Good day, and welcome to the Northern Trust Corporation First Quarter 2014 Earnings conference call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to the Director of Investor Relations, Bev Fleming, for opening remarks and introductions. Please go ahead. Beverly Fleming : Thank you, Paula. Good morning everyone and welcome to Northern Trust Corporation\u2019s First Quarter 2014 Earnings conference call. Joining me on our call this morning are Mike O\u2019Grady, Northern Trust\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, Jane Karpinski, our Controller, and Alison Quaintance from our Investor Relations team. For those of you who did not receive our first quarter earnings press release or financial trends reported via email this morning, they are both available on our website at northerntrust.com. In addition and also on our website, you will find our quarterly earnings review presentation, which we will use to guide today's conference call. This April 15 call is being webcast live on northerntrust.com. The only authorized rebroadcast of this call is the replay that will be available through May 14. Northern Trust disclaims any continuing accuracy of the information provided in this call after today. Now for our Safe Harbor statement. What we say during today's conference call may include forward-looking statements, which are Northern Trust's current estimates and expectations of future events or future results. Actual results, of course, could differ materially from those expressed or implied by these statements because the realization of those results is subject to many risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. I urge you to read our 2013 annual report and other reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission for detailed information about factors that could affect actual results. During today's question and answer session, please limit your initial query to one question and one related follow-up. This will allow us to move through the queue and allow as many people as possible the opportunity to ask questions as time permits. Thank you again for joining us today. Let me turn the call over to Mike O'Grady. Michael O\u2019Grady: Thank you, Bev. Good morning everyone and let me join Bev in welcoming you to Northern Trust\u2019s First Quarter 2014 Earnings conference call. As usual, I\u2019ll review our results for the quarter, after which Bev and I would be happy to answer your questions. Starting on Page 2, this morning we reported first quarter net income of $181 million and earnings per share of $0.75, which was up 12% over last year and 7% over last quarter. Our reported return on equity was 9.3% in the first quarter, better than last year\u2019s first and fourth quarters but below our target range of 10% to 15%. Let me draw your attention to three specific items which will help you evaluate our performance this quarter. First as noted in our press release this morning, net investment security losses were $4 million this quarter due to an other than temporary impairment of certain Community Reinvestment Act eligible securities. Impairment was taken on four CRA pools backed by residential mortgage loans. Second, our results in the first quarter of last year included a $12.4 million write-off of certain fee receivables recorded in other operating income and $1.8 million in restructuring and integration-related charges. Third, recall that our reported results in the fourth quarter of last year included a charge of $19 million in connection with an agreement to resolve certain longstanding class action litigation. Excluding these items across the relevant periods, earnings per share rose 7% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Environmental factors which impact our businesses and our clients were mixed in the first quarter, continuing trends which persisted in 2013. Equity markets were higher year-over-year in the U.S. and Europe with the S&P 500 up 19% and the EAFE Index up 14%. Bond markets, however, were down year-over-year as the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index was down almost 4%. (Audio gap) equity markets were mixed with the S&P 500 up 1% and the EAFE Index flat, while bond markets were up about 1% sequentially. Client assets under custody ended the quarter at $5.8 trillion, up 15% over last year, and assets under management ended at $915 billion, up 13%. On a sequential basis, client custody and managed assets were up 3%. Currency volatility, which influences foreign exchange trading income, was lower in the first quarter, having decreased each month in 2014 to multi-year lows. FX industry market volumes were lower versus last year but higher sequentially. Short-term interest rates remained at very low levels and continued to pressure our net interest margin and result in fee waivers on our money market mutual funds. Three months LIBOR averaged 24 basis points, down 6 basis points year-over-year and down 1 basis point sequentially. The Fed fund\u2019s effective rate at 7 basis points was half the level it was at the same time last year and down 1 basis point sequentially. Average overnight repo was 5 basis points in the quarter, down 10 basis points year-over-year and down 4 basis points sequentially. With those comments providing context on the environment, let\u2019s move to Page 3 and discuss the financial highlights of the first quarter. Starting with the year-over-year comparison, revenues were up 7% and expenses were up 5%. Revenue growth was the result of higher trust, investment and other servicing fees and net interest income. Expenses rose due to increases in compensation and benefits, outside services, and equipment and software. As a result, reported net income was 11% higher year-over-year. Excluding the specific items I mentioned previously, net income was 6% higher year-over-year. Compared to last quarter, revenues were essentially flat and expenses excluding the fourth quarter settlement charge were down 1%. Growth in trust, investment and other servicing fees was offset by lower net interest income and the other than temporary impairment item that I mentioned earlier. Expense management was led by lower outside services and other operating expense. As a result net income, excluding the specific items mentioned earlier, increased approximately 1% sequentially. Earnings per share was $0.75 and our return on equity was 9.3%. With that background and summary, let\u2019s get into more details behind our first quarter results. Turning to Page 4, first quarter revenues on a fully taxable equivalent basis were approximately $1.05 billion, up 7% year-over-year and flat sequentially. Trust, investment and other servicing fees, the largest component of revenues, were $679 million in the quarter, up 8% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Fees in our corporate and institutional services business increased 9% year-over-year and 2% sequentially while fees in our wealth management business grew 6% year-over-year and were down 2% sequentially. Higher equity markets and new business were both drivers of growth with higher money market mutual fund fee waivers offsetting. Fee waivers were approximately $33 million in the first quarter, an increase of $10 million over last year and $2 million sequentially. The higher waivers were primarily due to the gross yield of the funds declining by approximately 6 basis points on average from the prior year and 1 basis point sequentially due to lower overnight repo rates. I\u2019ll go into further detail on trust fees shortly. Foreign exchange trading income was $50 million in the first quarter, down 16% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. Currency volatility was lower in the first quarter, having decreased each month in 2014 to multi-year lows. Client trading volumes, however, were slightly higher year-over-year and were flat sequentially. Other non-interest income was $65 million in the first quarter, down 10% year-over-year when adjusting for last year\u2019s fee receivable write-off, and down 7% sequentially primarily reflecting the other than temporary impairment item. Net interest income, which I will also discuss in more detail later, was $254 million in the first quarter, up 9% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially. With that backdrop, let\u2019s look at the components of fee revenues on Page 5. For our corporate and institutional services business, fees totaled $379 million in the first quarter, up 9% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees, were $252 million in the first quarter, up 13% year-over-year and flat sequentially, while assets under custody for C&IS clients were $5.2 trillion at quarter-end, up 15% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Growth in fees and assets primarily reflects higher equity markets and new business. The sequential quarter comparison also reflects lower sub-custodian recoveries. Investment management fees in C&IS of $75 million in first quarter were down 1% year-over-year and flat sequentially. Assets under management for C&IS clients were $698 billion, up 16% year-over-year and 5% sequentially due to higher equity markets and higher cash and securities lending collateral levels, as well as the transfer of $7.6 billion in assets under management from wealth management to C&IS in the first quarter. The transferred assets represent defined contribution accounts and target date funds which emanate from our growing third party distribution and are more appropriately categorized as institutional assets. C&IS investment management fee growth was dampened on a year-over-year basis by higher waivers on institutional money market mutual funds. Waivers impacting C&IS fees equaled $15 million in the first quarter, $6 million higher year-over-year primarily reflecting the lower gross yield achieved in the underlying funds that I previously mentioned. Additionally, investment management fees in C&IS reflect the impact of a reduction in AUM from a central bank client which occurred in the fourth quarter. Since 2008, we had been managing approximately $7 billion for this client. Those assets moved out of our funds in the middle of the fourth quarter and therefore diminished fee growth in the first quarter. Securities lending fees were $23 million in the first quarter, up 2% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher volumes as securities lending collateral increased 15% year-over-year and 14% sequentially to $117 billion. Other fees in C&IS were $29 million in the first quarter, up 8% year-over-year and 27% sequentially, in both comparisons due to higher benefit payments and investment risk in analytical services. Moving to our wealth management business, trust, investment and other servicing fees were $300 million in the first quarter, up 6% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. Assets under management for wealth management clients were $217 billion at quarter-end, up 5% or $11 billion year-over-year and down 2% sequentially. As I mentioned earlier, in the first quarter we transferred $7.6 billion in assets under management from wealth management to C&IS, the major in equity assets. This reduced the growth rate in assets under management by 4 percentage points year-over-year and 3 points sequentially. In addition, cash balances within wealth management AUM were $5 billion lower year-over-year and flat versus year-end. The year-over-year increase in wealth management fees was primarily due to higher assets under management partially offset by higher wage fees in money market mutual funds and the impact of fee reductions in certain of our mutual funds. The sequential decline in wealth management fees was due to the reduction in assets under management as well as two fewer days in the quarter, higher money market fund fee waivers, and the impact of fee reductions in certain of our mutual funds. Fee waivers in wealth management totaled $17.6 million in the current quarter compared to $13.4 million in the first quarter of last year, and $16.2 million in the prior quarter. Moving to Page 6, net interest income was $254 million in the first quarter, up 9% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially. The year-over-year increase in net interest income was driven by a larger balance sheet as clients\u2019 interest-bearing deposits averaged $63 billion in the quarter, up approximately $7 billion or 12% year-over-year, and short-term borrowings and non-interest bearing demand deposits were each higher by approximately $1 billion. This higher level of funding compared with the year ago was primarily invested on the asset side in Federal Reserve deposits at 25 basis points. Partially offsetting the impact of a larger balance sheet was a lower net interest margin which at 1.12% in the first quarter was down 3 basis points year-over-year. In the sequential comparison, average earning assets and the net interest margin were both essentially flat. As a result, the 2% decline in net interest income reflects two fewer days in the first quarter when compared to the fourth quarter. The yield on the securities portfolio decreased 4 basis points sequentially, primarily reflecting smaller adjustments to premium amortization in our mortgage-backed securities portfolio due to changes in prepayment speed assumptions. Adjustments to premium amortization were less favorable in the first quarter at approximately $3 million, $7 million lower than the $10 million in the fourth quarter. The adjustments in the first quarter increased the net interest margin by approximately 1 basis point compared to 4 basis points in the fourth quarter. Offsetting the less favorable impact to the premium amortization adjustments to net interest income was a shift in the mix of earning assets from lower yielding interest-bearing deposits with banks and Federal Reserve deposits to higher yielding securities. Turning to Page 7, expenses were $768 million in the first quarter, up 5% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially. Similar to previous periods, expense growth is primarily driven by a combination of the costs and investments to supports the growth of the business and those required to meet more stringent risk management compliance and regulatory requirements, along with other expenses that can vary by quarter. Compensation expense increased 7% year-over-year, primarily reflecting staff growth and annual merit increases. Staff levels increased 5% year-over-year with about half of staff growth supporting the growth of global fund services in C&IS, a business which is experiencing above-average growth and in which we are investing for future growth across traditional hedge and other fund structures. The majority of the remainder of staff growth was in our operations and technology area, as well as in control functions. On a sequential basis, compensation expense increased 2% primarily driven by the accounting for annual equity-based awards. Recall that there is a requirement to immediately expense options granted to retirement-eligible employees. Staff growth was less than 1% sequentially. Employee benefit expense was 6% higher year-over-year and 1% higher sequentially as higher payroll tax expense more than offset lower pension expense. The year-over-year comparison also included higher expense associated with medical benefits. Outside services expenses increased 11% year-over-year and decreased 5% sequentially. Consulting, sub-custodian expense, and technical services expense were all higher year-over-year but lower in the sequential quarter comparison. Certain categories within outside services expense are seasonal or vary by quarter, and as you recall, consulting expense was higher in the second half of 2013 primarily related to regulatory initiatives. While we expect these trends to continue, they moderate in the first quarter of 2014. Equipment and software expense was higher by 11% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Spending on a variety of technology initiatives continues as we keep apace with supporting a variety of data and reporting needs for our clients and implement tools to enhance the efficiency of our partners while also managing a full docket in the regulatory and compliance arena. Occupancy expense was up 2% versus the prior year and 1% sequentially. Other operating expense decreased 14% year-over-year and decreased 13% sequentially when adjusted for the fourth quarter settlement charge. Both comparisons primarily reflect lower charges associated with accounts servicing activities, which can be uneven from quarter to quarter. The sequential quarter comparison also included seasonally higher business promotion and marketing costs associated with the Northern Trust Open. Turning to Page 8, we continue to be focused on enhancing productivity and efficiency in order to improve profitability and returns. This takes the form of specific initiatives such as those included as part of driving performance over the last two years, which produced quantifiable results; however, it is also achieved through a chance in the mindset of every Northern Trust employee to incorporate productivity into every aspect of our respective roles. Whether someone is in client servicing, portfolio management, product development, operations, technology, or one of the corporate functions, all of us have the opportunity to execute more efficiently. Deploying our capital productively is a component as well. The financial benefit created through greater productivity allows the company to simultaneously increase profitability and invest in future growth opportunities that we expect will produce targeted returns over time. Ultimately, our success in achieving our overall productivity goals can best be measured by our return on equity, and pre-tax margin is a significant contributor. We track both closely; however, given the impact macro-environmental factors can have on pre-tax margin, we also closely track the ratio of expenses to fees. Although by no means immune to external factors, we believe it\u2019s a useful metric to gauge our progress. As Page 8 demonstrates, in 2011 when our return on equity was 8.6%, our pre-tax margin was 24.2% and the expenses to fee ratio was 131%. Since then, we\u2019ve made progress in reducing the ratio to 115% last year and 113% in the first quarter. Capital, outlined on Page 9, remained very strong with common equity Tier 1 and Tier 1 capital ratios of 12.8% and 13% respectively. Based on our interpretation of the final Basel III rules released by the Federal Reserve, on a fully phased in basis our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the standardized approach would be approximately 11.1%, and under the advanced approach would be approximately 11.7%. Both of these ratios are well above the fully phased in requirement of 7%, which includes the capital conservation buffer. The supplementary leverage ratio is estimated to be approximately 5% at the holding company, which is above the requirement applicable to Northern Trust. As Northern Trust progresses through fully phased in Basel III implementation, there could be additional enhancements to our models and further guidance from the regulators on the implementation of the final rule, which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under final Basel III rules. As we announced in March, our 2014 capital plan received no objections from the Federal Reserve. In it, we requested authority to increase our quarterly common dividend to $0.33 per share. At its regular meeting later today, our board of directors will consider formal approval of the planned dividend increase which is expected to be payable July 1. In the first quarter, we repurchased 2.6 million shares at a cost of $163 million. In addition, our 2014 capital plan provides for the repurchase of up to $425 million of common stock between April 2014 and March 2015. In closing, the first quarter demonstrated continued progress on a number of fronts but with more work to do as we progress through 2014. With institutional clients, momentum was strong across regions. Announced wins in the quarter included Australia\u2019s Energy Industry\u2019s superannuation scheme and Canada\u2019s IWA Forest industry pension plan. Our hedge fund servicing business continues to manage through a period of rapid growth and client take-on as well. In addition, in early April we closed out the $55 million contingent purchase consideration related to our 2011 acquisition of Omnium from Citadel. In completing this about two years earlier than contemplated in the original purchase agreement, we solidified our relationship with this important client of our hedge fund servicing business. At the same time, we also expanded our partnership with Citadel\u2019s technology arm, which has become a key strategic partner of Northern Trust. With wealth management clients, new business was better than last quarter in all geographic regions and the global family office group, although it fell short of the prior year which was particularly strong due to uncertainties of the changing tax and investment environment. While our performance in wealth management this quarter was hampered by higher money market fund fee waivers and other factors, the business is well positioned both strategically and competitively. From a financial perspective, while we have improved our profitability across recent periods, we remain focused on achieving returns in our target range. Before I conclude and as is customary for our first quarter earnings call, we will need to end today\u2019s call to allow sufficient time for all of us to get to our annual meeting, which begins at 10 :30 Central time this morning. Please accept our apologies in the event that we have to close off the Q&A period earlier than our normal practice. Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust\u2019s first quarter earnings conference call today. Paula, please open the line for questions. Operator : (Operator instructions)  We\u2019ll take our first question from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin \u2013 Jefferies: Hi Mike and Bev, how are you? Good morning. Mike, can you give us a little more color on the custody business? Obviously there\u2019s great growth on a year-over-year basis and there\u2019s really good AUC growth sequentially, but the revenues were only up just slightly and I was wondering if you could detail whether some part of it might have been transaction activity or any other pushes and pulls that there might have been that would have withheld it from a better growth rate. Michael O\u2019Grady: So the custody business continues to grow well, and as you saw from the custody and fund administration fees is actually a nice quarter as far as growth, and that just reflects the continued strong new business that we talk about as it works its way through the fee line. I would say that as far as factors within the quarter, keep in mind that as strong as the equity markets may be, only about half of the assets under custody relate to equity so they don\u2019t\u2014they won\u2019t fully reflect that. So having a growth rate in fees that is similar to assets under custody is actually the positive impact of net new business. Ken Usdin \u2013 Jefferies: Okay, but was there something that either was strong in the fourth or that didn\u2019t come through in the first, because all that, given the growth that you\u2019re mentioning and the onboarding of new clients, the revenues were only up less than $1 million sequentially. So I\u2019m just thinking about from a prospective, is there something that either wasn\u2019t in there that might be going forward, or just something that maybe is lagging in terms of its revenue recognition? You had the good positive comp locked in from this quarter as well. Michael O\u2019Grady: Yeah, so on a sequential basis, all the trends that I mentioned there continue. However, Ken, one of the things that also runs through that line is sub-custodian recoveries. So where we\u2019re utilizing sub-custodians throughout the world, when we get certain charges we pass those charges along to our clients, given that we\u2019re the global custodian, and those can tend to vary, as we\u2019ve talked about, from quarter to quarter, and recoveries were higher in the fourth quarter of last year and lower in the first quarter of this year, which trimmed a little bit from the growth rate. Ken Usdin \u2013 Jefferies: Okay, got it. My second question \u2013 Mike, the outside services and the other expense lines were much better controlled on a year-over-year basis than they had been. To your point about seasonality, I just want to understand, how do we understand especially for those two lines which have been the biggest growth areas over time, you mentioned trends expected to continue but I want to just ask you what you mean by that. We can expect continued growth in outside services and in other, or are we now coming off of a peak-ish type of number that we saw in the fourth? Michael O\u2019Grady: So outside services includes a number of sub-categories within that, so that\u2019s everything from consulting fees to technical services, which we use the technical services often as part of onboarding new clients. That includes legal expenses in there as well, and just any other third party service that we\u2019re contracting for. That\u2019s why the trends can move around from quarter to quarter. What we\u2019ve seen, though, over the last several quarters, particularly I\u2019d say about the last two quarters, is that consulting has been a big driver for an increase in that category overall, and if you recall, the first and second quarters of last year, consulting was relatively low, whereas it picked up a fair amount in the third and fourth quarters as we addressed a number of the regulatory projects that we had underway. What we saw in the first quarter is that the consulting expenses were lower than the fourth quarter, and I think you can expect that in the sense that there were a number of initiatives that we needed to complete by the end of last year, and yet we\u2019re higher than we were a year ago and that\u2019s just because the list of regulatory projects that we\u2019re working on still remains relatively long. The mix has changed, so many of the things that we were working on last year are different this year, so last year a number of the projects included things like the resolution plan and certainly more of a focus on CCAR, whereas in 2014 we\u2019re spending more time and resources on such initiatives as AIFMD, which has ramped up somewhat in the fourth quarter but also in the first quarter. Ken Usdin \u2013 Jefferies: Okay. So\u2014okay, I get it. So maybe we\u2019re at this new level, but not necessarily going back to where we were, and it just depends on the progression of this mix shift that you\u2019re alluding to. Michael O\u2019Grady: It definitely depends on all of those categories and what that mix is. The other thing I would say about the consulting line and just regulatory costs in general is that at this point in time, we don\u2019t necessarily know what all of the requirements and projects will be between now and the end of the year, so it\u2019s really difficult to be able to know exactly what those costs will be. Ken Usdin \u2013 Jefferies: Okay, I understand. Thanks, Mike. Operator : Moving on, we\u2019ll go to Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS: Good morning. So question on the AUM- it sounds like ex-noise in your C&IS and wealth management, I get to maybe roughly a 2% C&IS sequential growth rate and then just slightly positive in wealth management. Is that right? I was trying to note down all the noise you were walking through there, Mike. Michael O\u2019Grady: Yes, sequential, I think if you take into account the transfer that we talked about, on C&IS you would be closer to 4% and on wealth management you\u2019d be closer to 1%. Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS: Okay, and it also looked like the asset management fee rate in C&IS took a bit of a hit, so can we talk about whether or not this noise, was it the timing of some of these re-classes that might have had an impact there, or did these changes happen in the beginning of the quarter and therefore is this the new run rate that we should think about for the asset management business in C&IS? Michael O\u2019Grady: So as you point out, the fee rate is still shy of that, and there are a number of factors that contributed to it. One is just slightly higher money market fee waivers. Two is that at the beginning of the quarter, we did re-price some of our mutual funds in the multi-manager space. That was as of January 1, so that\u2019s in the run rate, if you will, now. Then also, the day count in the first quarter does impact the fees that are generated from the mutual funds, and then there\u2019s a slight mix change which we\u2019ve been talking about over time, which is even as clients take on more equity exposure, they\u2019re doing it more through passive product as opposed to active products, which have different fee levels. So those are really the factors that are driving the difference between AUM growth and fee growth. Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS: That\u2019s helpful, thanks. And then the other question here, maybe could you give some color on demographics of your wealth management business and how that compares today versus maybe five or so years ago? Have we seen a meaningful change there at this point? Michael O\u2019Grady: Well, I can\u2019t quote specific statistics for you based on demographics, but I can tell you that we clearly have evolved our strategy with regard to the target market that we\u2019re focused on, and so certainly the expectation is that the demographics are slanting more and more up market. So even putting aside the global family office business which deals with the largest families and wealth, the wealth business overall in all of the regions has also turned its focus to the level above $20 million of liquid net worth. Importantly, it\u2019s not just approaching more clients within that target range; it\u2019s also trying to provide the types of services that are particularly of interest to that target market, so whether that\u2019s from a banking perspective, a fiduciary needs perspective, or also just their approach to their investments, it is more up market-focused. So as a result, just the new wins and the clients that we\u2019re bringing on fit that demographic more than they do what I would consider a much broader wealth or high net worth demographic five years ago. Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS: Okay, thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Moving on, we\u2019ll go to Marty Mosby with Guggenheim. Marty Mosby \u2013 Guggenheim: Good morning, Mike. I was going to ask a technical question about the share repurchase. The $163 million was about over 2.5 million shares, but when you look at the outstanding shares in the report, they\u2019re only down about 800,000, so I was curious what the difference was between that. Michael O\u2019Grady: Yeah, the difference is just that in any time period, there are exercises of employee-related shares and options, and so that can offset some of the shares that we repurchase; and that\u2019s the case in the fourth quarter as well. Marty Mosby \u2013 Guggenheim: But that was stronger than what you would typically have probably seen\u2014we\u2019ve seen in past quarters. Michael O\u2019Grady: Yes, and part of that, Marty, is it is going to be related to the level of the stock price, so options that were granted a number of years ago were out of the money for some time period. In the fourth quarter with the stock price being higher, that provides a greater incentive for employees to exercise the options. It also just depends on the remaining time that\u2019s in the options as well, and certainly as options get closer to expiration, which will happen towards the end of the year, then the employees tend to exercise those options before they expire. Marty Mosby \u2013 Guggenheim: And then lastly, the shift from the shorter term money with banks and the Fed into the treasury portfolio, what kind of duration are you buying into? What\u2019s your thought process there at this point? Michael O\u2019Grady: So our duration on the securities portfolio was very stable with where we were in the fourth quarter, so right now, as I\u2019ve mentioned previously in the fourth quarter, we were at about 14 months as far as the duration for that portfolio and we\u2019re still in that range. We did increase the size of the securities portfolio during the quarter just because we\u2019ve seen increased custody deposits and stability in those deposits, and I would say at this point that obviously like everyone else, we\u2019re looking at interest rates and what the expectations might be, but our position is relatively stable as opposed to one where we\u2019re necessarily looking to either increase or decrease the duration on that portfolio. Marty Mosby \u2013 Guggenheim: Got you, so just a shift between the shorter term and then the securities, given what you\u2019re looking at as more long-term funding out of the deposit base? Michael O\u2019Grady: Exactly. Marty Mosby \u2013 Guggenheim: Thanks. All right, thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll go to our next questioner, and that will be Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse. Ashley Serrao \u2013 Credit Suisse : Good morning, Mike. First, a question on regulation. As we come towards the end of the SLR rule-making process, do you believe that the rule as it stands today will impact business decisions in any meaningful way? And then an update on how you\u2019re thinking about other regulation, especially in Europe \u2013 I know you addressed the expense angle with AIFMD, but maybe some thoughts on revenue opportunities as well. Michael O\u2019Grady: Sure. So with regard to the supplementary leverage ratio, I do believe that that will have an impact on business decisions, not necessarily because it has such a great impact on Northern Trust but I think that it will impact the market. And the areas where I would expect to see impact would be certainly just with the size of the balance sheet being very relevant and having higher levels for the largest banks, just being able to take on deposits, for example, as a different capital implication than it previously did. So I think that will affect the market overall and certainly will affect the way we think about client deposits and what the appropriate pricing is for that deposit. At this point, the supplementary leverage ratio does not present limitations to us, so it hasn\u2019t caused us to do anything that we wouldn\u2019t have previously done; but I think that that will evolve, as I mentioned, with the market over time. And then a second area that I think it could potentially have an impact is on what I\u2019ll consider off-balance sheet commitments, whether that\u2019s line of credit or just credit facilities to corporations; and again, given the fact that those are included in the denominator of that ratio, I think that it could have an impact not only on the extension of credit to corporations but also the pricing of that credit, and certainly that\u2019s something that, again, we look at very closely because that is a way in which we\u2019re deploying our capital for our clients. And then I think the other question, Ashley, was with regard to regulation more broadly, things like AIFMD. I would say that we, like others, are investing in that area to make sure that we\u2019re in a position to provide those services to our clients. So far, that\u2019s gone very well as far as the implementation of what we think the required needs are. What is being required being a depository in that marketplace is very similar to services that we\u2019ve provided for clients for a long time period, both in the U.S. but also in Europe for USDs (ph), so this is really an expansion of that and it is just requiring an expansion of our capabilities to serve the clients. But overall, we think that that\u2019s actually something that will be a positive because it\u2019s more that we can do for our clients and also a service that they\u2019ll value and will also pay for. Ashley Serrao \u2013 Credit Suisse : Great, thanks for all the color there. My quick follow-up is on other expenses. Typically you would expect 2Q to be a bit lower, given the non-trust expenses roll off. Should we be expecting the same magnitude of a drop that we\u2019ve seen historically given the lower than usual account services expenses this quarter? Thanks. Michael O\u2019Grady: As you pointed out, we had a particularly good quarter, I would say, with regard to the charges associated with operating activities, and that\u2019s something that is impossible to predict. Certainly our objective is to minimize those, but it\u2019s not something that we have visibility into. But as I mentioned, it was very good in the first quarter, so hard to determine whether we\u2019ll be able to repeat that. That category includes, as you know, a number of other items as well and that\u2019s why it\u2019s a broad other category, which when you look over time there\u2019s more variability to that category. So there\u2019s no particular increase or decrease that we necessarily would expect. Ashley Serrao \u2013 Credit Suisse : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Moving on, we\u2019ll go to Luke Montgomery with Sanford Bernstein. Luke Montgomery \u2013 Sanford Bernstein : Morning guys. Just a quick one on CCAR. Now that you\u2019ve been through the process, just any lessons you\u2019ve learned, things that maybe you would do differently or could have done differently for next time. And then also along with that, perhaps you could comment on whether the uncertainty going into this time, maybe more conservative on your capital return request than you might have otherwise been. Michael O\u2019Grady: Sure. So CCAR, as we talked about a lot last year, we needed to make a number of changes and enhancements to our process relative to the CapPR process and feel that we were successful in implementing those and we\u2019re certainly pleased with the outcome. Having said that, we still have more work to do on that front. As has been much talked about, there\u2019s the quantitative aspect of it, which we think that we perform well, but then there\u2019s also the qualitative aspect, and in those areas we continue to improve the modeling that we do. We continue to improve the way in which we communicate our plan to the regulators. We definitely involve a broader group of people within the company, whether that\u2019s different parts of business management as we develop stress scenarios but also the engagement of our board, so it\u2019s a very comprehensive, as it\u2019s titled, process and I think that we learn the importance of making those investments to be able to meet with the regulatory expectations, but we also understand that those expectations continue to move up. So we have plans in place, even though we have not received specific feedback with regard to our plan at this point, and we\u2019ll get that later in the month. That hasn\u2019t held us back from continuing to improve on our processes. As far as the second part of your question, Luke, it\u2019s clearly too early in our minds to think about what our capital action request will be. Again, we haven\u2019t even either sat down with the Fed to get a detailed set of points for feedback, nor have we received a letter, so just very, very early in the process. Luke Montgomery \u2013 Sanford Bernstein : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then perhaps just a quick update on Bridgewater \u2013 I think that\u2019s still coming on next quarter, right? So maybe a reminder about how we should be modeling the revenue impacts since the assets won\u2019t be in assets under custody, and then a general sense of any trend toward shadow servicing deals in general \u2013 do you think there will be more opportunity there? How difficult has this deal been to onboard, and has it changed your appetite to bid for those in the future? Michael O\u2019Grady: So I\u2019ll actually start with one of your last points there, which is just the complexity of onboarding a situation like this. It has gone well, albeit coordinating between the client and another provider is complicated, so at this point our expectation is that we will go live on that in the third quarter. To your point, when that happens, those will be assets under administration and then we\u2019ll begin to recognize the revenue and expenses related to that as well. At this point, I would say that there is more discussion than activity with regard to shadow administrators. We think it\u2019s something that will be applicable in the marketplace going forward, albeit it for a select set of large institutions or hedge funds like Bridgewater. So we definitely think it\u2019s a positive. We\u2019re clearly pleased with that opportunity, and so we continue to look for more opportunities like that. Luke Montgomery \u2013 Sanford Bernstein : Okay, thanks a lot. Operator : We\u2019ll move to our next caller, and that will be Cynthia Mayer with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Cynthia Mayer \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, thanks a lot. Maybe just circling back to the fee reductions on multi-manager mutual funds, can you give us a sense of how many assets and funds that involves and some of the thinking behind that? Also, I think you had mentioned\u2014previously mentioned maybe last quarter that you were reversing discounted fees in wealth management, so wouldn\u2019t that offset some of that? Michael O\u2019Grady: So the first part, Cynthia, this related to three multi-manager funds which had AUM of approximately $4 billion related to that, and the rationale for the change in pricing was to just ensure that those products continued to be priced competitively within the marketplace. As you would expect, we constantly are monitoring pricing and the costs of our funds, and from time to time feel it\u2019s appropriate to look at reducing the fees on the fund. So that\u2019s what it related to. As far as the discounts, the discount is what I would consider kind of an ongoing initiative. We did not necessarily reduce discounts, for example, across the board in the first quarter. It\u2019s something where right now, it\u2019s happening more on what I would consider kind of an account-by-account basis where if we determine that the level of work and value that\u2019s being delivered is not aligned with the discount, then that\u2019s an opportunity. But we didn\u2019t really see any benefit, significant benefit from that in the first quarter that would offset the change in pricing. Cynthia Mayer \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, great. I apologize if you mentioned this, but how is your pipeline looking for C&IS? Michael O\u2019Grady: Pipeline continues to look very good. I would say that the level of market activity is good, so there are many opportunities which we are currently either in dialogue in or that we\u2019re actually in the RFP process for those, so that\u2019s really a positive. We\u2019ve been very pleased with our win rate on that front as well, so on the institutional side, I would say very good. As I mentioned on the wealth management side, if you go back a year ago, we were really coming off a time period where it was very high level of activity and new business in the wealth management business, and then it tailed off through the end of the year. Coming into 2014, it\u2019s improved off of where it was at the end of the year but it\u2019s still not at the very high levels that we saw a year ago. Overall, though, I would say that if you think about the risk appetite for our client base and if you were to talk to some of the investment professionals for us, like various people within asset management or within the wealth management business, I think what they would tell you is that the beginning of this year, there was a fair amount of uncertainty in the marketplace which caused a little bit of a pause in activity, whether that\u2019s some of the geopolitical activities or just the volatility in the equity markets. So we didn\u2019t see a pullback necessarily but we didn\u2019t see as much advancing on that front. Cynthia Mayer \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you so much. Operator : Moving on, we\u2019ll go to Glenn Schorr with ISI. Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI: Thanks very much. I guess I\u2019m trying to tie together all of the pieces of the puzzle for investment management because we heard about a transfer, some price cuts, and then some internal transfer stuff. If I look at assets versus fee growth over, let\u2019s say, the last five years instead of worrying about the last quarter or year, fees grow less than assets, but that\u2019s a function of active to passive which you should be capturing. So I guess I\u2019m looking for any kind of summary comment of how the asset management business is doing in your mind, the passive as it should be well positioned, especially with your client base, but it\u2019s hard to see with a lot of the different moving parts \u2013 sorry. Michael O\u2019Grady: Sure, I think it\u2019s certainly a fair question, and over time\u2014over a longer time period, as you suggested, assets under management have certainly grown at a nice growth rate for us, which is a result of, as we\u2019ve talked about, a strong equity market environment but also new business. On the fee side of the equation, we\u2019ve had the negative impact of the fee waivers which right now, we\u2019re at basically the highest run rate level that we\u2019ve seen. It did go down if you went back a year ago, obviously, and some quarters before that, but it\u2019s gone back up to a higher level now just because the very shortest end of the curve is very low, and that\u2019s where a lot of the funds within those funds are invested. So that\u2019s been a drag on the growth rate, and I would agree that we certainly have benefited because of the move from active to passive, so you\u2019ve seen that in the asset growth, and a category that is growing the fastest within that is the equity index business, and that\u2019s a combination of both the equity markets again going to a high rate, but also that\u2019s a particular area where we\u2019ve had success with inflows. The other part of that, however, is that the index business comes at a lower fee rate than our average fee rate, and certainly lower than active equity, so it does bring down the revenue yield, if you will, on the assets under management. I think those are the longer term trends. I think that within wealth management, you did see through 2012 and 2013 the benefit of fee simplification, which was a lift to that yield on the assets under management. As I mentioned before, at this point it\u2019s been two years since we did have an overall increase in those fees, but you\u2019ve seen that now the growth or the positive benefit of that trail off. As I mentioned, we look at incrementally addressing discounts on the accounts, but we have not looked at actually increasing fees. Finally, I would just say, again, benefiting from some of those trends but also part of the trends more broadly are just fees on investment product overall, so it\u2019s very important for us to make sure that we\u2019re offering products at competitive fees and so that\u2019s resulted in some of the activity this past quarter, but if you went back, there\u2019s been other quarters where we also have reduced the fees on some of our investment product. Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI: Got it, and maybe I\u2019ll do one quick, short one on expenses as well. Again, you went through a bunch of moving parts, but the results are actually pretty good both sequentially and year-on-year in terms of positive operating leverage. Do you sense a turning of the corner, and I know that\u2019s market dependent, I know it\u2019s rate dependent, but things look like in the most control you\u2019ve had in a little while. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m reading too much into things, but just curious to get your thoughts. Michael O\u2019Grady: Yeah. I definitely am not in a position to be able to comment on whether we\u2019ve turned a corner. I would just say that 2012, 2013, we were very focused on driving performance, which was primarily initiative-based, as I talked about. We continue to have a number of initiatives on that front, but more importantly I would say some of the things that were more initiatives before, Glenn, now are part of just business as usual. What I mean by that is going back two years ago, we looked at some of our procurement categories and said, how can we reduce our expenses here? What are some areas that essentially we can attack as a project to reduce those, and we were successful in that; whereas now, that\u2019s become just part of normal practice is looking at our expenses in procurement from a strategic standpoint and making sure that every negotiation that we do on a large vendor contract goes through the same rigor. So in some ways, we\u2019re getting continued benefit just on an ongoing basis, so I\u2019d like to think if there\u2019s a corner that we\u2019ve turned, the corner that we\u2019ve turned is just in the mentality of how we approach efficiency and productivity, but not necessarily anything that enables us to say that the expense trajectory, by definition, will change. Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI: Okay, I appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Moving on, we\u2019ll go to Mike Mayo with CLSA. Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA: Hi. Could you just elaborate more on the sub-custodian fees fourth quarter to first quarter, maybe a dollar amount or who are you dealing with, if you can disclose that, and how are those relationships? Michael O\u2019Grady: Yes, so we deal with sub-custodians all over the globe, and it\u2019s particularly in areas where we are not inclined to actually be a primary custodian, so that\u2019s the nature of it. We\u2019re the global custodian, and then we have the sub-custodian networks. With regard to the costs, there are certain of those costs which are absorbed but there are certain which per agreements with our clients get passed on. With that network, the timing in which we receive the cost is not always as smooth and predictable as we would like, so I can\u2019t obviously comment on specific names of the sub-custodians that result in the higher levels, but I can tell you, for example, that there are certain just geographies that in the quarter ended up being higher than what we expected, so as a result we had less that we recovered in the fourth quarter. But I would say, Mike, that\u2019s a line that just over time, quarter to quarter, moves up and moves down, but the longer term trend I would say is one where if anything, we\u2019re picking up efficiencies in the cost of our sub-custodian network. Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA: Okay. Separately, your earning assets grew 12% this quarter, 11% last quarter, but before that it was kind of flat or down the prior few quarters. So is anything changing with the balance sheet? Michael O\u2019Grady: Yeah, there is no question that some of our larger custodian clients are placing more deposits with us, some just with the growth in the business but I would also tell you that some of these deposits are large, chunky deposits which even within that, I wouldn\u2019t characterize them as all being the same. As you would expect, we follow them very closely and when I say not the same, I would say some of them, for example, are money managers who at this point in time just have excess cash and placing it at the bank in a deposit is preferable for them at this point in time. As you would expect, if they have a different view on the market going forward, they may deploy more, and we\u2019ve seen that in the past with different clients. But it is just a higher level of deposits with our custodian clients at this point that\u2019s driving the increase in the balance sheet. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily, Mike, look from quarter to quarter again to expect that it is going to necessarily go up or go down. It\u2019s just a longer term trend. It goes in fits and starts a little bit, but as long as we continue to expand the business, we certainly expect that the deposits will also expand. Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA: Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Robert Lee with KBW. Robert Lee \u2013 KBW: Thanks, good morning. I\u2019d like to go back to the SLR for just a quick question. You mentioned you\u2019re 5% of the holding company. Can you just conceptually\u2014you know, if you guys have gotten this far, how should we be thinking about where you\u2019d like to run your SLR? What kind of cushion you\u2019re thinking that would be appropriate for Northern? Would it be running it at 5, 5.25, 5.5, and then maybe if you could kind of update us where you are kind of the bank level? Michael O\u2019Grady: Sure. So as far as\u2014let me take the second part first, which is with regard to the bank level. The bank level is approximately in the same neighborhood that the holding company is as well. As you know, you can affect the level of capitalization at the bank differently than the holdco to the extent that you downstream from the holdco into the bank. But at this point, we\u2019re comfortable with the level of capitalization at both the bank level and the holding company level, and I would say as far as where we\u2019re targeting the SLR, I would say similar to our other ratios. We look at all of them collectively and just over time determine what is the level that we feel we need, first from an internal perspective, second from a regulatory perspective, and that\u2019s an area that particularly with the SLR right now, I would say we have a fair amount of room given that the requirement for Northern Trust is at 3%, and as we pointed out we\u2019re above 5% there. So there is room there on the regulatory front, but then the third category we talked about or consideration is just the level of our peers as well, which a number of our peers will be held to the higher level of 5%. So that\u2019s definitely a consideration as we look at it. We have the ability to be below that 5%, so I think in some ways that gives us more flexibility, but I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say that it allows us to not have to consider it. We definitely have to take it into our consideration. Robert Lee \u2013 KBW: Okay, great. That was helpful. Maybe shifting back to the asset management business, I\u2019m curious if you could update us\u2014I guess maybe it was 18 months or two years ago, I forget precisely, you had kind of re-launched your ETF initiative. I believe you have at least several billion of assets there now. Could you maybe update us on that on how that business is going, maybe kind of what extent you see that contributing to some of the organic growth there, and just kind of really just update us on where that stands. Michael O\u2019Grady: Sure, be glad to. Our ETF business, as you mentioned, is FlexShares, and as of the end of the quarter the assets under management in FlexShares was $7.6 billion, so it\u2019s been very successful for us given that it was a re-launch, but it was a re-launch from a standing start and it\u2019s been an effort where we are focused on not necessarily competing in what I would consider the more commodity or general ETFs, but rather ETFs that we think are structured in a way that they are particularly appealing for our clients. It\u2019s important for us because as we talk about the trends within the asset management industry and talk about things like going from active to passive, we want to be in a position where we\u2019re able to provide the right products for our clients, so part of these trends have resulted in the ETFs going above the $7 billion, as I talked about. It\u2019s something that we certainly like the strategy there. We\u2019ve rolled out a number of new funds which, at this point, are low levels of AUM but certainly that we have high expectations for. Robert Lee \u2013 KBW: Maybe just one follow-up question, if I could, on the ETF business. Are you sourcing most of those assets maybe through your private client business to the extent you\u2019re including them in your asset allocation or model portfolios or whatnot, or are you seeing more of those assets come in through a third party source? Michael O\u2019Grady: Yeah, it\u2019s a combination of both, so as I mentioned, part of it is we do structure these products so that they are appropriate and useful for our existing wealth management clients, but we also have a very focused third party effort here to distribute those funds directly to new clients of Northern Trust where the only product they may have, for example Robert, would be the ETF. So at this point, most of the AUM has come from our wealth management business, but the expectation is that we\u2019ll continue to grow the business both from that source but then also directly with new clients. Robert Lee \u2013 KBW: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Next we\u2019ll go to Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC: Thank you, good morning. Mike, you guys have the ROE target of 10 to 15% for Northern Trust, and as you pointed out earlier, you\u2019ve had some very strong growth in assets under custody as well as the global custody assets, and this quarter as well assets under management were quite strong. Is it\u2014and your ROE, unfortunately when you back the last five years with the exception, I think, of \u201909 has been consistently under 10%, below your range. Is it simply a matter of interest rates, because I know you have the fee market waivers as a drag on earnings, so it is really we\u2019re waiting for interest rates to rise for you to get into that 12, 13% ROE consistently? Michael O\u2019Grady: Yeah, I would say that we are not waiting on interest rates to rise. They may rise, they may not rise, and at this point as to when they\u2019ll rise, we wouldn\u2019t know even if you told me it was certain that they\u2019re going to rise. So our focus has been on improving the profitability absent that. Certainly, the low interest rates have presented the drag they have, but part of the reason why we have the slide there that points out the expenses to trust fees ratio is because although, again, that\u2019s not completely immune from external factors so the money market fee waivers does impact that ratio, because it lowers the fees. But it is a way that we think we can control the profitability more, and that\u2019s why we are focused on trying to bring that ratio down to make the core fee business more profitable for us. Over the last nine quarters, we\u2019ve been successful looking year-over-year in bringing that ratio down to 113% now from 131% going back to 2011. So to get into the target range of 10 to 15%, we need to continue to focus on bringing that down absent what may happen in the environment. Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC: Where would that ratio have to go to get you, because I\u2019m looking at your trends package here and it\u2019s just been so challenging for you folks and your peers \u2013 it\u2019s not just Northern Trust. Does that expense to fee number have to break 100% to get you over the 10% into 12% ROE territory? Michael O\u2019Grady: Yeah, as you mention, there\u2019s lots of other factors related to it, so there\u2019s not a specific number I would give you. But at the same time, I would say we do not necessarily need to reach a particular point \u2013 you mentioned 100% or to go below that \u2013 in order to get into our range. Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC: Okay, and then the second question is on your stock buyback this year that you were approved for. Are you expecting to spread that out over a 12-month period, or is it going to be more front-end loaded, back-end loaded? And then the second part of that \u2013 what do you see for your incentive comp for this coming year for your employees? How much stock will you be distributing to eligible employees? Michael O\u2019Grady: I\u2019ll take your second question first just with regard to incentive comp and the composition there. As you would expect, that is ultimately determined by the compensation committee of the board of directors, and they finished up the past year but they are early stages of how they would look at this year, going into it, and ultimately I don\u2019t know what their thinking is on that front. But clearly they are trying to provide the right mix to reward employees for the right type of activity and performance, and there\u2019s nothing that really changed significantly in the past year with regard to the mix there other than, I would say, making it more performance-oriented and making sure that it\u2019s aligned with our corporate targets. As far as the share repurchase, as we\u2019ve talked about before, there are a number of factors that go into determining the amount of stock that we\u2019ll repurchase in a particular quarter, and we do not have a particular strategy that we\u2019re going to communicate with regard to whether it\u2019s even or front or back-loaded, just given the fact that there are a number of factors that go into it. Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC: Thank you. Operator : Our final question will come from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Geoffrey Elliott \u2013 Autonomous Research : Hello. In terms of the shift from assets from active to passive business, particularly on the wealth management side, what can you do to ensure that as clients\u2019 risk appetite returns, that still (audio interference). Michael O\u2019Grady: Geoffrey, I think I missed the last part of the question. Geoffrey? Operator : Just one moment. I\u2019m sorry, please continue, Mr. Elliott. Geoffrey Elliott \u2013 Autonomous Research : Hello. So the share of equities in wealth management AUM has been increasing pretty significantly, but I guess because of the shift from active to passive products, that hasn\u2019t really been benefiting the fee rate, so what can you do to ensure that you benefit as clients\u2019 risk appetite returns? Michael O\u2019Grady: So we clearly benefit to the extent that our clients benefit, and so our objective is to provide the best wealth management services and expertise to them, and we feel that as it has been true historically, we\u2019ll benefit along with them to the extent that they do well. As far as the trends, though, we also try to position ourselves well for the trends, and with the shift from active to passive, we actually think we\u2019re well positioned in the sense that we capture a large portion of the assets as they shift them around, given that we\u2019re well positioned in passive, but then further, very specifically the ETFs were directed at ensuring that we have products that meet those needs as well. So we will continue to do things like the ETFs where it\u2019s in product development in our asset management group. They\u2019re very focused on what are products that our clients will find useful as we go forward so that we can not only make sure that they are successful but that, as I mentioned, we can financially share in that success. Operator : Was there anything further, Mr. Elliott? Geoffrey Elliott \u2013 Autonomous Research : Hello, can you hear me? Michael O\u2019Grady: Yes. Geoffrey Elliott \u2013 Autonomous Research : On the last call, you mentioned that you expected to get back into the 10 to 15% ROE target range this year. Do you still expect to do that after reporting the 9.3% for the first quarter? Michael O\u2019Grady: The 10 to 15% range is our target range, and clearly the objective for not only me but for the company and management and all the employees is to be in our target range, so that is definitely what we continue to endeavor to do. Geoffrey Elliott \u2013 Autonomous Research : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : I\u2019ll turn it back to our presenters for any closing remarks. Beverly Fleming : Thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to updating you on our second quarter performance in July. Have a good day. Operator : That does conclude today\u2019s conference. We\u2019d like to thank everyone for their participation.",

Let me turn the call over to Michael O'Grady. Michael O'Grady: Good morning, everyone. And let me join Bev and welcome you to Northern Trust second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. As usual, I will review our result for the quarter, after which Bev and I would be happy to answer your question. Starting on page two. This morning we reported second quarter net income of $182 million and earnings per share of $0.75. Our reported return on equity was 9.2% in the quarter. As outlined in our earnings press release issued this morning, we remain focused on sustainably improving our financial performance and return. To that end, we recorded charges and write-offs in the second quarter of $42 million. Excluding these items, our earnings per share would have been $0.87 and our return on equity would have been 10.6%. I will discuss the charges in more detail later in today\u2019s call. Environmental factors which impact our businesses and our clients were mix in the second quarter, a theme which has been ongoing for some time. Equity and bond markets were higher at the end of the second quarter both year-over-year and sequentially. In the U.S., the S&P 500 was up 22% and 5% versus last year and last quarter, respectively. International equity as measured by the EAFE Index were up 15% and 2%, respectively. With market trending up as the quarter progressed, average daily market were also higher, although lag the end of period comparison by about 4 percentage points year-over-year and 1 percentage point, sequentially. In bond market, the Barclays US Aggregate Bond Index was up 1% both year-over-year and sequential. Client assets under custody ended the quarter at $6 trillion, up 20% over last year and assets under management ended at $924 billion, up 15%. On a sequential basis, client custody and managed assets were up 4% and 1%, respectively. Currency market had multiple impacts this quarter. Currency volatility, which influences foreign exchange trading income was lower in the second quarter, having decreased each month in 2014 to multiyear lows and is even lower in July. Currency rate which influence the translation of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar increased revenue and expense by about 1 percentage point each due in particular to the strengthening of the British pound during the second quarter. Short-term interest rate remained at very low levels and continued to pressure our net interest margin and result in fee waivers on our money market mutual fund. Three months LIBOR averaged 23 basis points, down 5 basis points year-over-year and down 1 basis point sequentially. The Fed fund effective rate at 9 basis points was down 3 basis points year-over-year but up 2 basis points sequentially. Average overnight repo was 8 basis points in the second quarter, down 3 basis points year-over-year but up 3 basis points sequentially. With those comments providing context on the environment, let\u2019s move to page three and discuss the financial highlights for the second quarter. Starting with the year-over-year comparison, revenues were up 6% and expenses were up 11%. Revenue growth was the result of higher trust investment and other servicing fees and net interest income. Expense growth reflects the $42 million in charges and write-offs. Excluding those items, expenses rose 5% due to increases in compensation and benefit, outside services and equipment and software. We had no loan loss provision in the quarter as credit quality continued to improve. Reported net income was 5% lower year-over-year. Excluding the charges and write-offs, net income was 10% higher year-over-year. Compared to last quarter revenues were up 4%, primarily driven by higher trust, investment and other servicing fee. Expenses excluding the charges and write-offs were essentially flat sequentially as higher compensation and equipment and software expenses were offset by lower business promotion and occupancy expense. Reported net income was essentially flat from the prior quarter, adjusted for the charges and write-offs, net income increased 16%, sequentially. Earning per share was $0.75 and our return on equity was 9.2%. Adjusted for the charges and write-offs earnings per share was $0.87 and our return on equity was 10.6%. Let\u2019s look at the results in greater detail, starting with revenue on page four. Second quarter revenues on a fully taxable equivalent basis were approximately $1.1 billion, up 6% year-over-year and 4%, sequentially. Trust, investment and other servicing fees, the largest component of revenues were $707 million in the quarter, up 8% year-over-year and 4%, sequentially. Fees in our corporate and institutional services business increased 9% year-over-year and 4%, sequentially, while fees in our wealth management business grew 6% year-over-year and 4%, sequentially. Higher equity markets and new business were both drivers of growth, with higher money market mutual fund fee waivers, partially offsetting in the year-over-year comparison. Fee waivers were approximately $31 million in the second quarter, an increase of $8 million over last year but $2 million lower sequentially. The higher waivers on a year-over-year basis were primarily due to the gross yield of the funds declining by approximately 5 basis points on average from the prior year. On a sequential quarter basis, yields increased 1 basis point. Overnight repo rates, a key driver of money market mutual fund yields were down 3 basis points year-over-year and up 3 basis points, sequentially. I\u2019ll go in a further detail on trust fees shortly. Foreign exchange trading income was $53 million in the second quarter, down 26% year-over-year, but up 5% sequentially. Currency volatility was lower in the second quarter, having decreased each month in 2014 to multiyear lows, client trading volume were lower year-over-year, yet higher sequentially. Other non-interest income was $75 million in the second quarter, up 5% year-over-year and up 15% sequentially, primarily reflecting gains from currency related hedging activity. The sequential quarter increase was also due to higher security commissions and trading income, and then other than temporary impairment item booked in the first quarter. Net interest income, which I will also discuss in more detail later was $253 million in the second quarter, up 11% year-over-year and down slightly sequentially. With that backdrop, let\u2019s look at the components of fee revenues on page 5. For our corporate and institutional services business, fees totaled $395 million in the first quarter, up 9% year-over-year and 4%, sequentially. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees were $261 million in the second quarter, up 11% year-over-year and up 4%, sequentially, while assets under custody for C&IS clients were $5.5 trillion at quarter end, up 21% year-over-year and 5%, sequentially. Growth in fees and assets primarily reflect favorable market condition, including higher equity and bond market, and favorable movements in foreign currency rate, as well as new business. Fees were also impacted in the sequential quarter comparison by higher sub-custodian recoveries. Investment management fees in C&IS of $78 million in the second quarter were up 5% year-over-year and up 4%, sequentially. Assets under management for C&IS client were $702 billion, up 17% year-over-year and up slightly sequentially. The year-over-year increase in C&IS assets under management was due to higher equity and fixed income market and new business, as well as higher securities lending collateral. In the sequential quarter comparison, higher equity and fixed income market was partially offset by lower cash balances. C&IS investment management fee growth was dampen on a year-over-year basis by higher waivers on institutional money market mutual fund. Waivers impacting C&IS fees equals $59 in the second quarter, $5 million higher year-over-year, primarily reflecting the lower gross yield achieved in the underlying funds that I previously mentioned. Securities lending fees were $30 million in the second quarter, down 4% year-over-year and up 32%, sequentially. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflect lower spread, while the sequential quarter increase reflect the traditional second quarter impact of the international dividend season, which resulted in wider spread. Other fees in C&IS were $27 million in the second quarter, up 7% year-over-year and down 9% sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects the new business in investment risk and analytical services. The sequential quarter decline primarily reflects seasonally lower revenue from benefit payment services. Moving to our wealth management business, trust, investment and other servicing fees were $312 million in the second quarter, up 6% year-over-year and up 4%, sequentially. And assets under management for wealth management clients were $223 billion at quarter end, up 10% year-over-year and up 3%, sequentially. The increase in wealth management fees due to higher assets under management was partially offset in the year-over-year comparison by higher waived fees in money market mutual funds. Fee waivers in wealth management totaled $60 million in the current quarter, compared to $30 million in the second quarter of last year and $80 in the first quarter. Moving to page six, net interest income was $253 million in the second quarter, up 11% year-over-year and down slightly compared to the first quarter. The year-over-year increase in net interest income was driven by our larger balance sheet as client interest-bearing deposit averaged $66 billion in the quarter, up approximately $10 billion or 18% year-over-year. These increase deposits compared with a year ago were primarily invested on the asset side in Federal Reserve deposits 25 basis points. Partially offsetting the impact of a larger balance sheet was a lower net interest margin, which at 1.06% in the second quarter was down 4 basis points year-over-year. In the sequential comparison higher average earning assets was offset by a 6 basis points decline in the net interest margin. The yield on the securities portfolio decreased 16 basis points sequentially, primarily reflecting higher premium amortization in our mortgage-backed securities portfolio due to factor prepayment speed option. Adjustments to premium amortization in the second quarter decreased the yield on the securities portfolio by approximately 7 basis points and the net interest margin by approximately 3 basis points, compared to 4 and 1 basis point increases, respectively in the first quarter. Average loan balances were approximately $1 billion higher in the second quarter compared to the first quarter with growth coming primarily from commercial and institutional, private client and commercial real estate. The yield on the loan portfolio decreased 6 basis points sequentially, primarily due to yield on commercial loans and day count. Turning to page 7, reported expenses were $811 million in the second quarter, up 11% year-over-year and up 6%, sequentially. As I mentioned earlier, we recorded charges and write-offs in the second quarter of $42 million, of that total $28.5 million relates to severance and other costs associated with the elimination of approximately 200 positions. As outlined in our earnings press release $25.5 million of that charge appears in the compensation line of our income statement, $1.9 million in the employee benefit expense and $1.1 million in outside services expense. Another $4.3 million relates to the ongoing realignment of our real estate portfolio and appears in occupancy expense. In addition, we recorded $9.5 million in software write-offs in the second quarter. Our actions taken this quarter, reflect the continued focus on improving profitability and returns and specifically, we expect the charges to produce annual ongoing saving of approximately $25 million once fully implement. Turning to page 8, expenses excluding the charges and write-offs were $769 million in the second quarter, up 5% year-over-year and flat sequentially. Expense growth is primarily driven by a combination of the cost and investment to support the growth of the business along with certain expenses that can vary by quarter. Expense growth was higher in C&IS where we experienced faster fee growth and lowering wealth management, which maintained attractive margins. Compensation expense excluding the charges increased 6% year-over-year, primarily reflecting staff growth, annual merit increases and the unfavorable impact of movements in currency rate. Staff levels increased 4% year-over-year, with about half of staff growth supporting the growth of global fund services in C&IS, the business which is experiencing above average growth and in which we are investing for future growth across traditional, hedge and other fund structures. The majority of the remainder staff growth was in our operations, technology and risk management group. On a sequential basis, excluding the charges, compensation expense increased 1%, primarily driven by annual merit increases. Staff growth was less than 2% sequentially. Employee benefit expense excluding the charges was 4% higher year-over-year as higher employee medical expense and payroll tax expense more than offset lower pension expense. On a sequential quarter basis, employee benefit expense decreased slightly excluding charges, as higher medical expense was offset by lower pension expense. Outside services expenses, excluding the charges increased 5% year-over-year and decreased 1%, sequentially. Higher volume driven sub-custodian and higher legal expense drove the year-over-year increase, but lower technical services expense was partially offset by seasonally higher sub-custodian expense in the sequential quarter. Equipment and software expense excluding the write-offs was up 16% year-over-year and up 5%, sequentially. Spending in support of our technology strategy continues as we invest to support clients, improve employee efficiency and meet regulatory and compliance requirements. Occupancy expense excluding the charges was down 1% versus the prior year and 3%, sequentially. Other operating expense decreased 7% year-over-year and decreased 11%, sequentially. Both comparisons reflect lower charges associated with account servicing activities, which can be uneven from quarter-to-quarter. The sequential quarter comparison also reflects lower business promotion and marketing costs associated with the Northern Trust open out in the first quarter. Turning to page nine, we continue to be focused on improving profitability and return. As Rick will discuss later, we are reorganizing to allow our client facing group to focus on growth and our operations and technology functions to efficiently enable this growth. This structure along with the actions announced today will create the opportunity for future productivity gain and the expected cost savings rollout that company to simultaneously increase profitability and invest in future growth opportunity that we expect will produce targeted returns over time. Our success in achieving our overall productivity goals can best be measured by our return on equity and pretax margin is a significant contributor. We track both closely. However given the impact of macro environmental factors can have on pretax margin, we also closely track the ratio of expenses to fees. Although by no means immune to external factors, we believe it's a useful metric to gauge our progress. As Page 9 demonstrates, in 2011 when our return on equity was 8.6%, our pretax margin was 24.2% and the expenses to fees ratio was 131%. Since then, we made progress in improving our pretax margins to 29.4% in the second quarter due in large part reducing the ratio of expenses to fees to 109%, both adjusted for this quarter\u2019s charges and write-offs. Capital is outlined on Page 10. As Northern Trust exited parallel runs for the calculation of Basel III advance risk-weighted asset, we are required to report our ratios on both in advance and standardized basis. The ratios calculated on a transition basis to both advanced and standardized, remains very strong with common equity tier 1 and tier 1 capital ratios of 12.7% and 12.9%, respectively. Based on interpretation in the final Basel III rules released by the Federal Reserve on a fully phased-in basis, our common equity tier 1 capital ratio under the standardized approach would be approximately 11.1% and under the advanced approach would be approximately 12.3%. Both of these ratios are well above the fully phased-in requirement of 7% which includes the capital conservation buffer. The supplementary leverage ratio at both the corporation and bank are above 5%, which exceeds requirement applicable to Northern Trust. As Northern Trust progresses through the fully phased in Basel III implementation, there could be additional enhancements to our model and further guidance from the regulators on the implementation of the final rule, which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final Basel III rules. In the second quarter, we repurchased 1.2 million shares at a cost of $75 million, bringing to 238 million of total share repurchase activity in the first half of the year. Our 2014 capital plan provides for repurchase of up to an additional 350 million in common stock through March of 2015. In closing, we remain focused on growing and steadily improving profitability in order to drive returns into our target range. Year-to-date fees have grown 8%, revenues have grown 6% and excluding charges and write-offs, expenses have grown 5%. Our pretax margin improved to 28% and our return on equity was 9.9%. With that, let me turn the call over to Rick. Rick Waddell : Thank you Mike and let me extend my thanks to everyone listening to Northern Trust earnings conference call today. We appreciate your interest and continued support. Yesterday, we announced several leadership changes that will become effective on September 1st. These changes have two key objectives, first, to sharpen our focus on profitable growth and second, to further develop our leaders by exposing them to different roles. Jana Schreuder will assume the role of Chief Operating Officer with operations, technology and enterprise change reporting to her. Jana and her teams will be focused on enabling accelerated growth by making Northern Trust more efficient and nimble. Bill Morrison, our President since 2011, will continue to lead our wealth management, asset management and corporate and institutional services businesses as well as our corporate marketing and strategy efforts. We are very excited about the strategic and competitive positioning of Northern Trust across the markets and segments we serve. Bill and the leaders reporting to him will be focused on maximizing our strong positioning and significant marketplace opportunities to accelerate growth. The leverage and further develop our leaders, Steve Fradkin will become Head of Wealth Management and replace Mike O'Grady will become Head of Corporate and Institutional Services. Biff Bowman formally was Head of C&IS in both North America and in EMEA and most recently Head of our Human Resources Group will become Chief Financial Officer. These changes are a testament to the deep end -- to the depth and breadth of our leadership team at Northern Trust and will further our efforts to accelerate profitable growth. Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust second quarter earnings conference call today. Mike and I would be happy to answer your questions. Joshua, would you please open the line. Operator : Yes, sir. (Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll take our first question from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs : Great. Thanks. Good morning everyone. And Mike, congrats on the new role and new responsibilities. First question, I guess, around the expense program that I guess, you guys announced. I just want to make sure that I got the numbers right. So the savings that you expect to get are about $25 million on an annualized run rate basis. Do you guys think of that as a gross number or net number meaning that do you think that actually as an expense reduction, or just a way for you guys to reinvest in other areas of the firm? Michael O'Grady: Two parts to that, Alex. The first part will be that we think about that number as a net number. So we will be reducing compensation related to the positions that we talked about, which is in excess of the $25 million. However, there are certain areas that we're reorganizing where we\u2019ll need to reinvest in people to take on some of those responsibilities. So that\u2019s a net number if you will. More broadly speaking, as we've been doing with driving performance, all of the savings that we generate and pretax benefit that we generate from the various initiatives are used first to improve our profitability but then also to allow us to continue to invest in the business. So even with the over $250 million, if you recall that we generated on a run rate basis through 2013, a portion of that was redeployed back into growing the business and improving technology as well. Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs : Got it. Thanks. And then my follow-up question was around trends in foreign exchange during the quarter. As you pointed out, I mean, we think we\u2019ve all observed pain throughout the course of quarter volatility been quite well and volumes across many asset classes been low as well. So a little surprise to see, I guess, sequential growth in expense -- sorry in FX trading for you guys. And I know you spend some time trying to develop some new capabilities. So do you think it\u2019s more of a function of you getting new business from clients that just haven\u2019t traded with you in the past or something else that\u2019s driving the sequential increase in those revenues? Michael O'Grady: Alex, it is a combination of factors, certainly, the broader market volatility level. Those certainly impact the broader market volume. And then more specifically as you know most of our activity is with our custody clients and those custody clients may or may not have consistent transaction and volume activity that the rest of the market does. The dynamic that we saw in the second quarter is that our client base, if you will, was more active. And so the volumes that we saw through our custody clients were higher on a sequential basis in contrast to market volumes overall which were lower. So that\u2019s one. Two, as you mentioned, we have had a number of initiatives in the foreign exchange area particularly looking to transact with the broader group of clients and more third party FX that we call the non-custody clients. As I mentioned in previous calls, we've begun to see the benefit of that. I would say that we\u2019re seeing much more volume related to that activity and more recently, including in this quarter we\u2019ve seen the benefit of increased revenue from that as well. But it\u2019s still early days in the financial impact from that. Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs : Got it. Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse. Ashley Serrao - Credit Suisse : Good morning. Within the wealth management divisions, the eastern region saw great growth this quarter. Is this really a function of New York gaining traction? And then if you step away and from a high level, how would you categorize the revenue potential here oh here both here and in Houston, what innings are we in? Michael O'Grady: Sure. So the growth of the wealth management business has continued to be relatively broad based within the U.S. and across all three regions. And from quarter to quarter, as you would expect one region may do better than another. And interestingly where we\u2019ve even seen the central region for example, which as you would expect we have higher market shares if you will. It continued to grow at a nice rate. At the same, we\u2019ve talked about increasing the investments that we make into certain markets where we have lower penetration or market share. And we\u2019re in the early innings of those strategies, if you will. You mentioned that couple of the markets, Ashley, there is certainly in the Texas market more broadly and Houston specifically. We\u2019re looking to expand the business more quickly but I would say that that\u2019s still in the early stages of that. And likewise in New York which clearly is the largest marketplace, as you\u2019ve identified, we\u2019ve had nice success but I would say it\u2019s still very early relative to the strategy that we have there. Ashley Serrao - Credit Suisse : Okay. And then on other expenses, this is the second quarter in a row where numbers look good. And do you feel that you\u2019re in a spot where you somehow structurally lower these account servicing charges to process improvement because it feels like you are run rating a fair bit below last year's levels. Any color there would be appreciated? Michael O'Grady: Sure. In the other categories, as you highlighted, there are a number of different items that fall into that category. And they can vary by quarter from quarter to quarter. We have had, I would say, very good experience in the last two quarters with regard to charges related to client activities there. That\u2019s not something that we\u2019re able to predict going forward. There's no question that we are focused on not only serving our clients very well but minimizing any type of errors that we may have that require financial renumeration that you would see there. But all the same, I can't by any means say that we can expect that we\u2019ll see these low levels going forward. Ashley Serrao - Credit Suisse : All right. Thanks for taking my questions. Michael O'Grady: Sure. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken - UBS: Hi. Good afternoon. Good question on the timing of these savings. How should we think about that growing into results. Can you give us a sense about how these are going to phase-in? Michael O'Grady: Some of the actions that we talked about today, we\u2019ve already begun to take. And so there will be some impact from that in the third quarter. But it will be very small. And even in the fourth quarter, we would expect the run rate to be very low as we begin to work through the plans that are related to the charges. For 2015, we would expect to see the majority of the $25 million that we talked about and beyond that 2016, we would be fully implemented. Brennan Hawken - UBS: Okay. And then and so with the majority, we\u2019re talking about 20 of the 25 there by the time we get through and as you go through 15, would it continue to phase-in over the year. Is there any sort of additional sense you can give on, on that? Michael O'Grady: Sure. It will phase-in over the year. Because the activities here are not in one particular area of the bank but across the company where we think we have opportunities to reorganize and become more efficient and how we execute in those areas. And so the implementation of that, takes time because the timelines are different for each of those areas. So the actual activities themselves will roll out over the next few quarters and as a result, the savings will phase in along with those. And when I say majority, it\u2019s certainly over half, well over half but beyond what the amount is. There is not a specific number that I would get. Brennan Hawken - UBS: Okay. That helps. Thanks. And then I guess question on capital. Can you -- do you, is it your sense that wealth management clients believe the capital strengths is an important differentiator for you. I\u2019m just trying to sort of get my head around why not return more capital, get closer to your regulatory capital minimums. Is it that you feel as though your compared with maybe some of the other trust banks and those firms are held to a higher standard. Therefore you have to be up at that level as well. Just can you maybe walk us through if there's a competitive factor coming in to play here? Michael O'Grady: Sure. Capital strength is critical to our business and that through both with wealth management as well as our corporate institutional clients as well. We believe that our clients definitely take comfort in the fact that Northern currently is and has been very well capitalized whether that's on a standalone basis or in comparison to other competitors that they may be considering doing business with. So that will continue to be a factor for us as we look at our capital level going forward. As to exactly where we are relative to a competitor, we don't necessarily determine our capital level based on anyone or even a small group of competitors. They are just relative data point that we take into account along with a number of other data point from our own internal analysis related to our own risk and certainly with regard to be a regulatory required level. So that\u2019s a framework that we used. It\u2019s a broader framework of factors and the commercial aspect and competitive aspects are part of that. So last thing, I would say is certainly we\u2019re very focused on returning capital to our shareholders, which we've done an increasing amount over the last few years and yet that\u2019s also obviously an exercise that we go through with our regulators that have a clear say in the amount of capital that we can return. Brennan Hawken - UBS: Okay. Thanks for the color. Operator : And we\u2019ll move next to Glenn Schorr with ISI. Glenn Schorr - ISI: Hi. Thanks. Maybe start with a quickie on capital ratios. I agree you got a ton of it. Just curious on how come it went down in the quarter and barely up on the year on a ratio basis. You\u2019re making a lot of money not buying back too much positive OCI benefit which is just logic? Michael O'Grady: Yeah. I would say that for the most part, Glenn, we have returned this year basically what our net income has been. So we\u2019re much higher in the first quarter and a little bit lower in the second quarter with regard to share repurchase. Between the two quarters there plus the dividend, it largely offset the net income impact from that. And then I would say beyond that we\u2019re into a time period where the capital ratios depending on the methodology approach are being transitioned in. So there is a number of factors that happen on a transition basis that I\u2019ll hit just a couple. But from a numerator perspective, we have trust preferreds for example. The equity credit for those are being phased out over a time period here. So, that\u2019s going to reduce our capital level. And then on the denominator side, there's a transition period, essentially what our Basel I risk weight to the Basel III standardized risk weight. So you will see that impact on the ratios. And then certainly with the advanced methodologies, those are always subject to updated modeling and assumptions that go into that. That can affect either operational risk capital or credit risk capital or any other of the capital category. Glenn Schorr - ISI: Okay. That\u2019s definitely helpful. And then on the -- I guess these questions on both expenses and net interest income merged together in this where you mentioned most of the deposit, higher deposit funding was invested at the Fed. By the way I have the same problem, I don\u2019t know what to do with cash either. So I\u2019m just curious if that's a comment about what you think the duration of those deposits might be or an interest in not taking on too much credit risk, not expanding more on the duration side? Michael O'Grady: Sure. Well, we would be glad to help you out with your problem if you would like to be a client of ours. So, we will talk about that separately. You're right that we have seen the balance sheet expand significantly more so over the last year and somewhat over the last quarter. And as you\u2019ve seen, we have increased the size of the securities portfolio. So, that is a way for us when to extend out the duration and get a higher yield on those investments. I would say that we look very closely at the nature of the deposits that are coming in. As much as we would consider all of these client-related deposits as you know with the extreme amount of liquidity that\u2019s just in the system. What we don't know exactly is what the impact of behavior will be to the extent that interest rate head in the different direction. So we have to be careful just on how much duration we add to the portfolio. We\u2019ve been relatively constant on that front. And then the last thing I would say is, as you saw in the quarter here, we actually had about $1 billion of growth in the loan portfolio. That's certainly a positive development. One, it indicates just the fact that in our view the economy is improving and our clients are positioned where they are taking on additional loans to expand their business or do other things, but that is an ideal way for us to deploy those assets because we\u2019re deploying them in client needs or for client needs. Glenn Schorr - ISI: I think that\u2019s all completely reasonable. And to your point, when you -- you\u2019re clearly managing expenses a little bit more or getting us to focus more on fees to core revenues versus the ancillary revenues. If and when we ever live to see the higher rates, does that just imply the higher incremental margins as super high on NII? Michael O'Grady: Very, very high, yeah. Glenn Schorr - ISI: Awesome. Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Hi. Thanks. I just had a follow-up on the last question where you\u2019re talking about what happen with NII increased. The one of the concerns that people had is that as interest rates have come down and soft dollar benefit has declined, you\u2019ve been able to -- the industry has been able to move more towards hard dollar as a percentage of total. As interest rates go up, does that cap ability to continue to grow the hard dollar fee side of the business as much? Will investors in a turnaround say I am giving you more soft dollar now so I can peel back hard dollar? Michael O'Grady: I think Betsy that it\u2019s a very interesting question in the sense of that\u2019s very tactically close to the business. And we -- as you point out, we\u2019ve gone through a time period here where whether you want to characterize certain revenue streams as hard dollar or soft dollar, that\u2019s not the terminology we use. But so let me say it the way we would which would be the fee component of our service offerings versus some of the other services that we provide where the revenues come in the form of whether it\u2019s spread income, foreign exchange, securities lending, things like that. And so we've been on the downside, if you will, of those revenue stream coming down. I think that has had some impact on the fee side in the sense that just for the entire marketplace. If the ancillary side is lower, then that there's firmer pricing if you will. To your point then the question is. To the extent rate turnaround, do we lose that? Hard to say, it all depends on the competitive dynamic. But my expectation is that some of that discipline that we've seen will be maintained in the marketplace as rates go up at least for some extended time period. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Okay. And the disclosures that you put up around benefit from rising rate environment into revenue stream, earnings stream in the Q. Are you anticipating that similar behavior of client as in past rate rise cycles? Are you assuming like a static balance sheet analysis? So I guess the basic question is, is that Q disclosure more of a minimum as opposed to in a dynamic environment, what you think you got? Michael O'Grady: So it is a static balance sheet analysis. It is, as you point out, difficult at this point to have a very high level of confidence in all the assumptions that go into that analysis given that we haven't had this type of rate environment for this time period. And so predicting the behavior as rate increases particularly difficult and be more specific, particularly difficult on the deposit side of that calculation. And so what we\u2019ve had to do is look at both the nature of the deposit. So whether we think that those deposits are core if you will or are operational. But then also our ability to maintain the level that we\u2019re paying on those deposit as rate increase and as we see the benefit on the asset side of the equation. And so we try to incorporate the fact that we\u2019re in a unusual interest rate environment, but it is just that, it\u2019s a set of assumptions that we put in there and we\u2019ll obviously have to see how it plays out to the extent rates move up. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Right. And then again as rates do move up there will clearly be a benefit. The question is, how much do you and you have some room there to determine how much you\u2019re going to allow to fall to the bottomline or not, I would expect that at least some of that improvement in NII would be able to fall to the bottomline, is that fair? Michael O'Grady: Absolutely. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Luke Montgomery from Sanford Bernstein. Luke Montgomery - Sanford Bernstein : Hey, guys. Thanks. So just maybe some more thoughts on the management reshuffle. I know you've done this a lot over the last few years and I get that it\u2019s part of your management philosophy and maybe there is some succession planning here. But at the same time, I think Mike was only in the seat for a short time, he is a good communicator, and I do believe that investors value some consistency in the CFO seat. So maybe you could comment what the catalyst was here and why the objectives you listed are more importantly that maybe providing some continuity in the dialogue with the investment community? Rick Waddell : Well, Luke, it\u2019s Rick and I appreciate the question. I would point out that Mike has been in the role for three years. So this is not what I would call just a quick change and I would also note that Mike is not leaving the company. He is still a very valuable member of our management team. The CFO role has quite frankly historically been one at Northern where we put high potential talented individuals who get to see the company with the different lens but across the corporation. And if you go back to Steve Fradkin and Bill Morrison, I would highlight two individuals who were in that role and have moved on into other role. So that really is the context with Mike, with Biff you are going to get an individual who has -- his entire career has been with Northern. He started at audit. He has been on the commercial banking side. He was part of our acquisition strategy in 2005. In Europe, he\u2019s ran Europe. He\u2019s run North America. And so he is a very seasoned talented leader with the terrific financial background. So I think I would say personally I have been spoiled by Mike. But Mike has a unique background. But I don\u2019t think investment community externally nor do I think internally from a financial leadership perspective that we are going to miss a beat when we\u2019ll make these changes. Luke Montgomery - Sanford Bernstein : Okay. Fair enough. I guess I have got someone new to try to pester into enhancing the organic growth disclosures? Rick Waddell : Well, that\u2019s your job. Luke Montgomery - Sanford Bernstein : Maybe an update on what you\u2019re seeing in terms of regulatory expense trends. Are you comfortable maintaining the view that it\u2019s going to be in line with 2013, but with the mix shift that you stated way from outside services and towards permanent or maintenance spending? And was there anything that was pulled into Q2 or pushed out that might affect the run rate over the next two quarters? Michael O'Grady: So on that front, Luke, I would say that so far this year it\u2019s been consistent with what our expectations were in the sense that we -- you\u2019ve seen for example that our comp and expenses have gone up. That\u2019s one of the areas where it\u2019s gone up. But we think that that\u2019s the most economical way for us to address the improvements that we\u2019re making within our control functions. And at the same time as you\u2019ve seen in outside services, it\u2019s not as much that you can see the detail per se that as you probably noted. I didn\u2019t talk about consulting expenses been higher either year-over-year or sequentially, and that\u2019s because we haven\u2019t successful in doing more or so and having less on the outside. Now the trend from quarter-to-quarter can certainly. There does tend to be more activity on the regulatory front as we get into the back half of the year as there are number of items that we are trying to clear whether that\u2019s for the CCAR process or any one of the other, any number of regulatory initiatives that we do have. So it\u2019s not to say that we\u2019ve locked into a low level, it\u2019s just that it\u2019s been consistent with what our expectations were. The other thing I would say is that one of the areas that has been our focus for us this year has been AIFMD over in Europe. So we\u2019ve incurred the cost and the investment to build that capability out in the first half of the year, that\u2019s all you\u2019ve had. It\u2019s just the cost and expense related to that. We will continue to have both some implementation costs and ongoing costs related to providing that service, but we will also have revenues in the latter part of the year as clients are using that service and compensating us for that. So that won\u2019t show up in the expense line as much, but it will show up on the revenue side. Luke Montgomery - Sanford Bernstein : Okay. Thanks. Very helpful. Operator : And our next question will come from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken, your line is open. Go ahead, sir. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: Hell, sorry about that. Hey, Mike, can you actually talk through about the net new business wins and the growth rates of the C&IS and FPS ex fee waivers have been at a pretty consistent rate both in upper single digit last year. So I was wondering if you could talk about the pace of new business wins and if either the size or constitution of what buckets that are coming from has changed at all? Michael O'Grady: Sure. On the C&IS front, the business continues to have quite a bit of momentum. So, it\u2019s very positive and I would say it\u2019s also relatively broad-based. So both from a geographic perspective. Again there are certain areas where you might think the business is more mature and that\u2019s going to grow at lower rates in North America for example, but it continues to be very successful and both getting new additional business or revenue opportunities from existing clients but also winning new clients. And then within GFS, success not only in North America but very much so in Europe. And that\u2019s after going through a time period when Europe had more difficult and we did see the new business levels go down in Europe. Now we\u2019ve had a number of quarters of very positive net new business in EMEA for us. And then you\u2019ve heard us talk about certainly our success in the APAC region broadly speaking and specifically in Australia. And I would say that that momentum continues as well. So all very good and we would expect that that continues in the sense that we\u2019re still very active in pursuing opportunities in all those regions in those businesses. On the wealth management front, I talked about it a little bit previously just about the different regions. And I would say there that we\u2019re at a time period in the market where I sense that or I should say our wealth management professionals and experts see a certainly level of nervousness if you will on the part of clients given the high equity market levels. That can always cause fits and starts with moving business to new providers. We continue as you would expect at very high retention levels and are very focused on trying to increase the level of new business that comes into the company. And so at this point, I would characterize that as steady not as high as we\u2019ve seen in other time periods where there is just more activity in the marketplace. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: And Mike just on an on-boarding question, is Bridgewater still on track for coming on this quarter and presumably even again without the related AUC so we\u2019ll see that in the capture rate as well? Michael O'Grady: Correct. So we are on track for Bridgewater to be online in the third quarter and their assets will be assets under administration. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: Okay. And just Mike one question on that fees, that expenses, that fees number. If we presume that rates really don\u2019t change, how much more progress do you think you guys can make on that just from an organic growth and expense control relative to the 115 that you\u2019re at this quarter? Michael O'Grady: Can we still think we have significant opportunity to improve that ratio and with the changes that Rick has talked about today, that\u2019s all an indication of our effort to try to do what it takes in order to continue to improve that ratio. This particular set of action happens to be around the structure of the organization. In my mind, it\u2019s a way for us to structure in a way that we think we\u2019ll create new opportunity to deliver efficiency. But that\u2019s on top of things that we've been doing for the last 2.5 years, which we will continue to do because we think it's important to our long-term success to be able to continue to drive that ratio down. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: Okay. Thanks a lot Mike. Operator : And we\u2019ll move on to Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe question for both Rick and Mike. As you think about the business realignment and the leadership changes and really trying to drive profitable growth over the longer term. Aside from the expense components of that, can you talk about profitable growth in the business mix perspective within the businesses? So what I\u2019m trying to get at is due to what extend would you prefer to invest in higher margin area within CI&S servicing such as hedge fund administration, alternative administration. And then similarly on the wealth management side, would you view as the more profitable components in the wealth management, higher end versus the medium area? Rick Waddell : Brian, its Rick. I mean, our businesses fortunately present tremendous opportunities to grow. So as Mike has indicated and we\u2019ve been saying for sometime, we continue to invest in a variety of initiative to take advantage of growth opportunity. So for example, in Australia, that business continues to grow. We\u2019re adding headcount. We\u2019re putting more capabilities in there. Asia we\u2019re at large, we opened an office in Kuala Lumpur earlier this year. There is just a number of markets on the institutional side where we\u2019re seeing strong client demand and therefore we need to invest in those market in order to grow them. On the well side, we talked about our mega market strategy. We\u2019re in the east coast, specifically North New York, our business in Texas and specifically in Houston. Those are markets were we are allocating more resources because growth opportunities, the margin, the revenues and the profitability are there. We\u2019re also expanding in capability so our EPS strategy where we\u2019re north of $8 million and continue to add product, broaden our product, mix leveraging our mutual fund and pass of capability. That\u2019s an investment that we\u2019re making. So it\u2019s fairly broad based, it\u2019s in both businesses, each of them have different dynamic granted, but we\u2019re seeing very, very good investment opportunities to grow our businesses in geographies and in markets throughout our business. Michael O'Grady: And I guess, Brian, the only thing I would add but Rick laid out there is to your question around the profitability of the service offering that we have for our client where we're doing and have been doing quite a bit of analysis as you would imagine around those product and services to determine where are the best opportunities for us to move that mix. And so you marry that up with the businesses and the growth opportunities we have to determine the best way to allocate capital and resources. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank : And then just a follow-on for that, maybe your view of the alternative servicing business, though I\u2019m thinking really of the Omnium, the legacy Omnium businesses and we\u2019re bringing Bridgewater on. To what extent do you think you can leverage that to much stronger growth in that area? And do you view that as the more longer term profitable area than the legacy core pension custody assets and investment management businesses? Michael O'Grady: So, we continue to think that area presents tremendous opportunity for us. And when we think about resource allocation, we would say that that\u2019s an area where we have invested in dedicated resources to over the last few years and that\u2019s because we do believe that it not only presents growth but presents attractive return to the extent that we grow that business out. And it\u2019s a situation where I would say at this point that we have had success there certainly adding large clients like Bridgewater, which will be onboard shortly here, changes the dynamic forces well as to the economic of the business, the ability to continue to invest in the business as well. So that is clearly one of the areas of opportunity. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank : Very clear. Thanks very much. Operator : And we\u2019ll move on to Cynthia Mayer with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Cynthia Mayer - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Thanks a lot. Most of my questions have been gone over, but just maybe circling back to the asset growth, it seem like this quarter there was a real disparity between the wealth management AUM up 3% and the corporate institutional, which was basically flat. So I think you mentioned that was a matter of cash outflows on the institutional side. I\u2019m just wondering if there was any other dynamic and put another way, whether it\u2019s focusing on the asset under management, what the pipeline is looking like? Michael O'Grady: Sure. On the asset under management, I think, Cynthia, just to clarify, you said on a sequential basis? Cynthia Mayer - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. Michael O'Grady: Yeah. Sure. So on a sequential basis, part of it is that cash certainly does factor in from quarter-to-quarter and given the nature of our client base and what they look to us to provide, that is one of the key areas, which is liquidity and liquidity management and so that going to affect the numbers on assets under management. The other part of it is that we do have some very large asset management client. And they do make allocation decisions from quarter-to-quarter. And on a sequential basis, we did have two very large clients who made reallocation decisions in the quarter. And so they allocated out of the product if you will that which was on the equity side into other categories and that was a drag if you will on the AUM growth on a sequential basis. Cynthia Mayer - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And looking forward any color? Michael O'Grady: Difficult, other than just I would say, consistent with my broader commentary on the opportunities being relatively broad based in that business as well across both industry group as well as geography. Cynthia Mayer - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then maybe just a quick specific follow-up, the lack of provision this quarter. How do you think about that going forward, given that where the trends are? Michael O'Grady: The trends continue to be very positive. We did see a nice decline, if you will, over 10% in our nonperforming loan. From quarter-to-quarter, we\u2019ll have to continue to see if we\u2019ll have to see if that continues going forward. And as you know, we\u2019re obviously resize the reserve to what the appropriate level is in the provision falls out of that. So you don\u2019t have a view as to where that would be necessarily, but we certainly do hope that we continue to see the positive credit quality trend. Cynthia Mayer - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thank you. Michael O'Grady: Sure. Operator : And we\u2019ll move on to Marty Mosby with Guggenheim Partners. Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Partners : I want to ask specific question on the write-off that you had in the securities portfolio with faster prepayment speeds, when the refi market has been flowing not accelerating us to have such a large adjustment this quarter, I just was curious what the catalyst for that was? Michael O'Grady: Sure, Marty. And on the premium amortization, it is something where it\u2019s difficult likewise to predict exactly what is going to happen in the portfolio because it is a collection of a number of these mortgage-backed securities. And admittedly we've done analysis on our own looking to be able to better predict our forecast, what the adjustments will be from quarter-to-quarter. And there isn\u2019t a single index if you will, whether that\u2019s the MVA purchase index or refi index or necessarily even interest rate level where the tenure is that will give you a clean read on what to expect as far as prepayment because there are just a number of drivers as to what can drive it in a particular MBS pool. So hard to necessarily give you a view on what to expect on that going forward other than the fact that the adjustment will move from quarter-to-quarter, but all the same our view is that on balance of course, it just a matter of ultimately amortizing all of the premium that is booked at the time of purchase. That doesn't change the ultimate return we\u2019ll receive on the security. Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Partners : Got you. And going to non-interest expense from some of the charges you had this quarter, the write-off that you had in the software, was that related to a system that was being replaced or is it an outdated system or was it a new system that just wasn\u2019t getting to the point where I can fulfill the -- what you thought the objective was? Michael O'Grady: Sure. It\u2019s some collection of -- I don\u2019t say all of the things that you mentioned but a number of things that you mentioned there. So this was not one large system where we had a write-off that totals 9.5 million. It\u2019s a combination of a number of application that fits the profile that you talked about here where we no longer are using that or expect that we\u2019re going to sunset it in a short time period and therefore not appropriate to continue to amortize it over a longer time period. Certainly, we have been and we will continue to be very focused on the IT capital investments we\u2019re making going forward and at time that does present, I call important financial decision to make because we may still have asset value on the book. And we have to determine whether it make sense to continue use that particular application or platform or to replace it write it off as we have on certain things here and then move forward with the new investment. Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Partners : Thanks. Operator : And we\u2019ll move on to Mike Mayo with CLSA. Mike Mayo - CLSA: Hi. This management change is that a lot of change at one time. What was the catalyst for that? I guess you said to improve profitable growth, but was there any extra reason why it\u2019s now? And when you say to improve profitable growth to what sort of EPS growth \u2013ROE, efficiency pretax margin ratio are you seeking? Rick Waddell : Mike, its Rick. Reason why now is lot of inputs into the decision, people's careers where they are and lengthen job and time to get them exposed, so lot of this is continuing to build out our leadership team and give people new roles. But really the impetus was as result of all the work that we've done over the last 2.5 plus years, beginning with our driving performance efforts and to leverage that, that [learning] that I call the muscle memory that we build up around in this environment, which we don\u2019t expect to dramatically improve to continue to drive efficiency, drive productivity, drive nimbleness throughout our organization in order to continue to grow profitably our businesses, which are well positioned, client franchise very, very strong brand, financial strength et cetera. So it really is to take the last 2.5 years and what we\u2019ve done around driving performance and the strategy review we put in place for the Board last year around our businesses and what we felt if take in order to grow profitably -- in order to reach those are -- we've been -- we have said probably to get to the second part of your question. We\u2019ve said we want a 10% to 15% ROE return and we have been inching our way along and doing all the right thing, but I think we\u2019ve got an opportunity to accelerate that and not just to get into the 10%, the lower end of that range, which we did in the second quarter, but get to the upper end of that range in the near-term. And if we are going to do that, I feel we need a different organizational structure that brings the focus and the expertise and the talent that we have to bare on what Mike referred to is the things to enable this growth to grow -- these businesses to grow profitably. And that was really [incident] and it is a good time. We had a Board meeting yesterday and I've been working with the Board and working with the management team over the last several months to put this in place and I\u2019d say everybody including me is extremely excited about their new roles and the opportunities that we have. Again, to leverage what we've been doing the last couple of years in order to accelerate the profitable growth for the company. Mike Mayo - CLSA: Is there a new name for the new program? Rick Waddell : Stay tuned. Mike Mayo - CLSA: Okay. I just have a follow up. Tell me, if I hear you correctly, you think you can get to the high-end of the ROE in the near-term without higher interest rates or is that a little too aggressive? Michael O'Grady: Certainly, we wouldn't have a target range out there if we didn\u2019t think that we could ultimately get to it. And as Rick said, all the plans around this are to try to drive not only into the range and well under the range but ultimately get to that top end of the range and trying to do so without the assumptions that the microenvironment gets much better and that takes us there. As far as the timing to you get there, very difficult, even the Chairman of the Fed had difficult time giving timeframe for things. I think it\u2019s difficult to say when that will be. It\u2019s more that we just need to make sure that we are on the path for getting there. Mike Mayo - CLSA: Let me ask it one way differently, the pre-tax margin was 28% this quarter, pre-crisis it was 35%? Can you get back to that pre-tax margin pre-crisis of 35% without higher interest rates? Michael O'Grady: Yes. I would say, Mike, that, first of all, that framework and looking at the margin is a good framework to look at and some thing that we do as well. So we know that we need to get that pre-tax margin into the 30s in order to achieve the returns that we are targeting, whether it's exactly 34, 35, whatever it may be, it\u2019s -- there's more to the calculation than that, but that is what we are driving toward is to get to those types of margins absence just looking for the interest rate environment or the FX currency volatility environment to be down. Mike Mayo - CLSA: Actually, my last question, when should we get additional update on these initiatives that you're taking, I guess, you have several new people and new seats, and how long will it take to get their planned out to the investment community? Michael O'Grady: I would say, at this point, Mike, there's no grand plan if you will or rollout of something, as Rick said, the businesses are extremely well-positioned, this is not a change in strategy, he is not looking to change the course of the strategy, this is an acceleration of what we have been doing. Having said that, as far as, the checkups in the monitoring along the way, every quarter we\u2019ll certainly be back like we are now to talk about the progress we are making toward those financial goals. Mike Mayo - CLSA: All right. Thank you. . Operator : And we will take our final question from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research : Hi. And the 20% year-on-year growth in assets under custody, if we strip out the market performance from that, is that kind of a sustainable pace of organic growth would be say, but there are some lumpy wins in there and obviously, the market performance is what it is, but if you take that out, all those is not making for these kind of on an underlying basis sustainable or was it written by lumpiness that will be difficult to maintain that? Rick Waddell : Yes. Geoff, if I understood the question correctly, that growth rate if you will in AUC year-over-year so 20%. Definitely a high rate if you will in the sense that it\u2019s been driven by very strong market. And so markets are driving that more than half of that growth at least as best we can attribute the growth. You also had a favorable foreign exchange impact to that, meaning just from a currency perspective, assets under custody that are denominated in pound, for example, were up significantly on a year-over-year basis, so that helps it. And then the differential if you will is more towards the organic growth and I would say the organic growth once you peel those other factors back is consistent with both historical levels and also what we\u2019ve been talking about. Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research : And then one quick, second question, the ECB move to negative deposit rate, have you started challenging the deposits in Europe, have you seen any of your competitors doing that? Rick Waddell : Yes. I can\u2019t speak to exactly what all the competitors are doing. From our perspective we are not charging client if you build for deposits. It is certainly something that we are monitoring very closely, given the fact that the ECB is at negative 10 basis point rate and that does certainly have an impact on the spreads that we can earn on euro deposits that we have, because to the extent we are at zero. We have to reinvest those in someway and as market rates come down, it squeezes the spread on those deposits. So we will continue to not only monitor the marketplace closely, but we've been in close communication with our client as well. Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research : Great. Thanks very much. Rick Waddell : Yeah. Operator : And that conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks. Bev Fleming : Well, we like to thank everybody for joining us today, any follow-up questions, please contact myself, Bev Fleming or Allison Quaintance, otherwise we will look forward to updating you on our third quarter performance in October. Thank you very much. Have a nice day. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference. We thank you for participation.",

This will allow us to move through the queue and allow as many people as possible the opportunity to ask questions as time permits. Thank you again for joining us today. Let me turn the call over to Biff Bowman. Biff Bowman : Good morning, everyone, and let me join Bev in welcoming you to Northern Trust earnings conference call. It is my privilege to be here today with you to review Northern Trust third quarter financial performance. I hope to meet many of you in the coming weeks and months. As is our customary practice, today I will review our results for the quarter after which Bev and I would be happy to answer your questions. So starting on Page 2 this morning we reported third quarter net income of $205 million and earnings per share of $0.84. Our return on equity was 10.1% in the quarter. As you evaluate our performance this quarter, recall that our results in the third quarter of last year included a $33 million gain on the sale of an office building and the results in the second quarter of this year included charges and write offs of $42 million. Excluding these items our earnings per share of $0.84 in the third quarter increased 11% year-over-year and decreased 3% sequentially. Environmental factors which impact our businesses and our clients were mixed in the third quarter, a theme which has been ongoing for some time. U.S. equity markets were higher at the end of the third quarter both year-over-year and sequentially with the S&P 500 up 17% and 1% respectively. International equities as measured by the MSCI EAFE Index were up approximately 2% year-over-year but down 6% sequentially with the sequential quarter decline driven largely by a stronger U.S. dollar. In bond markets the Barclays U.S. aggregate index was up 1% year-over-year but down 1% sequentially. Client assets under custody ended the quarter at $5.9 trillion, up 13% over last year, and assets under management ended at $923 billion, up 9%. On a sequential basis client custody assets declined 2% and managed assets were essentially flat. I\u2019ll provide further details on asset trends later in this call. Currency markets had multiple impacts this quarter. Currency volatility as measured by the G7 index was 36% lower than the third quarter of last year having hit an all time low in the month of July before trending up in the months of August and September. Sequentially, the G7 index was essentially flat while the emerging markets index was down 10%. Currency volatility influences our foreign exchange trading income as does the level of client activity. Currency rates, which influence the translation of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar, impact client assets and our revenues and expenses. The dollar was generally weaker on a year-over-year basis yet stronger compared to the second quarter. Dollar strength in the sequential quarter comparison tempered client asset growth and related fee growth with an offsetting benefit to expense growth. Short term interest rates remained at every low levels and continue to pressure our net interest margin and result in fee waivers on our money market mutual funds. Three month LIBOR averaged 23 basis points down 3 basis points year-over-year while the fed funds effective rate an average overnight repo rate both remained low at 9 and 8 basis points respectively. With those comments providing the context of the environment let\u2019s move to Page 3 and discuss the financial highlights of the third quarter. Compared to last quarter revenues were flat as higher trust investment and other servicing fees and net interest income were offset by lower foreign exchange, trading securities commission and trading, and other operating income. Expenses, excluding the prior quarter\u2019s charges and write offs, increased 1% due primarily to higher employee benefit and other operating expenses offset partially lower outside services and equipment and software expenses. We had no loan loss provision in the quarter as credit quality continue to improve. Reported net income increased 12% sequentially. adjusted for last quarter\u2019s charges and write offs net income decrease 3%. Year-over-year revenues adjusted for last year\u2019s gain on the sale of a building were up 6% and expenses were up 5%. Revenue growth was the result of higher trust investment and other servicing fees and net interest income. Expense growth primarily reflects higher competition and benefits and equipment and software expenses. Reported net income was 1% lower year-over-year. Excluding last year\u2019s gain on the sale of a building that income was 10% higher year-over-year. Earnings per share was $0.84 and our return on equity was 10.1%. Let\u2019s look at the results in greater detail starting with revenue on Page 4 of your deck. Third quarter revenues on a fully taxable equivalent basis were approximately $1.1 billion, up 3% year-over-year and flat sequentially. As I mentioned earlier, revenue growth excluding last year\u2019s gain was 6%. Trust investment and other servicing fees the largest component of revenues were $718 million in the up 11%yoy and 2% sequentially. Fees in our corporate and institutional services business increased 11% year-over-year corporate and institutional services business increased 11% year-over-year and 1% sequentially while fees in our wealth management business grew 10% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Higher equity markets in new business were both drivers of growth with higher money market mutual fund waivers partially offsetting. In addition, currency translation helped fee growth by about 0.5% on a year-over-year basis but detracted from fee growth by 0.5% on a sequential basis. Fee waivers were approximately $34 million in the third quarter, an increase of $1 million over last year and $3 million sequentially. The higher waivers were primarily due to the gross yield on t fund declining by approximately 1 basis point on average both year-over-year and sequentially. I\u2019ll go into further detail on trust and investment fee shortly. Foreign exchange trading income was 46 million in the third quarter down 26% year-over-year and 12% sequentially. Currency volatility was lower in the third quarter hitting a an all time low in July before trending up in August and September. Client trading volumes was lower year-over-year yet modestly higher sequentially. Other non-interest income was $65 million in the third quarter down 3% from last year when adjusted for the sale of the building and down 14% sequentially in both comparisons the decline was due in part to lower securities commissions and trading income. The sequential decline was also due to lower income from currency which I\u2019ve also discussed some more detail later activity and lower leasing and loan servicing income. Net interest income which I\u2019d also discuss in more detail later was $256 million in the third quarter up 5% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. With that back drop let\u2019s look at the component of our fee revenue on Page 05. For our corporate and institutional services business fees totalled 400 million in the third quarter up 11% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees, were $275 million in the third quarter, up 15% year-over-year and up 5% sequentially. Assets under custody for C&IS clients were $5.4 trillion at quarter end, up 13% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially. Growth in fees and assets primarily reflects new business and market conditions including higher equity and bond markets particularly in the year-over-year comparison. In the sequential quarter comparison, C&IS fees and assets under custody were dampened by the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar primarily due to the dollar strength in the quarter relative to the euro and Sterling. Investment management fees in C&IS was $75 million in the third quarter were up 6% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially. Assets under management for C&IS clients were $703 billion, up 11% year-over-year and up slightly sequential. The year-over-year increase in C&IS assets under management was due to higher equity and fixed income markets in new business as well as higher securities lending collateral. In the sequential quarter comparison, higher fixed income cash and securities lending collateral were partially offset by lower equities as the stronger dollar hampered international returns. For example, MSCI EAFE Index was down 6% in the third quarter driven primarily by currencies. C&IS investment management fee growth was reduced by higher waivers on institutional money market mutual funds. Waivers impacting C&IS fees equalled $17 million in the third quarter, $1 million higher year-over-year and $2 million higher sequentially primarily reflecting the lower gross yields achieved in the underlying funds that I previously mentioned. Security lending fees were $22 million in the third quarter, down 3% year-over-year and 26% sequentially. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects lower spreads while the sequential quarter decline reflects the traditional impact of the international dividend season which resulted in wider spreads in the second quarter. Securities lending collateral was $121 billion at quarter end, up 16% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. Other fees in C&IS were $28 million in the third quarter, up 4% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects new business and investment risk in analytical services while the sequential quarter increase primarily reflects higher revenue for benefit payment services. Moving on to our Wealth Management business, trust investment and other servicing fees were $318 million in the third quarter, up 10% year-over-year and 2% sequentially reflecting higher equity markets in new business. Assets under management for wealth management clients were $220 billion at quarter end, up 4% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. Recall that earlier in 2014 we transferred $7.6 billion in assets under management from wealth management to C&IS. Absent that transfer wealth management assets under management would have increased about 8% year-over-year. The sequential decline in wealth management assets under management was due primarily to lower non-U.S. equity markets. As I mentioned earlier the MSCI EAFE Index was down 6% in the quarter. Money market mutual fund fee waivers in wealth management totalled $17 million in the current, flat compared with last year and up $1 million compared to last quarter. Moving to Page 6, net interest income was $256 million in the third quarter, up 5% year-over-year and 1% compared to the second quarter. The increase in net interest income was driven by a larger balance sheet as client deposits averaged $86 billion in the quarter, up 14% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. These increased deposits were primarily invested on the asset side in Federal Reserve deposits and securities. Partially offsetting the impact of a larger balance sheet was a lower net interest margin which at 1.05% in the third quarter was down 9 basis points year-over-year. In the sequential comparison, higher average earning assets were partially offset by a 1 basis point decline in the net interest margin. The yield on the securities portfolio increased 2 basis points sequentially primarily reflecting lower premium amortization in our mortgage back securities portfolio due to changes in prepayment speed assumptions versus the prior quarter, as well as the maturity of lower yielding floating rate agency securities. Adjustments to premium amortization in the third quarter increased yield on the securities portfolio by approximately 5 basis points and the net interest margin by approximately 2 basis points compared to 7 basis point and 3 basis point increases respectively in the second quarter. Loan balances averaged $30 billion in the third quarter, up 6% or $1.6 billion year-over-year with growth primarily in commercial and institutional and private client lending partially offset by a lower level of residential real estate loans. The yield on the loan portfolio decreased 6 basis points sequentially primarily due to lower yields of commercial loans. Turning to Page 7 expenses were $775 million in the third quarter, up 5% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially. When adjusted for last quarter\u2019s charges and write offs of $42 million expenses were up 1% sequentially. Compensation expense increased 7% year-over-year primarily reflecting staff growth, annual merit increases and the unfavourable impact of movements in currency rates. Staff levels increased approximately 5% year-over-year with about half of staff growth in the Asia Pacific region including our offices in India and our newest operational center in Manila. On a sequential basis, excluding the charges compensation expense was essentially and staff growth was less than 1%. Employee benefit expense was 11% higher year-over-year as higher employee medical expense and payroll tax expense more than offset lower pension expense. On a sequential quarter basis, excluding the second quarter charges, employee benefit expense increased primarily due to higher medical expense offset partially by lower payroll tax expense. Outside services expenses were down 2% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. When adjusted for the prior quarter\u2019s charges the year-over-year decline primarily reflects consulting and technical services expense. Equipment and software expense was up 5% year-over-year and down 13% sequentially. Excluding last quarter\u2019s software write off the sequential decline was 6%. Software amortization and computer depreciation were slower in the third quarter. Spending and support of our technology strategy continues as we invest to support clients, improve employee efficiency and meet regulatory and compliance requirements. Other operating expense increased 2% year-over-year and 12% sequentially. Both comparisons reflect higher charges associated with account servicing activities which can be uneven from quarter-to-quarter. Turning to Page 8, a key focus has been on sustainably enhancing profitability and returns. This slide reflects the progress we have made in recent years to improve our expenses to fees, pre-tax margin and ultimately our return on equity. The ratio of expenses to trust and investment fees is a particularly important measure of our progress as it addresses what we can most directly control. Reducing this measure from 131% in 2011 to 108% in the third quarter has been a key contributor to the improvement in our return on equity from 8.6% to 10.1% across the same time period. As announced in July, we have reorganized to allow our client facing groups to focus on profitable growth and our operations and technology functions to efficiently enable this growth. We also announced in July the elimination overtime of approximately 200 positions. The success of these actions along with sustainable improvements to our operating model which continue to accrue from driving performance are critical to our future financial performance. Our focus on profitable growth and productivity gains will allow the company to invest in future growth opportunities that will produce targeted return over time. Turning to Page 9, our capital ratios remain very strong with common equity tier 1 ratios of 12.7% and 12.8% respectively calculated on a transition basis for both advanced and standardized. On a fully phased-in basis, our common equity tier 1 capital ratio under the advanced approach would be approximately 12.3% and under the standardised approximately 10.9%. Both of these ratios are well above the fully phased-in requirements of 7% which includes the capital conservation buffer. The supplementary leverage ratio at both the corporation and bank is above 5% which exceeds the 3% requirement applicable to Northern Trust. As Northern Trust progresses through fully phased in Basel III implementation there could be additional enhancements to our models and further guidance from the regulators on the implementation of the final rule which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final Basel III rules. In the third quarter, Northern Trust issued $400 million in perpetual preferred stock at a dividend rate of 5.85%. At its regularly scheduled meeting yesterday, our board of directors declared the quarterly dividend on the preferred stock. Given the early August issuance the initial preferred dividend payment will cover five months and, therefore, equal $9.5 million in the fourth quarter. In the third quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares of common stock at a cost of $77 million bringing to 315 million our total share repurchase activity in the first nine months of the year. Our 2014 capital plan provides for the repurchase of up to an additional 273 million of common stock through March of 2015. With the final liquidity coverage rules having been issued in early September we believe Northern Trust is already above the 80% minimum required effective as of January 1, 2015 and is also above the 100% minimum requirement that will become effective of January 1, 2017. Let me close with a few thoughts on the positioning of Northern Trust. From a strategic perspective, the third quarter again demonstrated that we are competing successfully in our target markets. Noteworthy on that front was the on-boarding of Bridgewater Associates to our hedge fund servicing platform as well as recently announced deployments by Woodford Investment Management to provide a full suite of investment operations and outsourcing services and by five local government schemes in the United Kingdom to provide a range of global custody services. Our four inaugural FlexShares Exchange Traded Funds reached the important three-year milestone in the third quarter. FlexShares account to $8.5 billion making it the fastest growing ETF family for each of the past two years delivering thoughtfully designed products that meet the targeted investment objectives of personal clients. In August, Northern Trust celebrated its 125th anniversary, a testament that we continue to provide exceptional service expertise and advice to clients around the world. From a financial perspective we achieved strong growth of 11% in trusted investment fees and improved further the ratio of expenses to fees. Our return on equity was 10.1% in the quarter and we remain focused on consistently achieving returns in our target range. Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust third quarter earnings conference call today. Bev and I would be happy to answer your questions. Eric, please open the line. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions). And we'll take our first question from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Good afternoon everyone. Hi. How are you? So first question I guess on the operating leverage. If we go back to Slide 8 that you guys illustrated considerable progress in terms of how you're management expenses relative to the trust and investment services fees. Just curious to think about, if you guys were to think about markets flat over the last 12 months, where would that 108 be? And I guess, more importantly, if the broader equity markets backdrop as a bit more choppy from here, should we still count on that ratio coming down over the next 12 months? Biff Bowman : So I'm going to talk a little bit about. If you look at our assets under custody growth year-over-year, Alex, and -- I'm trying to guide here to the -- to this point is, about 60% of our growth in AUC year-over-year was driven by markets but 40% was driven by new business and other flows in that front. So we recognize the markets have a meaningful impact on that but that there is a meaningful piece of that that is moving up and the fees are moving up because of excellent new business growth in our businesses. The other thing I would say is, while the market has impacts on certain of our services, certain of our fund administration services, our global fund services business are driven by transaction volumes as much as they are driven in the fees associated with those, as much as they are driven by assets under custody or market level appreciation. So I think the combination is the market certainly has an impact and is important to us. But hopefully, that gives you some clue as to the new business was a meaningful portion of that improvement as well. Alex Blostein \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Got you. Yes. Sorry. I guess I was just trying to get you looking at the bit more importantly the operating leverage of that. And clearly, the expense growth should -- was below the growth in your servicing fees and management fees but that's partially because the servicing fees and management fees share point were growing due to market gains. Biff Bowman : Yes. Alex Blostein \u2013 Goldman Sachs : But I guess, are there leverage you could pull to continue to see the decline in the non-interest expense relative to your fees, if the markets don't go up from here? Biff Bowman : Yes. So we remained vigilant around our expense management. And there are obviously, levels. I would say I'd refer you to the second quarter where I think you saw one of the levers that we were able and did a decision, we did take around our staff levels and the 200 person charge, if you will. The charge we took in the second quarter is an example of one of those levels. But there are many other levels and the management team here remains committed to driving through expense initiatives on that front. I would also, if I could real quickly add around our efficiency and productivity initiatives. We\u2019ve taken on board a lot of key projects, one of which would be -- I'll give one small example, if I could. We had multiple vendors providing us with pricing services, literally dozens. We consolidated those down into a few number pricing vendors and that drove a meaningful savings for the institution. We have lots of those types of initiatives ongoing. Alex Blostein \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Got it. Understand. Thank you for that. And my second question was just around the overall kind of franchise exposure to the euro. You guys clearly have some presence there and I'm just trying to better understand if the euro continues to weaken against the dollar. What does it mean from the net profitability perspective for Northern, is it a headwind or tailwind or fairly neutral given how revenues expenses should go? Biff Bowman : So good question. If the dollar -- I want to put it in a couple of buckets, if I can here. Firstly, we got -- if I will say, balance sheet exposure. So money on our balance sheet that's in euros or client's money that's on our balance sheet in euros. We did like many of others in the financial industry on August 14, Bev, I believe. Bev Fleming : October. Biff Bowman : October. Excuse me, on October 14, we put in place a negative 20 basis point charge for the balance sheet, if you will, which was in-line with what the ECB had done earlier in September. So we pass on, if you will, some of the financial impacts from the balance sheet perspective. The other part though to consider is, we have a substantial amount of our assets under custodies you might imagine that are in euros. A strengthening dollar doesn't help us on that regard as you would suspect. It's not the largest currency. Our largest currencies inside of our AUC would be the dollar first obviously and the second would be the sterling, but the euro is the third largest in our AUC and we have a substantial amount of assets, non-dollar denominated assets in our mix. So it will have some impact their on the AUC. Alex Blostein \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Got it. But from a pre-tax dollar perspective, is it -- do the expenses kind of offset that or it's in that kind of headwind it goes to, to pre-tax income? Biff Bowman : Sure. Bev Fleming : And Alex, on the -- from the income statement perspective, we actually hedge the net. So we do have revenue impacts, we do have expense impacts from the dollar and we hedge the net. We have significant natural hedge, if you will, because we earn revenues in multiple currencies. We also pay expenses in multiple currencies, so we have somewhat of a natural hedge. But then, we hedge the difference to pre-tax. So the impact from a bottom-line perspective is actually very modest. Alex Blostein \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Yeah. Got it. Yeah. That's what I was trying to get it. Thank you so much again. Operator : Our next question is from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank : Hi. If I can start with a question on the asset servicing business and I'm just trying to think of obviously, the Bridgewater was one of your largest mandates and E&A is somewhat of new type of arrangement for you. Bev, can you talk a little bit about how you view margins on those types of mandates versus your existing -- your current book of business in asset servicing and then the growth opportunities of that? In other words, as you are building that business, do you start out with lower margins with the hope of adding more clients to that particular platform? Biff Bowman : Yes. So I'll tackle that in a couple ways here. So I think the first is in the case of Bridgewater, they take a variety of different services that we provide, which include as we described it sort of the shadow fund accounting process that we would do, and I would say a variety of other middle office type products and services. Each of those has a different type of basis point fee or margin associated with it that the market dictates. So the combination of that for any one client like that would be a blend of whatever those are. So in the case of -- in the case of Bridgewater, I would only say that they are profitable. And we continue to be pleased to have them on board and think we can leverage that platform for other clients. I think the second part of your question is that the implementation and the expenses associated with that implementation we feel are highly leverageable to other clients in this space. And in fact, we've begun dialogues with many on a similar path around that. So we definitely believe that they are the investment, the capital investment is highly leverageable to other clients. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank : Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just to share on a sort of a go forward basis. We appreciate that obviously there is a long time range to this. But has the Bridgewater mandate -- and maybe in combination with Omnium acquisition dramatically changed your ability to tap that -- the alternative ends of the market to the extent that you think over the next two to three years you will be investing fairly heavily in growing that business versus the rest of your servicing business. And maybe just quickly, also relative to your -- touch on the investment in the wealth management business as it relates to for persons (inaudible)? Biff Bowman : I\u2019m going to answer the first two. I may need a little help on the second part of your question around the well. But the -- I think the first part was, do we think this will enable us to win other business? And I would say the credibility that having the largest hedge fund as a client has absolutely helped us. But I would add to that that the strength of the Omnium platform now Northern Trust Hedge Fund Services, the actual technology what we have there has also added credibility for us to be able to talk across the market. So I would also highlight one thing. I think people think of it only in the alternative space where it would largely be used and we think only traditionally of asset managers. But there are a lot of client's interest in this that are sovereign wealth funds, large foundations and endowments who have large pools of alternative investments within their portfolios and the technology around this has been a very attractive entr\u00e9e into some of those businesses. So I think it has as boarder opportunity set than just asset managers. So that was the answer for the first part. And then, you -- the second part around wealth management, I didn't quite pickup. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank : Yeah. That -- sorry, but I didn't ask (inaudible) really. What I was getting at with the wealth management side was, as you think about investing in the asset servicing business, how do you think -- I guess the question is, does that sort of distract you from investing more aggressively on the wealth management side or do you feel that your investment over the next two to three years in both of this businesses can remain fairly consistent with each other? Biff Bowman : Sure. We absolutely believe that we have the ability to invest in both businesses and we've talked about the mega market strategies in the past and other strategies here. So we absolutely think we can invest in both. Right now, we have to be disciplined about that, but we absolutely believe we can. And I would also highlight that some of these capabilities that we talked about in GFS translate into the very high-end of our wealth business setting with the global family office. So the ability to deal with complex alternative investments as you might suspect for families of -- at the highest end of our network spectrum that capability is very attractive there. So I see a lot of synergy and leverage, if I can in that investment across multiple businesses. Operator : We'll take the next question from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: Thanks. Hi Biff, how are you? Just a follow-up on expenses, the 200 FTE savings, you had talked about this little last quarter. But can you help us understand how much of that benefit? I think it was $25 million, was in this quarter's run rate and how you expected to lead in over time? Biff Bowman : Yes. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: Or when did you expected to get to a run rate? Biff Bowman : Yes. I would say this. We are on track to achieve the $25 million goal amount in the second quarter. I think Mike said last quarter that the savings would be modest in 2014, which really is the majority in the fourth quarter. And then, we'll see a ramp in 2015. I think we expect to achieve about 80% to 90% of that $25 million by year end 2015. I can tell you that we've begun that process in Q3 of moving through the 200, so -- but it will be a very, very modest impact in 2014. But you should expect to see about 80% to 90% of that $25 million by year-end 2015. And we'll achieve the full run rate entering 2016. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: Okay. And then, if I could ask you to extend a little bit more just on the -- into workings of the FX business. And obviously, I heard your points about volatility being flat. But can you just help us understand may be how the quarter progressed? I think you did say higher volumes but obviously, volatility was only average, flat on average and third quarter is typically a little seasonally soft. But I think relative to expectations and relative to the industry proxy it would have seen like the business should have done a little bit better. So was it mix, was it electronics? May be just you can flush that out for us, it would be great. Thank you. Biff Bowman : Okay. Thank you. So I will say this, the -- as a sequential quarter we were down, while I would say volatility was probably flatter. The first thing we think about in that is this, we look at our actual the notional amount traded to our clients and I don't know what others clients looks like, but we can look at our clients and look at the notional amount traded through our clients. And that was down modestly for us, so that's one factor and we do think about that. It depends on if our clients were trading in emerging market currencies, which were down and the volatility was lower there than it wasn't some other. So there is a couple factors that can help drive that number a little bit lower than what we would have seen given the volatility in that space. So I think that's one area you touched on I would say this. We continue to invest in this business with our client guidance around the types of ecommerce and needs that they have to enter this market and it\u2019s a meaningful commitment in both talent and capital to continue to improve and to continue to grow this source of revenue very important source of revenue for the bank. So I think it\u2019s a combination of those things, others may have if you look back, we looked back 22 quarters just as a fact and if you look versus peers our peers we take turns having better FX performance in any given quarter. So I think it has to do somewhat with our client mix and their action they took in any given quarter. And the third thing I would add is you are right there is some seasonality traditionally for us we see about a 12% to 15% decline sequentially which was what we saw this quarter. Operator : The next question is from Ashley Serrao of Credit Suisse. Ashley Serrao - Credit Suisse : Hi I had a two part question on capital. So how are you thinking about a capital structure today? Do you intend to issue more preferred and build up to that 1.5% of RWA? And the second part is how are you thinking about capital buffers to require minimum specifically I was interested on some color around if Tarullo succeeds in forcing your larger peers to hold higher capital cushions, are you looking to match them or really use that as a advantage and run at lower levels? Biff Bowman : Let me take the second part of that question first if I can so I don\u2019t, Bev write down the first part so I don\u2019t forget it, thank you. But on the capital buffers issues we currently today with guidance from our board and all of our governance committees place a premium on making sure we\u2019re well buffered if I can say that with our capital position and you can see that through our capital ratios as we describe. If, in our business if you think about that we\u2019re a gatherer of assets, we need to look somewhat similar to our closest peers particularly in the corporate intuitional side but also in the wealth side in terms of safety and soundness and stability. And so that probably means that our ratios need mere or be as close to theirs that is reasonably prudent for us as a financial institution. So you\u2019re right we may not be governed at the same level as a GSIP but we do believe that we may very well have to act and have buffers and others in place similar to that so that we have a competitive at least a quality when we go to the market. That is though, Ashley, if I can say this that is still playing out a little bit as we look at this. A good example might be around supplementary leverage ratio for instance that you cite and then whether that's not a buffer but there is a different standard for banks of different sizes. So we continue to play with that that\u2019s probably a long way around for we continue to look at this but we think we've probably largely have to stay in line with our peers. And the first part of the question was around our capital structure I believe and if we would contemplate more on the preferred side. So the answer is right. Today, your question is right in the sense of we did the $400 million in August it gave us an opportunity to add to our tier one capital where we had faced in approach we would have gone to zero the trust preferred phase out and so we effectively had none. So we were effectively covering what I will call the first two levels of our capital ratios with all common, that's a fairly expensive solution. I think we will continue to look at that mix on a regular basis to understand if there isn\u2019t more opportunity in the trust preferred to help as you say get to that 1.5% additional cushion over the common equity tier one ratio. I think we got a pretty good thought process around that now from our capital planning and we\u2019ll continue to look at that. Operator : The next question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Hi how are you there? So a couple of questions one, just on the last subject I mean is there a I would think there should be an opportunity to reduce common as a percentage of total RWA through this process with buybacks over time is that a fair assumption? Biff Bowman : Yes I think the \u2013 we\u2019re going to perceive it with our capital plan if I can, our capital plan actions that you\u2019ve seen and I would like this it\u2019s our intend to continue to take the actions that we described in our capital plan and you are well aware of it over time. In terms of the reducing common or the shares I think you\u2019re asking if the share is outstanding issues is what, is that you\u2019re trying to talk about in the capital fact -- Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Yes, right. With common as a percentage of RWA, the contribution of common to RWA shrink over time as you are accelerating buybacks given the pref, I think because we all kind of came to this with you have enough cushion over the minimum, why do you need pref, so the pref makes sense if you are able to reduce the common. Biff Bowman : Yes, so again I refer back to the capital plan and we think that, yes, we think executing on or our intent to execute on the capital plan should help us with that. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley Okay, got it. Just wanted to clarify. And then secondly, just on the fact that you need to charge clients for the 20 basis points in the euro zone given what the ECB is charging you to leave cash with the ECB, just trying to understand what kind of behavior activity you\u2019ve seeing there? I would think it would mean that you have clients moving if they could from euros into other currencies. I\u2019m wondering what else they could potentially do to offset that? Could they bring you more business to offset incremental fees or it\u2019s more of a one size fits all everybody gets a 20 bps if you\u2019re leaving euros with you? Biff Bowman : Yes, so good question so, I would say we are working with our clients to look at what their alternatives are in that space because as you might imagine some care about that rate. So there are money funds, there are suite vehicles, there are other services and capabilities where that we could help guide them some of those are our products, some of those are products elsewhere in the market but we are working with them. To-date, we have seen a I think \u2013 I\u2019d say relatively modest decline but in the 15% to 20% range in just our euro based deposit. It\u2019s not a large part of our deposit base, its sub 10% of our deposits are in euro, our total on our foreign office but our total deposit so it\u2019s not a big but we've seen a modest run off in most, we think is really there to support business activities. And so it\u2019s there and its sticky. Operator : The next question is from Brennan Hawken of UBS. Brennan Hawken - UBS: Hey how are you doing, Biff? Quick one on expenses. And it\u2019s somewhat of a follow-up to what we've heard before. So is there any way you could give some color or clarity on whether or not we saw some uplift this quarter from expenses that might prove transient, specifically elevated regulatory, expenses and maybe the amortization from on-boarding expenses on Bridgewater that might have been capitalized? Biff Bowman : So let me walk up through what potentially is transient I will just say nothing else moves around. So I got to start with we have what we refer to as cost of servicing clients. That number is, it moves around; it was very modest in the first and second quarters of this year. It was back to what I would say a more normalized level over a long period of time but that is a number that can move quite meaningfully in any given quarter. I would say our healthcare expense in this quarter as it relates to healthcare claims we looked back at about three years worth quarterly claims history was at a high. We don\u2019t have an ability to project if that will continue or if that was just we had a tough quarter from a healthcare claim perspective that was a fairly a meaty number. As it relates to the regulatory part of your question, I would say this. The rate of growth of our regulatory expenses has slowed. But I wouldn\u2019t say that the overall regulatory expenses have grown -- slowed excuse me or gone down from the levels you\u2019ve seen. So the pace of growth has slowed but there is still some growth in that and there are round things like we\u2019re in our second round of the CCAR for Northern Trust and there is work we have to do around that there is resolution planning etcetera that we have to deal with on that. So there are some expenses in there that I would consider volatile from a quarter-to-quarter basis. Brennan Hawken - UBS: Great. I guess no impact from increased amortization on on-boarding expenses as far as Bridgewater goes? Biff Bowman : There was some in the quarter. I would say the others have a chance to be at least that volatile is not more in terms of that. That number probably won\u2019t be as volatile as well over time because we know what the amortization is so and it\u2019s the other side of it you can move in bigger increments generally than that number would. Brennan Hawken - UBS: Yes, I guess I was just saying it wouldn\u2019t volatile versus last quarter when it was... Biff Bowman : Yes, it would have been volatile versus that, I would have been more than the quarter before. Brennan Hawken - UBS: All right, fair enough. Cool. And then for my second one, given some of the pressure that large global competitors are under from a capital perspective, is it your sense that the certain global custody assets come up for sale? And if they do, is that something that Northern Trust would be interested in expanding on towards that side of the business, on the institutional and trust side as opposed to the wealth management side is there, do you guys have a preference as far as that goes? Biff Bowman : So I would say this around any acquisition. I would describe this is opportunistic and if that opportunity provides us with a geography or a product or a capability or a technology that we don\u2019t have we\u2019re opportunistic in that. We have not traditionally just bought businesses to ramp up scale in a market where we already have scale. I won\u2019t put an absolute on that but that has generally not in the philosophy firm, it has been to address one of those first sort of four factors that I talked about. Operator : The next question is from Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks. Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks : Hey, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to look at the other fees. You had talked about lower security commissions as well as currency related hedging. The number dropped to kind of the low level it has been at over the last year. I was curious what kind of noise or what would be expected in there? Biff Bowman : Yes, so I\u2019ll address one on the securities commission and then I may let Bev take the foreign exchange currency part. One example would be what we would recall banking referral fees but our bankers well often because we\u2019re not an investment bank we\u2019ll partner with some other investment banks and we refer we\u2019re in a credit we refer deals to them to do some of the underwriting. We get referral fees for that. They were significantly down quarter-over-quarter. And the second is in our wealth business a lot of the times we will actually look at interest rate swaps and talk to our clients about interest rate swap options that they may have in their portfolios. The volumes in that were down substantially from Q2 to Q3. So those two items I\u2019d say have some volatility to them in any given quarter, it depends on how many, how much the deal flows in those two quarters that drove those two, and Bev I\u2019ll... Bev Fleming : Sure. Marty I think your other question has to do with the decline with the decline and other operating income, is that correct? Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks That\u2019s right, with the currency-related hedging, they talk about the hedging and they are in the press release. Bev Fleming : Yes, there were actually three different drivers to that particular figure. I mean first of all we did have leasing income lower in the quarter we did have a small lease gain recorded in the second quarter, and so when you do that quarter-on-quarter comparison it has an impact. We did see lower service charges related to some aspects of our banking business credit related service charges like commercial loan fees, letter of credit fees, commitment fees and like so that was down as well. And then the third one would be what you\u2019re pointing out which was one of the drivers listed which would be currency related hedging activity. As I mentioned earlier we do net hedges on our income statement and there was a modest impact from the asset was a drag on this particular line item. We also hedged the balance sheet back to functional currencies and that had a modest drag as well. So we really had kind of three or four different items that together contributed to that sequential quarter decline. Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks : And then my follow-up question in relation to that is, not to be specific but just in general, it seems like the core underlying trust custody asset management fees and expenses all moved in the right direction. There did seem to be several unusual expenses, other kind of areas and ancillary fees that were weaker than really kind of maybe took away a penny or two this quarter relative to what you might've expected. Biff Bowman : Yes, our view I think our view would be aligned with that the core underlying business performed well and the core trust fees and the core expense management was strong and that some of the ancillary or other forms of income had some volatility in the quarter and we feel pretty good about the core underlying performance of the business. We feel very good about that. Operator : And the next question is from Mike Mayo with CLSA. Mike Mayo - CLSA: Hi, first just a clarification on the preferred stock. So I guess what we are trying to figure out, should we be lowering our numbers for the $0.10 hit to the new preferred stock, or should we assume that gets offset with buybacks? Bev Fleming : Well you definitely should be incorporating again to your fourth quarter model the preferred stock dividend which was declared by our board yesterday and I would repeat what Biff said in his prepared remarks that this quarter will be -- fourth quarter will be a little bit unusual and that we would have five months instead of the normal three. The figure that's provided was $9.5 million in the fourth quarter. With respect to repurchases of common we\u2019re continuing to proceed under the capital plan that was not objected to by the fed so you\u2019ve seen what\u2019s remaining and we will continue to action on that for the next two quarters. Mike Mayo - CLSA: All right, great. Separately, Biff since this is your first public forum and you are new as CFO, can you talk about conceptually how you might want to change the balance, if at all between the customers, the employees and the shareholders? In other words, when you think about allocating expenses and resources among those three groups, do you think one needs to be favored a little bit more than it\u2019s been in the past? And I guess the customers, you guys win all sorts of awards especially for the private bank, employees this quarter you said the comp is up 8% year-over-year and then shareholders a great 10-year record but lousy five year record. So, how do you think about the balance among those kind of three constituencies? Biff Bowman : Thanks, Mike. Well I think they\u2019re all very important how is that is that a good hedge as the new CFO. I think they\u2019re all vital but I will say this I would that the firm not this isn\u2019t just me this is the firm it\u2019s focused on a key word here is profitable growth. So we do know that we need to be profitable and grow, and not just grow. And so the focus on profitable growth the focus and rigour around the return on equity range that we've given to you and to the shareholders of 10 to 15. We want to continue to move into that range on a regular basis. I believe this is our second quarter in a row and that so there is no decoration of victory and we need to continue to move. Higher in to that range with the thing so we can control and if we get external help it will help lever it other way up. But to your point I would say this all three of those matter a lot and in my role that focus on the shareholder is paramount to my day to day job and its where my focus and attention is on a regular basis right now. Operator : And we\u2019ll take the next question from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research : Good afternoon. Most of my questions have been asked, but one that we haven\u2019t discussed is can you talk about the new business wins in the pipeline, how you are seeing that develop and if there\u2019s been any kind of improvement or is it still strong? Just some color would be great whether it\u2019s across wealth management or institutional? Biff Bowman : Sure. So I can say really across all of our businesses across all of our geographies and across all of our products it was a very successful third quarter. I\u2019ll start with the C&IS business if I could. I think they had one of the if not their very best quarters; I'm looking at that if I'm allowed to say that, but I think that they had one of their very best quarters that we have seen from a new business and probably as important is that is the strength of the pipeline behind it. As you might imagine that pipeline is really a cross product it\u2019s not just our global fund services business servicing asset managers. Its broad based with sovereign wealth fund, its broad based with foundations endowments, healthcare, corporate institution and pensions and its very broad based across geographies probably about as diversified as I\u2019ve seen it from a geographical perspective. So I think that's the strength. Similarly in the wealth management space another strong new business quarter I think that that\u2019s borne out in the fees, in the fee growth that you\u2019ve seen particular success in our west region this year. I know we published in our regional reports. They continue to have good momentum but it was really good across all geographies. So we feel really pretty positive on the new business momentum and I would highlight here perhaps if I could briefly with the leadership changes that we've just gone through now that momentum is being amped up by each of the new business unit presidents and they\u2019re as whether out meeting with their clients and helping with the pipeline and developing the pipeline I believe. Steve Fradkin is out today in at North East helping them continue to build the product line there. Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research : Well just maybe a follow-up on the institutional side. It seems like you have had a bit of an uptick in the growth rate just trying to get it\u2019s pretty competitive. What do you think has been driving your uptick in the pipeline? And I think when we look at some of your peers it has been (technical difficulty) Biff Bowman : I would answer that by saying I think there is a couple of key factors I think one is we've got some technological advantage particularly in the global fund services space. We got some technological advantage that we\u2019re trying to lever and use at this point and as I think I described earlier its leverageable beyond just asset managers; it resonates with anybody who has large alternative asset portfolios in their mix. So I think that that is one of the prime factors that we have. And I just think our product quality continues to be strong and its being well received in the market. So I think but there is some technological strength right now for us particularly in the space I described around the Northern Trust Hedge Fund Services, etc. The other thing is we have some geographies where we've had some success we've had tremendous growth rate in Australia. So our product and reputation and our quality there I think is allowing us to pick up some meaningful market share it\u2019s not just there but it\u2019s one example of a meaningful market move for us. Operator : And the final question today is from Jeffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Jeffrey Elliott \u2013 Autonomous Research : Hello there. On the money market fee waivers, how do you think about the trajectory of recapturing those, if rates eventually start to move up? Biff Bowman : Yes. Thanks Jeffery. So I think we have said, (inaudible) I go up with -- I think we've said that as a 50 basis point move, all things being equal, that we would recapture a meaningful portion if not all of those fee waivers. But I want to put a little bit more color to that. That assumes that we are in the exact same competitive environment and that coming out of this low of an interest rate environment over this length of period of time, I would be hesitant to say that I know what the competitive environment for that will look like. So our partners in Northern Trust Asset Management are clearly looking on a regular basis to understand what the impacts will need to be on what they charge on those funds over time and they will consistently look at that end. They may look at different fee structures to be competitive coming out of a very, very low rate environment. That could have an impact on our fee waivers. And as we get more color on that over time, we'll try to give that color to you. But at this point in time, we do think there probably will be some competitive pressures to be candid, but we still think we should cover meaningful portion of those fees with a 50 basis point rise. Jeffrey Elliott \u2013 Autonomous Research : When you talk about competitive pressures what you\u2019re getting out there is any chance of the competition there will go into keep the fee waiver in place little bit longer (inaudible) slowly in order to try to capture more volume, is that (inaudible) up? Biff Bowman : Yes. I think what we're -- like I said, coming out of a low and long environment and I don't know how low and long it will remain. But I think everyone has gotten used to very low fees or waived fees in their funds and we're just not sure how the markets will react from pricing their own funds. That being said, you also have money market reform in place, which could help firms think about their pricing on those models. So I think there is a whole confluence of events quite frankly that could have the revisitation of pricing in that space. And the last thing you said, which I think is also right is, there could be pricing in the marketplace to gather assets. People could want to go because you may have certain firms and competitors that decide not to be in the space after reform and others may aggressively price whereas to gather assets in the cash. So the confluence of those three I think could actually lead to the need to look at the pricing in the funds for all competitors. But I'm not sure how that will play out to be candid. Operator : This concludes today's question and answer session. Ms. Fleming, at this time, I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. Bev Fleming : Thank you, Eric, and thank you to everybody who joined us today. We look forward to speaking with you in January when we release our fourth quarter and full-year results. If you have any follow-up questions, please don't hesitate calling. Thank you so much. Have a good day. Biff Bowman : Thanks. Operator : This concludes today's call.

Let me turn the call over to Biff Bowman. Biff Bowman : Good morning, everyone, and let me join Bev in welcoming you to Northern Trust earnings conference call. As is our customary practice, today I will review our results for the quarter after which Bev and I would be happy to answer your questions. Starting on Page 2, this morning we reported fourth quarter net income of $244 million and earnings per share of $0.98. Our provision for income taxes in the quarter included a 9.5 million benefit related to our decision to reinvest the earnings of a foreign subsidiary and definitely outside the U.S. This decision under APB opinion number 23 reflects the continued growth and success of our business outside United States and is consistent with other similar assertions made in the past. Excluding the income tax benefit earnings per share were $0.94 in the fourth quarter and our return on equity was 11%. Environmental factors which impact our businesses and our clients were mixed in the fourth quarter. A theme which is been ongoing for some time, U.S equity markets was higher at the end of the fourth quarter both year-over-year and sequentially with the S&P 500 up 11% and 4% respectively. International equities as measured MSCI EAFE Index however were down approximately 7% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. With the decline in both comparisons primarily reflecting a stronger U.S. dollar. In bond markets, the Barclays U.S. aggregate index was up 3% year-over-year but down 1% sequentially. Client assets under custody ended the quarter at $6 trillion, up 7% over last year, and assets under management ended at $934 billion, up 6%. On a sequential basis, client custody and managed assets both increased 1%. I\u2019ll provide further details on asset trends later in this call. Currency markets had multiple impacts this quarter. Currency volatility as measured by the G7 index was 4% lower than the fourth quarter of last year. Sequentially, the G7 index was 37% higher increasing in each month since hitting an all-time low in the month of July. Currency volatility influences our foreign exchange trading income as does the level of client activity. Currency rates, which influence the translation of non U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar impact client assets and revenues and expenses. The dollar was stronger both year-over-year and sequentially. Dollar strength tempered custody asset growth and related fee growth, but benefited expense growth. Short-term interest rates rose slightly compared with the third quarter yet remained at very low levels, continuing to pressure our net interest margin and resulting in fee waivers on our money market mutual funds. Three month LIBOR and the fed funds effective rate both increased 1 basis point sequentially to 24 and 10 basis points respectively and the overnight repo rate increased 6 basis points to 14 basis points. With those comments providing context on the environment, let\u2019s move to Page 3 and discuss the financial highlights of the fourth quarter. Year-over-year revenue increased 8% with non-interest income up 9% and net interest income up 5%. Expenses adjusted for litigation settlement charge taken in the fourth quarter of last year increased 1%, primarily reflecting higher compensation and equipment software. We\u2019ve recorded a loan loss provision in the quarter of 3 million primarily reflecting loan growth as credit quality continued to improve. Reported net income was 44% higher year-over-year. Excluding this quarter\u2019s income tax benefit and last year\u2019s legal settlement charge, net income was 29% higher. Compared to last quarter revenue increased 5% with non-interest income up 4% and net interest income up 6%. Expenses increased 1% due primarily to higher compensation, equipment software, occupancy and other operating expenses offset partially by lower employee benefit expense. Reported net income increased 19% sequentially; excluding this quarter\u2019s income tax benefit net income was 15% higher. Let\u2019s look at the results on Page 4 on greater detail starting with revenue. Fourth quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was approximately 1.1 billion up 8% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. Trust, investment and other servicing fees the largest component of revenue were $728 million in the quarter up 8% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Fees in our corporate and institutional services business increased 10% year-over-year and 2% sequentially while fees and our wealth management business grew 5% year-over-year and were unchanged sequentially. Higher equity markets and new business were both drivers of growth with higher money market, mutual fund, fee waivers partially offsetting in the year over year comparison. In addition currency translation as I mentioned earlier detracted from overall fee growth by approximately 1 percentage point in both comparisons. Fee waivers were approximately 33 million in the fourth quarter, 2 million higher versus last year and 1 million lower sequentially. The higher waivers year-over-year were primarily due to the growth shield of the funds declining but approximately 1 basis point on average. In the sequential comparison, the slight reduction in waivers was primarily due to higher gross yields. I\u2019ll go into further detail on trust and investment fees shortly. Foreign exchange, trading income was $61 million in the fourth quarter up 19% year-over-year and 31% sequentially. Currency volatility was higher in the fourth quarter, steadily trending up from an all-time low in July. Client trading volumes were modestly higher both year-over-year and sequentially. Other non-interest income was $77 million in the fourth quarter up 9% from last year and up 19% sequentially. Within other non-interest income securities commission and trading income was a record $21 million up over 40% both year-over-year and sequentially. Core brokerage particularly in equities and transition management were both higher in the quarter but the primary driver was higher income associated with interest rate protection products in support of our personal clients. This business is directly tied to wealth management, client, loan demand which were strong in the quarter as well as our clients preference to lock in a fixed rate solution in this low rate environment. The number and size of interest rate swap transactions grew significantly in the fourth quarter driving the increase of securities commission and trading income. Other operating income of 41 million in the quarter increased 8% year-over-year and 21% sequentially. The increase primarily reflects higher income associated with the third party servicing agreement which was modified in December. About half of the sequential increase of $7 million reflects the third quarter impact of the modified agreement. Net interest income which I will also discuss in more detail later was $271 million in the fourth quarter, up 5% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. With that backdrop, let\u2019s look at the components of our fee revenues on Page 5. For our corporate and instructional services business, fees totaled $409 million in the fourth quarter up 10% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Custody and fund administration fees the largest component of C&IS fees were $282 million in the fourth quarter, up 12% year-over-year and up 2% sequentially. Assets under custody for C&IS clients were $5.5 trillion at year end up 7% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Growth in fees and assets primarily reflects new business and market conditions including higher equity and bond markets offset partially by the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. Investment management fees in C&IS of $78 million in the fourth quarter were up 4% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Assets under management for C&IS clients were $710 billion up 7% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. The year-over-year increase in C&IS assets under management was due to higher equity and fixed income markets, new business and higher security funding collateral. In the sequential quarter comparison, higher U.S. equity and fixed income markets and new business were partially offset by lower securities lending collateral and the impact of the stronger dollar on international equities. C&IS investment management fee growth was reduced in the year-over-year comparison by higher waivers on institutional money market mutual funds. Waivers impacting C&IS fees equals $17 million in the fourth quarter, $2 million higher year-over-year, primarily reflecting the lower gross yields achieved in the underlying funds that I previously mentioned. Waivers impacting C&IS fees were essentially flat sequentially. Securities lending fees were $22 million in the fourth quarter unchanged versus last year and down 2% sequentially. Year-over-year results reflect higher collateral levels essentially offset by lower spreads in most asset classes. The sequential quarter decline reflects lower collateral levels with the largest decrease seen in U.S. treasuries offset by higher spreads. Securities lending collateral was $116 billion at year end up 14% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially. On an average daily basis, the sequential quarter decline was 1% as the change in period end collateral was more pronounced due to client and borrower decisions around year end positioning. Other fees and C&IS were $28 million in the fourth quarter up 23% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects investment risk and analytical services while the sequential quarter increase primarily reflects higher revenue for the benefit payment services.  Moving to our wealth management business, trust, investment and other servicing fees were $319 million in the fourth quarter up 5% year-over-year reflecting higher equity markets and new business. Wealth management fees were unchanged sequentially. Assets under management for wealth management clients were $225 billion at quarter end up 1% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. We call that earlier in 2014 we transferred $7.6 billion in assets under management from wealth management to C&IS. Absent that transfer, wealth management assets under management would have increased about 5% year-over-year. Money market mutual fund waivers in wealth management totaled $16 million in the current quarter, flat compared with last year and down just less than $1 million compared to last quarter. Moving to page 6, net interest income was $271 million in the fourth quarter up 5% year-over-year and up 6% compared to the third quarter. The increase in net interest income was driven by a larger balance sheet as client deposits average $87 billion in the quarter up 9% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Partially offsetting the impact of a larger balance sheet in the year-over-year comparison was a lower net interest margin, which at 1.08% in the fourth quarter was down 4 basis points year-over-year. In the sequential comparison, the larger balance sheet and a 3 basis points increase in the net interest margin drove higher net interest income. The yield on the securities portfolio increased 14 basis points sequentially, about 7 basis points of the increase and yield was due to lower premium amortization and our mortgage back securities portfolio versus the prior quarter. Another 3 basis points of the higher yield was due to the call in the quarter of certain auction rate securities resolving and accelerated discount amortization. Other factors which drove the higher yield on the securities portfolio were maturities of lower yielding, floating rate agency securities, the purchase of longer duration U.S. treasuries and the purchase of higher yielding securities denominated in the Australian dollar. Loan balances average $31 billion in the fourth quarter up 9% or 2.5 billion year-over-year and up 4% or $1.1 billion sequentially. We saw solid loan growth this quarter across commercial and institutional, private client and commercial real estate, partially offset by a lower level of residential real estate loans. The yield on the loan portfolio however, decreased 11 basis points sequentially as average loan yields have dropped in commercial real estate, private client and residential real estate and growth in lower yielding categories have shifted the mix of the loan portfolio. Turning to page 7, expenses were $781 million in the fourth quarter down 2% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. When adjusted for last year's legal settlement charge expenses were up 1% year-over-year. Compensation expense increased 6% year-over-year primarily reflecting higher incentive compensation, staff growth and annual merit increases partially offset by the favorable impact of movement in currency rates. Staff levels increased approximately 4% year-over-year with about 70% of 2014 staff growth emanating from our global operating centers in Bangalore, Manila and Limerick. On a sequential basis compensation expense increased 2% led by higher incentive compensation and staff growth was 1%.  Employee benefit expense declined 6% year-over-year primarily driven by lower pension and employee medical expense partially offset by higher payroll tax expense. On a sequential quarter basis, employee benefit expense decreased 11% primarily due to lower medical expense. Recall that employee medical experience which can be uneven from quarter-to-quarter was elevated in the third quarter.  In 2014, pension experience was approximately $5 million lower each quarter versus 2013. In 2015, we expect pension plan experience to be approximately $4 million to $5 million higher each quarter versus 2014 in line with the 75 basis point decline in the discount rate, a 50 basis point decline in the planned rate of return assumption and changes in the mortality table. Thus we expect 2015 pension experience to approximate 2013 levels. Outside services expenses were down 6% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. The year-over-year decline reflects a lower level of expense in a number of categories including legal, technical services, consulting and sub-custodian. Equipment and software expense was up 5% year-over-year and 3% sequentially reflecting higher software amortization as we continue to invest to support client, improve efficiency and meet regulatory and compliance requirement. Other operating expense decrease 28% year-over-year. Excluding the prior year legal settlement charge other operating expense decrease 11% year-over-year primarily driven by lower business promotion and staff related expenses. In the sequential comparison other operating expense increased 3% primarily in business promotion which is typically higher in the fourth quarter than the seasonally slower third quarter and also typically seasonally higher in the first quarter due to Northern Trust Open. Turning to the full year, our results in 2014 are summarized on page 8. Net income was $812 million and earnings per share earnings per share were $3.32 both up 11% compared with 2013. We achieved a return on equity for the year of 10% better than 9.5% in 2013 and at the low end of our target range of 10% to 15%.  Full year revenue and experience trends are outlined on page 9. Trust investment and other servicing fees grew 9% in 2014. New business across segments and geographies and higher equity markets contributed to these results. Foreign exchange income was down 14% primarily reflecting lower currency volatility across the first three quarters of the year. Net interest income increased 7% primarily driven by 12% growth in earning assets as low short-term interest rates continued to pressure our net interest margin.  The net result was a 6% growth in overall revenue in 2014. Expenses were 5% higher in 2014 and 2013 reflecting investments in people and technology to support the growth of the business and risk management and compliance requirements.  Turning to page 10, a key focus has been on sustainably enhancing profitability and returns. This slide reflects the progress we've made in recent years to improve our expenses to fees, pretax margin and ultimately our return on equity. The ratio of expenses to trust and investment fees is a particularly important measure of our progress as it addresses what we can most directly control. Reducing this measure from 131% in 2011 to a 111% in 2014 has been a key contributor to the improvement in our return on equity from 8.6 to 10 across the same time period. Sustainable improvements to our operating model are critical to our financial performance. Our focus on profitable growth and productivity gains will allow the company to invest in future growth opportunities that will produce timely returns overtime. Turning to page 11, our capital ratios remain solid with common equity tier 1 ratios of 12.4 and 12.5 respectively calculated on a transition basis for both advanced and standardized. On a fully phased in basis our common equity tier 1 capital ratio under the advanced approach would be approximately 11.9% and under the standardize approach would be approximately 10.6%. All of these ratios are well above the fully phased-in requirements of 7% which includes the capital conservation buffer. The supplementary leverage ratio at both the corporation and bank is above 5% which exceeds the 3% requirement applicable to Northern Trust. As Northern Trust progresses through fully phased in Basel III implementation there could be additional enhancements to our models and further guidance from the regulators on the implementation of the final rule, which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final Basel III rules. We repurchase 2.5 billion shares of common stock at a cost of $165 million in the fourth quarter bringing to $481 million our total share repurchase activity in 2014. Our 2014 capital plan provides for the repurchases up to an additional 108 million of common stock through March of 2015. In October, our Board of Directors declare the quarterly dividend on the preferred stock issued in August.  As I mentioned during our third quarter call the initial preferred dividend payment reflected in our fourth quarter financials covers five months or $9.5 million. The quarterly preferred dividing going forward will equal $5.85 million. With respect to the liquidity coverage ratio Northern Trust is above the 80% minimum required effective as of January 1st 2015, and is also above the 100% minimum requirement that will become effective of January 1, 2017. In closing in 2014 we made progress on many fronts. Let me review just a few examples. From a geographic perspective we enhanced our client servicing presence by opening offices in South Korea and Malaysia. From a product and positioning perspective we successfully established new depository businesses in the Netherland, United Kingdom and Guernsey concluding implementation under the AIFMD regulation. In Wealth Management we remain best private bank in the United States for the sixth consecutive year by the financial times group. And we\u2019re particularly gratified the innovation our clients centered strategy and the quality of our staff are highlighted as key factors driving the award.  From a strategic and financial perspective, we sharpened our focus on profitable growth with the number of leadership changes that became effective on September 1st. Announced action is expected to produce annual ongoing savings of approximately $25 million once fully implemented and expanded our global operating footprint with the new processing center in Manila and the announcement of our new center in Arizona. We achieved growth of 9% interest and investment fees and improved further the ratio of expenses to fees.  Our return on equity was 10% in 2014 within our target range of 10% to 15% and we remain focused on continuing to improve profitability and returns overtime. Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust fourth quarter earnings conference call today. Bev and I would be happy to answer your questions. Rich please open the line. Operator : (Operator Instructions). And we'll take our first question from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : So operating leverage looked really great and I was just wondering if you could speak to how you're thinking about driving operating leverage, if we have a scenario where rates continue to come down at the long end of the curve? Do you have anything that you could do to pull forward some of the actions that you were outlining? Biff Bowman : We continue to execute expense initiative that we talked about in previous calls. We continue to focusing on the revenue side obviously if you think of operating leverage growing that top line that revenue provides the first part of that. And we believe that our focus around growing our trust fees and executing on our business strategies can allow us to continue to grow that even in a rate environment as you described with a flattening curve. So I\u2019ll talk about the fee part of the revenue in that, if you look at our balance sheet and how it\u2019s currently put together today which I would talk about - they can go a little longer than this is. If you looked at our construction of our balance sheet it is relatively short in duration. And this position to take advantage the short end of that curve moves up and the long end stays flat. And that is scenario that we do model and look at and consider. So I would say we\u2019re positioned well on that. Bev Fleming : Betsy, did you have a follow up question? Betsy Graseck : Sorry about that. So the follow-up question is just on the volatility that's in the marketplace. Not so much on the equity market, which is where I know your skew is more towards the equity market than the bond market, but you do have some business obviously in the bond market side. Could you just give us a sense of how the flash crashes that we're seeing in different parts of the market over the last few months, in October we had the Treasury and more recently the Swiss franc activity. How do you prepare for that? How does that impact you? Are you being asked to take on any balance sheet from your clients if other market participants are not willing to provide sufficient liquidity? And is there anything that you can talk to about how you're thinking of trying to enhance liquidity for clients? Biff Bowman : So let me focus in, I\u2019ll pick one example if I could, I\u2019ll talk about the announcement that the Swiss National Bank came out with, it\u2019s one example the flash crashes that you described. If you think about it from our perspective, other than the obvious move in the Swiss franc and the volatility surrounding that move, we really saw no negative impact and we don\u2019t expect when going forward. Much of our business like our foreign exchange business model is centered around our clients for whom we custody their global assets all around the world, so it\u2019s sort of business as usual if you will in support of that. And so these movements if you will have not created any undue stress other than there is volatility in the market on our client base. As you also know we have a conservative risk appetite, you can look at our bar, you can look at other public disclosures, another example for instance is on FX. We don\u2019t really warehouse large currency positions. So these types of volatilities I am just picking on foreign exchanges, one, really haven\u2019t lent them self to the volatility to our business performances perhaps other institutions. Betsy Graseck : Right. And your clients aren\u2019t necessarily asking you to take on additional roles beyond the custodian role that you have got right now. Biff Bowman : They\u2019re not. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Adam Beatty of Bank of America. Adam Beatty : Thank you, good morning. I'll ask my question and follow-up together as they both concern Asset and Wealth Management. Some of the Mutual Fund data that we can see indicate a decent flows through the quarter but somewhat weaker for Northern Trust than other firms in December. Just wondering if you saw similar trends on the Wealth Management side in separate accounts? And also what you're seeing on the corporate institutional side? And as my follow-up it was interesting that some of your wealth clients are were using interest rate swaps to try and lock in lower rates for longer was wondering if that was also affecting their behavior as investors whether they were going toward shorter maturity, fixed income funds or what have you? Thanks very much. Biff Bowman : First let me talk a little bit if I could about the AUM and AUC growth which I think you talked about or the AUM growth specifically. On the wealth side first of all the performance when you look at markets being up, that was a U.S. phenomenon and if you look at the MSCI EAFE index, that actually declined 4% or so. And our wealth clients are typically invested globally. So it would have had an impact if you will both a positive and net which help drive what I would call some of the lower sequential growth that you\u2019ve seen in our wealth management business. I would also highlight that we did see some movement into cash in our wealth management space, we saw some meaningful that may address part of your question Adam about did we see any different behaviors with the volatility of the market. We did see some movement into cash in our movements so we didn\u2019t get some of the equity pick up that you may have thought about in those businesses. In terms of the swap portion of question, if you think about our loan volume growth that you saw sequentially the 4%, that has largely come to our wealth management clients who have asked for that and in this interest rate environment they have asked for ways to covert the floating into fix. So we think that some of that revenue was just part of a client solution in not only providing the financing for these individuals but also being able to provide the interest rate protection as a part of that solution. So I think ultimately your question was that is it behavior change? I think they\u2019re certainly looking and coming up with their own conclusions about the rate environments and making decisions based on that. Adam Beatty : Just to clarify, as fund investors, are they sort of shying away from longer government funds or high yield funds and going towards shorter maturity type funds? Or have we seen that? Biff Bowman : So our mutual fund flow, we saw increases in our mutual fund flow, summing in the cash. I would say probably the trend I would high light would be that that we have seen in our wealth space, I think this is a macro trend is a movement from active to more passive type products in that. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks. Marty Mosby : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask a little bit about the ability to close out the last round of the efficiency target you have on getting the operating expenses equal with your Custody in Core revenues. You've gone down to about only 7% gap between those but do you see kind of what the time frame being able to get that to 100? Biff Bowman : So I would start with saying, I don\u2019t know we\u2019ve publically said that the 100 is goal because while we\u2019re trying to continue to drive it down, I don\u2019t know that 100 will be the place we want to stop. But let me give you some color? First if I look at our wealth management business, they actually are at a 100% in the wealth management franchise. Our corporate and institutional services business where we have very high growth as you saw in the earnings, it\u2019s slightly higher than that but it\u2019s reducing that significantly as we utilize locations like Mondella, Limerick and Bangalore to help lower the cost if you will and the cost ratio there. We continue to progress on that and continue to execute on all of the expense initiatives and cost initiatives items that we talked about in the past like our location strategy, our technology strategy on minimizing storage or our asset service, our asset pricing where we\u2019ve consolidated asset pricing vendors, all of those continue and we think we can continue to move forward. Marty Mosby : Follow-up question was on the loan growth, you've all been around the $28 billion to $29 billion range for a while and now through this year you've really seen kind of a momentum pick up. What are the sources or catalysts for that acceleration in loan growth? Biff Bowman : Thanks, yes. Let me start by sharing some of the data you\u2019ll see when we publish our annual report. We\u2019ve had great success in our private client loans I think they\u2019re up 510 million or 7% commercial real estate has grown about 225 million and commercial and institutional is also increased really some across the board, the one area where I\u2019d say we haven\u2019t seen that growth is in residential real estate which is a conscious strategic decision for the bank. Our clients demand and need for assistance in those space picked up significantly in the second half of the year and particularly as you saw with the 4% sequential growth particularly in Q4. So those are kind of the pockets of where we\u2019ve seen that loan growth expand. Marty Mosby : And then you change in your philosophy or just customer demand for? Biff Bowman : There is not really a change in our philosophy I think we continue to want to serve the clients as their credit needs, as we continue I\u2019d say we\u2019ve grown things that we\u2019d call - secured that is its investment account secured and we\u2019ve gone more up market in our credit strategy that\u2019s why you see some pull back in the residential real estate and more in things such as premium finance, air craft lending and et cetera. Operator : Now we\u2019ll take our next question from Luke Montgomery of Bernstein Research. Luke Montgomery : Great, good morning, thank you. Well afternoon at this point. I believe you and the other trust banks recently agreed to share information with your custody clients about what they're paying for benchmark licensing and data that you use in performance measurement for them. So I wondered if you might anticipate any need to unbundle those costs from performance reporting fees or if you think there would be any pricing pressure as those costs become more transparent? Maybe it's just a question about whether you mark those up at all, I'm not sure. Bev Fleming : Luke that\u2019s something that we\u2019re really not familiar with to that level of detail I\u2019d happy to take it offline with you and help you out, we can talk directly on that at a later date. Luke Montgomery : Okay, so a little overly detailed, so maybe stepping back big picture, obviously this was a very encouraging result this quarter, fees were up in the face of negative FX impacts. FX fees are finally trending more like peers, you got a little NI growth, expenses seem well contained and the operating margin is above the illusive 30% aspiration you've discussed elsewhere. Core expenses to core trust fees are approaching 110%. So I think at the same time the quarter looks a little bit like an outlier so I just wanted to get your sense of whether you think this is a sort of run rate that's more or less sustainable and a step up related to core business initiatives? Or do you think there is an element of random lumpiness there really caused by the equity market in Q3 among other things? Biff Bowman : First, we believe that our business model and strategy are absolutely sustainable and geared around our business with great growth demographics whether we\u2019re serving the wealth of individuals or institutions. Secondly, we believe that the ability to execute on those strategies particularly around winning new clients, winning new mandates, increasing our productivity that you discussed are within our control and those are absolutely sustainable items such as markets and currency volatility and interest rate, they will continue to fluctuate and they provide some of the variability in there but we still believe with continued execution that there is sustainability in our momentum. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : Hi how are you guys? Wanted to dig into the [NII] dynamic in the quarter. And Biff you highlighted a couple of moving pieces just wanted to make sure I've got all the numbers right. So there was obviously a little bit help in NIM this quarter from lower premium amortization and a couple other things but all-in sounds like it was maybe like a 10 basis point help sequentially on the securities portfolio. Maybe like a one or two basis point on the NIM overall. Is it a fair assessment so like all else equal, NIM probably stays in the range over the next couple quarters until rates move hopefully in a positive direction towards the end of the year? Biff Bowman : Thanks Alex, yes. We would look at this if you have the stated NIM of 108 we think that there was probably 1 basis point premium amortization and 1 basis point we had an early call so auction rate preferred, so that 2 basis point type helped that you talked about it is absolutely in the range from a NIM. There were other actions as you see across many of the earning assets that moved them most of those were conscious actions that we take in the regular management of our portfolio. Alex Blostein : Got it. And on the funding side of things again numbers are getting quite small but if you look at I guess your funding cost did come down again a little bit over the course of the quarter I think a 1 basis point or 2 basis points. More of what primarily gets behind that is there more room to go because it doesn't seem like we've seen a kind of corresponding headwind on bank deposits, if you guys could help on the asset side of the balance sheet? Bev Fleming : Alex I can give you a few data points there across a couple of the funding categories savings which you think as another time that might be the one you are talking about was down about 2 basis points, we saw lower CD rates across basically all tenors but the ultra short category. You saw the cost of non-U.S office interfering go down about 3 basis points. Recall that we had a change in deposit pricing on Euro deposits, so that was obviously a factor there as well as some less favorable FX swap arbitrage activity. And then long-term debt was down as well, we had a September maturity of FHLB advance and had the full quarter impact of that.  So again as Biff said kind of a lot of things just in the normal course if you will that led to both the asset side and funding side moving in aggression as he described. Alex Blostein : Got it, that's helpful, thank you. And then a quick follow-up just on the core business. C&IS like we have seen for the last couple of years continues to do quite well. It still sounds to me like a big driver there is the administration business but we don't obviously see the assets that correspond to that. Any sense you guys can break out how much of the growth this quarter was due to kind of some of the new funding administration initiatives versus kind of the more core custody business? Bev Fleming : Alex we don't have that breakdown for you this quarter but in 2015 we're looking at expanding our disclosures to include asset letters administration which has obviously become a much more relevant asset figure for Northern Trust and we should have our all of our disclosure parameters and controls in place to allow for that disclosure in 2015. And at that time coincident with that asset disclosure it would be our intention to take custody and fund administration fees for C&IS and break that down into two different lines. Operator : And we will take our next question from Ashley Serrao of Credit Suisse. Ashley Serrao : ?: Biff Bowman : The slight decline in the corporate capital level really resulted from a flat equity balance and a very modest increase in risk weighted assets as you saw we essentially returned all of net income through capital actions in the quarter between the buyback and the dividend, so obviously we kept the capital level flat and we had a modest increase in the risk weighted assets as you have seen some the balance sheet gets slightly larger. So the combination of those drove that ratio slightly lower about from 12.5 to 12.4, so depending on how you have looked at it. We still think that's a very well capitalized as you might say.  The second part of your question was really around the capital structure and how we think about preferred. As you know we did some in August and we continue to evaluate the regulatory environment and to look at our ability to both return or comment and if possible replace that with the tier 1 and that's a strategy we will continue to review on a regular basis. Ashley Serrao : Okay. I guess my follow-up is just on the core business within C&IS. Are you able to size the business won but not installed as it stands right now? Biff Bowman : Internally we have that ability and we know I will comment on this our pipeline is very strong and our incoming business that will be implemented is also very strong and we're busy working on bringing that in as we speak. Operator : And we will take our next question from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Ken Usdin : A little follow-on on the net interest income fund, can you just remind us if that if well I guess actually could you just tell us what that number was -- what the premium amortization was this quarter versus the '13 you had last. And then also then remind us how your mechanism tends to work with regards to either coincidence or lagging. So if rates stay where they are will that then revert back the other way just from a mechanism perspective. Biff Bowman : Let me answer the second part of your question first. We are in a lagging basis so as rates have come down, you and we will look at that and the impact on premium amortization absolutely. The first part of your question was on the. Ken Usdin : Just wanted to actually size those two numbers that you give basis points terms percent of - you gave in the yield some but it just be simpler if we\u2019re able to just tell us what premium amortization was this quarter and what the benefit was from that those pre phase of the auction rates? Bev Fleming : It was 7 million was the amortization in the period. I am rounding. Ken Usdin : And then smaller amounts for the auction rate pay down. Biff Bowman : That\u2019s correct. Ken Usdin :  And then the bigger picture follow-up on net interest income. The balance sheet mix is changed low ends are now starting to grow again they\u2019ve become a smaller proportion of the balance sheet. When you think about the potential for rates arise whenever they do any update as use as far as where you think your normalize them can go given the changes that we have seen in both the liabilities structure the equity mix and the asset side components of the balance sheet. Thanks. Biff Bowman : What we certainly think our NIM can expand in that environment. And we think we\u2019re positioned well for that increase in rates when they do arise. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll provide exactly where we think the NIM can go. But we think we\u2019re positioned well. As you see in our duration we\u2019re relatively short with the sort of a 1.1 duration in the existing portfolio and we think like I said we\u2019re positioned well on the NIM for the NIM to rise when rates do come. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Brennan Hawken of UBS. Brennan Hawken : So little quick on the dropping in outside services and other expense. Was some of that a decline in the sort of elevated CCAR expense that you\u2019ve got and should we expect some of that to transition in the comp as I think you guys have laid out in the past. Just curious about whether that\u2019s said play it all there. Biff Bowman : Let me answer that question from a couple of different perspectives particularly as it relates to regulatory expense and what you saw come through down like services. I\u2019ll start with same, that the decline in outside services fairly broad based that include legal expense, included that consulting expense that you talked about, you talked about consulting services our focusing on the part that you talked about the regulatory environment. Let me talk about that from a few different perspectives. As we said in the past our expenses associated with outside consultants it did ramp up in 2013 really due to our first time efforts around CCAR resolution planning. We expected the level of consulting expense related to these initiatives to decline in 2014 and that did indeed happen. We do continue however to add personal where appropriate and as we shift to what I would call business as usual environment we\u2019re staffing those efforts more internally than using outside expertise. So the second part of it is our portfolio of regulatory initiatives quite frankly it changes year to year, as you\u2019re aware. We track those we track the expenditures for those specific programs and we really track those programs if you will to indicate where we need internal personal and appetite consultant. And we\u2019ve seen the mix shift from use of outside consulting to the hiring of personal internal Northern where we need that expertise on an ongoing basis. So I\u2019ll end it by saying while we don\u2019t really a moderation in the level of expense. We do see a slowing in the growth rate of that and the mix between internal higher and external is shifting as well. Brennan Hawken : And then following up on the point that you made on the swap volumes that you saw this quarter, should we view those as sort of one time in opportunistic. And if so is there a way you could help us maybe size that to think about how we should be looking at the revenues on core basis. Biff Bowman : So they are opportunistic and they are certainly in any environment would move up and down and - this sequential increase had about half of that sequential increase was a result of what I would call apostolic interest rates swap opportunities. Those can come and go in quarter depending on loans. But about half of the sequential increase in that line item was interest rate swaps. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Biff if you can just talk a little bit more on the balance sheet. Just trying to get a sense of direction coming into 2015. I think you mentioned investing a little bit longer out on the yield curve in the government security portfolio. Just want to see if that was a significant additive. And then also on the yield mix and pricing if you continue to see that recent trends continue into 2015 on the loan pricing? Biff Bowman : Let me start with part one on the duration. As we said we were at 1.1 in the month of December we did add about 0.1 of duration buying treasuries about $1 billion worth of treasury. So I would say a modest increase in the duration of the portfolio and still on the shorter end. So that help to add if you will some of the increase that you saw there. If you look at the loan, the yields on loans were down 11 basis points quarter-over-quarter. There is a couple components that I\u2019ll walk through there if I could. The first is really the shift if you will, the first was we\u2019re in lower yielding loans and I scribe some of those, so that is part one. And part two is some of that mix shift has impacted the overall spread and we did have a very modest amount of lease residual write down in the quarter meaningfully. But the combinations of those sort of was the 11 point basis points. Brian Bedell : And do you see those trends continuing aside from the lease residual write down? Do you see those trends continuing into the first quarter? And what\u2019s sort of your ceiling on duration on the securities portfolio that typically like to stay within? Biff Bowman : On the ceiling on duration the answer the answer is as we meet monthly as a committee and look at the market environments and make decisions as needed. So we removed appropriately on that front. In terms of the loan yield, somewhat a factor the market, what is pricing doing in the market and if the compaction and others continues to drive down the pricing on the loans there that we have there, we could continue to see pressure on that line. So that\u2019s all market driven. Brian Bedell : And then just for clarification on the expenses, I think you said FX currency translation impacted revenue by 1%. I don\u2019t know if I missed what the impact was to expenses? Biff Bowman : Generally the revenue and expense impact for us is almost a wash in any given -- on a year-over-year comparison we had 7 million worth of trust fee impact and 6 million worth of impact in our comp bend. But a reasonable expectation is around those two being a wash in terms of currency impacts. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Glenn Shor of Evercore ISI. Glenn Shor : Just a quick question on annulations levels. You mentioned strong capital ratios and you returned most of the cash net income in the quarter. But fully diluted share counts only down 1.3% year-on-year. So just curious what\u2019s the annual issuance about just more of a modeling question for go forward? Biff Bowman : I was thinking about whether or not I have got that in the materials in front of me. I think I am going to have to get back you on that. Glenn Shor : The other question I have is just in asset management general we tend to talk around it through the other businesses but maybe we can get a quick reminder on maybe the core growth initiatives within the asset management as a business is seen to be well positioned from a product standpoint given the environment and using your own proprietary distribution. But just curious if you could talk about it at the asset management business level? Biff Bowman : I\u2019ll highlight a couple of initiatives in the group that are, we\u2019ve talked about our ETF growth and we continue to add funds I believe we have 17 funds in our ETF family and over 8.5 billion of AUMs, so that\u2019s continued to be a focus. I would also highlight an engineered equity products and capability, this is if you think about our tax advantage equity and other programs which is as the trend from active to passive comes we view engineered equity as a form of active equity but has some of the characteristics of passive funds in their return profile. And so those are two areas, the third I would highlight is have alternatives investment business. And particularly that\u2019s a particular interest really across both of our business units, but that demand as you might suspect from our wealth management clients. Glenn Shor : Okay and usually not a big - on my part but while you\u2019re contemplating some of those other disclosures for 2015, a metrics screen on asset management as a business might be an interesting one because you got a lot of essential pieces of what\u2019s growing in the marketplaces it\u2019s hard to see sometimes but I appreciate that. Bev Fleming : I just find that figure, so we talked about in the call that we had 2.5 million shares repurchased in the quarter. The issuance for under employee comp was about 112,000. Glenn Shor : [indiscernible]. Bev Fleming : For the fourth quarter. Glenn Shor : Okay, I have a follow up and if you don\u2019t have it on the full year later. Bev Fleming : Okay, no problem. Operator : And we will take our next question from Mike Mayo of CLSA. Mike Mayo : Hi, I\u2019m staring at slide 4, and just looking at the fourth quarter annualized revenue growth of 19% and wondering how much of those revenues are sustainable? I heard that you said you\u2019ve sustainability to model the clients and momentum but what\u2019s interesting is that your assets under custody and assets under management grew only half of that in the fourth quarter as it did for the year but the revenue growth grew twice as that so maybe just to summarize what you said on this call, you talked about some episodic event but when I look at slide 4, and the four categories, anything there you want to caution us about not extrapolating too much? Biff Bowman : Yes, well first of all in first part of your question was around the AUC and other growth there is foreign exchange impacts on those so they somewhat tempered AUC growth and other so the sequential growth was a little bit it muted the impact of the AUC growth by some of the foreign exchange impact. In terms of is there anything in that, that we want to sort of - I\u2019d say that there is the core business the trust fee growth continues to be solid and trend around that 8% to 9% range that you\u2019re seeing by almost three measure we think that there will clearly be volatility in FX, your models will produce that and we think in the net interest income model while at risk to the - rate loop, we think we\u2019ve given you some pretty good indications to the stability of that. We can highly control the expense side of the equation in terms of the overall profitability and we continue to work on that but I don\u2019t think there is any revenue trend that we would call out, Bev, I don\u2019t know if you have. Bev Fleming : Yes, Mike I guess the only think that I would point out and as Biff mentioned this earlier and you can quite see it on slide 4 but within the other category is securities commissions and trading income and we did point out that, that was a record in the quarter quite a significant record of $21 million and that the interest rate swap revenue in the quarter was particularly high. So, what I\u2019d say is the stars align with respect to that particular revenue stream and whether or not that will repeat as we go forward and the interest rate environment shift and client demand shift remains to be same. Biff Bowman : Yes, and Mike I highlight one other in the other income we have a relationship that we talked about that it had some third quarter impact we had retroactive negotiation with the service provider if you will and we have some benefit in that it\u2019s a portion of that outperformance but not meaningful in terms of that but there is a little bit of the outperformance and other was third quarter and not fourth quarter run rate relatively modest. Mike Mayo : And then just one follow-up, in terms of the competitive environment as it relates to the trust fees, has anything changed, has it got better, has it got worst, could you talk maybe by geography? Biff Bowman : It continues to be a competitive landscape as you know I think there is discipline amongst our competitors in that, they have their own models and when it - an opportunity make sense financially they compete hard and when it doesn\u2019t we\u2019ve seen them for ourselves have the discipline to not continue on, both from a pricing and from a risk perspective at least that\u2019s true for us. In certain regions of the world we\u2019ve seen our success and our competitive wins have been really broad based I think we\u2019ve had particularly great success in Australia but the wins are pretty broad based for us across the business. Operator : And we will take our next question from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Question I have has to do with your securities lending business, can you frame out for us the ideal environment where the security loan balances could grow even faster than you have seen in the recent past. Ideally the foreign exchange revenues, it seems like high volume of activity and volatility favorably impacts that business. Earning metrics that you guys look to that could favorable impact the securities lending business besides some spreads widening out. Biff Bowman : Demand is a big part of that I mean the market the hedge fund needs for the securities or the instruments you have got I mean demand is the primary driver of the success in that business. And as you know that varies and particularly in the fourth quarter we see people make decisions about their willingness to have that outstanding late in the year but demand is the driver. So if we see either stocks let's talk about equities if we see equities with high intrinsic values and there is a demand for those it's a driver of that business -- a substantial driver of that business. Gerard Cassidy : Do you get a sense behind the demand obviously higher demand would be great but would a sustained bear market be the ideal condition to drive that demand even higher. Do you guys with a sense of what that would be from your past experience? Biff Bowman : I am not sure, I think it could but it would be speculation on my part I mean I think it's absolutely good but I would be speculating and I don't -- I would be speculating I will leave at that. Gerard Cassidy : Okay. And the follow-up question is you guys have had good success in growing the balance sheet obviously over the last two years and one of the areas of growth has been the deposits that central banks the Federal Reserve deposits were up quite strongly in the fourth quarter versus first quarter of '13 as you show in your trend slides. The question is how much of that is sticky meaning that should rates move higher and your customers decide to take their excess deposits out assuming most of them are sitting there. Where do you see those line items going and do you have the liquidity coverage ratio that you have to maintain versus what your customers may take out and put elsewhere? Biff Bowman : So I will start with our liquidity coverage ratio and as you see from our balance sheet our liquidity coverage ratio is fully compliant with 2017 guidelines and is north of a 100% as we talk and to your point we have a very liquid balance sheet as you have seen. We do detailed analysis to understand the stickiness or what is operational in that deposit base and what is perhaps sitting there as an excess and I have just used that phrase as an excess. I think that much of the growth in the balance sheet and much of the growth that you have seen in central bank deposits et cetera is reflective of the growth we've had in our business. They are largely items there that would be in support of business transactions and the core custody business. We have had an increase in demand deposit if you look at that, that's a meaningful increase on the balance sheet. I believe two-thirds of that increase is in 10 clients and that money is largely around hedge funds endowments and other types of large clients with large balances. The nature of them staying or going is probably somewhat more in up for discussion. But our core balance growth I think is still reflective of the business growth you see. Operator : And we will take our next question from Jim Mitchell of Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell : I just wanted to follow-up on foreign exchange in the fourth quarter as you guys were up 31% sequentially. Is that purely the function of just the higher volatility or was there anything unusual whether this quarter I mean fourth quarter as in the third quarter where you were a little bit weaker than your peers. Anything unusual that you saw in the fourth quarter or is it just reflective of the environment? Biff Bowman : It's largely reflective of the environment with the volatility we track with that we had very modest volume increase with our clients but largely it was is around the volatility. As we said last quarter though we continue to build out our capabilities and products around foreign exchange business and we hope to see the fruition of that as we move through the year. Jim Mitchell : On the electronic side? Biff Bowman : On the electronic side and providing algorithmic solutions to our clients et cetera. Jim Mitchell : Got you, so when we think about the volatility this quarter -- I appreciate the comments around it's the volatility around the Swiss National Bank for instance was in a negative but I would think is it fair to assume that all else being equal the higher volatility so far this month is a positive or is there would we think there is something else that could be negative -- I have seen that way but volatility should be good, right? Biff Bowman : Volatility is good for us as I described earlier with the -- no we don't warehouse positions and others it's really trading volume for our clients, so that volatility is positive. Jim Mitchell : Great, and on sticking with the volatility theme, have you seen deposits remain elevated or increase by the times end of the quarter you get a buildup and then it drops up. But obviously with Swiss National Bank in Queue and Europe, do you see deposit level even growing further so far this quarter. Biff Bowman : We have seen some modest growth in the balance sheet. But I wouldn\u2019t say outsized from traditional growth that we just see related to our core businesses. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Jeffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research. Jeffrey Elliott : When you talked about the 10.6% fully phased Basel III common equity tier one you mentioned that you\u2019ll be watching for what regulators have to stay there and I just wondered are there any areas in particular that you\u2019re focusing on but you think could move that ratio up or down. Biff Bowman : We just continue as you know in December Governor talked about additional buffers which didn\u2019t impact us. But we still stand ready to see if that type of change is come along so it\u2019s so much of change in the calculation of that element of the ratio. But it - where our levels are relative to where new ratio limit are required. So we've seen ready to make adjustments if we need to be compliant with any new ratios that come about. And then we obviously will wait for anything on the net stable funding ratio we got better guidance in the U.S version of that and the Basel came out in October but the U.S sort of finality that and others. Jeffrey Elliott : And then maybe just to follow up there\u2019s been some discussion around the group of banks which go through the CCAR process being bolted the 50 billion asset threshold being where is - Do you kind of think as an advanced to purchase bank you\u2019re going to be in that exercise whatever or do you think this as a $100 billion asset bank or thereabouts, at some stage you come out of the process or it gets watered down. Biff Bowman : The answer I would say is we\u2019re different in some of those other $100 balance sheet banks in the sense that were 6 trillion of assets under custody and were a trillion almost a trillion of assets under management. So we become and we\u2019re far more significantly global that probably puts us in a position that the regulators will have to make a determination if we more like a U.S based $100 billion regional bank or a global institution and want to see how that plays out. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our last question from Vivek Juneja of JPMorgan. Vivek Juneja : Question on the swaps business that drove some higher revenues. Is that a business you have trying to expand more actively in the wealth and management area? Biff Bowman : It is a business that we think is complementary to our focus on solutions for our client. And in this kind of interest rate environment particularly is the credit demand picks up and we have an interest rate environment where people have an opinion on whether it\u2019s at lows or going up. It\u2019s a product in a capability that I think goes out for solutions that we can bring to them very effectively. So we will continue to discussing with our clients as needed. Vivek Juneja : And might you limit in to just interest full ups or anything beyond that too. Biff Bowman : Generally that\u2019s been the most common solution. But we listen to our clients and if they have other needs we certainly have those dialogues internally. Vivek Juneja : And a completely unrelated question that been some great cuts overseas any commentary on implications of those. Biff Bowman : Sure if you up picked Swiss franc if I could for instance we have about $200 million worth of Swiss franc deposits we have been charging negative 35 basis points on that with move to negative 75 basis points. Our team will closely monitor the situation and adjust our pricing to be appropriate for the competition. But likely moving down much closer to that rate if not slightly hasted. And the same would be through in the Danish Kroner or any other market that where they dropped the central bank rates if you will. Vivek Juneja : And in Australia meaningful one from your folks in terms of deposit or assets. Biff Bowman : It is and in fact it is a high growth area for us. And some of the improvement in our NIM is been our ability to invest in Australian securities it\u2019s a pretty modest impact to the NIM but it is - it\u2019s an example of where because we have the cash and the deposits in that market we\u2019ve been able to utilize some sub sovereign wealth investments in the Australian marketplace. Operator : And at this time, there are no further questions in the queue. Bev Fleming : Thank you Biff and thank you everyone for joining us. We will speak with you again in this format in April on the day of our Annual Meeting. Thank you very much.",

Let me turn the call over to Biff Bowman. Biff Bowman : Good morning, everyone. Let me join Bev in welcoming you to Northern Trust first quarter earnings conference call. As is our customary practice, today I will review our results for the quarter after which Bev and I would be happy to answer your questions. Starting on Page 2, this morning we reported first quarter net income of $231 million, earnings per share were $0.94, 25% higher year-over-year. Our return on equity was 11.3% in the quarter. Environmental factors which impact our businesses and our clients were mixed in the first quarter, a theme which has been ongoing for some time. U.S. equity markets were higher year-over-year with the S&P 500 up 10%, but relatively flat sequentially. International equities as measured by the MSCI EAFE Index were down approximately 3.5% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially and were negatively impacted in both comparisons by a stronger U.S. dollar. In bond markets, the Barclays U.S. aggregate index was up 2% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Client assets under custody ended the quarter at 6.1 trillion, up 6% over last year and 2% versus last quarter, and assets under management ended at 960 billion, up 5% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. I\u2019ll provide further details on asset trends later during this call. Currency markets had multiple impacts this quarter. Currency volatility as measured by the G7 index was 33% higher than the first quarter of last year and 22% higher than last quarter. Currency volatility influences our foreign exchange trading income as does the level of client activity. Currency rates which influence the translation of non U.S currencies to the U.S dollar impact client assets and our revenues and expenses. The dollar was stronger both year-over-year and sequentially. Dollar strength tempered custody asset growth and related fee growth, but benefited expense growth. Short-term interest rates rose slightly compared with the fourth quarter yet remained at very low levels, continuing to pressure our net interest margin and resulting in fee waivers on our money market mutual funds. Three month LIBOR and the fed funds effective rate both increased 2 basis point sequentially to 26 and 12 basis points respectively and the overnight repo rate increased 1 basis points to 15 basis points. With those comments providing context on the environment, let\u2019s move to Page 3 and discuss the financial highlights of the first quarter. Year-over-year revenue increased 9% with non-interest income up 10% and net interest income up 5%. Expenses increased 3%, primarily reflecting higher compensation, equipment and software, and employee benefit expense. The provision for credit losses was a credit of 4.5 million in the quarter primarily reflecting a sustained improvement in the level of non-performing assets. Net income was 27% higher year-over-year. Compared to last quarter revenue was flat with non-interest income up 1% and net interest income down 2%. Expenses increased 1% due primarily to higher employee benefit expense, business promotion and equipment software offset partially by lower outside services expense. Net income declined 5% sequentially as the prior quarter included a 9.5 million income tax benefit. Excluding last quarter's income tax benefit net income was 2% lower sequentially. Page 4 let's look at the result in greater details starting with revenue on page 4. First quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was approximately 1.1 billion, up 9% year-over-year and flat sequentially. Trust, investment and other servicing fees the largest component of revenue were 728 million in the quarter, up 7% year-over-year and flat sequentially fees in our Corporate & Institutional Services business increased 7% year-over-year and declined 1% sequentially while fees in our wealth management business grew 7% year-over-year and were unchanged sequentially.  New business and higher equity market were both drivers of growth but currency translation as I mentioned earlier detracted from overall fee growth. The impact was approximately 2 percentage points year-over-year and 1 percentage point sequentially. Fee waivers were approximately 33 million in the first quarter relatively unchanged both year-over-year and sequentially. I'll go into further detail on trust and investment fees shortly. Foreign exchange trading income was 72 million in the first quarter up 43% year-over-year and 18% sequentially. Currency volatility was higher in the first quarter, client trading volumes were also higher both year-over-year and sequentially. Other non-interest income was 75 million in the first quarter up 15% from last year and 3% lower sequentially. Within other non-interest income securities commission and trading income was again strong at 20 million as we continue to see strong demand for interest rate protection products from our personal clients.  Other operating income of 39 million in the quarter increased 2% year-over-year but declined 6% sequentially reflecting lower income associated with a third party servicing agreement which was modified in the fourth quarter. If you recall we said last quarter about half of the income recorded in the fourth quarter reflected the third quarter impact of the modified agreement. Net interest income which I will also discuss in more detail later was $267 million in the first quarter, up 5% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially. With that backdrop, let\u2019s look at the components of our fee revenues on Page 5. For our corporate and instructional services business, fees totaled 407 million in the first quarter up 7% year-over-year and 1% lower sequentially. Custody and fund administration fees; the largest component of C&IS fees were 277 million in the first quarter, up 10% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially. Assets under custody for C&IS clients were $5.6 trillion at quarter end up 6% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Growth in fees and assets primarily reflects new business and market conditions including higher equity and bond markets offset partially by the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. Investment management fees in C&IS of 76 million in the first quarter were up 2% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially. Assets under management for C&IS clients were 727 billion, up 4% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. The year-over-year increase in C&IS assets under management was due to higher equity and fixed income markets partially offset by the impact of the stronger dollar on international assets. In the sequential quarter comparison, modest improvement in equity markets and new business were both contributors to the increase. C&IS investment management fees were impacted by fee waivers on institutional money market mutual funds totaling 15 million. Securities lending fees were 22 million in the first quarter, 5% lower than last year and 1% lower sequentially. Year-over-year results reflect lower spreads across asset classes with the largest decline in U.S. equities offsetting the impact of higher collateral levels. The sequential quarter decline reflects higher collateral levels offset by two fewer days in the first quarter. Securities lending collateral was 123 billion at quarter end, up 6% both year-over-year and sequentially. Other fees in C&IS were 32 million in the first quarter, up 10% year-over-year and 13% sequentially due to higher sub advisory fees. The sequential quarter increase also reflects seasonally higher revenue for benefit payment services. Moving to our wealth management business, trust, investment and other servicing fees were 320 million in the first quarter, up 7% year-over-year reflecting higher equity markets and new business. Growth was relatively consistent across the regions and global family office. Wealth management fees were up slightly versus the prior quarter as new business was largely offset by higher waived fees in money market mutual funds. Assets under management for wealth management clients were 233 billion at quarter end, up 7% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Money market mutual fund fee waivers in wealth management totaled 18 million in the current quarter, flat compared with last year, but up 1 million compared to last quarter. Moving to Page 6, net interest income was 267 million in the first quarter, 5% year-over-year and up 2% compared to the fourth quarter. The year-over-year increase in net interest income was driven by a larger balance sheet as client deposits averaged 87 billion in the quarter, up 7% versus last year. Partially offsetting the impact of a larger balance sheet was a lower net interest margin, which at 1.1% in the first quarter was down 2 basis points year-over-year. In the sequential comparison, net interest income was lower due to two fewer days in the quarter, a slight decline in earning assets was offset by 2 basis point increase in our net interest margin, which resulted from a favorable mix-shift in earning assets. We continue to see growth in our loan portfolio with average loans and leases increasing 2% sequentially and we reallocated a portion of our short-term interest bearing deposits into our securities portfolio which was 7% higher sequentially. The yield on the securities portfolio decreased 5 basis points sequentially, about 4 basis points of the decrease in yield was due to higher premium amortization in our mortgage back securities portfolio versus the prior quarter. Premium amortization in the fourth quarter was $10 million, compared to 4 million in the year ago quarter and 7 million in the fourth quarter. Loan balances averaged 32 billion in the first quarter up 10% or 2.9 billion year-over-year and up 2% or approximately 700 million sequentially. We saw solid loan growth this quarter across commercial and institutional, private client and commercial real estate, partially offset by a lower level of residential real estate loans. The yield on the loan portfolio increased 1 basis point sequentially. Turning to Page 7, expenses were 789 million in the first quarter, up 3% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Compensation expense increased 4% year-over-year primarily reflecting higher incentive compensation. The impact of staff growth and annual merit increases was largely offset by the favorable impact of movements in currency rates. Staff levels increased approximately 5% year-over-year with more than 75% of the growth emanating from our global operating centers in Bangalore, Manila and Limerick. On a sequential basis compensation expense was essentially flat as higher equity based incentives including the requirement to immediately expense options granted to retirement eligible employee were offset by the impact of movement in currency rates, staff growth was 1%. Employee benefit expense increased 9% year-over-year primarily driven by higher pension and employee medical expense. On a sequential quarter basis, employee benefit expense increased 16% due to the higher pension expense, payroll taxes and medical expense. Outside services expenses were down 6% both year-over-year and sequentially, reflecting a lower level of expense in a number of categories including legal, consulting and third-party advisor fees. Equipment and software expense was up 9% year-over-year and 7% sequentially reflecting higher software amortization as we continue to invest to support clients, improve our efficiency and meet regulatory and compliance requirements. Other operating expense increase 6% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher charitable donations and higher deferred amortization expense related to client on boarding. In the sequential comparison other operating expense increased 3% reflecting seasonally higher business promotion and marketing cost associated with the Northern Trust open. Turning to page 8, we continue to make progress on our goal to sustainably improve profitability and returns the focused execution that I have highlighted this morning has resulted in continued improvement in the ratio of expenses to trust and investment fees from 113 in the first quarter of last year to 108% this quarter. This combine with the slight moderation in the revenue headwinds that we have faced in recent year including growth and foreign exchange trading and net interest income produced meaningful operating leverage and resulted in improvements in our pre-tax margin to 31% and in our return on equity to 11.3%. Turning to page 9, our capital ratio remains solid with common equity Tier 1 ratios up 10.5 and 11.8 respectively, calculated on a transition basis for both advance and standardized. Both were lower when compared to prior periods. The decline in the transition basis advanced common equity Tier 1 ratio was primarily due to higher risk weighted assets given mix changes on the sheet as well as higher operational risk weighted assets due to modeling refinement. The decline in the transition basis standardized common equity Tier 1 ratio was primarily driven by the implementation effective January 1st 2015 of Basel III standardize risk weighted assets. On a fully phased in basis our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the advanced approach would be approximately 11.5% and under the standardized approach will be approximately 10.3%. All of these ratios are well above the full phased in requirement of 7% which includes the capital conservation buffer. The supplementary leverage ratio at the corporation was 6.4% and at the bank was 5.6% both of which exceed the 3% requirement applicable to Northern Trust. As Northern Trust progresses through fully phased in Basel III implementation there could be additional enhancements to our models and further guidance from the regulators on the implementation of the final rule, which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final Basel III rules. As we announced in March our 2015 capital plan received no objection from the Federal Reserve. In it we requested authority to increase our quarterly common dividend to $0.36 per share. And its regular meeting later today our board of directors will consider formal approval of the planned dividend increase which is expected to be payable July 1st. In the first quarter we repurchased 1.6 million shares at a cost of 1.7 million. In addition, our 2015 capital plan provide for the repurchase of up to 675 million of common stock between April 2015 and June 2016. With respect to the liquidity coverage ratio Northern Trust is above the 80% minimum requirement effective as of January 1st 2015, and is also above the 100% minimum requirement that will become effective of January 1st, 2017. In closing the first quarter demonstrated continued progress in driving our return on equity deeper into our target range of 10% to 15%. Execution around both growth and efficiency priorities remain strong and is evidenced by meaningful operating leverage generated in the quarter. And our C&IS business momentum remain strong with announced wins such as the government employee Superannuation board of Australia and AutoCanada based [indiscernible] Trust as well as a robust pipeline of new opportunities. New business was diverse both geographically and across products and clients segments. Our wealth management has solid new business results as well. Record level of AUM and AUC coupled with strong loan growth helped to deliver positive results in the quarter. From a financial perspective, while we have moved our return on equity into our target range we remain focused on further enhancing profitability. Before I conclude as its customary for our first quarter earnings call we will need to end today's call to allow sufficient time for all of us to get to our annual begin which began at 10 :30 central time this morning. Please accept our apologies in the event that we have to close off the question and answer period earlier than our normal practice. Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust's first quarter earnings conference call today. Bev and I will be happy to answer your questions. Casella, please open the line. Operator : [Operator Instruction] We\u2019ll take our first question from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is open. Brennan Hawken : So the fully phased in Basel III capital ratios declined quarter-over-quarter in about 30 bps for standardized and 40 for advanced, what drove those declines? Biff Bowman : So there are a couple of factors that we need to consider here; first is the phase to Basel III. So largely it was a risk weighted asset impact. The two point that you talk about approximately 75% were driven by that conversion and then 50% were driven -- up to 50 basis points were driven by the shift in asset mix on the balance sheet. So we have greater loans and we moved items out of our fed deposits if you will into other earning assets. And is as expected we -- these are as we would have expected to move under the migration into Basel III and the shift-mix if you will on the balance sheet into assets that draw the RWA up again about 50 of the basis points and then 150 basis points is simply to move to the Basel III standardize. Brennan Hawken : But I was actually asking on the fully phased basis, your fully phased as you guys reported last quarter, standardized 10.6, this quarter at 10.3 and the advanced was 11.9 and this quarter to 11.5. So does that mean that on the fully phased basis it was purely based on asset mix on the balance sheet? Biff Bowman : Yes, that\u2019s exactly right. Brennan Hawken : Okay thanks. And then thinking about -- what you just referenced the deposits with fed, what drove that shift quarter-over-quarter? They dropped almost in half, is that something that you expect to be sustainable and is that some progress that you're making in decreasing non-operating deposits? Biff Bowman : I don\u2019t know that the halfing is something that we\u2019ll continue, but we\u2019re just trying to put the balance sheet items to work. The asset mix as you can see shifted to the shorter end of the securities portfolio, so we have just put those items to a more effective use than 25 basis point deposit at the fed. I don\u2019t think you should anticipate a half -- continued halfing though. Brennan Hawken : No, sure, sure of course, I just -- and the other part of the question does that mean is it right to infer that maybe non-operating deposits might have decline too, which gives you the confidence to switch it over to securities? Biff Bowman : No I don\u2019t think you can make that inference. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll move now to Luke Montgomery with Bernstein Research. Your line is open. Luke Montgomery : So just a question on the base line fee rates for which we estimate a fee waivers. I think some investors are concerned that the fee waiver disclosures, maybe not just for you, but for the industry are calculated on fee rates that haven\u2019t been negotiate for a long time and clearly your yields on those funds could be primarily lower. In the past, I think you\u2019ve discussed you're recapture expectation and the possibility of how competition might play into that, but more fundamentally in providing those disclosures, is your basic assumption that fee rates are roughly what they were about six years ago? Biff Bowman : So, we\u2019ve reprised some of our money market fee assets more recently than that, I think 2012 was the most recent reprising in a portion of our money market fee asset. So it's not fair to say that some of those aren\u2019t current, but we are revisiting in light of the money market reform and all the other acts, we are constantly revisiting if you will our bulk of product offerings and capabilities as well as the competitive pricing landscape in that space. Luke Montgomery : And then on sec lending in February, you said a couple of pair of class action lawsuits for about; I think it was three quarters worth of sec lending revenue. So could you just remind us are there other suits outstanding of a similar nature or is this issue pretty much put to bed and then had that already been accrued for in prior earnings or was there an impact in the P&L this quarter? Biff Bowman : As we previously disclosed we did agree to settle the alleged class action claims arising out of the client investments in the Northern Trust index funds that experienced losses from securities lending during the financial crisis. We took the 19.2 million pre-tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2013. The parties obtained preliminary court approval for the class wide settlement during the first quarter of 2015 and the final approval hearing has been schedule for August of 2015. So there are still some items that we are reviewing in the process the best sort of the most recent update we have on our securities lending. Operator : (Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll move next to Glenn Shor with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Glenn Shor : A NIM question if I could on the yield front, so yields on the loan -- so I think 22 basis points year-on-year they fell double that on the debt front which is helping support [indiscernible] among other things. So the question is, is the drop end loans -- how do you attribute to rates versus pricing versus mix of products and on the debt front? I\u2019m assuming there is a component of rolling off high [cost] debt, could you talk about maybe the year ahead and in terms of what's rolling off and can we still expect to same year-on-year trends? Biff Bowman : If you will on the loan mix and if you will -- the lessening of the yield. The mix of products there has moved from, as we talked about residential real estate into what we would call investment secured loans. Those have a lower yield but they are well secured in high credit quality. So the mix shift there has driven a lot of that change if you will in rate, in terms of the first part of your question in the loan mix. So the areas we are growing our loans in have a slightly higher lower yield then the traditional residential real estate and others. So that is driven most of the loan mix down. In terms of the debt we did have last year 500 million of senior notes and then in the first quarter of this year we had 125 million sterling note which was used financed the bearings acquisition about a decade ago roll off in the first quarter. And then as far as the rest of the year we along with the treasure in the [indiscernible] committee of the firm look at our debt structure on an ongoing basis to determine what type of debt structures we will have over that roll off. Glenn Shor : Okay, nothing imminent schedule? Biff Bowman : Nothing. Glenn Shor : I know you're sure on time, go ahead you can move on. Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Ashley Serrao : Just a boarder question, expenses in general. You are off to a good start in the first quarter, as we think about the balance of the year what are some of the puts and takes which we should mindful of in terms of reinvestment and maybe any other efficiency gains in the horizon? Biff Bowman : So as we've discussed before we have many ongoing expense initiatives around the firm. I talked about our location strategy for instance and we gave some numbers in our talking points were last year a little north of 75% of our higher were in our locations that we would call Operating Centers in Tier 2 and Tier 3 locations. That will continue ongoing and we've done a great job of managing our consulting and legal expenses that we've talked about that are other drivers on the expense front. Those can be episodic, particularly legal can be episodic but some of the disciplines that we put in place around there have aided us in the expense measures that you see here and in the expense performance that you see here. In essence it's a business as usual on the expense product, we've embedded some of the disciplines around the expense to trust fees that we talk about is been embedded into our businesses and people are gearing their expense growth rates to be in line with our trust fee growth rates. Ashley Serrao : And just a quick follow up. Just in FX if you look at the cumulative pre-tax impact was this last quarter or a year ago what was it? Bev Fleming : Are you talking about the impact of the currency rates? Ashley Serrao : Yes, the exchanges rates. Biff Bowman : If you're talking about the impacts on the P&L for us, to give some indication if you look at revenues sequentially we would have had 7% on trust fees -- excuse me $7 million of trust fees were impacted negatively. And then if you looked at it on a year-over-year basis that would have been about 15 million negatively impacted by the strengthening dollar, that\u2019s an important line. On the expense side if I look at [indiscernible] largest expense line it was $14 million impact year-over-year and sequentially also 7 million. Just trying to give you some idea of our two main expenses. Operator : We'll move on to Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Brian Bedell : Maybe just go back to expenses very good cost control in the quarter. I was just trying to understand a little bit more granularly some of the what you would identify as seasonally high or first quarter and then some of the -- as mentioned I think the lower consulting and legal fees. Just trying to isolate that as well. Biff Bowman : So we do have some seasonality in our expense as you noted. We have the Northern Trust open and then we have certain compensation related expenses particularly with option expense for retirement eligible individuals that are seasonal. I think if you look probably historically you'll be able to see the spike particularly in our business promotions and other lines in your analysis to see. We felt pretty good about our ability to absorb that increase in expense in the first quarter and still maintained expense growth rates at you saw in our earnings release. As for things like legal and consulting, the disciplines we put in place around the use and the contracts, and the rate cards with those individuals, I think will allow us to create some permanent savings, but take legal for instance there is -- there can be episodic situations where we need to utilize outside law firms for situations and we continue to manage the cost of the rate cards, but if we have to use legal firms more for entities going forward or consultants for needs going forward it could move that needle around. I think most of the other expenses again are very much in line with the expense-to-trust fee ratio that we talk about and people are embedding that into their allowable growth rates in their businesses. Brian Bedell : And then just maybe on the outside services, do you view that run rate as a sustainable run rate borrowing anything unforeseen in the first quarter? Biff Bowman : I am hesitate to say that that\u2019s a run rate because of the episodic nature of some of it, but I think there is a portion of that that is permanent, but there is also the episodic need. So I am not sure I am willing to concede. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Alex Blostein : Question on the asset management business and the I guess the organic growth, I know you guys don\u2019t give that to us here and that\u2019s sort of a wish, but broadly speaking if I look at the AUM growth up 4% quarter-over-quarter it\u2019s up quite nicely despite the FX headwinds in the market helped to some extent, but I am assuming that\u2019s not all of it. So just got a curiosity here where the growth is coming from? We\u2019ve definitely seem a lot of incremental growth in the past with strategy seeing that, predominantly what\u2019s driving that and maybe what the pipeline looks there? Biff Bowman : So if we look at our growth in our AUM and our asset management business in general, we did see growth in our cash funds in the quarter, we\u2019ve seen growth in our OCIO business, our outsourced Chief Investment Officer business, very much we\u2019ve seen growth in our enhanced equities strategy. Our three areas where we\u2019ve seen growth are ETF business also has continued to grow as well. So, we\u2019ve had -- and it's been -- I would also say it's been global as well, that growth has been both domestically here in the U.S. and particularly in Europe and in the Middle East we\u2019ve seen significant growth in our AUM. Alex Blostein : And then just my follow-ups to business initiative, the cash business, given the fact that the bigger banks continue to seek pressure on the balance sheet size and more cash continues to move off to the sidelines. Given your roll in the cash management world both on the money market fund side, but also I guess some of the balance sheet capacity since you guys are not, that\u2019s a lot of constrained like your peers. Just curious to think about how you guys think about that opportunity relative to some of your peers given the fact that there is still -- feels like a lot of cash in the systems that needs home and nobody sort of wants it? Biff Bowman : We\u2019ve assembled a cross business unit project team which would as you describe encompass both professionals from our asset management business and our treasury team to look really in servicing the liquidity needs of our clients and in some cases that liquidity needed is balance sheet and in some cases that is in some form of money market fund or some other type of cash vehicle. There is a cross Northern Trust wide team looking at that, working with clients to understand their solution needs and it\u2019s very active and moving forward at a pace as you might imagine, in conjunction with the money market reform that you see on the asset management side but also in relation to other financial institutions that have taken a very different tact around large deposits and we -- right now we view each of those on an individual basis, but we\u2019re looking at that as I said across the business with a real holistic approach to client liquidity needs. Operator : [indiscernible] with Jefferies. Unidentified Analyst : A little bit on the securities lending business, you mentioned that the spreads look like they continue to be under pressure, you had okay period in collateral growth and we did see little bit disconnect between LIBOR and sec funds this quarter. So can you talk through to some of the underlying dynamics and if anything is just changing fundamentally inside the security lending business or if it was just some anomaly from this quarter? Biff Bowman : On volumes we did see a pickup in borrower demand particularly in U.S. equities and U.S. corporate bonds, our sequential volume growth was impacted -- we have sequential volume growth. However it was essentially offset by two fewer days in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter and I know you're asking from macro trends as well. We also saw sort of for us a mix shift in the impacted fee splits so our clients with different fees split were more in the market than those with perhaps more favorable to Northern fees splits. And so the clients having those less favorable fee arrangements represented a larger portion of our revenue in this quarter. Fundamentally though I don\u2019t think we saw any other macro level issues that we would call out on the call. I would note in the second quarter we get our dividend fees and ramp up in security funding so we anticipate that in the quarter. Unidentified Analyst : And then my follow up is just on the same topic. So historically securities lending spread, did you tend to widen when we get an advance of that rate cycle. But I'm just wondering this time do we actually have to wait for the administer grade to change. Or should we anticipate that as dead funds in LIBOR go up in advanced of the actual fed cycle. How would you expect that dynamic to work this cycle if any different form prior. Biff Bowman : I don\u2019t know that I can answer that, if you want to be all candor. I'm not sure that I\u2019ll have a good answer for you on that. Unidentified Analyst : I'll follow up offline. Operator : We'll go now to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Betsy Graseck : Couple of questions on wealth management. We've seen some headlines on some of the neutrals that are coming out of the West Coast they're known as robo advisors. I'm not asking if, if you\u2019re going down that road, but is there something in the technology that you could use to leverage that kind of concept and get even more efficient, freeing up some of your folks to spend more of their time on client acquisition or enhance there wallet in using some of these tools? Biff Bowman : We are -- our product team insight is actively looking at if you will the capabilities that those type of robo advisors if you will bring to the market. And if you will considering the technology that would enable our client situations more effectively and it is an emerging trend, our president of our wealth management business spends significant amount of time on the West Coast meeting with individuals to further understand the technologies if you will that are driving the wealth management business forward. So you're right, there is technology there, it today doesn\u2019t target our typical client as you might suspect. But I think the nuances and the capability under penning the technology there is of interest to us to continue to evaluate. Betsy Graseck : And the follow up is just on the fiduciary standard language that came out of departmental [liberalizing] was last week. I'm sure you had took the time to look through that just wondering if there is any change in how you approach the marketing of your clients given that language come of the DOL. Biff Bowman : We believe our wealth management remains very well positioned versus others vis-\u00e0-vis the new fiduciary standards. A brief overview from a financial perspective we would expect minimal negative impact because our model is a fee based model, other have commission oriented models with different compensation structures. Ours are largely discretionary structures which don\u2019t lend themselves to some of the issues the department of LIBOR has timed on. If you think about the discretionary incentive awards for our individuals, the factors that drive them are really based on client satisfaction, client retention and risk management and not driven by product placement and some of the other elements that the department of LIBOR is concerned about. And then lastly I would say this for 125 year the firm has been driven by fiduciary responsibility and we don\u2019t some of these new requirement that department of LIBOR is talking about here is new news for us in that space. Betsy Graseck : So opportunity for potential mortgage or gain as the DOL has tightened people awareness around the need for fiduciary responsibility. And maybe there is a marketing effort that will ring little bit more clearly in people minds. Biff Bowman : We hope so. Operator : We'll move next to Mike Mayo from CLSA. Your line is open. Mike Mayo : Foreign exchange is up about one fifth quarter-over-quarter and about two fifth year-over-year. How much that is sustainable? How should we think about that? Biff Bowman : So it is highly links to volatility and volumes. So it's very links to the volatility that you saw. We have taken -- as we discussed we have taken efforts to look at our e-commerce platforms and other solutions for clients that has modestly driven up our client volumes and our client share. But still the lion share of this is driven by the volatility that we see. We're hoping to further through products and capabilities and solutions, have more that is sustainable as you describe, but it's partially linked to volatility. Mike Mayo : And what are the key drivers of that volatility when you do the analysis and is that continuing into the second quarter? Biff Bowman : Well we used probably the same things that you do to looking at the JP Morgan, G7 currency volatility or the emerging market volatility index in the [seats], we have into April seen the same types of volatilities that we\u2019ve seen and I -- we believe that you have the possibility of Central Bank divergence on monitory policy it could continue to create at least the need for more volatility or create volatility in the foreign exchange system. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll move next to Adam Beatty with Bank of America. Your line is open. Adam Beatty : On asset management just interested in any differences that you're seeing between your overseas and domestic clients, whether that\u2019s in C&IS or wealth management just in terms of the level of new business or asset allocation and whether maybe currencies effecting that? Thanks. Biff Bowman : If you look at our business and our asset management business globally, in the U.S. it has a strong balance between our asset, our wealth management business and our corporate institutional businesses. Outside of the U.S. that becomes largely an institutional base for our AUM and it has a significant position in our passive products if you will and particularly to large sovereign wealth funds those are meaningful clients across the globe outside the U.S. So there is obviously substantial pools of assets there and they need those kinds of index products. And in U.S. in the domestic product market, we have a wide arrays of suite of products in our asset management that are attractive to our clients from alternatives to ETFs, to mutual funds, to cash products, to active equity, et cetera. So it's a much broader spectrum. Institutionally, in the U.S. we also have a broader array, it still has a heavily cash and index component on the institutional side, but we do have an array. But on the wealth side it's a much broader mix product capabilities. Adam Beatty : Thank you, really appreciate the detail and then just a quick follow-up on the OCIO business, how much synergy is there between that and custody and asset servicing, do you look for cross selling there or is it more of a stand alone? Thanks. Biff Bowman : Tremendous synergies and if you think it from a -- we may be providing the custodial services and as part of a solution set to that client, they need help or they\u2019re seeking help, or they\u2019re seeking to outsource some of the pension responsibilities or the investment responsibilities, we become a fairly natural solution for them and there is synergies in the ability to bundle that product and service together. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is open. Gerard Cassidy : Biff, can you share with us an update on the funding over in the European markets where there are negative interest rates and you\u2019ve passed on the cost to some of your customers, what\u2019s been the reaction by the customers? And also what percentage of those deposits are actually being -- that cost is being passed on them, in the markets where there are negative rates? Biff Bowman : So we do have several markets, you're correct where we have a negative rate environment. We have the Euro, we have the Danish krona, we have the Swiss franc, our three areas where we have gone negative if you will with our clients. In terms of the spread if you will on that it's interesting in some cases it depends on the reinvestment possibilities that we have in those. So we -- in some cases we have seen the spread erosion occur where the spread is narrowed and in others we\u2019ve been able to maintain that if you will that spread even with negative rates. I will say that we on a continuous and an active basis we monitor the markets, we understand where we\u2019re able to reinvest and we have active dialogues with our clients about in some cases perhaps the need to press further negative into the rate environment where Central Bank\u2019s continue to take more aggressive negative rate stances. Allison Quaintance : Gerard, one thing that I would add to that is that of the three currencies where we\u2019re currently charging negative rates, the one that is really the most significant for us from a client balance perspective as the euro and I think we had mentioned last quarter that while we had seen a run up in our Euro balances when our rates was not negative, we did see that come down we went from about \u20ac4 billion to about 3 billion, kind of stabilized at that level in line with what our expectations had been and I guess after that initial response, we have seen those balances drift up, but just modestly. In terms of the Swiss franc and the Danish krona is about the balances is there from client, they\u2019re really quite small. Gerard Cassidy : And about what percentage of customers are being passed on this cost? Is it half of the deposit base or a third or all? Allison Quaintance : A vast majority. Biff Bowman : A vast majority. Gerard Cassidy : And then second, there has been some evidence of loans that are tie to Euro bar, that when the Euro bar rate has gone negative the variable rate loan, the spread over the loan is also pushing the loan yield negative meaning the bank is being forced to pay the borrowers. Do you guys have any loans tied to these negative rates where you could be at risk, where you would be forced to pay the borrower? Biff Bowman : We don\u2019t as of our last asset liability committee meeting because we walked through this scenario. But we keep our eyes very closely pealed to I know what you're describing and to date we don\u2019t have that situation. But we're continuing to stay close with the negative movement in the rate. Most of our lending is domestic in this dollar based; in fact I believe all of our lending is dollar base. Operator : And we'll move now to Jeffrey Elliott with Autonomous. Your line is open. Jeffrey Elliott : On the 20 million or so year-on-year increase in foreign exchange trading income. Can you give us sense of what if, any expenses all attached to that incremental income or does it all just drop through to pretax? Biff Bowman : There are some but they are relatively modest level of expenses. There is compensation related expenses that would move with that success in the foreign exchange trading market. But there is not much else in way of incremental expense that moves with that. Operator : We'll move next to Brian [indiscernible] with KBW. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : I just have a quick question on the wealth management specifically looking at the East region. I know you have been seeing growth there relative to all the other reasons but look like for the last four quarters revenues kind of plateaued and I know in the past you kind of talk about a j-curve when you are in certain markets. Kind of outline where you are at on that j-curve in the market? When you kind of expect to see enhance growth in that market again? Biff Bowman : So I would take a step back and say that our east region is very broad geographically, it goes from Miami Florida to Boston. So I think you need to sort of peel back into market by market type analysis which we don\u2019t have in here. So we've got markets within there that have stronger growth trajectories than what you see here overall. We are -- and continue to have very large market share and meaningful presence in the Florida coast and we're building out that presence from what I would say the Washington D.C. quarter. We have meaningful presence in New York but continue to work on increasing our presence and penetration in that market all the way up to Boston. So I don\u2019t know that I can specifically make a comment on generically about the East because it's made up of so many markets along the Eastern sea board. So some with great growth dynamics and some where we continuing to invest and want to deliver more. Unidentified Analyst : Would say that the investment in the North East is going to pick up year-over-year than in 2015? Biff Bowman : It continues to be a growth initiative for our wealth management area and we continue to invest both marketing and probably more important talent [dollars] into the region to facilitate that growth. Operator : We'll take our final question today from Jeff Harte with Sandler O'Neil. Your line is open. Jeff Harte : Looking at assets under custody the growth has been consistently impressive and the market share gain opportunity is pretty clear with 6 trillion versus some peers north of 30. Can you talk a little bit about what is actually driving the market share gain you're seeing there? Is it a better product offering than competitors? Is it simply entering new markets and winning your share of bids? What's actually driving that logistically? Biff Bowman : I'll answer that with a few points. One is we had success in regions where we've grown quickly. So let me highlight Australia and we highlighted an Australian wins. So there is an example where the regionality and our strength in that region has helped drive that market share growth, that\u2019s one area where we've seen net growth. Most notably has been our success in our servicing asset manager or our global fund services business. We've seen really substantial double digit growth in that business over the last three or four years and our ability to compete against our primary competitors in there and be successful has grown remarkably over the time. And then I would end with product and capabilities, technologies like what we have -- from in our hedge fund services, the Omnium acquisition and other elements of technology. The combination of technology, regional strength and growth particularly in our GFS business have allowed to market share gains. Jeff Harte : Is GFS; is that a function of operating it to new markets where maybe you hadn\u2019t been before? Jeff Harte : In some cases geographic markets, in some cases its product and capabilities. So it's a combination of both. And then the scale that we've achieved in that business makes us competitive force. Operator : And this does conclude our Q&A for today. I\u2019ll turn the call back to our speakers for any closing remarks. Bev Fleming : Thank you, Biff and thank you everyone for joining us today. Allison and I would be happy to take additional questions as the rest of this week unfolds and we look forward to speaking with you on our second quarter call in July. Have a good day. Thank you. Operator : And that does conclude today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect at any time.",

This will allow us to move through the queue and enable as many people as possible the opportunity to ask questions as time permits. So, thank you again for joining us today. Let me turn the call over to Biff Bowman. Biff Bowman : Thanks Bev. Good morning, everyone. Let me join Bev in welcoming you to Northern Trust second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Today I will review our results for the quarter after which Bev and I would be happy to answer your questions. Starting on Page 2 of our quarterly earnings review presentation, this morning we reported second quarter net income of $269 million, earnings per share were $1.10 and our return on common equity was 12.8%. As outlined in our press release, our results in the second quarter included three items, which I would like to highlight for you today. First we recorded a pre-tax gain of 99.9 million on the sale of 1 million Class B Visa shares. This gain is reflected on our income statement in the other operating income line. The sale reduces our ownership position in Visa Class B shares to 5.23 million shares as of the end of the second quarter. At the current conversion rate, this is equivalent to 8.62 million Class A shares of Visa. These shares are recorded on our balance sheet at the original cost basis of zero. Second we recorded a pre-tax charge of 45.8 million related to voluntary cash contributions to four constant dollar net asset value funds. This charge is reflected our income statement and the other operating expense line. While the market base net asset values of the four funds were well above the prescribed threshold for transactions to occur at $1. This voluntary action offsets legacy losses realized by the funds during the financial crisis. The market base NAV's now approximate one across all four funds. Third, we recorded a 17.8 million impairment of the residual value of eight aircraft under leverage lease arrangements. This impairment charge is reflected on our income statement in net interest income. Excluding these three items, second quarter net income was $247 million, earnings per share were $1.01 and our return on common equity was 11.8%. Recall that our results in the second quarter of 2014 included pre-tax charges and write-offs of 42.3 million excluding both the current quarter and prior year quarter's items that I just mentioned earnings per share increased a strong 16% year-over-year. Let me also review environmental factors which impact our businesses and our clients. U.S. equity markets were higher year-over-year with the S&P 500 up 5% yet international equities as measured by the MSCI EAFE Index were down 6.6% year-over-year impacted by stronger U.S. dollar. In the sequential quarter comparison both U.S. and international equities were down modestly. In bond market, the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index was lower by 1.5% year-over-year and 2.5% sequentially. Currency market had mixed impacts in the quarter. Currency volatility as measured by the G7 index was 62% higher than the second quarter of last year yet was 3% lower the last quarter. Currency volatility influences our foreign exchange trading income as does the level of client activity, currency rates which influence the translation of non U.S currencies to the U.S dollar impact client assets and our revenues and expenses. The dollar was stronger year-over-year which tempered custody asset growth and related fee growth, but benefited expense growth sequentially the dollar weakened particularly versus the sterling and euro. U.S. short-term interest rates rose slightly yet remained at very low levels continuing to pressure our net interest margin and resulting in fee waivers on our money market mutual funds. Three month LIBOR and the fed funds effective rate both increased 2 basis points sequentially to 28 and 13 basis points respectively and the overnight repo rate increased 3 basis points to 18 basis points. Let's move to Page 3 and review the financial highlights of the second quarter. My comments are on an adjusted basis which excludes the prior year and currency quarter's item I mentioned in my opening comments. On an adjusted basis year-over-year revenue increased 8% with non-interest income up 8% and net interest income up 9%. Expenses increased 5%. The provision for credit losses was a credit of 10 million in the quarter primarily reflecting ongoing improvement in credit quality. Adjusted net income was 18% higher year-over-year. On an adjusted basis compared to last quarter, revenue increased 3% with non-interest income up 4% and net interest income up 3%. Expenses increased 3%. Adjusted net income was 7% higher sequentially. Client assets under custody of 6.2 trillion increased 3% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. In the year-over-year comparison strong new business was partially offset by the currency impact of a strong dollar as I mentioned earlier as well as lower bond markets. In the sequential quarter comparison, the positive impact of new business and currency translation was partially offset by lower international equity markets and lower global bond markets. Assets under management were 946 billion, up 2% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially versus last year higher fixed income cash and securities lending collateral were partially offset by lower equity assets driven in part by the stronger dollar versus last quarter cash and securities lending collateral were both down modestly and decline in equity assets resulted from certain clients rebalancing out of equity index mandates. Let's look at the results in greater detail starting with revenue on Page 4. Second quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was approximately $1.3 billion, adjusted for the gain I mentioned earlier revenue was approximately 1.2 billion up 8% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Trust, investment and other servicing fees the largest component of revenue were 757 million up 7% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Fees in our corporate and institutional services business increased 9% year-over-year and 6% sequentially while fees in our wealth management business grew 4% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. New business and higher equity markets were drivers of growth but currency translation as I mentioned earlier detracted from overall fee growth in the year-over-year comparison by approximately 2 percentage points. Lower money market mutual fund waivers also contributed to growth this quarter. Fee waivers were approximately 28 million in the second quarter down 2.5 million year-over-year and 5 million sequentially. I will go into further detail on trust and investment fees shortly. Foreign exchange trading income was $75 million in the second quarter, up 41% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. Currency volatility and client trading volumes were higher versus last year but were muted versus last quarter. Other non-interest income excluding the Visa gain was 73 million in the second quarter down 3% from last year and 2% sequentially. Within other non-interest income securities commission and trading income was $20 million up 12% year-over-year due to higher referral fees and income on interest rate protection products used by our personal clients. Sequentially, security commissions and trading income increased 2% primarily due to higher referral fees. Excluding the Visa gain other operating income of 38 million in the quarter decreased 7% year-over-year and 3% sequentially, reflecting a number of miscellaneous income categories including for example lower loan and banking related fees and currency hedges. Net interest income, which I will also discuss in more detail later, was 275 million in the second quarter when adjusted for the lease impairment increasing 9% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Let\u2019s look at the components of our fee revenues on Page 5. For our corporate and institutional services business, fees totaled $432 million in the second quarter, up 9% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees were $294 million in the second quarter, up 12% year-over-year and 6% sequentially while assets under custody for C&IS clients were $5.7 trillion at quarter end, up 3% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. In the year-over-year comparison strong growth primarily reflects new business and higher equity markets, partially offset by the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. In the sequential comparison, new business was again a primary driver of growth. Recall too that some custody and fund administration fees in C&IS are based on one quarter lag asset values. Higher first quarter markets therefore helped second quarter fee growth while lower current period equity and bond markets negatively impacted client asset values. Investment management fees in C&IS of 81 million in the second quarter were up 4% year-over-year and 5% sequentially, primarily due to new business and lower fee waivers. Money market mutual fund fee waivers in C&IS were 14 million, 8% lower year-over-year and 11% lower sequentially driven primarily by higher gross yields in the funds. Assets under management for C&IS clients were $714 billion, up 2% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially. As I alluded to earlier, a small number of clients specifically sovereign wealth funds rebalanced their portfolios in the second quarter moving out of equity index mandates. Securities lending fees were 27 million in the second quarter, 11% lower than last year and 24% higher sequentially. The year-over-year decrease reflects lower fee splits in spreads, partially offset by higher volumes. The sequential quarter increase primarily reflects the traditional second quarter impact of the international dividend season, which resulted in wider spreads. Securities lending collateral was 120 billion at quarter end, up 3% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially. Other fees in C&IS were 31 million in the second quarter, up 16% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially. The year-over-year increase reflects a number of items including higher fees from benefit payments and investment risk and analytical services. The sequential quarter decrease primarily reflects seasonally higher revenue for benefit payment services typically seen in the first quarter. Moving to our wealth management business trust investment and other servicing fees were $325 million in the second quarter, up 4% year-over-year, reflecting higher equity markets and new business. Growth was relatively consistent across the regions and particularly strong in the global family office. Wealth management fees increased 1% sequentially. Recall that wealth management fees are based primarily on month or quarter lag asset values. Thus higher equity markets in the first quarter resulted in a favorable sequential fee comparison. In addition, weight, fees and money market mutual funds were lower. Money market mutual fund fee waivers and wealth management totaled $15 million in the current quarter, down 8% year-over-year and 17% sequentially. Assets under management for wealth management clients were 232 billion at quarter end, up 4% year-over-year and down slightly sequentially. Moving to Page 6, net interest income was 258 million in the second quarter, up 2% year-over-year and down 3% compared to the first quarter. Recall from my opening comments that the 17.8 million lease impairment is reflected in net interest income. Excluding that item, net interest income was $275 million, up 9% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. A larger balance sheet was a primary driver of growth in net interest income. Earning assets averaged 104 billion in the quarter, up 9% versus last year and 5% versus last quarter. Total deposits averaged 92 billion in the quarter, up 9% year-over-year and 7% sequentially with strong growth in non-interest bearing demand deposits. We also saw solid loan growth this quarter particularly in private client and commercial real-estate lending. Loan balances averaged 33 billion in the second quarter up 10% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. The net interest margin was 1.06% when adjusted for the lease impairment, flat compared to the prior year second quarter and down 4 basis points sequentially. The sequential decline in the net interest margin primarily reflects a lower yield on the loan portfolio as mix shifts to lower yielding products and a lower yield on the securities portfolio due to higher premium amortization in our mortgage-backed securities portfolio. Premium amortization in the second quarter was 15 million compared to 10 million in the first quarter. Turning to Page 7, expenses were $855 million in the second quarter, up 5% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. Adjusting for the second quarter items both this year and last year expenses were 5% higher year-over-year and 2% higher sequentially. Compensation expense adjusted for the prior year's charges increased 4% year-over-year primarily reflecting higher incentive comp. The impact of annual merit increases and staff growth partially offset by the favorable impact of movements in currency rates. Staff levels increased approximately 4% year-over-year with more than 80% of the growth emanating from our global operating centers in Bangalore, Manila and Limerick. On a sequential basis compensation expense increased 2% due primarily to annual merit increases and staff growth was 1%. Employee benefit expense increased 10% year-over-year when adjusted for prior year charges, primarily driven by higher pension and employee medical expense. On a sequential quarter basis, employee benefit expense was essentially flat. Outside service expense was 3% higher year-over-year adjusted for prior year charges and 9% higher sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher technical service expense. The sequential increase primarily reflects higher expenditures for consultants, sub-custodians and legal. Equipment and software expense was up 7% year-over-year while adjusted for the prior year software right-offs and 4% sequentially reflecting ongoing support of client and regulatory technology initiatives. Other operating expense includes the $45.8 million charge associated with our voluntary cash contributions to four constant dollar NAV funds. Excluding that item, other operating expense increased 11% year-over-year primarily driven by higher charitable donations and higher charges associated with account servicing activities. In the sequential comparison other operating expense decreased 6%, reflecting seasonally lower business promotion and marketing costs. Turning to Page 8, we continue to make progress on our goal to improve core profitability and returns. We closely track the ratio of expenses to trust and investment fees and remain focused on driving that ratio lower. As shown on Page 8, this important parameter of our progress improved to 107% in the second quarter on an adjusted basis excluding charges. This combined with the growth in other revenue categories produced meaningful operating leverage again this quarter, resulting in improvement in our adjusted pre-tax margin to 32% and in our adjusted return on equity to 11.8%. Turning to Page 9, our capital ratios remained solid with common equity Tier 1 ratios up 12% and 10.7% respectively calculated on a transition basis for both advanced and standardized. On a fully phased-in basis our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the advanced approach would be approximately 11.7% and under the standardized approach will be approximately 10.4%. All of these ratios are well above the fully phased-in requirement of 7%, which includes the capital conservation buffer. The supplementary leverage ratio at the corporation was 6.3% and at the bank was 5.6% both of which exceed the 3% requirement which will be applicable to Northern Trust in 2018. With respect to the liquidity coverage ratio, Northern Trust is above the 80% minimum requirement effective as of January 1, 2015 and is also above the 100% minimum requirement that will become effective on January 1st, 2017. As Northern Trust progresses to fully phased-in Basel III implementation there could be additional enhancements to our models and further guidance from the regulators on the implementation of the final rule, which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final Basel III rules. In the second quarter, we repurchased 1.3 million shares at a cost of $97 million. Our 2015 capital plan provides for the repurchase of up to an additional 578 million of common stock through June of 2016. In closing, Northern Trust continued to perform well this quarter. Disciplined execution around both growth and productivity priorities remain solid as evidenced by over strong operating leverage and our expense the trust and investment fee ratio of 107%. As I mentioned earlier when adjusted for this quarter's items our pre-tax margin was 32% and our return on common equity was 11.8% both reaching 5 year highs. In our institutional business, C&IS continues to perform well with growth coming from both existing and new clients. For example, we recently began providing global custodies at Queensland Investment Corporation, a client for whom we first began providing fund administration in 2011. The third and second Swedish National Pension Funds or AP3 and AP2 as they are known recently announced they have each appointed Northern Trust as the Global Custodian. This is a reappointment from AP3 a long time client and the beginning of a new relationship with AP2. Other announced wins include RPMI Railpen in the United Kingdom and the University System of Maryland Foundation. These wins signify the momentum in our institutional business as well as the diversity of new business globally across products and by client segments. In our personal business, wealth management remains well positioned in the affluent market offering comprehensive solutions to our clients. For example, solid loan growth of 7% demonstrates the success of our customized lending strategy as we support client demand while maintaining excellent credit quality. Wealth management also continues to manage expenses very well, driving further growth and pre-tax profit margins which have consistently exceeded that of peers. Our commitment to returning capital shareholders continues, as we increased our common dividend by 9% and returned a 182 million to common shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. This was accomplished while continuing to maintain strong capital ratios that support our growing business. Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust's second quarter earnings conference call today. Bev and I would be happy to answer your questions. Lisa please open the lines. Operator : Thank you, Sir. [Operator Instructions]. And we will take our first question from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : A couple of questions, just one -- kind of clean-up question, I know you mentioned the one-time charge for the NAVs -- stable NAV product. I guess I just wanted to understand -- make sure I understood why that was happening now? Biff Bowman : Sure, Betsy. We constantly evaluate our liquidity products and suite of products that we provide to our clients. And as you are well aware there is a lot of SEC reform and other items that have been appearing. So as we went through the evaluation process, we looked at some of the legacy issues that existed in four funds and make the determination as a management team that the right time to address the legacy issues losses and there it was -- was now. I'll be clear, all four funds traded above the $0.995 NAV price that is required. These top-ups will bring them to $1. Betsy Graseck : And is that all in preparation for the money market reform that\u2019s going to be coming into effect next year in October? Biff Bowman : That is a part of it, but it was also as we're looking at our array of liquidity products and offerings to our clients in conjunction with that reform. We felt that this was the right time. Betsy Graseck : And then just separately on Omnium, I'm sure if you mentioned it too much during this conference call. But I just wanted to get a sense as to how important that platform is for some of the wins that you mentioned just now as well and the trajectory and accelerated ASD growth that you've been having? Biff Bowman : It is very important to some of the wins that we've talked about. The platform and the capabilities there has first of all allowed us to have meaningful dialogues with significant hedge funds and other large asset managers. Equally important is the capability is very attracted to very large for instance sovereign wealth funds, large foundations or endowments, particularly around its capabilities to handle complex and alternative investments instruments. So it's been powerful not only the hedge fund clients but to other more traditional type clients as well. Betsy Graseck : And then its more product and services you'll be able to layer into that platform over time? Biff Bowman : So we continually look at its applicability and its functionality to integrate into the broader Northern Trust offering and that's ongoing and something that we are clearly investing in right now. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : Question for your guys in operating leverage clearly really nice job so far in driving that ratio lower year-over-year basis. Two part question I guess A. Bigger picture, how should we think about that heading into back half of the year. And I guess it's my follow-up was one that you guys could address a little bit more with some of the specific items that expanses a) outside services and equipment and software could be a little bit more elevated on this quarter, so I am not sure if you can give us a little more color on whether anything kind of one-off drove it in of course the quarter particularly maybe related to some the investments with regard to the business wins? Biff Bowman : Sure. First we would say that the 8% revenue growth that you saw it requires some investment and some expense to grow with it, but as you pointed out maintaining that leverage as we grow is very important to us, so we're focused on that and continue as you saw drive the expense to trust fees ratio down and produce this quarter 300 points of operating leverage. But specifically around some of the expense line items, let me talk about outside services. What I want to highlight here is that much of the sequential growth that was seen was really directly attributable to the revenue growth that you saw. So for instance sequentially on our outside services line you saw that it grew about 19.7 million. More than half of that is directly attributable to growth for instance in lines like sub-custodian expense, depository expense those are directly related to the revenue growth that you see above. I would also suggest that other lines in there are also attributable to growth for instance we produce consulting or legal spend to help that new products and capabilities. So much of that growth is directly attributable to the revenue lines you see above. On the compensation line and expenses, much of that is supporting that growth that you see and as I highlighted in the prepared remarks we're able to do that in the appropriate type cost centers with over 80% of our hires being in Manila, Bangalore and Limerick, and we've also announced now a new operating center that we're starting in Tempe. So we're getting the cost to serve those in the right locations. Alex Blostein : Just in equipment and software? Biff Bowman : So the equipment and software line reflects the investment we've made, we have, we do need to and we do invest in technology and capital, it's an important part of our value proposition to our clients and that investment as we have previously said led to 7-ish or higher expense growth rate which is higher than the rest of the expense growth rate, but it reflects the investment in our platforms. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Brennan Hawken from UBS. Brennan Hawken : Quick one on FX, remarkably strong here quarter-over-quarter actually sort of a standout and being up sequentially versus some others who reported. Can you speak to what drove that strength and whether or not we should view that as sustainable? Biff Bowman : I would highlight two items around that, the first is our trading results, they don\u2019t always exactly align with the broader market trends as our business is focused on trustee clients and their needs and their unique trading patterns in the quarter. I would also say that we talked about in previous quarters our development and our utilization of FX e-commerce capabilities to provide excellent execution for those clients, but it also allowed us to enhance our efficiencies through more automation. So we believe that led to some of the performance that you saw in the second quarter. Brennan Hawken : Fee waivers came down here which certainly encouraging, I know you all have expressed some concerns about the ability to fully recapture fee waivers now that we're getting closer to the fed actually providing lift-off here on the short-term rates. Can you provide an update with your view on fee waivers and what you think about the potential risks to any recoveries there? Biff Bowman : Sure there are several factors that way in recovery of fee waivers, first will be any pricing that goes on in that market and our competitive ability to match or the need to compete in that marketplace. The second is if you will is there a sharing with the clients that will go on or how will that unfold in terms of as the rates rise, how will we discuss that rise with the clients and share on the rate up. Obviously the amount and the size of the balances in our accounts will also impact the fee waivers as we move forward. We're still waiting for some of that to unfold, I hope you're right that the rate rises on the horizon, but we're taking proactive actions to look at this, to model this out and as we've said we still think that we will be able to recruit a majority of those fee waivers in a rising rate environment. Operator : And we'll now take a question from Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Biff I was wondering, can you talk a little bit about the really big growth in the balance sheet especially on the -- led by the deposit side, non-interest bearing and then your non-U.S. offices. Can you characterize the sources of that, whether it\u2019s coming from other large institutions, or its client driven, and any color on geographic orientation? Biff Bowman : It is client driven, and it\u2019s large deposits held by what you consider to be large asset holders. So, our sovereign wealth funds, central banks -- type of pension client types. It was meaningfully focused in Europe as you saw on the balance presented, some of their activities is as they went through the quarter and looking at they\u2019re bouncing but it also reflects just growth in our core business where we\u2019ve had tremendous success particularly\u2026 Ken Usdin : So if you\u2019re presuming that this is mostly client oriented and sticky, can you also then give us an update on reinvestment strategy, where you\u2019ve taken duration to and what type of investment yields are you getting on new investments versus what\u2019s still running off? Biff Bowman : So Ken if you look at the balance sheet and other items, you can see that we moved some into interest bearing deposits with banks. So, a slightly longer duration has been an overnight if they\u2019re shorter term CDs. And those moneys in there that we felt weren\u2019t operational deposits but were in effect some type of excess deposit we kept in very short type Bank of England or other type investments in the marketplace. So, we put it to work a little longer for those that we viewed was core operational deposits, what we just described in any of those others that we felt were shorter term in nature we\u2019ve applied appropriately into more Central Bank type deposits. Ken Usdin : And just within the securities portfolio, any changes in terms of your strategy, your reinvestment interest? Biff Bowman : I would spare asset sensitivity did not change much sequentially and it remains the duration in the portfolio remains very short around one year, so hope that changes there. Operator : And we\u2019ll now take a question from Ashley Serrao from Credit Suisse. Ashley Serrao : So, first question just on NII. Curious if you expect some of the drag from the premium amortization to abate in 3Q. I am just trying to get a sense of any lags here that we should be mindful of? Biff Bowman : As well as I will highlight here for you, we had about 2 basis point drag to the NIM in the second quarter. And traditionally in the third quarter we\u2019ve seen that improve. However it is really tied to the underlying mortgages and assets that we hold in that portfolio. It\u2019s going to be much more impacted by where the rate environment moves in the quarter. And right now last quarter we were in the third quarter as you would have seen in ours, it was flattish. We\u2019ll have to see how that plays out. I think there is other factors too, there is a housing market, there is seasonality and other items that we think about. The second quarter traditionally has a little bit more premium amortization and then others. Ashley Serrao : And then just on FX, can you just give us some sort of sense of the penetration of your ecommerce FX capabilities. I am just trying to ultimately understand like how much of this year-over-year improvement is driven by greater penetration or was this some of your unique client trading behavior? Biff Bowman : So we continue to try to capture more and more share by bringing the right products and services to our clients. So, whether those are electronic solutions or other automated solutions, and we have been successful in that. It\u2019s hard for me to attribute exactly how much of the FX performance you saw this quarter was due to that. We have continued to improve our market share with our clients and we think some of those products and capabilities we\u2019re investing in are helping make that difference. Operator : We\u2019ll now take a question from Luke Montgomery from Bernstein Research. Luke Montgomery : So, on the expense the core fees ratio that is down a little bit this quarter, you put a goal out there of 100% but I think you also recently said that progress gets harder we achieve from here. When you think about what inning you were in with various revenue expense initiatives you have in place, whether that\u2019s location strategy driving down legal and consulting expense, or capturing more third party FX. Do you have a strong sense of the pace and path to getting to that 100% target? And if you assume for example there is no change in the environment, could you do it in the year, two years? Biff Bowman : So, I\u2019ll start with this, we haven't put 100% target out there for number of reasons; first of all is if we get to a 100% that may not be enough with all of the investment that we\u2019re making and all of the productivity that we\u2019re trying to drive. So, we have not stated a public target of 100%. But we\u2019re in 107 today and we have said we want to continue to drive that down, so I\u2019ll answer your question in that frame work. It does get a little more difficult and you need a balance of revenue growth and expense growth as you have seen with the leverage we've demonstrated here to help to achieve that. That being said, we do think, there are number of initiatives that are ongoing and still in the side innings of the game, where we can make more progress. And while we talk about location strategy, there is still a lot of meaningful effort that the bank can do around looking at where it provides services, that's one example of where we can do that. Consolidating platforms in systems using fewer pricing vendors, there are numerous examples of where we've made progress and that we think we can continue to drive that ratio down. Luke Montgomery : And then it looks like in C&IS custody fees as a percentage of client assets that ticked up nicely this quarter, I calculated about 212 basis points that's the highest it's been in a long time. So I was wondering, if you could -- maybe if you could speak to whether that's business mix pricing anything unusual that I'm not considering and whether you think that could be sustained from here? Biff Bowman : It reflects a few items. First it reflects very strong new business that we've talked about in previous calls and continues to come in. It's both global and across segment that's helping drive the majority of that, you do have a full run rate of Bridgewater in this year, so that is a portion of that versus last year, where we would not have had a full run rate for Bridgewater in that. And I would largely just say it's the success of the new business momentum in across the globe. Luke Montgomery : But it's a new business but it's coming on a higher fees as a percentage of assets or\u2026 Biff Bowman : It's -- we've seen some of the pricing, while I won't say move far north, we've seen the pricing stabilized in across many of that, many of those clients and we think that's help drive some of the improvement that you see. Bev Fleming : Luke, this is Bev, one thing to keep it in mind as well is the calculus there, which is custody and fund administration fees to asset under custody. So to the extent that we continue to be successful in growing our global fund services business which serve asset managers, be a traditional asset managers or hedge funds that will help to fee line and that has certainly been a significant contributor to the fee growth there, but it won't be reflected necessarily in the denominator and assets under custody because what's coming in, in some cases with the asset under administration. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : If you can maybe just talk a little bit about the lending strategy, you mentioned the loan growth was very strong, first of all, the charge I assume is coming out of the loan bucket on the average balance sheet, that the leasing aircraft resurge looks like the yield was fairly confident on a core basis, if you can verify that? And then secondarily, if we can talk a little bit about the leverage to higher rates in terms of loan pricing the lag of resets on your both your commercial and residential books to higher rates. Biff Bowman : First, as you said the nor lease impairment charge the lease impairment charge was flow through the NII and as you likely said our loan yield actually was down 2 basis points driven by mix. So to the first question, the loan strategy there, we have shrunk the residential real-estate by approximately 6% quarter-over-quarter, but if you look at C&I, if you look at commercial real estate and you look at personal loans which we would typically be secured by the investment assets of our client, all of those had growth rate in the teens up to the mid 20s. So across those portfolio we had very high growth, they produced slightly lower yields because of the secured nature and the credit quality which is strong in those. So that was 2 basis points of the NIM and I previously talked about the premium amortization that's pretty much your 4 basis points of NIM. So, that's the loan growth strategy that we've seen as supplying that into largely our wealth management franchise. Your second question I think was around the leverage to rates and movements of rate, approximately two-thirds of the portfolio, entire portfolio is floating, and so we will have a positive reaction to that in that nature. Because our residential real-estate is shrinking as you might expect that's tied probably closer to the 10 year or something 5 to 10 year type rate, that is declining so it makes it slightly less sensitive to those moves. I would just highlight that roughly two-thirds of the portfolio is floating in nature and likely to be sensitive to the rate moves, so. Brian Bedell : And do you have a sense of the average lag -- after rates go up, in terms of the resets on the floating part? Biff Bowman : I don't really have that available, I don't -- Bev if you have that. Bev Fleming : I don't, Brain. Brian Bedell : And then just a follow up to be back to the expenses and obviously very good traction there. If you talked a little bit about the technology investments, numerous investments that you're making in the platform. Can you talk a little bit about to what extent you think over the long-term those enhancements are revenue producing versus just expense reduction? Biff Bowman : Well, they're both -- there are clearly both many of these are investments for instance in technology that will allow our wealth partners to be able to deliver services and capabilities to our clients in a more effective, the holistic manner. Others are quite frankly investments in processing platforms that will allow us to be more efficient. So it is a blend of those that we believe will generate ultimately revenue and those that generate operating efficiencies and it is not just an operating efficiency type investment for those technologies. Brian Bedell : And that would -- dovetail the comments of getting at 107 continue to drive the 107 down even in the near-term? Biff Bowman : Yes. Operator : And we'll now take our question from Jeffrey Elliott from Autonomous Research. Jeffrey Elliott : On the money market fee waivers, why are they down this quarter? Biff Bowman : So, money market fee waivers were down for two reasons in the quarter. One was primarily because the yields are up and short term rates have risen if you look across overnight REPO rates in particular moving up so that's one factor and we've slightly lower cash balances in those funds available. So the combination of those two were the drivers but I would highlight that rate -- the short end of the rate curve moving up does help produce a lower fee waivers. Jeffrey Elliott : And does the -- in the fact that you've been able to get a bit of a benefit from a very small move and short-end of the curve. Does that give you more confidence on your ability to recapture a higher proportion of the fee waivers or is it still kind of too early to tell? Biff Bowman : I would describe it is too early to tell, because I think we need to see probably a more pronounced move as oppose to the 1 to 2 to 3 basis point type moves, we've seen that likely will come with any kind of Central Bank action that may move rates up. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Glenn Shor from Evercore ISI. Glenn Shor : What caused the changes in the fee arrangements in Sec lending. How broad based was that? Was that part of a broad change across the whole book just curious on how that unfolded? Biff Bowman : The competitive nature in securities lending means that we revisit the securities lending fee splits with all of our clients on a regular basis. It remains competitive around fee splits and we negotiate those and have dialogues with our clients on those on a regular basis. We have seen it move modestly against sort of a trend meaning more is returned to our clients than to ourselves and the fees splits that is relatively modest which is the competitive place. Bev Fleming : And Glenn one thing that I would add to that is it, it's not just the fee splits on specific clients but it's also the proportion of revenue that we earned from different clients and to the extent that we have a mix shift in where we're with the clients than it could be that the overall fee split would come down. So, mix plays a roll on that as well. Glenn Shor : And is that something that will take few quarters to annualize if you will meaning this quarter it shows up in your year-on-year number, next quarter we should look to see that flow through on a year-on-year number as well? Biff Bowman : That's a reasonable assumption, I think Glenn. Glenn Shor : And then just one other one was I'm curious the global family office has been growing at a much better pace than the regions. I don't know if that's a smaller base thing or if there are special things you're doing to put more resources at it, just curious if you could talk towards that? Biff Bowman : I would say a couple of items I would highlight there is one, these are ultra high net worth of family offices and others and they tend to be chunkier in the nature of their growths so they have very big opportunities, they come in very large size. And we have a very strong market position in this space in particular we have strong position across all of our wealth management franchise, but in this area in particular, it leverages the technology that we talk about the institutional space significantly as many of these clients can and often look very similar to institutional investors and so is growing similar to what you saw on the corporate institutional side is probably not coincidental. Operator : And we'll now take a question from Adam Beatty from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Adam Beatty : Just want to ask about some of the equity index rebalancing by sovereign, seems like a bit of theme this quarter. What's your sense of what types of products where that money went types of products either Northern Trust or other firms or whether it was a source of liquidity for your clients? Biff Bowman : I don't want to speculate on all the places and when I think they were all rebalancing from asset classes and equity as you saw for perhaps different reasons, it could have been their own liquidity needs, it could have been that they felt that the equity market it had a very strong run and then third I would say is as you know passive management has outperformed active over the most recent periods and some maybe taking a view that in this next environment or perhaps we don't see same type of steady growth that active would begin to outperform passive. So I won't speculate any further on what their decision making process was, but I think those three items were probably in the decision process for many of our clients. Adam Beatty : And I also wanted to ask about engineered equity solutions which you highlighted as an important and growing part of your business. What's the level of interest you're seeing currently there? What kind of fee rates do you get around that business? And what's the growth outlook looking like right now? Biff Bowman : We're having a great dialogues and great conversations, we had a significant win in Europe around that product and capability and we continue to have dialogues with both our wealth and our institutional clients in this space. The take up is very high and the market we feel is very intellectually curious about this product and capability right now. The fee rate really ranges based on the complexity of the instrument we're talking about. I know this won't give you all the guidance you want and we don't give guidance, but it's certainly north of traditional passive management and somewhere less than what you would see in an active spread and then that depends on the complexity of the product where it is closer to equity type activity equity type pricing or more passive type pricing. Operator : And we will take our next question from Jim Mitchell from Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell : Just another -- just a follow-up on the balance sheet, you guys obviously saw some strong deposit growth and I am just trying to get a sense or do you get a sense that you're kind of grabbing some share from more leverage constrained competitors who are trying of push deposits off the balance sheet and let me get you thought on that and if you view that as a long-term sort of market share opportunity to grab some of these deposits because you're much less leverage constrained? Biff Bowman : Yes, so we certainly see clients that are approaching us because of discussions they have had elsewhere around the use of other's balance sheet. I would say that we're taking a transaction by transaction approach to that and looking at the overall breadth and nature of the relationship we attain with those deposits before we take and I am speaking a very large deposits here before we take those on. So if it's an opportunity that say a hedge fund has a billion, we want to dialogue about what the other opportunities are with them other than what we would say as a very transactional oriented deposit or very rate sensitive deposit. And we're actively pursuing those in terms of deal-by-deal. Excuse me when I said we're looking at those deal-by-deal. Jim Mitchell : And then maybe just a follow-up on wealth management, just curious the central region saw revenues that were down when most others up so just was there something unusual in that line item? Biff Bowman : There were in the first quarter there were certain tax related fees that were accrued in the central region. We adjusted those in the second quarter and allocated those out amongst the other regions so it created what would appear to be a negative growth rate for the central region sequentially. Jim Mitchell : But the total numbers I guess fine which is just how it was allocated in the quarter? Biff Bowman : Total number is fine. Operator : And we'll now take a question from Gerard Cassidy from RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Can you share as you've mentioned that you had some very good strong deposit growth in Europe, so the European deposits that had negative interest rates due to the central bank policies in certain countries over there were those new deposits brought on was the customers having to pay you guys to hold the deposits? Biff Bowman : So the answer of that would depend on the currency in which those deposits came in the Swiss, Swedish, Danish and Euro market the answer to that would be yes, not in sterling but in the other currency the answer of that would be yes, we've moved to negative rates in the currencies I discussed. Gerard Cassidy : So that the existing customers and the new ones that came in as well, correct? Biff Bowman : It would be both. Gerard Cassidy : And then second this is more longer term, it was decided that they were not going to include selected Chinese stocks in the MSCI World Indexes. Should that happen at some point in the future, is that an opportunity for you guys to see a bump in your the index funds and everybody having to move to buy those securities to match these MSCI World Indexes and to drive revenues for quarter or two as a even out to the new ratings? Biff Bowman : We haven\u2019t factored that in that would make intuitive sense that there could be a bump with the purchase of those securities in there. But I wouldn\u2019t be able to give you any indication of what the magnitude of that impact would be for us? Operator : And we\u2019ll now take a question from Mike Mayo from CLSA. Mike Mayo : Can you elaborate more on the increase in demand and other non-interest bearing deposits? What is that and why is it going up so much? Biff Bowman : It\u2019s generally just growth in the business and growth in our clients, both domestically and internationally. And some probably have some temporary nature to it but the majority of it is operating oriented deposits that\u2019s reflective of our success across the regions. Mike Mayo : Could you make it a little bit more concrete because these aren\u2019t the interest bearing deposits that\u2019s not savings in money market or that category and it\u2019s a little bit further down and your liability and stockholders equity category. Just any one concrete example would be helpful, because it\u2019s up one third year-over-year and up couple of billion just linked quarter. Biff Bowman : I mean there is clients that are large fund clients or others that have put large balances with this because the nature of perhaps we have a GFS relationship or some other, where it will not be interest bearing they have just left the funds cash or some other portion of that cash no our balance sheet. And we\u2019re trying to determine the interest rate sensitivity to those as we enter a rising rate environment. But it\u2019s probably large GFS or our asset manager type clients were that balance has grown. Mike Mayo : And just preliminarily, how sticky do you think those deposits are, do those play with higher rates or what? Biff Bowman : So the operational component clearly won\u2019t Mike, but we think it will be reasonably rate sensitive as rates rise. Mike Mayo : And redeploying those funds because they went up so much I guess you put a bit more into securities. Is that the main usage of these additional funds? Biff Bowman : So most of it is in deposits with banks as you would see I don\u2019t know that we put our securities portfolio has both long and short-term components to it and some could be in the very short-term components of the securities portfolio. Operator : And we\u2019ll now take a question from Vivek Juneja from JP Morgan. Vivek Juneja : Just a follow up on the question that was asked earlier about deposits from being set by other banks. So did you actually see -- did any of the growth this quarter come from that? Biff Bowman : Modest amount really came from what we would say were outflow from others, most of it was really either our existing clients increasing their balances with us or just growth in general from our franchise. So there probably some modest amount of that but most of it was just core growth. Vivek Juneja : And one last thing just timing on when you\u2019re planning to start disclosing Bev what you referred to earlier the assets under custody and administration. Bev Fleming : Vivek that's something that we continue to work on and to make sure that we have everything aligned internally to get to the point where we wanted do public disclosure of that. So it\u2019s something that we continue to work on. Vivek Juneja : Why is it taking so long, since you\u2019ve been talking about it for a while now? Biff Bowman : I think we want to make sure that we have this right for not only reporting here but for SEC reporting and all the other documentation that\u2019s important to go around it and we continue to invest in it and we\u2019re moving forward when it\u2019s ready to be moved forward. Vivek Juneja : Because I am sure you track this yourself, so it\u2019s a little surprising that you\u2019ve been talking for so long and it\u2019s not yet out? Biff Bowman : Internal management reporting however is different than external when we\u2019re ready to move it forward, we will. Operator : And we\u2019ll take a question now from Brian Kleinhanzl from KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : I just had a quick question on the your opening comments about the advanced purchase and the Fed checking the model, I was just curious as to why you kind of mention that and is there something eminent and then I know the Fed's always reviewing those models, so do you have had recent communication or something that would indicate that there is going to be changes coming soon? Biff Bowman : No, that's a standard statement but as we evaluate our models under the advanced approaches any change in the parameters of the models themselves can produce changes in our advanced approaches ratio, so we cover that off with that statement to acknowledge that, particularly things around operational risk for instance could be changed with different parameters or different events being in database could change those numbers in any given quarter. Bev Fleming : But just to emphasize our commentary this quarter was no different than it had been for the last several quarters. Brian Kleinhanzl : And then just a follow-up question, on those remaining Visa shares, can you walk through the internal thought process on when you sell those? I mean it sounds like it represents about 8% of your tangible equity there. Biff Bowman : So, the decision this quarter was clearly an investment decision that we took as an organization, we have not sold any visa shares any of our Class B shares held to date, but we've seen a meaningful increase in the visa's stock over that period of time and felt it was time to monetize if you will a portion of our gain. So, we do still have remaining post sale of about 5.23 million Class B shares and that today's conversion rate is about 8.6 million A shares. At this point we make investment decisions on a regular basis and we will evaluate those on a regular basis. Operator : And we have no more questions currently in the queue. I would like to turn the conference back over to today's moderators for any additional or closing remarks. Bev Fleming : Well, thank you, Lisa and thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you after we report third quarter results in the month of October, if not sooner. Thank you so much. Have a good day. Biff Bowman : Thanks. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. And we thank you for your participation.",

Let me turn the call over to Biff Bowman. Biff Bowman : Good morning, everyone. Let me join Bev in welcoming you to Northern Trust third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Today I will review our results for the quarter after which Bev and I would be happy to answer your questions. Starting on Page 2 of our quarterly earnings review presentation, this morning we reported third quarter net income of $235 million, earnings per share were $0.96 and our return on common equity was 10.9%. Environmental factors which impact our businesses, as well as our clients were mixed this quarter. Equity markets were lower both year-over-year and sequentially. In US markets, the S&P 500 was down 2.6% year-over-year and down 6.9% sequentially. In the international markets the MSCI EAFE index was down about 11% in both comparisons with the year-over-year decline in particular being driven by the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. In bond market, the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index was slightly lower year-over-year, but higher sequentially. Currency volatility as measured by the G7 index was 60% higher than the third quarter of last year. In the sequential comparison, currency volatility was 1% lower. You will recall that currency volatility influences our foreign exchange trading income as does the level of client activity. Currency rates influence the translation of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar and therefore impact client assets in certain revenues and expenses. The dollar was stronger year-over-year, which tempered custody asset growth and related fee growth, but benefited expense growth. Sequentially, the dollar was stronger against all major currencies except the euro and yen. U.S. short-term interest rates rose slightly yet remained at very low levels continuing to pressure our net interest margin and resulting in fee waivers on our money market mutual funds. Three month LIBOR and fed funds effective rate averaged 31 basis points and 14 basis points respectively, both higher sequentially. The overnight repo rate was also higher increasing 3 basis points to 21 basis points. Let\u2019s move to Page 3 and review the financial highlights of the third quarter. Year-over-year revenue increased 7% with both noninterest income and net interest income up 7%. Expenses increased 5%. The provision for credit losses was a credit of $10 million in the quarter, primarily reflecting ongoing improvement in credit quality. Net income was 15% higher year-over-year. In the sequential comparison, recall three items which were reported to you last quarter, our pre-tax gain of $400 million on the sale of 1 million Class B Visa shares, a pre-tax charge of $46 million related to voluntary cash contributions to four constant dollar net asset value funds and an $18 million impairment of the residual value of eight aircraft under leveraged lease agreements. On an adjusted basis, excluding the second quarter items revenue decreased 2% sequentially with non-interest income down 2% and net interest income essentially flat. Adjusted expenses were also flat, as a result adjusted net income was 5% lower sequentially. Client assets under custody of $6 trillion increased 1% year-over-year, but declined 4% sequentially. In the year-over-year comparison, strong new business and higher bond markets were essentially offset by the currency impact of a strong dollar, as well is lower global equity markets. In the sequential quarter comparison, the positive impact of new business was more than offset by sharply lower equity markets and the impact of a stronger dollar against most major currencies. Assets under management were $887 billion, down 4% year-over-year and down 6% sequentially. In both comparisons a decline in equity assets was the primary driver driven by lower markets, as well as outflows from certain sovereign wealth fund clients in light of economic conditions in their regions. In addition, fixed income assets were lower, primarily due to the loss of one sizable passive mandate from a non-U.S. institution institutional client. Let\u2019s look at the results in greater detail starting with revenue on Page 4. Third quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was approximately $1.2 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Adjusted for the second quarter items that I mentioned earlier revenue was down 2% sequentially. Trust, investment, and other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue and were $749 million in the third quarter, up 4% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. New business and lower money market mutual fund fee waivers were the primary drivers of year-over-year growth with currency translation as I mentioned earlier detracting from overall fee growth by about 2 percentage points. Fee waivers were approximately $28 million in the third quarter, down $6 million year-over-year. The sequential quarter decline in trust and investment fees primarily reflects sharply lower third quarter equity markets and the typical seasonal pattern in securities lending both of which combine to more than offset new business. I\u2019ll go into further detail on trust and investment fees shortly. Foreign exchange trading income was $63 million in the third quarter, up 36% year-over-year and 16% lower sequentially. Currency volatility was higher versus last year, but muted versus last quarter. Other non-interest income was $75 million in the third quarter, up 15% from last year and up 1% sequentially when adjusted for the Visa gain. Within other non-interest income securities, commissions, and trading income was $20 million, up 44% year-over-year due to higher income on interest rate protection products used by our person personal clients. Other operating income of $38 million in the quarter increased 12% year-over-year, reflecting a number of categories, including higher income associated with a third-party servicing agreement, which was modified in December. Net interest income, which I will discuss in more detail later was $275 million in the third quarter, increasing 7% year-over-year and unchanged sequentially when adjusted for last quarter\u2019s lease impairment. Let\u2019s look at the components of our trust and investment fees on Page 5. For our corporate and institutional services business fees totaled $430 million in the third quarter, up 7% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees were $294 million in the third quarter, up 7% year-over-year and flat sequentially, while assets under custody for C&IS clients were $5.5 trillion at quarter end, up 1% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially. The year-over-year growth in custody and fund administration fees, primarily reflects new business, partially offset by the currency translation impact of a stronger US dollar. In the sequential comparison new business was essentially offset by lower equity markets and currency translation. Investment management fees in C&IS of $83 million in the third quarter were up 10% year-over-year and 2% sequentially, primarily due to new business and lower fee waivers. Money market mutual fund fee waivers in C&IS were $12 million, 27% lower year-over-year and 10% lower sequentially driven primarily by higher gross yields in the funds. Assets under management for C&IS clients were $662 billion, down 6% year-over-year and down 7% sequentially, primarily reflecting lower equity markets and the outflows that I mentioned earlier. Securities lending fees were $20 million in the third quarter, 10% lower than last year and 26% lower sequentially. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects lower fee splits on average, the sequential quarter decline reflects the typical season pattern with the international dividend season driving wider spreads in the second quarter of each year. Securities lending collateral was $122 billion at quarter end, up 1% both year-over-year and sequentially. Other fees in C&IS were $33 million in the third quarter, up 21% year-over-year and 7% sequentially, primarily reflecting higher fees from investment, risk, and analytical services. The year-over-year increase also reflects higher fees from benefit payment services. Moving to our wealth management business trust, investment, and other servicing fees were $319 million in the third quarter, unchanged year-over-year and 2% lower sequentially. Global family office fees increased a strong 15% year-over-year and 4% sequentially reflecting new business. Lower fees in the geographic regions, both year-over-year and sequentially primarily reflect the sharp downturn in the equity markets during the third quarter. Money market mutual fund fee waivers and wealth management totaled $15 million in the current quarter, down 9% year-over-year and up 5% sequentially. The year-over-year decline in wealth management fee waivers reflects higher gross yields in the underlying funds. The sequential increase reflects lower yields in municipal and tax-exempt funds, which are used predominantly by personal clients. Assets under management for wealth management clients were $225 billion at quarter end, up 2% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially. Moving to Page 6, net interest income was $275 million in the third quarter, up 7% year-over-year and flat compared to the second quarters adjusted net interest income. The year-over-year growth was driven by a higher level of earning assets and higher net interest margin, while the flat result in the sequential quarter comparison resulted from a lower level of earning assets offsetting a higher net interest margin. Earning assets averaged $101 billion in the quarter up 4% versus last year and down 3% sequentially in both comparisons driven primarily by the level of demand deposits, which averaged $24 billion, up 21% year-over-year and down 5% sequentially. We saw solid loan growth again in this quarter, particularly in private client, commercial and institutional, and commercial real estate. Loan balances averaged $33 billion in the third quarter, up 10% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. The net interest margin was at 1.08% in the third quarter, up 3 basis points year-over-year and two basis points sequentially when compared with the second quarters margin adjusted for the lease impairment. The sequential improvement in the net interest margin primarily reflects a reduction in the lower yielding Interbank and Federal Reserve deposits as funding from demand deposits declined, as well as a higher yield on the securities portfolio due to the lower premium amortization in our mortgage back portfolio. Premium amortization was $14 million in the third quarter compared to $15 million in the second quarter and $13 million one year ago. Turning to Page 7, expenses were $812 million in the third quarter, up 5% year-over-year and down 5% sequentially. As I mentioned earlier, the second quarter included a charge of $46 million. Adjusting for that item in last quarter\u2019s results, expenses increased less than 1% sequentially. Compensation expense increased 4% year-over-year, primarily reflecting staff growth, the impact of annual merit increases and higher incentive compensation, partly offset by the favorable impact of movements in currency rates. Staff levels increased approximately 5% year-over-year with more than 80% of the growth emanating from our global operating centers in Bangalore, Manila, and Limerick and our newest operating centre in Tempe, Arizona. On a sequential basis, compensation expense was essentially flat. Employee benefit expense of $70 million decreased 1% year-over-year as lower employee medical expense offset higher pension expense. On a sequential quarter basis employee benefit expense decreased 5%, due primarily to seasonally lower payroll taxes. Outside services expense of $158 million was 11% higher year-over-year and 8% higher sequentially. The increase in both comparisons primarily reflects higher consulting expense due to evolving regulatory requirements and higher technical services expenses. Equipment and software expense of $114 million was up 13% year-over-year, reflecting higher software related costs in support of client and regulatory technology initiatives. Equipment and software expense declined slightly on a sequential quarter basis. Other operating expense of $65 million declined 6% year-over-year and 43% sequentially. Recall that the second quarter included a charge of $46 million associated with our voluntary cash contributions to four constant dollar NAV funds. Excluding that item, other operating expense decreased 5% sequentially, primarily driven by lower charitable donations. Turning to Page 8, we continue to focus on sustainable improvements in core profitabilities and returns. As shown on Page 8, the ratio of expenses to trust investment fees increased from 107% adjusted for last quarter\u2019s items to 108% in the third quarter, a sequential pattern that is not unexpected given seasonal strength in some revenue lines in the second quarter and the typical second half ramp in some regulatory related spending. This metric remains an important parameter of our progress having improved from 120% in 2012 and we remain committed to lowering it on a sustainable basis going forward. Our return on equity was 10.9% in the third quarter, within our target range of 10% to 15% and while lower than last quarter\u2019s adjusted 11.8% demonstrates improvement over time. Turning to Page 9, our capital ratios remain solid with common equity Tier 1 ratios of 12.4% and 10.4% respectively, calculated on a transition basis for both advanced and standardized. On a fully phased-in basis, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the advanced approach would be approximately 12.1% and under the standardized approach would be approximately 10.2%. All of these ratios are well above the fully phased-in requirement of 7%, which includes the capital conservation buffer. The supplementary leverage ratio at the corporation was 6.4% and at the bank was 5.7%, both of which exceed the 3% requirement, which will be applicable to Northern Trust in 2018. With respect to the liquidity coverage ratio, Northern Trust is above the 80% minimum requirement effective as of January 1, 2015 and is also above the 100% minimum requirement that will become effective on January 1, 2017. As Northern Trust progresses through fully phased-in Basel III implementation there could be additional enhancements to our models and further guidance from the regulators on the implementation of the final rule, which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final Basel III rules. In the third quarter, we purchased 1.9 million shares at a cost of $141 million. Our 2015 capital plan provides for the repurchase of up to an additional 437 million of common stock through June 2016. In closing, Northern Trust continued to perform well in a difficult third quarter macroeconomic environment. Revenue growth was solid at 7% and our focus on profitable growth was evidenced by 14% year-over-year earnings per share growth and a return on equity of 10.9%. In our institutional business, C&IS continues to profitably grow across the globe. Through the first three quarters of 2015, revenue growth in C&IS was 13% and the business generated approximately six points of operating leverage. Growth in C&IS was broad-based with a diversity of wins by geography, particularly in Europe, the Middle East and Asia and by product such as our on boarding of two Fortune 100 defined contribution plans in the quarter. In our personal business, wealth management year-to-date revenue growth of 6% was coupled with strong expense management as wealth management kept expenses flat yielding operating leverage of approximately six points. We also were pleased with the new business results from several markets in which we are focusing resources, including New York, Texas and the global family office. Our commitment to returning capital to shareholders was reinforced with the third quarter total payout ratio of 99%. In the quarter, we declared dividends of 85 million and repurchased 141 million of common stock. This was accomplished while continuing to maintain strong capital ratios that support our growing business. Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust third quarter earnings conference call today. Bev and I would be happy to answer your questions. Aaron, please open the line. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll go first to Luke Montgomery with Bernstein Research. Luke Montgomery : Good morning guys. Biff Bowman : Hi, Luke. Luke Montgomery : I think I asked you last quarter about C&IS custody fees as a percentage of client assets and that it picked up nicely. You spoke to Bridgewater in a mix-shift towards global fund services as positive drivers like now we\u2019ve done a round-trip back to where we were in Q1, so just wondering if there\u2019s anything unusual to call out in Q3 results, business mix, pricing, seasonality, just trying to get understand what the core trend is there and why it\u2019s looking more volatile lately? Biff Bowman : There really isn\u2019t anything unique to call out in the third quarter Luke from previous conversations. It\u2019s business as usual in that space. Luke Montgomery : Okay. With the C&IS asset management fees, the sequential trend was positive. You had lower AUM, you stated the equity markets there. The revenue yield on AUM jumped considerably, so was that explained more by the little fees on the sizable index mandate you called out or did he average versus period and levels factor in there? Biff Bowman : Yeah, the C&IS investment management fees increased slightly in the quarter due primarily to lower money market mutual fund waivers as you suggest and the gross yields improving in the underlying funds, so that was one of the key drivers of that and you talked about the fee realization I believe as well Luke in that comment and it is a factor on those are largely lower yielding type assets in terms of fees, so that actually improves the overall fee realizations as those large passive outflows are at the lower end of our fee spectrum. Luke Montgomery : Okay. So we can kind of think about may be the current level going forward is a good proxy? Biff Bowman : Yes. Luke Montgomery : Okay. Great, thank you very much. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Adam Beatty with Bank of America. Adam Beatty : Thank you and good morning. Just wanted to get your thoughts on flexibility around in this volatile market environment, flexibility around tactical cost-cutting, I know Northern Trust has made significant efforts over the years to improve the margin and cut core costs, what\u2019s your capacity and maybe willingness to make tactical cost cuts to defend the margin in the case of market volatility, thanks. Biff Bowman : Thanks Adam. We are absolutely committed to as we said in our scripted points, we are committed to improving the expenses to trust fee ratios and that is a mixture of both strategic expense and tactical expense initiatives and it can be items that we talked about in the past, our location strategy, technology spend using different storage techniques. I would also argue that around procurement for instance that is a very tactical and strategic investment that we are making to improve our procurement, our process and it\u2019s helping to continue to drive that ratio meaningfully. So, we do look at both tactical and strategic investments to drive the expense in our firm, particularly in relation to the fee growth. Adam Beatty : That\u2019s very detail, much appreciated. And then as a follow-up, just on the outside services it looks like that came up with some additional regulatory or compliance needs, was there anything unusual there, something that we should leery in going forward? Biff Bowman : Yes, on the outside services there were two drivers of the increase you saw particularly the sequential increase, the first as you described in yours was a move up in consulting spend, particularly related to regulatory initiatives. It\u2019s not uncommon for us to see that in the third and fourth quarter as most financial institutions get feedback on their CCAR or their resolution planning in our case and other meaningful regulatory initiatives in the second quarter and hence the work we need to do to embed that in our business as usual process and to continue to move as those goalposts move forward, we need to move forward with them. So, we see some consulting expense ramp typically in the back half of the year related to that. The second part of outside services, another part of the driver of the ramp in that was really what we refer to as technology, technical services expense, that\u2019s items like the cost of market data and also the technology support costs, this is where we perhaps use off-shore situations to support the growth you see in our technology spend. Those were the two primary drivers of the growth in outside services. Adam Beatty : Makes sense. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse. Ashley Serrao : Good morning. Another question on expenses, so, as you push ahead and try to drive towards 100% expense to fee ratio, curious to get your sense about around the timeline there because it feels like absent high markets and rates, you sort of plateaued here, we\u2019ve been in this 109% to 107% band for about like six quarters now, so I was curious how should we be thinking about the payoff from all the efficiency initiatives that you just spoke to? Biff Bowman : Thanks Ashley. The ratio as you rightly point out is both a revenue and an expense component to it and they both matter. So, the ability to continue to grow new business and grow the fees line is as important in improving that ratio, but we do still believe that there is opportunity in items we\u2019ve talked about before. For instance, in our location strategy, we do think there are still drivers in that, in some technological efficiencies i.e. the way we use storage, the way we use the cloud we do believe there are still items there. It is fair to say that that ratio gets harder and harder to drive down as we have taken some of the higher and perhaps easier expense initiatives over time, but we\u2019re focused on both the growth of the fees and the improvement in the expenses and so we do believe we can continue to drive that down. The pace will be helped or hindered by the markets in which we\u2019re operating on the fee line, but we\u2019re continued a strong focus on the expense side continue to drive those because we feel those are much more in our control. Ashley Serrao : Okay. And then just a follow-up on your employee location strategy, latest slide deck sort of points to about 27% of your employees being located in lower cost jurisdictions, are you working towards some sort of target? Is there an optimal state as we think about the evolution of your employee base? Biff Bowman : Yeah. So, as you\u2019ve seen we\u2019ve moved that from 0% to 27% over the last 10 to 15 years. We do not believe that that\u2019s done, we have not set a finite target, and we\u2019ve certainly not publicly disclosed a finite target, but we don\u2019t believe that it is done at 27% and we still think there\u2019s opportunity. As we opened in various locations Manila is a good example, some of our work that supports some of our Asia work has been done in Chicago in a north timezone. There\u2019s opportunities to move that work from Chicago to Manila over time and we\u2019re continuing to look at that which will help move that number to something higher than 27%. Ashley Serrao : Okay. And now just a clean-up question, what was expense growth on a constant currency basis? Biff Bowman : On a constant, it added about 2.5 points on a currency adjusted basis point similar to the revenue growth, so as we discussed, both we\u2019re impacted, revenue about 2%, expense about 2.5%. Ashley Serrao : Okay. Thank you for taking my questions. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Hi, thanks for taking the questions. One more on expenses, sorry, big topic here this quarter, but the increase that we saw in outside services from regulatory and tech, how much of that was sustainable do you think and can you help us unpack the forward shift in that line? Biff Bowman : Yeah, that\u2019s a little difficult to say as the bar around the regulatory world continues to move. We would suggest that in the second half of the year that that spend could continue and then as we finalize and get ready for resubmissions of a capital plan or the resolution plan or other documentation, we\u2019ll wait for feedback and see if the progress we want to make matches up with the expectations. So, I\u2019m hesitant to give you anything more than that in the second half of the year, we will continue to need to spend as we continue to try to embed the process and quite frankly generate a return on the investment we\u2019re making in that business on the regulatory side for our shareholders. So, second half is traditionally where you see that kind of ramp and we\u2019ll wait for feedback in the first part of 2016. Brennan Hawken : But I mean given that the CCAR timing is now mid-year in 2016, that doesn\u2019t change that pattern at all? Biff Bowman : It could change it by quarter right? It\u2019s been pushed back by a quarter. So\u2026 Brennan Hawken : Okay. So, sustainable \u2013 just paraphrasing just to make sure I understand, sustainable at these levels up through 1Q of 2016? Biff Bowman : Yes. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Thank you. Biff Bowman : I think you\u2019re saying, are you saying let me make sure I understand, are you saying that there is a ramp through the end of the first quarter when we submitted in April? Are you saying we could see heightened level of consulting spend through the first quarter? Brennan Hawken : What I was trying to understand was the uplift that we saw this quarter is that sustainable through 1Q of 2016? Biff Bowman : It could be. We have to wait and get feedback. I think we\u2019re seeing how we need to respond to the issues we have in front of us. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Okay, so okay understood that that visibility is not perfect there but this is as good of a starting off point as any. Biff Bowman : I think so. Brennan Hawken : All right, I\u2019ll move on. So, I understand and I appreciate the comments about the outflows in C&IS, but could you help us maybe with a bit more granularity there just so we can understand some of these AUM shifts in particular on the fixed income side. I know there was the fixed index mandate that outflowed, but can you maybe help us understand with that everything as far as the shift, was there some data in FX drop as well just trying to unpack that rather significant dramatic drop especially in the fixed income line? Biff Bowman : Yeah, we would suggest that it was largely a result of the flows that we just talked about. That it was the outflows of one significant fixed income passive mandate from a non-US client and it was a significant outflow and then we have large sovereign wealth passive mandate clients who for their own strategic purposes in that region have needed to make asset decisions and we saw significant outflows in some of those large sovereign wealth funds as well. Those were the primary drivers as opposed to some macro trend that I think you\u2019re suggesting elsewhere. Brennan Hawken : I just want to understand what it is, but thanks, that color helps and I know this is normally Luke\u2019s push, but I\u2019ll second it, it would be really helpful to get those specific flows disclosed just for your consideration. Biff Bowman : Thanks. I appreciate that and stay tuned for the next quarter, 10-K, stay tuned for the 10-K. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi good morning. Biff Bowman : Hi Betsy. Betsy Graseck : I had a question around the balance sheet. I was intrigued by the fact that your deposit came down a bit and I was wondering what drove the increase, is it around conversations you\u2019re having with clients? Is it around pricing? Biff Bowman : Yeah, so on the balance sheet, some of the sequential decline that you saw was just normal flows. We have large clients that from time to time can leave large balances and go in any quarters, but I would add to that we have instilled I think a strong discipline around looking at large additions to the balance sheet and have a rigorous process around dialog with the clients on those on really a transaction by transaction basis where we look at what the returns, what the liquidity costs of that would be to the firm and have active dialogues. We like to think about the needs of our clients really from a liquidity perspective and that dialogue is, is the balance sheet to the right vehicle or are there some off-balance-sheet vehicles that are equally attractive so that dialogue could very well have the move to a money market fund of some type and we are our Treasury and our asset management groups are linked and work closely to solve those kind of demands on needs of our clients and so we\u2019ve managed that constructively. Betsy Graseck : I thought that was great because I know the industry is working to try to make sure that you bring in as little non-operating deposits as possible, for a variety of reasons. Should we expect that this will continue in the sense that your balance sheet size could come down a little bit more? And obviously it supports the NIM, as well. Just wondering how you see that progress from here. Biff Bowman : I think the discipline that I described will absolutely continue, but we\u2019re a liability driven business model as you know well. So if we continue to grow our asset servicing businesses, working with them you can see that growth, just what I would call organic growth in the firm. So we have to manage that, it is the, as you described it the non-operational deposits that we\u2019re monitoring very closely. Betsy Graseck : And have you disclosed what those nonoperating deposit balances are? Biff Bowman : We have not. Betsy Graseck : Okay. All right. Thanks. Operator : And we will go next to Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks very much. Curious, in the comments on lending down 10% year on year, you mentioned about the different fee splits, and I remember that being the case last quarter. So I\u2019m just curious, when did that kick in? I know there\u2019s no magical date but when that kicked in. I\u2019m more asking from the standpoint of, once it\u2019s anniversaried, I doubt we\u2019ll see the same magnitude of down year on year. So, I\u2019m asking, do we see it again next quarter? Biff Bowman : The anniversary would be I think the first quarter of 2016. So we could see that one more quarter and as we described it is the, as you will see on a sequential basis and really the spread is on a year-over-year basis, on a year-over-year basis the spreads in the volumes are fairly similar. It was clearly split driven, and the performance and that is, the clients, our clients whose securities are being lent just have an unfavorable split relative to what we\u2019ve had historically and that has moved that split against us if you will. That trend we think will lap in the first quarter of 2016. Glenn Schorr : Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then the last one is, just the big difference between family office and rest of wealth management fees. You noted new business. I\u2019m just curious how much of it is new business versus just mix to the clients on different asset mix, more fixed income oriented, and that would explain some of the big differences, as well? Or is it all new business? Biff Bowman : It\u2019s meaningfully new business is a driver and if you think of that space it is the mandates in that space are very large. Those are large hundred million to billion plus type mandates. So they have a scale when they come in. Some of it is the mix in the business as you described, the asset management makes they have more cash in the GFO, which while lower yielding we haven\u2019t seen any degradation in those balances like we have in other areas. And then the other areas in the regions while the size of those portfolios maybe smaller there is flows and if you think of that a $10 billion current in a lower yielding environment is using some of the principal if you will to live more frequently and that creates some issues in the larger GFO space, there is many more assets to help deal with that issue. Glenn Schorr : Totally understand. Appreciate it. Thanks, Biff. Operator : And we will go next to Alexander Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alexander Blostein : Great. Hello, everybody. Just to follow up on the balance sheet discussion I guess, we\u2019ve seen most of the bigger banks trying to push deposits out. You guys are not constrained by SLR like some of your larger peers. And I think that\u2019s come up in the prior calls, as well, but just curious to hear what you guys are seeing in terms of industry pricing, and whether or not if some of your larger competitors start to jack up pricing to get a little bit more aggressive on pushing deposits out, what kind of an opportunity does that create for your business? Would you consider that opportunity and how you would approach that? Biff Bowman : Thanks Alex. So I will take that in kind of two parts. The first is, as I mentioned earlier we do look at those opportunities transaction by transaction and we do see some of those were they\u2019ve been I don\u2019t want to say pushed out, they\u2019ve had discussions with the current providers and don\u2019t like the economics of that trade. We look at those, but we\u2019re also looking at with the lens towards what we can generate from a return on our capital on those transactions. On the second part of that in pricing if you will in this space in particular we stay very closely abreast of the market. We evidence that when we went negative in Europe say for instance and some of those rates in Europe are moving even further negative, I think we went to negative 20, we are still at negative 20, but we will continue to look at how those rates move in the U.S., in U.S. dollars there are some competitors who appear to be charging for non-operational deposits in the marketplace. We will keep a close eye on that, we have not made that decision today we have some difficult constraints different constraints as you point out, but we want to stay abreast of market pricing to generate the appropriate level of returns. Alexander Blostein : Okay. Got you. And then, sorry, just one more question around expenses, just to round out that discussion. There\u2019s been lots of back and forth over the course of the call, obviously, on the topic, but if we take a step back, and in the past you guys talked about getting the expenses to core fees ratio not necessarily to 100, but even potentially below that, like as in 100 is not the end goal, with the flattish equity market backdrop and slightly higher regulatory expense spend like we\u2019ve seen this quarter, is it still reasonable to think you have enough flexibility to get that ratio lower over the next 12 to 18 months? Understanding there\u2019s going to be quarterly volatility in this number but just taking a step back I think that would be helpful to sum that up. Biff Bowman : Yes. We do think we have enough initiatives ongoing inside the firm to help drive that. Again as we pointed out the revenue side of that equation is important as you described of flat markets don\u2019t help that ratio, but we do believe just in the series of expansion initiatives we have over the longer run we can continue to drive that down and you may get some quarterly volatility as you describe but we do believe we can drive it down. Alexander Blostein : Okay. Thanks. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Hi, good morning, folks. Just maybe even longer term on expenses and really focusing more on the investment in the business. Obviously, you guys have been very aggressive longer term in building EBIT and investing for organic growth. How do you balance that desire to bring the 108% down with further investments in the asset servicing capabilities, particularly in alternative services and middle office? And do you have things on the near-term horizon that make you think you want to do that sooner rather than later? Or do you think you can postpone that until we get a much better revenue environment? Biff Bowman : We have a portfolio of businesses some of which will require investment as you described and we may run that ratio different, but we have other businesses that are of different levels of maturity what we do as a management team and as a firm is think about the overall growth rate of the firm. We think 7% revenue growth rate in this environment was a meaningful achievement for the firm. We gear those expenses to try to be able to fund that level of growth. So in this period it was 5% to generate 7% of growth, still leveraging the business. In any given business say servicing asset manage managers as you call, we may have that investment period for a period of time create little to no leverage for a business line, but not at a firm level. We still are looking at driving that leveraging into our business. We\u2019re at the top line every can grow seven funding it with five [indiscernible] expense growth is something that we think generates an acceptable return for shareholders. Brian Bedell : Great. And it is nothing, no initiative is big enough to really move the needle enough in that regard and rather, go ahead I\u2019m sorry. Biff Bowman : I\u2019m sorry it is a series of initiatives. Brian Bedell : Yes. Okay and then maybe just switching gears a little bit to asset management, I guess again through longer term how do you view the sovereign wealth dynamic obviously that this quarter for the entire industry there were a lot of outflows, but how do you view that as the client channel longer term and also how do you think you\u2019re positioned within your asset management business passively and actively for longer term demand in non-US institutional clients. Biff Bowman : So, the \u2013 particularly the large asset management clients in the sovereign wealth funds you described generally have very broad based relationships with the banks. So, we have asset servicing and asset management relationships with them and we have seen over time some of them for instance are geared to oil prices they have ebbs and flows in the valuations and the wealth they create, so we don\u2019t while we see this as a difficult environment currently at current oil prices for instance those will change over time and their asset allocation and their recommitment to certain passive has over periods of time moved back up. So we\u2019ve seen them add assets into the pass of capability in the best of times and we trained trench if you well in times where they need to use those for the local. But we are broad based relationships where you know those clients well and we think their commitment to the passive space is probably in the long-term something that will continue. We happen to be in a period where it is creating more outflows than inflows, but those generally have then what we would consider to be accretive clients over time. They are adding assets to their portfolio. Brian Bedell : Great. And importantly you have the whole relationships so there is a broad suite of services that you are providing for those clients. Okay, great. Thanks that\u2019s very helpful. Operator : And we will go next to Jeffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Jeffrey Elliott : Hello thank you for taking the question. Maybe I could start by asking about distributed ledger technology in block shade what seems to be a very hot topic at the moment, how do you think that was going to impact the custody business and more than just specifically looking out of few years? Biff Bowman : Thanks Jeffrey. We are like many firms looking into the block chain and its potential applications. We are working under the premise really that if you can help, if something can help us perform more effectively and efficiently in service to our clients in areas like operational optimization or asset safety or transparency that we\u2019re going to continue to pursue it aggressively. Currently, we\u2019re close to formalizing a proof of concept effort with a third-party that will help us through or disprove some of what has been theorized around block chain in the institutional space and I think I will probably leave it at that to say we are on the case and there are significant efforts in side of the organization to see how this will impact us. Jeffrey Elliott : And then just to follow up on some of the earlier questions on regulation you mentioned that there are a couple of areas you are focusing on no following the feedback earlier in the year, how would you kind of characterize the size of those projects compared with what you\u2019ve done in previous years. Biff Bowman : While we won\u2019t give any specific feedback that we got from a regulator they continue to look for us to enhance if you will our modeling capabilities, around how we model certain elements of our submission and our documentation around that. I think they also, feedback we are trying to do is how can we embed this into our business as usual processes, so that\u2019s not a stand-alone exercise, I\u2019m talking specifically around CCAR. For instance how can we use the tools and the models that we use to further enhance processes that we have inside the bank. So we are investing in that with outside expertise to understand how others have done that and how we might best maximize, if you will, the work we need to do from a regulatory standpoint to further leverage it into our business as usual processes. Jeffrey Elliott : So similar sort of projects to this year is a bigger or smaller? Biff Bowman : I would say they\u2019re different. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re bigger or smaller, but I just think there are different types of projects, for instance, there could be certain line items that you want to fund this year to build models for versus in previous submissions different items. Jeffrey Elliott : Right. Thank you very much. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Hi, Biff and Bev. Just a follow-up question just on the business environments. Obviously, it\u2019s tough to kind of see the good growth you guys are having underneath the surface given the market levels. But has anything changed over the summer in terms of quiet activity in new business potential, whether it\u2019s on the core servicing side, or inside regional side of wealth management? Biff Bowman : Yes. So in both of our businesses, the new business opportunities remain robust and they remain robust across geographies, across product types, across client types. Our new business momentum again in both is quite strong. And as we look into the fourth quarter and beyond, we still see that that robust opportunities set exist in both businesses really haven\u2019t seen any diminution in that. Ken Usdin : Okay. And then on the wealth management business specifically, just look at it excluding the fee waiver delta, the business has just kind of flattened out growth wise. And so could you just help us understand, is that a \u2013 is there pricing inside the business perhaps, is it activity levels like you\u2019re alluding to a little bit before, kind of what are the just the ins and outs of the growth dynamics inside the regional wealth management business? Biff Bowman : Yes. So if you look either the flattening out or the decreases depending on if you\u2019re looking sequentially are year-over-year. It was almost entirely driven really by the negative impact of the sharply lower equity markets that we have in the third quarter on the sequential decline and relatively flat on a year-over-year. Money market fee waivers perhaps somewhat ironically in that business sequentially were a little bit of a drag as opposed to year-over-year, where there were a benefit. There were some positives in that business, if I could highlight them. I mean, the new business remains strong. We\u2019ve been able to look at some fee discount reductions that was a positive influencer in that business on a year-over-year basis, but again the markets produced a drag. And then lastly, I would say is around the product usage in that space, as we\u2019ve seen some trends, if you will, from active equity, say, passive equity that has created some compression in the fees and the fee realization in the space. The combination of those has flattened that business out. I would only highlight one thing. Now when we look at our competitive landscape particularly in the quarter, this is \u2013 we think this is probably a result that is still relatively strong. It\u2019s a tough \u2013it\u2019s been a tough set of comparable financials for this space. Ken Usdin : Right, understood. Okay. Thanks, Biff. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Marty Mosby : Hey, guys. I had two kind of different or the larger kind of questions. One is, Biff, we talked about a year ago balance sheet utilization and duration and asset, we\u2019ve seen a lot of the banks starting to look at the lower for longer scenario more aggressively and started to make some changes in their portfolio. You\u2019ve made some movements over the last year and just wanted to kind of get a feel for what\u2019s your thought process at this moment looking out over the next year and the potential to go ahead and take advantage of the yield curve a little bit more? Biff Bowman : Okay, thanks, Marty. Our asset liability committee meets monthly and has a very active dialogue about our thought process around rates and where we are from a duration standpoint. I would only add one comment, I think that generally our investors have \u2013 while they care a lot about net interest income, big duration bets is not been something that the bank has looked at, as enhancing to the overall economic return of the bank. That being said, we certainly have interest rate forecasts that we consider. And we have a view on what we think rates will do inside that committee and we\u2019ll make up the appropriate duration bets since I met the appropriate duration for the portfolio through the ALCO Committee. Marty Mosby : And then the other thing is, you\u2019ve talked about your capital position continuing to get stronger, which it has been, and you\u2019re well above what would be your required levels. Just curious in a sense of any types of window or opportunity, you can\u2019t really go above a hundred, or let\u2019s assume that you can\u2019t go above a hundred, because regulatory constraints. What incremental opportunities you have to utilize more that, capital that\u2019s sitting on your balance sheet for business opportunities? Biff Bowman : Yes. So we \u2013 as you saw, we were at a 99% of total payout ratio in the quarter, and we had a fairly high total payout ratio. We would tend to agree that we think anything above 100% would be very difficult in this environment. So we continue to look at where that capital could be deployed whether that\u2019s in M&A, or whether that\u2019s in other investment inside the firm. And we make those decisions on a regular basis with the firm. We do look at opportunities from time to time, and we\u2019ll continue to do that as alternative uses of the capital. Marty Mosby : Thanks, Biff. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Mike Mayo with CLSA. Mike Mayo : Hi. I guess, no good deed goes unpunished. You were one of two large banks that do not cut the dividend. And here you are with all these extra expenses to deal with CCAR, but I guess, that\u2019s the way things are. But why are your regulatory consulting expenses so much higher, so much later than your peers? Is this just the lifecycle of dealing with the regulators since you were kind of the second wave of CCAR? And just to clarify the answer earlier, the elevated level of consulting expenses will be there in the fourth quarter, and it\u2019s likely to be there in the first quarter also, because that would be three quarters in a row, three or four quarters in a year just, is this something that should be around for a while? Biff Bowman : Yes. So I would say on the first part of the question, we\u2019ve only submitted twice under the CCAR regime to your point. So our experience at the CCAR level is still relatively early versus our peers. So the feedback and the work that we need to do will continue in that space. And it\u2019s not just CCAR related, so we were a wave three in resolution planning, for instance. So really getting first sets of feedback around resolution planning versus what you would consider GSIB or other listing providers. So I would say, we\u2019re in different phases in different spaces. In terms of being clear on the ramp in consulting spend, it clearly manifested itself in the third quarter. Don\u2019t have line of sight completed in the fourth quarter, but it could remain elevated at this level unsure. And then in the first quarter of next year, it could still be elevated from levels the year before, but not sure that it will be at the level of Q3 then we\u2019ll wait and get feedback shortly thereafter. So, hopefully, I don\u2019t know that I portrayed that as a diminishing level of this spend, because we still have to see. But right now, it will be elevated on a year-over-year comparison basis. Mike Mayo : And when you talk about getting a return on this investment, isn\u2019t the main return just not failing and being allowed to return more capital and having life less concern for the regulators? Biff Bowman : That\u2019s a meaningful or meaningfully desired outcome. But I would say some of the models and tools that we can use can be used, for instance, to help us model trust fee growth and projections to help build our own planning scenarios, our own internal planning scenarios. We can use some of the tools we use for better loan-loss estimation techniques. And there are many other tools that we can embed into our business and not use them just as a standalone CCAR model, but really help run elements of the business. Mike Mayo : All right, thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you, and good afternoon. Biff, can you share with us you talked about loan growth was 10% year-over-year this quarter. And it seem like there was some loan growth outside your traditional wealth management area. Maybe can you give us some color behind what was driving the loan growth this quarter? Biff Bowman : Yes, so it\u2019s similar to the story we\u2019ve talked about in previous quarters Gerard, it\u2019s we got a ramp if you will. Our growth rate in commercial real estate C&I, and what we would refer to as investment secured lending, or personal lending secured by your investment accounts. Those all have double-digit type growth rate offset by a decline in residential real estate. So I think those are largely the growth areas we\u2019ve see in our lending portfolio. It\u2019s also lend ourselves to our portfolio shift, a mix shift, which is allowed for the credit quality, and the strengthening of the credit quality, that you saw to improve and allow for some of the provision release and the reserve release to occur. Bev Fleming : And one thing that I would add to that Gerard, is it some of our commercial, and institutional lending, as well as, some of it\u2019s not a large part of our commercial real estate lending is in the wealth management business unit. So to ultimately to a personal client relationship, so despite the name of the category having commercial in it or institutional in it. We do a lot of lending to our personal clients in those areas as well. As a matter of fact the total loan portfolio at Northern Trust is probably 75% to 80% wealth management or personal loans. Does that help? Gerard Cassidy : Yes, no thank you, it does. Shifting years coming to the global family office business you guys have obviously had good success here. Can you share with us on the new business wins that you\u2019ve talked about earlier. Are these newly created wealthy folks or are you taking the business from another servicer. And if you\u2019re taking the business, what are some of the advantages that you\u2019re bringing to the table that they want to leave their current provider and move to you? Biff Bowman : So, the answer is that it\u2019s some of both, but in many cases this is wealth that\u2019s already been created in the family office exists. The interesting dynamic here is this business often looks like a large institutional investor, so they want a high-end technology, and high-end sophistication to support that family office. And the technology that we\u2019ve built in the platform, we built to support our institutional asset servicing plays very well in that space with the global family offices. It\u2019s a very attractive set of sophisticated solutions that is attractive, it allows us to demonstrate to those individuals that we\u2019ve got a capability to serve these a very high net worth families. So it\u2019s really leveraging what I would say is our institutional platform for these family offices that have many similarities to a large institutional asset owner. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Vivek Juneja : Hi, thanks for taking my question. A quick one how did the Bridgewater deal that you added in the second quarter. Was it in the second quarter for the full quarter, or was that partly 2Q and partly 3Q. And along that line any other such administration type mandates you added in the third quarter? Biff Bowman : The Bridgewater came fully into our run rate in the middle of the third quarter of last year, it came on in August. So you have a little bit of it\u2019s split in this year\u2019s quarter run rate when we go to the fourth quarter it\u2019s fully in from both a revenue and expense standpoint in the next quarter\u2019s comparator. In terms of other large mandates as we called out we had some very significant mandates in the defined contribution space I won\u2019t call out any on the asset servicing side other than what we publicly disclosed. We have had great success in Australia, in particular, around some large asset manager opportunities and several in our European, Middle East, and Africa region as well. So the new business continues to be buoyant. Vivek Juneja : And, Biff, those wouldn\u2019t show up in your AUC numbers, so those would be just additive through the fee line, is that right? Are you referring to those as really coming into the AUC line that we would see? Biff Bowman : So some of those have been won and have not been implemented yet at this point, so you wouldn\u2019t see them in an AUC or in AUA line. But if we\u2019re the custodian obviously you\u2019ll see them in the AUC line. Today, you would not see that in an AUA, you\u2019ll just see the fees. Vivek Juneja : Okay. And similar to your comment earlier about testing the flows in the 10-K potentially, should we expect to see AUCA also in the 10-K? Biff Bowman : We\u2019re working on that, and I\u2019m hopeful that you will see that in the 10-K in the quarter. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Thanks. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : Hey, good afternoon, Biff. Biff Bowman : Hey. Brian Kleinhanzl : So I just had two quick questions. One on the credit. Second quarter in a row that you\u2019ve booked a $10 million credit and provision expense even through charge-offs are ticking up. Is there something here that this should be an ongoing trend in that you\u2019re seeing overall improvement, NPAs are down, and the reason being is that NPAs were down in previous quarters, but you didn\u2019t see that kind of negative provision coming through? Biff Bowman : Yes. So a couple of things. In this quarter, the charge-offs you\u2019re right, slightly higher. But we had specific reserve for over 70% of the charge-offs already accounted for. So that really was a meaningful driver of the release, because we were releasing reserves that had already been accounted for, if you will in this. And in terms of, as I discussed before, the mix of credit in our portfolio is producing stronger credit dynamics. You saw non-performers were down 10%. The mix has improved, really the credit dynamics in the portfolio, so we continue to evaluate that on a quarter by quarter basis. We look at macro trends. So I can\u2019t really say whether that will continue or not, because it depends on how the market evolves. But I know that the overall credit quality right now of our portfolio is improving because of the mix shift I described away from residential real estate and into secured by securities or C&I type loans. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. And then just the second question on the money market fund fee waivers. You mentioned that the yields were improved in the quarter, but it looks like towards the end of the quarter and into the fourth quarter, yields could be down a little bit. I mean, it was just a one quarter impact on the fee waivers, seeing a little it of benefit, and we\u2019re kind of expected to be elevated again in the fourth quarter? Biff Bowman : So that depends on how the yields play out during the course of the quarter. We did see that improvement at the end of the third quarter. As you\u2019ve seen, we\u2019ve seen some erosion in that and we have to see how that plays out for the yields during the course of the quarter in the funds how much more I met. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. Thanks. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll go next to Kirill Pyshkin with Mirabaud. Kirill Pyshkin : Hi. Yes, I had a question about the technology glitch that some of your competitors had in August. So with that regard, do you have any or have you had any discussions that may show that you would benefit from that by winning clients, I don\u2019t know what you could share with us? Biff Bowman : Yes. Well, we\u2019ve not had any discussions that we would disclose here. The industry is certainly looking at that, I\u2019m sure the mutual fund industry is certainly looking at what I\u2019ll call business continuity response to that and how they, if you will secure with their providers the right type of business continuity planning around that, and we\u2019ll leave it at that at this point I think for that for us. We as a firm feel that we have the right controls in place. And evaluated that type of scenario internally, but we feel that that something that we have our own contingency planning around. Kirill Pyshkin : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And that does conclude the Q&A portion of today\u2019s conference. I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to our speakers for any comments or closing remarks. Bev Fleming : Thank you, Aaron, and thank you everybody for calling in today. We look forward to speaking with you soon and to speaking with you again on our next earnings conference call in January. Have a good day. Thank you. Biff Bowman : Thanks. Operator : And, this does conclude today\u2019s conference. Everyone, we thank you for your participation. And you may now disconnect.",

Let me turn the call over to Biff Bowman. Biff Bowman : Good morning everyone. Let me join Bev in welcoming you to Northern Trust's Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Today I was review our results for the quarter and the year after which Bev and I would be happy to answer your questions. Starting on page two of our quarterly earnings review presentation this morning we reported fourth quarter net income of $239 million. Earnings per share were $0.99 and our return on common equity was 11.1%. A number of environmental factors impact our businesses as well as our client. Let me review how some of those factors unfolded during the quarter. Equity markets were lower year over year but higher sequentially. In US market the S&P 500 was down 1% year-over-year and up 6.5% sequentially. In international markets the MSCI EAFE index was down about 3% year-over-year and up 4.4% sequentially with the year-over-year decline being driven by the impact of a stronger US dollar. Recall too that some of our fees are based on lagged market values and the third quarter 2015 markets were generally lower. In bond markets the Barclays US Aggregate Index was lower both year over year and sequentially. Currency volatility as measured by the G7 index was 11% higher than the fourth quarter of last year. In the sequential comparison currency volatility was 4% lower.  Foreign exchange market volumes as measured by two of the Interbank brokers were down over 20% year over year and down about 13% sequentially. You'll recall that currency volatility and client activity influenced our foreign exchange trading income. Currency rates influenced the translation of non-US currencies to the US dollar and therefore impact client assets and certain revenues and expenses. The dollar was stronger year over year which tempered custody asset growth and related fee growth but benefited expense growth. Sequentially the dollar was stronger against most major currencies except the Australian dollar and Swedish krona. U.S. short-term interest rates rose on the heels of the first Federal Reserve rate increase in nearly a decade. Three months LIBOR and the fed funds effective rate averaged 41 basis points and 16 basis points respectively both higher sequentially. The overnight repo rate was also higher averaging 22 basis points in the quarter. Before I move to the highlights of the quarter, allow me to mention one item discussed in our press release. In the fourth quarter, we sold approximately 550 million of non-strategic leases and loans for a net gain of 26 million. We also wrote down by approximately 27 million certain held-for-sale leases, which had a book value of 112 million at year end. The net effect of these two items on other operating income was essentially nil. Let's move to Page 3 and review the financial highlights of the fourth quarter. Year-over-year, revenue increased 2% with non-interest income essentially unchanged and net interest income up 9%. Expenses increased 6%. The provision for credit losses was a credit of 18.5 million in the quarter, reflecting a change in the estimation methodology for inherent losses and improving credit quality. I'll explain the methodology change later on this call. Net income was 2% lower year-over-year. In the sequential comparison, revenue was essentially flat with non-interest income down 2% and net interest income up 8%. Expenses increased 2%. Net income was 2% higher sequentially. Client assets under custody at 6.1 trillion increased 2% both year-over-year and sequentially. In the year-over-year comparison, strong new business was partially offset by the currency translation impact of a strong dollar. In the sequential quarter comparison, favorable equity markets and new business were partially offset by the impact of a stronger dollar against most major currencies. Assets under management were 875 billion, down 6% year-over-year, a decline in equity assets was the primary driver due primarily to outflows from certain sovereign wealth fund clients in light of economic conditions in their regions. A continuation of the trend we mentioned last quarter. In addition, fixed income assets were lower year-over-year, primarily due to the loss of one sizable passive mandate from a non-U.S. institutional client which I mentioned last quarter. Assets under management decreased 1% sequentially, primarily driven by lower securities lending collateral. Let's look at the results in greater detail starting with revenue on Page 4. Fourth quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was approximately 1.2 billion, up 2% year-over-year and unchanged sequentially. Trust, investment and other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue and were 747 million in the fourth quarter, up 3% year-over-year and essentially unchanged sequentially. New business and lower money market mutual fund waivers were the primary drivers of year-over-year growth, with currency [ph] translation as I mentioned earlier detracting from overall fee growth by about 1 percentage point. Fee waivers were approximately 20.5 million in the fourth quarter, lower by 12.5 million year-over-year and 7 million sequentially. I'll go into further detail on trust and investment fee shortly. Foreign exchange trading income was 53 million in the fourth quarter, down 13% year-over-year and 16% sequentially. Lower client volumes drove the year-over-year decline, while the sequential decline reflects lower volumes and volatility. Other non-interest income was 68 million in the fourth quarter, down 12% from last year and down 9% sequentially. The primary driver of the decline was other operating income, which at 33 million was 20% lower year-over-year and 13% lower sequentially, reflecting decreases in various categories. In the year-over-year comparison, recall that the fourth quarter of 2014 included two quarters of income associated with a third-party servicing agreement which was modified in late 2014. Net interest income, which I will discuss in more detail later, was 296 million in the fourth quarter, increasing 9% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. Let's look at the components of our trust and investment fees on Page 5. For our corporate and institutional services business, fees totaled 428 million in the fourth quarter, up 5% year-over-year and essentially unchanged sequentially. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees were 286 million in the fourth quarter, up 2% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially, while assets under custody for C&IS clients were 5.6 trillion at quarter end, up 2% both year-over-year and sequentially. The year-over-year growth in custody and fund administration fees primarily reflects new business, partially offset by the unfavorable currency translation impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. In the sequential comparison, new business was more than offset by lower quarter lag equity markets, lower transaction volumes and unfavorable currency translation. Investment management fees in C&IS of $86 million in the fourth quarter were up 10% year-over-year and 4% sequentially, driven in large part by lower money market mutual fund fee waivers. Fee waivers in C&IS were $8 million, lower by $9 million year-over-year and $4 million sequentially driven primarily by higher gross yields in the funds. Assets under management for C&IS clients were $648 billion, down 9% year-over-year and 2% sequentially, primarily reflecting the outflows that I mentioned earlier. Securities lending fees were $22 million in the fourth quarter, 3% higher than last year and 13% higher sequentially, primarily reflecting higher spreads. Securities lending collateral was $104 billion at year end, but averaged to $124 billion across the quarter. Average collateral levels increased 3% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Other fees in C&IS were $34 million in the fourth quarter, up 19% year-over-year and 1% sequentially, reflecting higher fees from investment, risk, and analytical services invested payments. The year-over-year increase also reflects higher sub-advisory fees. Moving to our wealth management business trust, investment, and other servicing fees were $319 million in the fourth quarter, essentially unchanged both year-over-year and sequentially. In both comparisons new business and lower money market mutual fund fee waivers were offset by the impact of unfavorable lagged markets. Money market mutual fund fee waivers and wealth management totaled $13 million in the current quarter, down $4 million year-over-year and $3 million sequentially, primarily reflecting higher gross yields in the underlying funds. Assets under management for wealth management clients were $227 billion at year end, up 1% both year-over-year and sequentially. Moving to Page 6, net interest income was $296 million in the fourth quarter, up 9% year-over-year and up 8% compared to the third quarter, growth was driven by a higher level of earning assets and higher net interest margin. Earning assets averaged $106 billion in the quarter up 6% versus last year and 5% sequentially in both comparisons driven in part by the level of client demand deposits, which averaged $26 billion, up 20% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. We saw solid loan growth again in this quarter. Loan balances averaged $34 billion in the fourth quarter, up 8% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. The net interest margin was at 1.11% in the fourth quarter, up 3 basis points both year-over-year and sequentially. The improvement in the net interest margin primarily reflects a higher yield on the securities portfolio due to lower premium amortization in our mortgage back portfolio. Premium amortization was less than $1 million in the fourth quarter compared to $14 million in the third quarter and $7 million one year ago. Turning to Page 7, expenses were $825 million in the fourth quarter, up 6% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Compensation expense up 366 million increased 3% year-over-year, primarily reflecting staff growth and the impact of annual base pay adjustments, partially offset by the favorable translation impact of changes in currency rates and a lower accrual for incent of compensation.  Staff levels increased approximately 5% year-over-year with more than 85% of the growth emanating from our global operating centers in Bangalore, Manila, and Limerick and our newest operating centre in Tempe, Arizona. On a sequential basis, compensation expense increased 1%, primarily reflecting staff growth. Employee benefit expense of $69 million increased 11% year-over-year, reflecting higher pension expense and employee medical expense.  On a sequential quarter basis employee benefit expense decreased 1%, due primarily to seasonally lower payroll taxes. Outside services expense of $155 million was 8% higher year-over-year. The increase primarily reflects higher technical services expense and higher consulting expense due to evolving regulatory requirements.  Outside services expense declined 2% sequentially, primarily reflecting lower third parties sub-advisory expense. Equipment and software expense of $117 million was up 13% year-over-year and 3% sequentially, primarily reflecting higher software related costs in support of client and regulatory technology initiatives. Higher depreciation expense also contributed to the sequential increase. Other operating expense of $74 million increased 5% year-over-year and 14% sequentially, primarily driven by higher business promotion expense and other miscellaneous expenses. The effective income tax rate in the fourth quarter was 31.7%. Our fourth quarter results include a $5.5 million income tax benefit related to our decision to reinvest the earnings of certain additional foreign subsidiaries and definitely outside The United States. This decision under APB opinion no. 23 reflects the continued growth and success of our business to outside the U.S. and it's consistent with similar assertions made in the past. Excluding this income tax benefit the effective tax rate was 33.6 and earnings per share were $0.96. As I mentioned earlier, our loan loss provision was a credit of 18.5 million in the fourth quarter. This reflects not only improving credit quality as evidenced by a 9% or $19 million sequential reduction in non-performing assets, but also a change effective December 31 in our methodology for estimating inherent losses. The new estimation methodology is more quantitatively focused and leverages work developed for regulatory purposes. This change resulted in a decrease in the inherent loss estimate for commercial and institutional loan portfolio, partially offset by an increase in the allowance for off balance sheet commitments. Turning to the full year, our results in 2015 are summarized on Page 8. Net income was 974 million and earnings per share were $3.99 both up 20% compared with 2014. During 2015, we recorded a $99.9 million gain on the sale of a portion of our holdings in Visa shares, a 45.8 million charge for voluntary cash contributions to certain constant dollar NAV funds and a lease impairment of 17.8 million. Excluding these items, net income was 951 million and earnings per share were $3.90. We achieved a return on equity for the year of 11.5% adjusted for the items I just noted, better than 10% in 2014 and within our target range of 10% to 15%. Full year revenue and expense trends are outlined on Page 9. Trust, investment and other servicing fees grew 5% in 2015. New business across segments and geographies contributed to this result. Foreign exchange trading income increased 25%, primarily reflecting higher currency volatility. Net interest income increased 6%, primarily driven by 7% growth in earning assets. The net result was 8% growth in overall revenue in 2015. Expenses were 5% higher in 2015, reflecting investments in staffing and technology to support the growth of the business as well as to comply with evolving regulatory requirements. Turning to Page 10, a key focus has been on sustainably enhancing profitability and returns. This slide reflects the progress we've made in recent years to improve the expenses to fees ratio, pretax margin and ultimately our return on equity. The ratio of expenses to trust and investment fees is a particularly important measure of our progress as it addresses what we can most directly control. Reducing this measure from 131% in 2011 to 110% in 2015 has been a key contributor to the improvement in our return on equity from 8.6% to 11.5% across the same time period. This metric remains an important parameter of our progress and we remain committed to lowering it on a sustainable basis going forward. Turning to Page 11, our capital ratios remained solid with common equity Tier 1 ratios of 11.9 and 10.8 respectively calculated on a transition basis for both advanced and standardized. On a fully phased in basis, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the advanced approach would be approximately 11.5% and under the standardized approach would be approximately 10.5%. All of these ratios are well above the fully phased in requirement of 7%, which includes the capital conservation buffer. The supplementary leverage ratio at the corporation was 6.2% and at the bank was 5.6%, both of which exceed the 3% requirement which will be applicable in Northern Trust in 2018. With respect to the liquidity coverage ratio, Northern Trust is above the 90% minimum requirement effective as of January 1, 2016 and is also above the 100% minimum requirement that will become effective on January 1, 2017. As Northern Trust progresses through fully phased in Basel III implementation, there could be additional enhancements to our models and further guidance from the regulators on the implementation of the final rule, which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final Basel III rules. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 2.1 million shares at a cost of 152 million. Our 2015 capital plan provides for the repurchase of up to an additional 285 million of common stock through June 2016. For the full year, we returned 830 million in capital shareholders via common dividends of 333 million and share repurchases of 497 million. Our total payout ratio for the year was 87% which we believe continues to position Northern Trust among the highest rates of capital return across large U.S. banks. In closing, in 2015, we continue to grow the firm profitably for our shareholders, deliver comprehensive solutions for our clients and improve our technology and infrastructure to ensure the sustainability of our momentum. From a financial perspective, we delivered an 11.5% return on equity for the full year moving further into our target range of 10% to 15%. In addition, we returned 830 million to our shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases, while maintaining strong capital and liquidity levels. Our C&IS business delivered strong profitable growth in 2015. New business success was balanced both globally and across client and product types. During the year CNIS introduced several new or enhanced capabilities for its clients. For example we launched our complete FX service and outsourced foreign exchange execution service for investment managers which provides flexible execution options and operational efficiency. We also announced the agreement to acquire ADA Global LLP an institutional focused equity brokerage firm which will expand our existing capabilities to the EMEA and A-PAC regions.  Our wealth management business grew revenues 4% year-over-year and continued to produce attractive margins achieving a pretax margin for the year of 36%. Product innovation and support of our personal clients continued in 2015. For example in response to an increase in demand for ART advisory services and how ART fits in a client's asset allocation we have expanded our expertise in providing leverage against collections to preserve liquidity and a client\u2019s portfolio and estate. Also in 2015 we implemented a first generation bank-by-text platform. Clients are now able to check balances, view their net worth summary, transfer money, locate ATMs and perform other frequently used banking functions via text on their mobile devices. Our asset management business also has been successful in creating innovative client solutions. We expect to launch soon a new generation of target date funds designed to improve retirement outcomes by leveraging our engineered equity expertise.  Lastly our investment in technology and infrastructure facilitated the growth we produced in 2015. An example of our investment was acknowledged in December when we were awarded best cloud and best analytical initiatives by Waters magazine which recognizes financial services technology excellence. Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust's Fourth Quarter Earning Conference Call today. Bev and I would be happy to answer your questions. Zack please open the line. Operator : Thank you, [Operator Instructions] we'll take our first question from Adam Beatty with Bank of America, please go ahead. Adam Beatty : Thank you and good morning, just wanted to get some color on AUM particularly on the wealth management side, maybe you could provide some details around what you're seeing in terms of equity and fixed income and also maybe a comment on trend within the quarter whether December was significantly worse or pretty much run rate, thank you. Biff Bowman : Thank you, when we look at our wealth management AUM what we have continued to see is movement from equity and other higher yielding products into lower basis point products, over the cycle that's been true for the whole year. I think that trend continued at about the same pace in the fourth quarter, so as clients look at their portfolios the movement from equity into passive solutions and or lower basis point yielding products continued throughout the quarter. Adam Beatty : Great thank you, and just to follow up on the money market fee waivers, short rates came up significantly kind of mid-quarter, I was wondering either what the run rate looked like at the end of the quarter or you know whether you would expect continuing diminishing of the waivers, thanks. Biff Bowman : We saw the gross yields in many of our funds improved with the short rate movement. I would position that as it was later in the quarter, not the midpoint in the quarter but tenders [ph] that occur more in December and then throughout December. So we certainly saw the waivers abate meaningfully throughout the month of December and the run rate of waivers the demunition that you talked about really occurred the week or two before the Fed announcement and then post that we began to see the growth yields in the funds move up meaningfully. So the waiver rate was very back loaded in the quarter. Adam Beatty : That's helpful, much appreciate. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Luke Montgomery with Bernstein Research, please go ahead. Luke Montgomery : Hey good morning, a quick question on the NIM expansion. Looks like the yield on Fed deposits seems to have benefited from the Fed hike, so similarly to the money market question, am I right to think that if you run rate that through the full quarter the dynamic would be a tailwind for Q1? And then also it seems like the biggest driver this quarter was this spike in the GSE book, the yields there. You cited that the premium amortization so maybe you could remind me if that's a one off benefit that goes away next quarter and what the NIM was excluding that benefit. Biff Bowman : Yes, so, if you, let me address the Fed first, your analysis is correct, we benefited obviously from just a brief two weeks of that and you can project the forward benefit of that going forward in your models. In terms of the securities portfolio improvement if you will in the spread that was driven by the premium amortization that you described was a meaningful component of that during the period. It has some seasonality but it's more impacted by factors such as movement in the housing market and or rates in any given period, so we do typically see a slowdown in housing activity in the fourth quarter we generally have better amortization in that period if you will but as we mentioned in the script in the first part of the prepared remarks, it was slightly larger than last year and more than slightly it was about 13 million difference at quarter over quarter. Luke Montgomery : Okay, great, thanks. And then a question on what you\u2019re seeing in credit quality, it looks like market pricing recession here, you release reserves for the fourth quarter in a row and net charge offset are near historical lows, I wondered if underneath that you're seeing any signs of stress at all and I think maybe that's getting in a leading way period in loan balances tick down for the first time in over two years, I know you called out at the loan sales, but I'm wondering if you\u2019re getting a little tighter about extending credit, giving your outlook on the environment or is that just reading too much into it Biff Bowman : You might be reading a little too much into it, some of that it was the $550 million of loans and leases that ran off during the period. So, that's a portion of it, in terms of our own credit quality, it's important to remember this our mix in our credit portfolio as we have slowed or we have negative growth if you will in residential real estate, the growth is largely coming from areas that are investment accounts secured or large C&I type loans where the credit quality remains a very robust and very strong right now. So, the mix in our portfolio has driven improvement in the overall credit quality. I think we've referenced the 9% sequential improvement in non-performing assets and I think on a year-over-year basis the non-performing assets were closer to a 19% better. So, we have experienced strength in our own credit portfolio. Luke Montgomery : Okay, thanks very much. Operator : And we'll go next to Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead. Marty Mosby : I wanted to ask you a question, again if you look at the rate sensitive pieces that were favorable this quarter, you back out the 13 million from the prepayment fees, out of 8 million net impact on NII about 7 million on waved fees, taking that that's about a total of 15 million, but yet only really a month out of a quarter, you can move that up to be about $45 million in total once you get through the full run rate, just want to make sure I was looking at that right. Biff Bowman : If you have that, you also have to look at volume and consider volume in there but your math is accurate. Marty Mosby : Okay and then the other question was when you look at the balance sheet inflows of deposits especially non-interest bearing deposits were really still very strong, so your cash position continued to expand and securities came down little bit, you've been trying to do the other which is put more securities on utilizing. Given what you're seeing in deposit characteristics, do you feel comfortable you can still expand securities faster, so that you can bring some of that cash position down going forward through 2016? Biff Bowman : Yes, the growth in those deposits can often be lumpy, we get significantly high deposits and from hedge fund and/or endowments or other large institutional type deposits and we have particularly near period ends we will typically place that at the Fed. Over a long period of time the migration and looking at our ability to move some of those into the securities portfolio remains something than our asset liability committee is focused on and we do believe, we can do that in any given short time period we may have the need to put those with the Fed, so that it helps with LCR as well. Marty Mosby : Thanks. Operator : And we'll go next to Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : So, I want to be careful and not overly focus on one quarter because the full year revenue expense relationship was good and as you pointed out the expense to trustee relationship continued to improve, but if you look at the course specifically, I think some people are worried that there is a little bit of reversal trend. Some of the expense items you pointed out are higher and the ratio gave back a little bit. So I'm just looking for a higher level comments of, how much of that is just one quarter and the fourth quarter specifically, and I know the market is breaking down but as a general comment should we continue to look for that relationship to improve? Because it feels like some of the expenses are elevating. Biff Bowman : Thanks. Let me -- we still think that the expense-to-fees ratio it's an important parameter of our progress towards sustainably improving profitability and returns and we remain committed to improving that ratio, but as you noted in the short-term and on a quarterly progress there can be a variety of factors. I would say Glenn as you pointed out on annualized basis, we've improved that since 2011 every year and we were like I said remain committed to that improvement. Also there is a numerator and denominator in the equation, it\u2019s in that ratio as you know in a difficult macro environment certainly makes the space that which we can improved that challenging, particularly if you look across a very short timeframe like a quarter. Look, we're focused on the areas that we can drive that and that\u2019s new business on the top-line and fee growth on the top-line and the success continues there very strong new business results for the firm. On the expense side, on the denominator if you will or actually in the numerator, on the expense side, we've got several initiatives that we continue to work on, our location strategy, procurement optimization, technology optimization, those are still in force and still moving at pace. You see some of that investment in our equipment software line, in the depreciation we hope has long-term benefit for us. So a little longer answer, but it's the question I know that matters there and we are committed to continuing to drive that ratio down. And as fee growth slows, we have to recalibrate our business to address that on the expense side. Glenn Schorr : Yeah understood and appreciate the one quarter versus one year. The only related follow up I have is, when you look at the expense items that you lined up between employee related stuff outside services equipment, on a gross dollar basis are those the best estimates we have for starting point for the year? Is there any seasonal component that we should be thinking about? Biff Bowman : We have some seasonal components in the first quarter around other expense which is business promotion around the Northern Trust Open and there is some modest compensation, first quarter impacts from when we set our compensation awards. The Northern Trust Open beginning the business promotion being probably the most seasonal of those expenses. The rest are relatively balanced and that is a good launch point. Operator : And we'll go to next to Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : I guess just following up on Glenn's question there on the expense front. Can you -- if you continue to see these difficult market conditions, downward pressure in the equity markets and the like, can you talk about how you think about your expense flexibility, how you're approaching your budgeting process this year and obviously you've got some pressure from regulatory -- on the regulatory front as you've laid out in some of those line items, so how do you balance all of that? Biff Bowman : Sure. Parts of our business as you know are on the expense side are actually also tied to market level, so we have a natural movement either up or down based on market level, so there is a component in our expense base that moves relative to those market, so it's not all fixed cost if you will into our expense base. As we think about the year going forward, we certainly run multiple iterations of macro factors impacting our business, such as markets up X or down X, rates hikes coming or not coming and we run multiple iterations. We try very hard to run our business without macro factors being major inputs to the success of the firm's business going forward, which means we are not overly reliant on either rates or markets in any given period. And so that's how we build our process and we hope that not being overly reliant allows us to be flexible in our ability to react to large macro events, particularly in your question on the expense side. Brennan Hawken : And then I guess that -- is it paraphrasing it correctly, Biff, here to say that you feel good about your front expense flexibility and you feel like you've embedded some in your budgeting process, am I taking too much of a lead [ph]? Biff Bowman : I would phrase it this way, I would say that part of our expense base is variable based on market levels. Part is we have access to maneuver that in this environment and part is quite frankly investment that needs to continue to support the growth on the new business side, so its parts of all three of your question are true in that. We don\u2019t have complete flexibility on the expense side, it's not at 100% variable expense base. Brennan Hawken : Thanks for the color there. And then one question just maybe if it's possible for you to give us a little more color on the change of methodology for the provision and how much of that credit improvisation we should assume is one-time. Does this mean that there would be less credits running through that line on a go forward basis due to the change in methodology? And I think you mentioned there was a regulatory issue driving it or feedback from regulators, if you can give a little more color there, that'd be great? Biff Bowman : Yeah, I'll start with the last thing, I mean it was not the regulators driving in, it was our use of the models and methodologies we use in CCAR to help guide us to help build this model to drive our loan loss reserve policy. So it was not something regular drove us to do. I will give you a little bit of color. So at December 31 that was the first time that we applied the new methodology and it produced the $18.5 million release that you talked about. Your characterization of, we\u2019ve now set that baseline and that\u2019s establish and in any given quarter based on the credit quality and the factors that we look at from the model perspective. We will see provision or release based on that modeled approach going forward. But it certainly was one quarter where we employed the methodology and got the number two at least a level that allows us to move forward based on how the actual credit quality and other factors are moving in the future, so we rebased if you will. Brennan Hawken : Got it. Thanks a lot. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Ken Usdin : Can I ask a question just about the interchange between NII and fees? Specifically, I see you had another outstanding growth quarter for the size of the balance sheet. And I\u2019m wondering, can you talk us through the inflows that you\u2019re continuing to see into deposits. Is that new client money, is it flight to safety or is it money coming out of your existing clients and maybe showing up in NII, but not so much showing up in fees. Just trying to get to interplay between money flows across the franchise and is it a net positive or is it more of a hedge against the total revenue? Biff Bowman : I would describe that it has primarily driven by growth in our organic business underlying. So these clients may come to us and become a global fund services client and use our firm for fee based services. And then place an additional billion dollar deposit with us after that relationship has strengthen overtime. So it adds if you will to the deposit base and I would say that they\u2019re linked. There are some deposits that are probably a flight to safety, but I would not say that\u2019s the majority of what we seen in our growth, most are existing clients in other fee based lines in the firm. And in fact, what I would add is generally, we have not taken on large deposits that we talked about, if they don\u2019t have broader relationships, just because the return dynamic is less attractive. Ken Usdin : And then my follow-up, if you could just split the businesses for a second and just talk about then any changes and either the pipelines or client activity that you\u2019re see given the sentiment change that we\u2019ve witness now for going on a couple of months in the marketplace and if you can disaggregate that into CNS [ph] to CNIS component and wealth management? Biff Bowman : I\u2019ll start with CNIS, the pipeline remains very strong and when I say that it\u2019s really globally strong strength in Asia, particularly in Australia and other parts of Asia. In Europe very strong demand and pipeline there. And then in the U.S., a balance pipeline, but between our global fund services business, servicing asset managers and institutional investors as we would call them, think pensions and foundations, endowments, et cetera. Very balance set of existing wins and pipelines in both of those businesses. On the wealth side, we talked about our investment in certain markets in Texas and Houston specifically in New York. I can say that both of those experienced meaningful outsized growth versus the rest of the wealth management franchise. So that investment in their pipeline in those regions is very important. We made a key hire that we announced in New York just this week or the 11th, we announce. So I would say both pipelines are very, very solid and we feel good about the pipeline. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brian Bedell : Biff could you comment a little bit more about the passive investing I think we\u2019re seeing maybe across consider [ph] it wealth management franchise. How are some of the recommendations to clients changing and I guess are you recommending passive strategies, overactive and then on the new target dates funds are those going to be invested in passive products, no-interest passive products or active. And I guess just the risk posture of the wealth management client basis and how you\u2019re recommending allocations in this market? Biff Bowman : So we have a very robust IPC committee and investment policy committee made up professionals from our asset management expertise and Katie Nixon on the wealth management side, looks that I diversified investment portfolio for our wealth clients, which does make tactical asset allocations during any given period, but it is largely well diversified portfolio across all array of investments. So when you ask the question about passive versus active, it's really a question around diversified versus commitments to large components. So, when you can get large-cap exposure through active or passive, but it's about being diversified across that portfolio mix that's important. That's a very independent committee that helps to make that decision for our clients and they do make some tactical decisions if they are concerned about region or an asset class, but they generally stick to what I would say is a very well diversified global portfolio mix for the clients. Brian Bedell : Is that shifting more toward passive only because in a legacy basis, it may have been more active or not necessarily? Biff Bowman : So, it may not but as the price point difference between the passive and actives, and then the performance comparison has changed for those clients to get S&P 500 exposure or large-cap exposure the cost point for them could be quite different and they continue to evaluate that cost point. So they do evaluate that and there has been some migration from say active equity to passive equity, we've focused first and formal on the diversification of the portfolio and then whether that's delivered actively or passively is something that we talk with our clients in our policy. Brian Bedell : Okay and then maybe just shifting to the balance sheet, there was pretty strong growth in the short-term borrowing in the fourth quarter, is that at the startup [ph] or is that in line with the commentary that you give around deposit growth and then maybe if you can talk about how you're thinking about deposit data moving into the new year with the higher short-term rates in December and then also on the loan book, if you can remind us what portion of your loans are floating rate what kind of lags to I think it's LIBOR for those part that we'll see, just trying to get a sense of that, how that might move in one [multiple speakers]? Biff Bowman : Try to give all three of those Bev Fleming : Brian, let me just take couple of the factual questions that you asked here. In terms of the loan portfolio about 70% floating, the reminder fixed. So that's one of the things that you're interesting about and then in terms of pricing, I mean it depends on the loan category you're talking about. So, clearly for example our commercial loans would be generally LIBOR based, our private client loans also LIBOR based, although a few could be time and then of course the real estate portfolios would be based off of treasury. So, it depends on the category, you're referring to Brian Bedell : And then just on the commentary on your sense on the deposit [indiscernible]? Biff Bowman : Yes, we're watching the market like many. Like others, we did not pass the 25 basis points on to the clients on that but we continue to watch the market and I think we'll have a much better idea how that unfold over time. Brian Bedell : Okay, fair enough. Thank you. Operator : And we'll go next to Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Alex Blostein : Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Couple of quick questions. I guess, just sticking with NII and the balance sheet discussion. I guess, seasonally we shouldn't expect that there was an elevated level of activity towards quarter ends, so like quantify, [indiscernible] balance is a decent starting point for next year and then again the organic growth that we've seen in a past, is the reasonable way to think about it? Biff Bowman : Yes. Alex Blostein : Okay, easy enough. And my other question was around the securities lending business and you mentioned the drop off in collateral balances happened towards the end of the quarter, again just want to understand whether or not it was something episodic or what drove the decline. And I guess, as a follow up to that given the fact that we've seen obviously pick up in market volatility in a more challenging backdrop quarter-to-date, just wondering if you\u2019ve seen any change in demand spreads or something that could help the securities lending business as we look out into 2016? Thanks. Biff Bowman : So, talking about the balances and the difference between the average balance sheet in the end. That was a borrower or a demand driven phenomenon and I'm -- I will presume that was -- those institutions looking at their own balance sheets at year-end as they did what they needed to, to make their balance sheets and ratios look appropriate at year-end. It benefited us in the sense that if you look at our standardized ratio we had a 40 basis point improvement, much of that was reduction from a standardized approach as I said, much of that was a risk weighted approach -- risk weighted asset improvement driven by lower securities lending balances at quarter end. In terms of we're not seeing so far into 2016, more of the same trend that you saw late in Q4 for us, nothing than I'd called out at this point. Operator : And we'll go next to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : So that was just a one off on client event for the securities lending book? Biff Bowman : It was not a one off client, it was just demand in general, I'm guessing that our clients were working on their own balance sheets at quarter end and it was really a quarter end phenomenon. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then just a follow up question on the reserve methodology changes, just want to make sure I understand what drove the decision to do this and is it as indicated that the kind of reset the bars so from here changes in credit outlook Q-on-Q-on-Q is going to drive changes in reserving or in net charge-offs. Any legacy reserve benefit or reserve release has been coming through this quarter with reserve methodology change? Biff Bowman : I\u2019ll take the second part and answer it. Beth, that is accurate, it is -- the new methodology and approach has been approved and utilized in this quarter and is I think put in at the run-rate and then quarter-on-quarter credit quality will become variable. In terms of the, why now. We've worked to build out the model over the course of the year and we wanted to leverage the work we had done with CCAR to use a much more quantitatively oriented model to do this and we also work with our accountants and others to make sure that the reserve is as quantified as possible. This allowed us to get to that level of a much more quantified approach and that was the trigger. Betsy Graseck : And do you think that there is any impact in the volatility of provisioning going forward where there is model change? Is there anything on that net nature that we should be thinking about? Biff Bowman : No, it will just depend on overall the credit quality of the portfolio, so I'm hesitant to say yes or no. If the credit trends continue then it should be well reserved and if there's something in the portfolio then it will move. I think it is reasonable unless there is meaningful improvement or degradation in the portfolio that large releases are unlikely to happen. Operator : And we'll go next to Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Well, Biff I guess your timing for $500 million of government bonds was pretty good, you probably had a gain on those purchases in the fourth quarter. So I'm not sure if we'll gains on those down the road, but my question relates to the funding of some of the purchases, I know you were asked before, I missed the answer. The short-term borrowings were up 1.7 billion. Now, I'm just trying to understand the balance sheet dynamics, just a little bit more, I mean earning assets grew at an annualized pace of 20% and you have short-term borrowings up quite a bit and why just, a lot of questions have touched on this, but I just want to make sure I have the right answer. Biff Bowman : So part of that was federal home loan bank borrowing that we took advantage of which was an attractive, a very attractive borrowing rate, so that was a meaningful portion of the increase in short-term borrowings if you will that you described there. And in terms of the timing of the purchase, again, Mike we have an asset liability committee that has a view on where we should take investment decisions and we thought maybe right after the rate hike it maybe opportunistic and I don\u2019t know if that's right in the long-term, but it was -- it's an attractive trade through today. Mike Mayo : And the federal home loan bank borrowing rate, could you elaborate on that, what is that? If you're allowed to disclose the rate or -- I mean how often does this come up? Is this something you never seen before or you see it every so often? Biff Bowman : We've had access to that borrowing in the past, I don\u2019t know if we can disclose the borrowing rates, I'm unsure. I will say that it is very low, very low effective borrowing rate. Mike Mayo : So a part of the quarter was simply advantageous situation, where you took advantage of a very low borrowing rate at a good time when you thought it might make sense to load up on some more government security, so is that correct? Biff Bowman : No -- yeah -- not completely that, I think part of it was we liked -- the federal home loan borrowings is attractive from an LCR perspective as well, so that borrowing allowed us to also strengthen some liquidity measures and then we were able to take advantage of some of that borrowing and create some yield. Mike Mayo : Last follow up, so you had 8% growth in NII\u2019s linked quarter which is pretty impressive, should we consider that to be sticky? Should we consider the potential for our growth in NII like that again in upcoming quarters? Biff Bowman : I think that there was obviously the amortization benefits in there that has seasonality and deals with macro factors like rates and/or housing starts, so that tailwind is unlikely to maintain itself during the entire course of the year. It tends to be worse in the second and third quarters, so --. Mike Mayo : So should we see that come down a little bit from the first quarter level? Biff Bowman : I'm hesitant to say one way or the other, I don\u2019t know what the premium amortization in mortgage backed securities will do in the period, so --. Operator : And we'll go next to Jeffrey Elliot with Autonomous. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Elliot : I wanted to come back to the securities lending collateral move because I kind of heard at one point you were saying this was a quarter end phenomenon and then I also thought I heard you say something about the behavior that you'd seen at the end of the fourth quarter how it continued into the first. So I guess could you clarify the drop in like lending collateral is that a kind of something that happened around December 31st, it probably comes back, is not going to impact the P&L or has there been some sort of change in customer behavior that maybe last a bit longer? Biff Bowman : So the collateral levels and the loan levels were quarter end phenomena, my comment was about -- the question was around spread, has we seen any dramatic changes in the spread and or demand in the first part of this year and I would say the demand and the collateral levels are closer to the averages we've talked about in the previous period. Not a decline and then movement from the quarter end. Jeffrey Elliot : That's clear and then just to follow up, again on the institutional side, the AUM you know I guess if you take out the cycle ending it's not as if it\u2019s declined a lot but given equity markets are up quite a lot, we might have expected a bit more growth. So you know the reasons why that business isn't grow that -- AUM balance isn\u2019t growing as strongly as you might have expected given what equity markets did in the fourth quarter customers kind of going elsewhere. Biff Bowman : Yes, so one meaningful factor in that would be our sovereign wealth fund exposure that I mentioned in my prepared remarks but we, we do report in P&I magazine, a year ago I think we reported sovereign wealth balances of 70 billion in that. At year end those had migrated down just too sovereign wealth funds of 50 billion, approximately 50 billion. So we're seeing some of the pressures, if you will, on those regional economies and the need for some of those large sovereign wealth funds to use those funds, if you will, in their local environment. So that phenomenon has helped drive down the AUM, what I will say is about 95% of those are passive management mandates and generally have very low basis point fees, so while the AUM decline is meaningful the fee impact is more muted. Operator : And we'll go next to Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW, please go ahead. Brian Kleinhanzl : Yes, thanks, so quick question on the deposit betas, I know you said it\u2019s too early to get a sense of what deposits are doing in the quarter, but can you have any balancing or managing the balance sheet for lower for longer, why if deposit betas are low shouldn't we expect the securities portfolio to increase? Biff Bowman : Well if that is correct we may see that happen, but we're still observing the market and I think it's digesting the first round of these and remember we have a variety of large clients where the deposit betas may be more bespoke, more uniquely crafted in the contract so it's not a direct corollary that that is going to happen. And then the other thing is just from a liquidity standpoint, maintaining our liquidity. Brian Kleinhanzl : And then just a follow up on the seasonality and the expenses, so not in 2016 but in 2017 when you changed your title sponsorship, will that seasonality move from the first quarter into the third or fourth quarter and kind of what is the magnitude of that impact on a dollar basis? Biff Bowman : Yes, it will move to the third quarter in 2017, and we don't disclose the magnitude of that, but you'll be able to see in the expense run rate after the third quarter 2017. Operator : And we'll take our last question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC, please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you, good afternoon Biff. Question for you and this isn\u2019t really directed at your loan portfolio because I don't think you have anything to really worry about with this fall in the price of oil but you can give some color, what are you guys looking into how this decline in the price of oil may affect maybe some of your wealth management customers or are there any counter-party risks that you're trying to figure out that you may have that would be impacted by the decline in the price of oil. Biff Bowman : Sure, so let me start at a high level and I just briefly -- if you look at the decline in the price of oil many of the sovereign wealth funds that we serve are in oil producing nations and so that decline does have an impact on our business. They have lower asset levels and we certainly have seen flows out of those sovereign wealth funds as they address their issues. So that's on the institutional side, I know you also asked on the wealth side. And certainly in certain regions, we've talked about Houston is that, there can be secondary or tertiary impacts from low oil prices, so there are people providing services to companies and others that have been impacted, generally our clients given the wealth nature of our clients our liquid well invested and well diversified away from those single asset wealth creation in vehicles and we generally see modest impact to them from this type of environment, our direct exposure as you rightly said is largely too large multinational diversified firms with strong investment grade credits and so from an overall credit quality at this point while we certainly monitor it and look at it from a risk perspective, it has not had a significant impact on the overall credit quality of the deferral [ph]. Gerard Cassidy : Great and then the second question obviously you guys have focused on driving your return on equity higher within your range of 10% to 15%. We all know the industry is -- had to carry a considerable more amount of equity which is permanently reduced return on the equity. If you shift over to your ROA, that obviously is not impacted by equity and those ROA numbers are still quite a bit below where you used to be prior to the crises, is it primarily just that net interest margin and spread that's affecting the ROA would you say or is there other factors as well? Biff Bowman : So, it is the two items that you described. I would say, it can be a bit of the earning asset mix, it can be some of the impacts of netted low net interest income, margins, et cetera that are driving that fundamentally. I will say that our business is much more liability driven and so the focus is really on turning those liabilities are fees essentially those liabilities are client placing deposits with us that we then turn into asset and so our focus is on return of equity and it just so happens that the ability to turn those liabilities into higher earning assets has been muted in the last several years under these low environments, but I think the combination of those has probably driven the ROA down, what we focus really on the ROE as a primary profitably measure. Gerard Cassidy : Correct, which is the one to -- I agree with you. Great, thank you for your input. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. Bev Fleming : We thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you when we report first quarter earnings in the middle of April which will occur on the same day as our annual meeting. Thank you very much. Biff Bowman : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may now disconnect. And have a wonderful day.",

Let me turn the call over to Biff Bowman. Biff Bowman : Good morning, everyone. Let me join Bev in welcoming you to Northern Trust\u2019s first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Starting on Page 2 of our quarterly earnings review presentation, this morning we reported first quarter net income of $242 million. Earnings per share were $1.01 and our return on common equity was 11.4%. A number of environmental factors impact our businesses as well as our clients. Let me review how some of these factors unfolded during the first quarter. Equity markets rebounded in March after a volatile and negative start to the year. In U.S. markets, the S&P 500 ended the quarter down 0.4% year-over-year and up 0.8% sequentially. In the international markets, the MSCI EAFE index was down 10.7% year-over-year and down 3.7% sequentially. Recall that some of our fees are based on lagged market values and fourth quarter 2015 markets were generally higher. In bond markets, the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index was lower year-over-year and higher sequentially. Currency volatility as measured by the G7 index was 2% higher than the first quarter of last year and 12% higher sequentially. Foreign exchange market volumes were varied in the first quarter. As measured by two of the interbank brokers, volumes were down 11% to 14% year-over-year, and up 19% to 24%, sequentially. You\u2019ll recall that currency volatility and client activity influenced our foreign exchange trading income. Currency rates influenced the translation of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar and therefore impact client assets and certain revenues and expenses. Dollar strength, primarily versus the British pound sterling, tempered custody asset growth and related fee growth while benefiting expense growth. U.S. short-term interest rates were higher following the Federal Reserve rate increase in December. Thee-month LIBOR and the Fed funds effective rate averaged 62 and 37 basis points respectively, both higher sequentially. The overnight repo rate was also higher averaging 46 basis points in the quarter. Let\u2019s move to Page 3 and review the financial highlights of the first quarter. Year-over-year, revenue increased 5% with noninterest income up a modest 1% and net interest income up a strong 18%, expenses also increased 5%. The provision for credit losses was $2 million. Net income was 5% higher year-over-year. In the sequential comparison, revenue increased 3% with noninterest income up 2% and net interest income up 6%. Expenses were essentially flat when compared with the fourth quarter. Net income was 1% higher sequentially. Client assets under custody of $6.2 trillion increased 2%, both year-over-year and sequentially. In the year-over-year comparison, strong new business was partially offset by lower international equity markets and the currency translation impact of a strong dollar. In the sequential quarter comparison, new business, favorable quarter end equity markets, and currency translation were all contributors to asset growth. Assets under management were $900 billion, down 6% year-over-year. Lower equity assets were the primary driver due to outflows from certain sovereign wealth fund clients and weaker global equity markets. In addition, fixed income assets were lower, primarily due to the loss of one passive mandate from a non-U.S. institutional client, which I mentioned last quarter. Assets under management increased 3% sequentially, primarily driven by higher cash and equity balances. Let\u2019s look at the results in greater detail starting with the revenue on Page 4. First quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was approximately $1.2 billion, up 5% year-over-year and up 3% sequentially. Trust investment and other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue and were $748 million in the first quarter, up 3% year-over-year and essentially unchanged sequentially. Lower money market mutual fund fee waivers were an important driver this quarter. Fee waivers were approximately $8 million in the first quarter, lower by $25 million year-over-year and $13 million sequentially. I\u2019ll go into further detail on trust and investment fee shortly. Foreign exchange trading income was $61 million in the first quarter, down 15% year-over-year and up 15% sequentially. Lower client volumes drove the year-over-year decline, while the sequential improvements reflect higher volumes and volatility. Other noninterest income was $74 million in the first quarter, down 2% from last year and up 9%, sequentially. The sequential increase primarily reflects higher other operating income. In the first quarter, we recorded a net gain of $2.3 million related to our decision to exit a portion of a non-strategic loan and lease portfolio, which I mentioned on this call last quarter. Our fourth quarter results included a $1.1 million net loss in other operating income related to the same decision. Net interest income, which I will discuss in more detail later, was $314 million in the first quarter, increasing 18% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. Let\u2019s look at the components of our trust and investment fees on Page 5. For our Corporate & Institutional Services business, fees totaled $433 million in the first quarter, up 6% year-over-year and 1%, sequentially. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees were $286 million, up 3% year-over-year and unchanged sequentially. Assets under custody for C&IS clients were $5.7 trillion at quarter end, up 2% both year-over-year and sequentially. These results primarily reflect new business partially offset by the unfavorable impact of equity markets and currency translation. Recall that lagged market values factored into the quarter\u2019s fees with both quarter lag and month lag markets impacting our C&IS custody and fund administration fees. Investment management fees in C&IS of $89 million in the first quarter were up 17% year-over-year and 4% sequentially, driven in large part by lower money market mutual fund fee waivers. Fee waivers in C&IS were approximately $2 million lower by $13 million year-over-year and $6 million sequentially, driven primarily by higher gross yields in the funds. Assets under management for C&IS clients were $670 billion, down 8% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the outflows that I mentioned earlier and up 3% sequentially, due primarily to a $15 billion increase in cash balances and a $5 billion increase in equities. Securities lending fees were $23 million in the first quarter, 5% higher than last year and 1% higher sequentially, primarily reflecting higher spreads. Securities lending collateral was a $106 billion at quarter end and averaged to $115 billion across the quarter. Average collateral levels decreased 9% year-over-year and 7% sequentially, primarily reflecting lower loan volumes in U.S. treasuries. This asset class has been most impacted by the regulatory landscape, as actions have been taken by agent lenders and borrowers to calibrate capital usage in the securities lending business. Other fees in C&IS were $35 million in the first quarter, up 10% year-over-year, reflecting higher fees from investment risk and analytical services and other ancillary services. In the sequential quarter comparison, other fees were up 4%, reflecting the normal seasonal pattern in our benefit payments business. Moving to our wealth management business, trust investment and other servicing fees were $315 million in the first quarter, down 2% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Within wealth management, the global family office business have strong performance with fees increasing 13% year-over-year and 6% sequentially, due to solid new business and lower money market mutual fund fee waivers. Performance in the regions was lower in both comparisons, as lower money market mutual fund fee waivers were more than offset by the impact of unfavorable lag markets and lower fees on equity mutual funds. Recall that fees within the regions are based on month lagged asset value, so the difficult equity markets in January and February negatively influenced first quarter fees. Money market mutual fund fee waivers in Wealth Management totaled approximately $6 million in the current quarter, down $12 million year-over-year and $7 million sequentially, primarily reflecting the impact of higher short-term interest rates on the gross yields in the underlying funds. Assets under management for wealth management clients were $230 billion at quarter end, down 1% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. Moving to Page 6, net interest income was $314 million in the first quarter, up 18% year-over-year, driven by higher level of earning assets and a higher net interest margin. Earning assets averaged $105 billion in the first quarter, up 6% versus last year, driven by higher level of deposits. Demand deposits, which averaged $26 billion increased 19% year-over-year and non-U.S. office interest-bearing deposits, which averaged $49 billion, or up 4% year-over-year. We saw solid loan growth again as loan balance averaged $34 billion in the first quarter, up 6% year-over-year. On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income increased 6%, primarily driven by higher net interest margin, as average earning assets were unchanged sequentially. The net interest margin was 1.21% in the first quarter, up a 11 basis points year-over-year and up 10 basis points sequentially. The improvement in the net interest margin primarily reflects a higher yield on earning assets as short-term interest rates rose following the Fed\u2019s move in December. In the sequential quarter comparison, the benefit of higher interest rates was partially offset by higher premium amortization or mortgage-backed securities portfolio. Premium amortization was $6 million in the first quarter, up from less than $1 million in the fourth quarter. Turning to Page 7, expenses were $829 million in the first quarter, up 5% year-over-year and essentially flat sequentially. Compensation expense of $379 million increased 7% year-over-year, primarily reflecting staff growth, the impact of last year\u2019s annual base pay adjustments, and higher accrual for incentive compensation, partially offset by the favorable translation impact of changes in currency rates. Staff levels increased approximately 5% year-over-year with more than 60% of the growth emanating from our global operating centers in Bangalore, Manila, and Limerick. On a sequential basis, compensation expense increased 4%, primarily reflecting higher performance-based incentive compensation, including the requirement to immediately expense options granted to retirement eligible employees and the immediate vesting of certain restricted stock units awarded in the first quarter. Employee benefit expense of $71 million decreased 3% year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower pension expense. On a sequential quarter basis, employee benefit expense increased 2%, due primarily to seasonally higher payroll taxes, partially offset by lower medical and lower pension expense. Outside services expense of $150 million was a 11% higher year-over-year. The increase primarily reflects higher technical services expense and higher consulting expense due to evolving regulatory requirements. On a sequential quarter basis, outside services expense declined 3%, primarily reflecting lower consulting expense. Equipment and software expense of $114 million was up 3% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher software related costs in support of client and regulatory technology initiatives. In the sequential comparison, equipment and software expense was down 2%, primarily reflecting lower equipment related expense. Other operating expense of $74 million increased 1% year-over-year and was unchanged sequentially. In the sequential comparison, seasonally higher business promotion expense related to the Northern Trust open was offset by lower expense in various other categories. Our loan loss provision was $2 million in the first quarter. This compares to a provision credit of $4.5 million in the year earlier quarter and a provision credit of $18.5 million in the fourth quarter. Recall that we changed our methodology for estimating inherent losses effective December 31, 2015. This change resulted in the provision credit of $18.5 million last quarter. Loan quality remains very strong with nonperforming assets of $174 million at quarter end, down 7% versus year-end and the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans equal to only 48 basis points at quarter end. The effective income tax rate in the first quarter was 32.7%. Turning to Page 8, a key focus has been on sustainably enhancing profitability and returns. This slide reflects the progress we have made in recent years to improve the expenses to fees ratio pre-tax margin and ultimately our return on equity. The ratio of expenses to trust an investment fees is a particularly important measure of our progress, as it addresses what we can most directly control, reducing this measure from where it was previously as high as 131% in 2011 to the levels we see today is a key contributor to the improvement and our return on equity. We have seen the ratio hold steady or move slightly upward over the most recent quarters, as both macro and seasonal factors can impact this measure in the short-term. This metric remains an important barometer of our progress and we remain committed to lowering it on a sustainable basis going forward through continuing to win new business, to drive fee growth, and drive productivity within our expense base, our ongoing initiatives focused on location, strategy, procurement, and technology. Turning to Page 9, our capital ratios remains solid with common equity Tier 1 ratios of a 11.6% and 10.6%, respectively, calculated on a transition basis for both advanced and standardized. On a fully phased-in basis, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the advanced approach would be approximately 11.4% and under the standardized approach would be approximately 10.3%. All of these ratios are well above the fully phased-in requirement of 7%, which includes the capital conservation buffer. The supplementary leverage ratio at the corporation was 6.1% and at the bank was 6%, both of which exceed the 3% requirement, which will be applicable to Northern Trust in 2015. With respect to the liquidity coverage ratio, Northern Trust is above the 90% minimum requirement effective as of January 1, 2016, and is also above the 100% minimum requirement that will become effective on January 1, 2017. As Northern Trust progresses through fully phased-in Basel III implementation, there could be additional enhancements to our models and further guidance from the regulators on the implementation of the final rule, which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final Basel III rules. In the first quarter, we repurchased 2.3 million shares at a cost of $140 million. Our 2015 capital plan provides for the repurchase of up to an additional $145 million of common stock through June 2016. In closing, the first quarter of 2016 was characterized by volatile markets, low commodity prices, low and even negative interest rates, and geopolitical uncertainty. Despite that difficult backdrop, Northern Trust produced solid financial results growing earnings per share 7% year-over-year and delivering a return on equity of a 11.4%. Our sequential performance demonstrated our commitment to improving our operating efficiency. Expenses were essentially flat to the fourth quarter even with the seasonal uplift the results from the Northern Trust open and annual equity compensation grants. In addition, we returned $234 million for our shareholders through dividends and stock purchases, while maintaining strong capital ratios and funding our growth. Our wealth management business grew revenues 3% year-over-year and continue to produce attractive returns achieving a pre-tax margin of 34% in the first quarter. Our ability to serve complex client needs and create sophisticated solutions for our clients was evident within our global family office business, which serves ultra-high-net-worth individuals and family offices. Global family office had strong new business at a 13% trust fee growth in the quarter. C&IS continue to grow as well. One growth driver over the last couple of years has been providing services to help our clients meet new regulatory requirements. For example, we provide depositary services, so clients can meet their AIFMD, UCITS V, and other asset safety related regulations. Another growth driver has been providing new tools and technology to enhance our client\u2019s oversight of their increasing investments and alternatives. We\u2019ve recently announced the exclusive agreement with AltX to offer our clients access to the largest amount of data for hedge funds on a single platform. These are just a couple of examples how we\u2019re growing our business by doing more for our clients. I\u2019d like to take a moment to acknowledge that this will be Bev Fleming\u2019s last earnings call after remarkable 15 years as our Director of Investor Relations. So many of us within Northern Trust have relied on her expertise. Her wisdom, advice and counsel will most certainly be missed. Please join me in wishing her well in retirement. We\u2019re also fortunate to have Mark Bette joining Investor Relations. Mark joined Northern Trust in 1994 and has served in a number of leadership roles within finance, including a Senior Financial Analyst and Investor Relations from 2001 to 2006. He brings a wealth of knowledge about the firm to the role. Before I conclude, as is customary for our first quarter earnings call, we will need to end today\u2019s call to allow sufficient time for all of us to get to our annual meeting, which begins at 10 :30 Central Time this morning. Please accept our apologies in the event that we have to close off the question-and-answer period earlier than our normal practice. Thank you, again, for participating in Northern Trust first quarter earnings conference call today. Bev and I would be happy to answer your questions. Zack, please open the line. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Ashley Serrao : Good morning, Biff. Biff Bowman : Good morning, Ashley. Ashley Serrao : So first question just on a couple of expense line items. I wanted to get a sense if you feel that outside service expense has finally normalized somewhat. And also if you could share some color on what drove the reduction in occupancy despite all the growth efforts? Biff Bowman : Yes. I\u2019ll take the first part of that on outside services in terms of normalizing. The regulatory environment still remains robust and we need to continue to make investment in that, but we will continue to get feedback from the regulators as our CCAR was submitted last week, April 5, and as we sense that. But there are other line items inside and outside services that I think we demonstrated control of in the quarter, and those include, I would say non-regulatory consulting spend, legal spend, and other items inside of that category that I think we demonstrated good discipline during the quarter. So I\u2019m hesitant to tell you where that run rate will go. But I think the vigilance around the most controllable items inside of that we remain steadfast on. The second part of your question was around\u2026 Bev Fleming : Occupancy expense\u2026. Biff Bowman : Occupancy expense in the quarter. From an any given quarter, we could have certain leases that we need to advance the accounting work, make changes to the accounting that could move it by a modest amount in this quarter. Certain leases in Europe were adjusted. But the \u2013 that\u2019s essentially what we did in the quarter. Ashley Serrao : Okay. Thanks for the color there. And just one clean up question on expenses. Can you quantify the seasonally higher comp items this quarter, what were they in total? Biff Bowman : So seasonally we do have, as we said in the script, we have certain equity expense that relates to the vesting of retirement eligible individuals that is a first quarter seasonal expense that we experienced to deal with our retirement eligible employees option expense for them. Bev Fleming : And as it is \u2013 this is Bev. Those numbers will be disclosed in our 10-Q, so I would ask you to refer to that. There\u2019s a table in the 10-Q that will provide you some of that information and that\u2019s probably the best way to get the exact figures that you are looking for. Operator : We will take our next question from Adam Beatty with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Adam Beatty : Thank you, and good morning. A couple of questions on asset servicing, particularly hedge fund and mutual fund. I want to get your thoughts on the recent FSOC update, which seems to call for greater data collection and also assurance around third-parties, and then maybe get your thoughts as well on the termination of Aurora 50 South and how you are thinking about M&A in that area? Thank you. Biff Bowman : Let me take the second part of your question first. Alternative investments really remain a strategic priority for Northern and 50 South Capital, our alternative arm. I don\u2019t really have anything to offer beyond what was announced in the press release after consideration from all parties we mutually agreed to terminate the agreement. In terms of the second part of yours was the FSOC on certain data requirements for mutual funds. I think can we get back to you on that question? Bev and I will and Mark will follow-up with you Adam on that one. Adam Beatty : Sure, that\u2019s fine. Yes, just and maybe a follow-up on Aurora and 50 South, Do you feel as though M&A continues to be a good way to expand your asset servicing and hedge fund servicing business, or are you looking more around partnerships or expanding services organically? Thanks. Biff Bowman : So our general philosophy on growth has been to do it through organic means. However, when opportunities to either fill a product gap, a geographic gap, a technological gap, or a regional gap, as I said our geographic gap, as I said, we will be opportunistic in those, but we really fundamentally still have an organic growth bias. And so in this space, discussions with Aurora were based on filling client and product needs, and we will continue to look at the strategies I laid out for you. Operator : And we go next to Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Hi, two quickies related to net interest income. Biff Bowman : Hi, Glenn. Glenn Schorr : Hi, Biff. The two were you mentioned I think $5 million of premium amortization, just curious what the impact was on the NIM in the quarter if this is a big jump up? And the other part was with average securities up 8%, curious on what you\u2019re buying on the asset side these days, and what the change in duration, if any of the overall securities portfolio was? Biff Bowman : Okay. The premium amortization as we described in the quarter, it was up sequentially from the fourth quarter. I think it was $6 million in the quarter. We have discussed in the past that amortization is typically $9 million to $10 million in a quarter. It can move so it was slightly better than the normal run rate, but in the fourth quarter of 2015, we actually experienced kind of a low at only $1 million of premium amortization. So sequentially, it actually hurt the returns. On a year-over-year basis, it actually helped by a small amount, actually a modest amount. So that\u2019s a little bit of color on premium amortization. In terms of what we\u2019re buying and the improvement in the security portfolio, first of all, I would say the \u2013 we benefited from the rate move in the portfolio. We did at about -- you could see about a $1 billion of treasury securities. Those were largely five- to seven-year duration purchases, but swapped back to something closer to three months. So the duration in the portfolio was really not extended, but we were able to get some enhanced feel there. We did have a small portion of that billion that we went out a little longer in duration. So the overall duration of the index duration of the portfolio only increased modestly. Glenn Schorr : Okay. So I don\u2019t want to put words in your mouth, but it sounds like this \u2013 this is the most rational jumping off point we have for the NIM going forward? Biff Bowman : Yes, that\u2019s a reasonable assumption. Glenn Schorr : Excellent. Okay, thanks, Biff and Bev, you\u2019re the best. Bev Fleming : Thanks, Glenn. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Alex Blostein : Thanks. Hey good morning, guys. So just picking up the discussion around NII and NIM. So, Biff, it sounds like the securities overall has to be very short duration. There might be additional benefit just as the security portfolio kind of reprices even, I guess, if you don\u2019t get them anymore hike this year. Can you help us understand that dynamic a little bit more, so if 120 is kind of a decent starting up point assuming no more rate hikes, how meaningful of a benefit could we still see through the NIM from the initial hike? And the follow-up also around the net interest income discussion. It looks like the ending balance sheet ended a bit higher than the average. So just wondering whether it\u2019s the timing of the kind of net new business that came in a little bit later in the quarter, or is it just the typical and quarter stuff, so the balance sheet was a little bit lower, but the average should kind of normalize, as we\u2019re looking to the second quarter. Biff Bowman : So I\u2019ll take the second part of the question first. The ending balance sheet is just traditional quarter end balance sheet maintenance that can happen. It can move, as you know on March 31 or any quarter end period based on client activity, et cetera. So I would say there was nothing unusual about that movement from our perspective. In terms of the NIM and the expansion or potential expansion of the NIM, two components that I want to address there. First is, you have to remember that approximately half of our balance sheet is in foreign office time deposits. And in some of those places, we\u2019re experiencing negative spreads and others where that compression is not impacted by necessarily by treasury rates. In the U.S., two things to consider there. If there are no further rate hikes, many of our assets repriced in the first three months of this year or since the rate hike, but there are still some repricing opportunities left inside of that portfolio, remember, it\u2019s of a short duration. So there is some benefit in there. So I would say, we\u2019re going to wait and see how that plays out. But to-date, as you rightly saw in the NIM, the data has been relatively close to zero and the assets have been able to reprice, so we\u2019ve been able to capture that 11 basis point increase in the NIM. Glenn Schorr : Got it. That\u2019s all for me. Thanks, again, and\u2026 Biff Bowman : Thanks. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Ken Usdin : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just on the trust fee side, you\u2019ve got a great benefit obviously also from the first hike on the fee waiver side. Can you just help us understand, if we got another hike, do you anticipate at this point now seeing the experience of the first hike that you\u2019d get the rest of the seven and change back? Biff Bowman : Yes. The \u2013 we did get a majority of the waivers back with the first hike. And our anticipation would be that, we would get a significant portion with the second hike that remains. But we have, as you can reduce we had meaningful movement with just the first 25 basis point hike in that. Bev Fleming : And, Ken, another way to think about that is the fees on the funds for the retail fund family, 35 basis points for the institutional fund family, 22 basis points. So I think that should help to answer your question. Ken Usdin : Yep, okay. And then my second follow-up is just on the \u2013 just a follow-up on the wealth management business, which and this come up in the last couple of quarters. But you mentioned the mutual fund pricing in there, and I\u2019m just wondering, if you give us some of the underlying growth dynamics, if we take out that fee waiver recovery and wealth management the growth rate of wealth continues to be slower than the positive growth rate that we\u2019re seeing in C&IS. So just any other dynamics that just help us understand in terms of whether it\u2019s pricing or activity on top of that clear explicit one you mentioned on the mutual funds one? Biff Bowman : Sure. So in the quarter new business and lower money market mutual fund fee waivers weren\u2019t really sufficient to offset the drag from, remember, we have month lag equity markets. So the fees are based on February month end, which was still quite down, and the lower fees on equity mutual funds, as you discussed. If you think about this, there\u2019s an ongoing and broad industry trend towards passive management, as investors continue to face lower overall returns. And they look to control what they can control, which is namely fees. So we have seen that kind of fee pressure in our funds into lower cost alternatives. So the combination of the month lag in the fees, the migration, if you will to lower fee structured products was not enough to offset the positive fee waiver in the quarter. We do still think relative to the industry that the growth rates are healthy and that the business is indeed strong, it\u2019s just a difficult macro environment for that business. Ken Usdin : Understood. Best of luck, Bev. Biff Bowman : You bet. Bev Fleming : Thanks, Ken. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brian Bedell : Great and congrats Bev also and welcome back Mark. The first question is just on just trying to get a better handle on the expense trends going into second quarter you mentioned on the occupancy side, the lease adjustment and as we think about some of the cost-cutting that you\u2019ve had and then I guess merit increases, I think we\u2019re posting to 3Q, I believe, if that\u2019s correct? Biff Bowman : Correct. Brian Bedell : And if you could just talk a little bit about that trajectory coming into the \u2013 sort of the second quarter \u2013 through the CCAR process as well? Biff Bowman : Yes, so if you think about \u2013 let me start with the first quarter. There is some seasonality in the first quarter that you can see if you look historically. As it relates specifically to the occupancy expense, I think looking at a longer period of quarters in the past, probably gives you a better indication of the run rate in our occupancy expense. So that line item as you look historically has remained fairly consistent. And that\u2019s probably your better trending. Other line items you suggested, we did differ salary increases to October 1st for all employees. So that we did April of 2015, we did merit salary increases. We will not have that in this sequential comparison and we continue to be vigilant on business promotion non-regulatory consulting spend and all other key discretionary line items and there is a continued focus on that line item as we enter Q2 and beyond. Brian Bedell : Great and then just a follow-up would be just on customer behavior, I guess first of all on the deposit side, you said the deposit beta was extremely low, went through the passing on rates. Do you see any impact on deposit behavior? And then similarly you mentioned within wealth management, obviously continued shifts towards passive products, do you see that trend across your wealth management franchise continuing? Are you seeing more of your own manufacture products such as FlexShares into that client base and should we expect to the \u2013 sort of the revenue yields, you\u2019re obviously capturing that on the passive side, but the revenue yields would potentially be pressure longer-term in that trend? Biff Bowman : Yes, so in terms of the client behavior, first part of your question on deposit behavior, we do not see any exodus of clients based on our deposit base that we push through. So we did not really see that and you can see that from sequentially a very stable balance sheet size and even growth on a year-over-year basis, which is really driven by I would say our core organic growth rate, so no real behavior changes. In terms of the migration from active to passive, what I would say first is that in some cases that\u2019s from higher fee to lower fee solutions as our clients have struggled to get returns. They focus on what they can control, which is the fee portion of that. So they\u2019re looking for lower fee opportunities. And in some cases, along that spectrum from active to passive, there are our product and capabilities that we continue to discuss with our clients. Those could be FlexShares, those could be engineered, paid our engineer equity offerings. So we do have products along the spectrum if you will between fully active and fully passive to help \u2013 some of that fee compression that we talked about. Brian Bedell : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to David Long with Raymond James. Please go ahead. David Long : Good morning guys. Biff Bowman : Good morning. David Long : We\u2019re talking about the change in active versus passive and my question just looking at the Corporate & Institutional Services, the custody fees and the Investment Management fees, given a strength in the markets and the decline in the fee waivers, how do expected those lines would be a little bit stronger? Is that \u2013 is this just go back to that mix shift change? Why those lines maybe didn\u2019t have the full benefit? Biff Bowman : So in the C&IS business, it was a smaller AUM. As we talked about in the past sovereign wealth fund migrations as they needed to convert those assets for whatever those reasons were for the sovereign wealth fund. So we\u2019ve seen a lower base on those. So smaller AUM and I think that\u2019s probably driven more than offset migrations into passive solutions at this point, though the sovereign wealth fund an example was down almost 33% from a year-over-year, the AUM, down to, I believe $46 billion and down 32%, as I said year-over-year. So their low basis point realization of products, but high AUM. David Long : Okay, got it. And then as a follow-up, the effective tax rate was down 32.7% in the quarters, seems a little bit lighter than where it has been running. Any reason for that and should we expect it to normalize? Biff Bowman : I would say that it was normal actions that can be taken in any quarter typically those could be APB23 actions, they could be the release of a small reserve in a region or something like that. But it will typically be normal, if you look historically that that\u2019s probably the right rate to put into your thinking. David Long : Great. Thanks, Biff. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Biff Bowman : Hi, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : I was just wondering about the buybacks and I heard what you did this quarter. But I was wondering, if you included within that some incremental like we\u2019ve seen some of the other institutions this quarter or de minimis addition to what was approved last year? Biff Bowman : Betsy, we did not \u2013 our total payout ratio as you can see is very high and we did not utilize the de minimis exception. Betsy Graseck : And I was just wondering if you would consider doing that in the future, or was there a reason why it shows not to do that, given the strength of the capital ratios that you have? Biff Bowman : Yes, first of all, I think, we already have a very high payout ratio, as we look at this. And our capital ratios, if you look at our common equity Tier 1, it\u2019s sort of in the median of the CCAR banks and we view that as the prudent level in terms of right now how we think about that. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Biff Bowman : We\u2019ll say we will use it, but we didn\u2019t use it last quarter. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And is there any consideration for potentially issuing pref and doing buyback just to use that bucket, which some other people have used wondering if that how you think about that? Biff Bowman : Yes, we always evaluate our capital structure and in fact obviously spend meaningful time evaluating it as a part of our submission of our capital plan. And we think about all the ways we could maximize our capital structure. Betsy Graseck : Okay. All right. Thanks very much and Bev have a great retirement. Bev Fleming : Thanks, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning, guys. Biff Bowman : Hi, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Bev, it just seems like yesterday you joined Perry [ph], so congratulations on your return. Biff, I apologize, I had to jump off on the call, so if you address this, I can read in the transcript. But you guys are doing a very good job in driving that ROE higher, as you show in Slide 8 in the presentation. I know the business at times can be seasonal. Are we at the best you can do for whether it\u2019s the margin at 30.6% or the noninterest expenses as a percentage of trust and investment fees, because when I look at first quarter 2015, you\u2019ve kind of given an apples-to-apples approach those numbers in first quarter 2015 are a little better. These are good numbers I recognize that, but are we at the best, or do you think there is improvement to be had? Biff Bowman : So we\u2019re indeed committed to driving long-term improvement in the expense to fee ratio, and it remains a key strategic focus. And that obviously has a knock on impact to produce better ROE. Improvement in the ratio was driven by achieving positive fee operating leverage. And as is the case with operating leverage in the short term, there could be periods of time where we have degradation in the ratio sometimes due to seasonal impacts. This quarter, for instance, while the ratio would have benefited from lower level fee waivers, the seasonal expense impact of stock-based compensation in the Northern Trust open more than offset the improvement in fee waivers. So we remain focused on the two parts of that equation that we can the first is and what I would describe is the organic growth rate of our fees. And the second is on the strategic long-term initiatives on the expense side include location, strategy, procurement, technology. If we focus on those things that we can control, we think we can continue to drive that down. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. And then just as a follow-up and again I apologize if you have given this number. I believe many of the banks are going to see higher FDIC premiums in the third quarter to boost up the reserves of the FDIC. Did you guys disclose what you expect your premium or will you see higher premium and if you will, can you disclose what that number will be? Biff Bowman : Yes. Right now we anticipate in the third quarter of 2016 that we would have an incremental $3 million headwind. Obviously, balance sheet size and other things can move that around, but that\u2019s \u2013 our anticipation is about a $3 million headwind starting in Q3. Gerard Cassidy : Great. Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. Brian Kleinhanzl : Hi, good morning, Biff. Biff Bowman : Good morning, Brian. Brian Kleinhanzl : Sort of quick question. Since the last Div Arb season over in Europe, there has been a lot of discussion about from tax regulators, as well as politicians on investigations about Div Arb. Have you heard anything additional about that from clients, or is there any concern that there would be less seasonality in the Div Arb season this year? Biff Bowman : At this point in time, we are entering that season and our team anticipates a similar seasons they have experienced in the past in my conversations with them. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay, good. And then some of the large like [ph] few years also had a Living Well feedback given to them. Does their feedback affect how you think about the outside services fees and how that run rates over the back of the year, I know there is some increase due to the feedback that you got from regulators from Living Well. So it is the fact that some of those banks have passed and it\u2019s generally looking like there\u2019s a blueprint for the Living Well process allow you to kind of lower those fees over the back half of the year? Biff Bowman : Yes. So at this point we\u2019ve not received feedback. So we haven\u2019t had a designation made regard to Northern Trust 2015 resolution plan. We don\u2019t have any indication as to when that determination will be announced for us from the Fed or the FDIC. That being said to answer your question, we have been in regular contact with the Fed and the FDIC. We have engaged industry expertise to help guide us through that process, and we are certainly reading the feedback given to our two closest competitors as in that our business model is similar in structure and that we can learn from the feedback that they\u2019ve received, which is public. We will incorporate that into our thinking around our resolution planning. So more to come, as we get our feedback. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. Thanks. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And it appears we have no further questions at this time. Biff Bowman : Okay. Well, thank you. I appreciate it. Bev, thanks again for everything. Mark, welcome and thanks to everyone on the call, and that\u2019s it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s conference. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.",

Let me turn the call over to Biff Bowman. S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : Good morning, everyone. Let me join Mark in welcoming you to the Northern Trust's second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Starting on page two of our quarterly earnings review presentation, this morning, we reported second quarter net income of $261 million. Earnings per share were $1.09, and our return on common equity was 12.2%. As outlined in our press release, our results for the second quarter included five items, which I would like to highlight for you today. First, we reported a pre-tax gain of $118.2 million on the sale of $1.1 million Class B Visa shares net of swap expense. This gain is reflected on our income statement in the other operating income line. The sale reduces our ownership position in Visa Class B shares to 4.13 million shares as of the end of the second quarter. At the current conversion rate, that is the equivalent two 6.81 million Class A shares of Visa. These shares are recorded on our balance sheet at their original cost basis of zero. The $118.2 million net gain included $5 million in costs relating to the mark-to-market of the swap on last year's sale of 1 million Class B shares. Second, we recorded a $46.5 million charge in connection with an agreement subject to court approval to certain longstanding securities lending litigation. This charge is reflected within the other operating expense line of our income statement. The charge covers settlements and cases related to client losses from the 2008 financial crisis. With this agreement, we are pleased to have resolved the most significant litigation against Northern Trust related to the financial crisis. Third, we recognized $21.6 million in losses associated with our loan and lease portfolio. This included $14.1 million in impairment charges and the loss on sale related to the decision to exit a portion of a non-strategic loan and lease portfolio, as well as a $7.5 million impairment charge related to the residual value of certain aircraft and railcars. Of these $21.6 million in losses, $18.9 million is reflected on the other operating income line, while the remaining $2.7 million reflected within net interest income. Fourth, we recorded an $18.6 million charge relating to contractual modifications associated with existing C&IS asset servicing clients. The impact of this charge is reflected on the other operating expense line on our income statement. Lastly, we recorded $17.5 million in expense related to severance and personnel-related charges. I will discuss both of these last two items in further detail later in the call when we review our expenses for the quarter. Excluding these five items, second quarter net income was $253 million, earnings per share were $1.06, and our return on common equity was 11.7%. Recall that our results in the second quarter of 2015 included a pre-tax gain of $99.9 million relating to the sale of 1 million Class B Visa shares, voluntary cash contributions to certain constant dollar, net asset value funds of $45.8 million, and the impairment of the residual value of certain aircraft lease agreements of $17.8 million. A number of environmental factors impact our businesses as well as our clients. Let me review how some of those factors unfolded during the second quarter. Equity markets have been mixed during 2016. In U.S. markets, the S&P 500 ended the quarter up 1.7% year-over-year and up 1.9% sequentially. In international markets, the MSCI EAFE Index was down 12.7% year-over-year and down 2.6% sequentially. Recall that some of our fees are based on lagged market values and first quarter markets were generally lower. In bond markets, the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index was higher for both the year-over-year and sequential comparisons. Currency volatility as measured by the G7 Index was 10.5% higher than the second quarter of last year and 5% higher sequentially. Foreign exchange market volumes were down in the second quarter. As measured by two of the interbank brokers, volumes were down 9% to 13% year-over-year and down 9% to 12% sequentially. You'll recall that currency volatility and client activity influence our foreign exchange trading income. Currency rates influenced the translation of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar and, therefore, impact client assets and certain revenues and expenses. Dollar strength, particularly in the year-over-year comparison, tempered custody asset growth and related fee growth, while benefiting expense growth. U.S. short-term interest rates were higher compared to last year following the Federal Reserve rate increase in December but flat sequentially. Three-month LIBOR and the Fed funds effective rate averaged to 64 basis points and 37 basis points, respectively. The overnight repo rate was also higher compared to last year, but flat sequentially averaging 45 basis points in the quarter. Let's move to page three and review the financial highlights of the second quarter. My comments are on the adjusted basis which excludes the prior year and current quarter items I mentioned in my opening comments. Year-over-year, revenue increased 4% with non-interest income up 1% and net interest income up 12%. Expenses also increased 4%. The provision for credit losses was a credit of $3 million reflecting ongoing improvement in credit quality. Net income was 2% higher year-over-year. In the sequential comparison, revenue increased 3%, while non-interest income was up 4% and net interest income down 2%. Expenses increased 2% compared to the prior quarter. Net income was 5% higher sequentially. Return on average common equity was at 11.7% for the quarter, down slightly from one year ago but up from 11.4% in the prior quarter. Client assets under custody of $6.4 trillion increased 3% compared to one year ago and 2% on a sequential basis. In both the year-over-year and sequential comparisons, strong new business and favorable market impacts were partially offset by the currency translation impact of a stronger dollar. Assets under management were $906 billion, down 4% year-over-year. Lower equity assets were the primary driver due to outflows from certain sovereign wealth fund clients and weaker global equity markets. In addition, fixed income assets were lower, primarily due to the loss of one passive mandate from a non-U.S. institutional client, which I mentioned during our third quarter call. Assets under management increased 1% sequentially, primarily driven by higher fixed income and equity balances partially offset by lower cash balances. Let's look at the results in greater detail starting with revenue on page four. Second quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was approximately $1.3 billion. Adjusted for the items I mentioned in my opening, revenue was approximately $1.2 billion, up 4% from last year and up 3% sequentially. Trust, investment and other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue and were $777 million in the second quarter, up 3% year-over-year and up 4% from the prior quarter. Lower money market mutual fund fee waivers were an important driver this quarter. Fee waivers were essentially zero in the second quarter compared to $28 million one year ago and $8 million in the first quarter. I'll go into further detail on trust and investment fees shortly. Foreign exchange trading income was $64 million in the second quarter, down 14% year-over-year and up 6% sequentially. Lower client volumes drove the year-over-year decline while the sequential improvement mainly reflects higher volatility. Other non-interest income was $76 million in the second quarter, up 4% from last year and up 4% sequentially. The current quarter's results include $2.6 million in revenue associated with the Aviate acquisition, which closed on May 1. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by other operating income, partially offset by a net investment security loss of $2 million in the current quarter due to an other than temporary impairment of certain Community Reinvestment Act eligible securities. The sequential increase primarily reflects higher securities commission and trading income primarily due to the Aviate acquisition, and higher other operating income partially offset by the investment security loss. Please note that as referred to in our call last quarter, the first quarter results included a net gain of $2.3 million related to our decision to exit a portion of a non-strategic loan and lease portfolio. The primary driver of the remaining sequential increase in other operating income was higher income associated with the supplemental compensation plans that have an associated expense within other operating expense. Net interest income, which I will discuss in more detail later, was $309 million in the second quarter, increasing 12% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially. Let's look at the components of our trust and investment fees on page five. For our Corporate & Institutional Services business, fees totaled $447 million in the second quarter, up 3% both on a year-over-year and sequential basis. Custody & Fund Administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees, were $293 million, unchanged from one year ago and up 2% sequentially. Assets under custody for C&IS clients were $5.8 trillion at quarter end, up 3% year-over-year and up 2% sequentially. These results primarily reflect new business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of equity markets. Recall that lag market values factor into the quarter's fees, with both quarter lag and month lag markets impacting our C&IS, Custody & Fund Administration fees. Unfavorable currency translation impacted the year-over-year comparison. Investment management fees in C&IS of $94 million in the second quarter were up 17% year-over-year and 6% sequentially, driven in large part by lower money market mutual fund fee waivers. Fee waivers in C&IS were essentially zero during the second quarter, lower by $14 million year-over-year and $2 million sequentially, driven primarily by higher gross yields in the funds. Beyond fee waivers, the favorable impact of new business was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of equity markets. Assets under management for C&IS clients were $672 billion, down 6% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the outflows that I mentioned earlier and flat sequentially. Securities lending fees were $27 million in the second quarter, flat with the prior year and 18% higher sequentially, primarily reflecting higher spreads. The sequential performance primarily reflects the traditional second quarter impact of the international dividend season, which resulted in wider spreads. Securities lending collateral was $108 billion at the quarter end and averaged $117 billion across the quarter. Average collateral levels decreased 7% year-over-year and were up 2% sequentially. The decline in loan volumes compared to the prior year was across most asset classes. This asset class has been most impacted by the regulatory landscape as actions have been taken by agent lenders and borrowers to calibrate capital usage in the securities lending business. Other fees in C&IS were $33 million in the second quarter, up 5% year-over-year, reflecting higher fees from investment risk and analytical services and other ancillary services. In the sequential quarter comparison, other fees were down 8%, reflecting the normal seasonal pattern in our benefit payments business. Moving to our Wealth Management business, trust, investment and other servicing fees were $330 million in the second quarter, up 2% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. Within Wealth Management, the global family office business had strong performance, with fees increasing 14% year-over-year and 6% sequentially due to lower money market mutual fund fee waivers and new business. Performance in the regions was lower on a year-over-year basis as lower money market mutual fund fee waivers were offset by the impact of unfavorable lag markets and lower fees on equity mutual funds. On a sequential basis, fees within the regions benefited from lower money market fee waivers and favorable lag markets. Money market mutual fund fee waivers in Wealth Management were essentially zero in the current quarter, down $14 million year-over-year and $6 million sequentially, primarily reflecting the impact of higher short-term interest rates on the gross yields in the underlying funds. Assets under management for Wealth Management clients were $234 billion at quarter end, up 1% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Moving to page six, net interest income was $307 million in the second quarter, up 19% year-over-year, and down 2% compared to the first quarter. $2.7 million of the $7.5 million impairment on certain aircraft and railcars from my opening comments was included in this quarter's net interest income. Also, recall that the prior year's results included $17.8 million lease impairment. Excluding these two items, net interest income was up 12% compared to one year ago, driven by a higher level of earning assets and a higher net interest margin. Earning assets averaged $107 billion in the second quarter, up 3% versus last year, driven by a higher level of deposits. Demand deposits, which averaged $27 billion, increased 5% year-over-year, and non-U.S. office interest-bearing deposits, which averaged $50 billion, were up 2% year-over-year. We saw solid loan growth again as loan balances averaged $34 billion in the second quarter, up 5% year-over-year. On a sequential quarter basis, excluding the previously mentioned $2.7 million impairment, net interest income declined 2%, primarily driven by a lower net interest margin as average earning assets were up 2% sequentially. When adjusted for the impairment, net interest margin was 1.17% in the second quarter, up 11 basis points year-over-year and down 4 basis points sequentially. The improvement in the net interest margin compared to the prior year primarily reflects a higher yield on earning assets as short-term interest rates rose following the Fed's move in December. In the sequential quarter comparison, the lower margin was driven by higher premium amortization in our mortgage-backed securities portfolio. Premium amortization was $20 million in the second quarter, up from $6 million in the first quarter. Turning to page seven, expenses were $925 million in the second quarter, up 8% year-over-year and 12% sequentially. As I mentioned earlier, we recorded three expense-related charges in the quarter. First, as described in my opening remarks, we recorded a $46.5 million charge in connection with an agreement to settle certain securities lending litigation. This charge is reflected within the other operating expense line. Second, an $18.6 million charge related to contractual modifications associated with the existing C&IS asset servicing clients. These were previously incurred implementation costs that were being deferred over the life of the client contracts. As a result of the contractual modifications, these costs are no longer considered recoverable and had been brought forward into the current period. The expense associated with this charge would have been amortized into expense over the next two years to three years. This $18.6 million charge is reflected in other operating expense. Third, we recorded a charge of $17.5 million related to severance and other personnel-related costs. Of that, $15.2 million relates to severance and other costs associated with the elimination of approximately 150 positions. As outlined in our earnings release, $13 million of that charge appears in the compensation line, $1.5 million in employee benefit expense and $0.7 million in outside service expense. Our actions taken this quarter reflect a continued focus on improving profitability and returns, and we expect the charges to produce annual ongoing savings of approximately $15 million once fully implemented. The remaining $2.3 million of personnel-related charges reflected in other operating expense. Recall that one year ago, other operating expense included a $45.8 million charge associated with our voluntary cash contributions to four constant dollar NAV funds. Adjusting for these second quarter items, both in this year and last, expenses were 4% higher year-over-year and 2% higher sequentially. It is also worth noting that the current quarter included $3.4 million of expense associated with our acquisition of the Aviate business, which closed on May 1. Now, let's go through the remaining components of expense. My comments going forward will exclude the three current year charges totaling $82.6 million and last year charge of $485.8 million. Compensation expense of $377 million increased 4% year-over-year, primarily reflecting staff growth, partially offset by the favorable translation impact of changes in currency rates. Staff levels increased approximately 5% year-over-year with approximately 60% of the growth emanating from our global operating centers in India, Manila and Limerick. On a sequential basis, compensation expense declined 1% as the impact of staff growth and higher current year cash-based incentive accruals was more than offset by the decline in stock-based incentives stood at the first quarter, including the impact of options granted to retirement-eligible employees and the immediate vesting of certain restricted stock units awarded during the quarter. Employee benefit expense of $71 million was down 3% year-over-year primarily reflecting lower pension expense. On a sequential quarter basis, employee benefit expense was flat as higher medical costs were offset by lower payroll taxes. Outside service expense of $158 million was 8% higher year-over-year. The increase primarily reflects higher technical services expense and higher consulting expense due to evolving regulatory requirements. On a sequential quarter basis, outside services expense increased 6%, primarily reflecting higher consulting and sub-custodian expense. Equipment software expense of $118 million was up 3% both year-over-year and sequentially, primarily reflecting higher software-related costs and support of client and regulatory technology initiatives. Occupancy expense of $45 million was up 5% year-over-year and 11% sequentially. The increases primarily reflected higher rent expense with the sequential comparison also impacted by a lease adjustment reflected in the prior quarter. Other operating expense of $74 million increased 7% year-over-year, primarily related to higher costs associated with account servicing activities, higher supplemental compensation plan expense and increased FDIC costs, partially offset by lower costs associated with the timing of charitable contributions. Sequentially, other operating expense declined 1% due to lower business promotion expense as the Northern Trust Open was during the first quarter offset by increases in various other costs, including higher supplemental compensation plan expense and higher staff-related expense. It is worth noting that, as mentioned, when I reviewed other operating income, the increase in supplemental compensation plan expense has an associated increase in revenue. Our loan loss provision was a credit of $3 million in the second quarter. This compares to a provision expense of $2 million in the prior quarter and a credit of $10 million in the prior year. The credit in the current quarter was driven by improved credit quality in the commercial real estate portfolio and a reduction in outstanding loans and improved credit quality in the residential real estate portfolio. Loan quality remains very strong, with non-performing assets of $166 million at quarter end, down 5% versus the prior quarter and the ratio of non-performing loans to total loans equal to only 44 basis points at quarter-end. The effective income tax rate in the quarter was 33.9%. Turning to page eight, a key focus has been on sustainably enhancing profitability and returns. This slide reflects the progress we have made in recent years to improve the expense-to-fee ratio, pre-tax margin and ultimately our return on equity. The ratio of expenses to trust and investment fees is a particularly important measure of our progress as it addresses what we can most directly control. Reducing this measure from where it was previously as high as 131% in 2011 to the levels we see today is a key contributor to the improvement in our return on equity. As you can see on this page after adjusting for the items noted in my opening comments, we have been able to continue our trend of improving this ratio. This metric remains an important barometer of our progress and we remain committed to lowering it on a sustainable basis going forward through continuing to win new business, to drive fee growth and drive productivity within our expense base by our ongoing initiatives focused on location strategy, procurement and technology. Turning to page nine, our capital ratios remain solid with Common Equity Tier 1 ratios of 11.5% and 10.6% respectively calculated on a transition basis for both advanced and standardized. On a fully phased-in basis, our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the advanced approach would be approximately 11.3% and under the standardized approach would be approximately 10.4%. All of these ratios are well above the fully phased-in requirements of 7%, which includes the capital conservation buffer. The supplementary leverage ratio at the corporation was 6.1% and at the bank was 5.8%, both of which exceed the 3% requirement, which will be applicable to Northern Trust in 2018. With respect to the liquidity coverage ratio, Northern Trust is above the 90% minimum requirement effective as of January 1, 2016 and is also above the 100% minimum requirement that will become effective on January 1, 2017. As Northern Trust progresses through fully phased-in Basel III implementation, there could be additional enhancements to our models and further guidance from the regulators on the implementation of the final rule, which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final Basel III rules. As we announced in June, our 2016 capital plan received no objection from the Federal Reserve. In it, we requested authority to increase our quarterly common dividend to $0.38 per share and the repurchase up to $275 million of common stock through June 2017. In the second quarter, we repurchased 2 million shares of common stock at a cost of $141 million. Yesterday, our board of directors formally approved the planned dividend increase, which will be payable on October 1. When we consider our strategy for capital actions, we take into consideration the level of retained capital to facilitate our continued growth, our level of capital to absorb significant stress scenarios and to enable us to continue to hold top tier credit ratings. We also look at our capital level structure compared to our peers, as our clients entrust us with the safekeeping of their assets and it is important for us to demonstrate competitive capital strength. Our growth, as measured by assets, earnings assets and risk-weighted assets, has grown at a rate about double that of our common equity since 2012 and we expect to remain focused on growth. We will continue to evaluate our capital structure as it relates to regulatory requirements and look to optimize the cost of our capital for the firm, not only in the short term, but importantly, over the long term as well. In closing, the second quarter of 2016 was characterized by continued market volatility, low and even negative interest rates around the globe and geopolitical uncertainty highlighted by the Brexit vote. Despite that challenging backdrop, Northern Trust produced solid financial results, growing our earnings per share 5% both year-over-year and sequentially adjusting for the items noted at the beginning of our prepared remarks. Our adjusted return on common equity was 11.7%, improving 30 basis points sequentially. We also achieved sequential operating leverage of 1 point as we continue to strive to produce even greater operating efficiency. We also returned $230 million to our shareholders while retaining enough capital to fund our growth and maintain high quality credit ratings. In the quarter, we were also pleased to receive no objection from the Federal Reserve for our 2016 capital plan submission. Our Wealth Management business grew revenues 5% year-over-year, grew fees 5% sequentially and produced a 38.2% pre-tax margin. All of this was accomplished against a challenging economic backdrop. C&IS continued to grow as well. In the second quarter, we had good success in growing our business organically with such wins as Ariel Investments and RECM Global Fund Limited and Guernsey. We also formally closed our Aviate transaction, allowing us to expand our brokerage capabilities into EMEA and APAC. I would also like to mention that our team handled the Brexit situation effectively as they enacted their contingency plans in light of the leave vote. Our efforts around Brexit remains focused, first and foremost, on our clients' needs, and we are communicating frequently as the situation clarifies. Lastly, Northern Trust has been named as a recipient of the 2016 CIO 100, an annual award program recognizing organizations around the world that exemplify the highest level of operational and strategic excellence in information technology. Technological solutions remain a vital part of our value proposition to our clients and this external validation of our efforts was an important indicator of the value of our investment. Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust's second quarter earnings conference call today. Mark and I would be happy to answer your questions. Derek, please open the line. Operator : Absolutely. Our first question comes from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, folks. S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : Hi, Brian. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey. Biff, maybe if you could just talk a little bit about the \u2013 on the balance sheet the factors behind the premium amortization and the second quarter average rates going down, but in terms of just looking out into the third quarter, how you run those calculations if they're based on actual experience, or just models on the fact that the tenure has come in and then if you can talk about what do you view on deposit beta will be with the next rate hike? S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : Okay. So two parts to that. The first is around the premium amortization. When we consider sort of the outlook for premium amortization, we consider the drivers in our mortgage-backed securities portfolio and there are several as you cited. First is our expectations around the rate environment. The second is obviously the pace at which refinances happen and we model all of that in. And there is also third, a seasonality to it. If you look historically at our prepayment amortization, it tends to be at its highest in the second and third quarters with some relief in the fourth quarter and first quarter, absent any unique rate environment that we're in. So we factor all of that in, and we've seen that play out over previous cycles. This was larger than we've seen historically, and I think it's probably driven by the rate of refinancing in the markets. The last element in the premium amortization is the characteristics of the portfolio we're invested in ourselves, how much time is left to maturity and what is the underlying construct of the portfolios we're invested in. So when we weigh all of those out, we do tend to see a tick-up in second and third quarters' seasonality normally and then lower in the fourth and first quarters. Again, the rate movements can also impact that as well. The second part of your question was around deposit betas, I believe, with a second rate hike. When and if a second rate hike occurs, obviously, the first rate hike produced close to a zero. Deposit beta not much was passed on in that. We think even in the second deposit beta, while observing it for the first time that we would continue to see that sharing, while it would move up, still be relatively favorable for financial institutions and us as well. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. And then, just to follow up on the \u2013 maybe if you could talk a little bit about the decision on exiting the non-strategic loan portfolio, maybe just describe in terms of what the portfolio was, is there still a large portion that you might exit? Is there a remaining credit risk from that? Sort of just little bit deeper discussion of it, I guess? S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : So we, approximately a year ago, made a decision to exit our loan and lease portfolio, particularly, our leasing portfolio given the relationship nature of that portfolio. We are approximately half way through the execution of that, perhaps, slightly more. The leases are still of good quality, but we are selling them in the marketplace as we find the appropriate buyers. So that will continue to progress in future quarters as well. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Any net interest revenue impact from the downsizing of that portfolio on a go-forward basis? S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : Relatively modest at this point. As you've seen, our loan growth in other categories has more than offset what is the reduction in this category that you've seen. So our residential real estate and this leasing portfolio have shrunk. We're still at a 5% loan growth rate. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Great. Thank you so much. Operator : Moving on, we'll hear from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : Hi, Alex. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, guys. Good morning or good afternoon, I guess. Question around the expenses and the whole expense to fee ratio. So I guess, when we look at the first half of 2015, you guys were kind of 1.07, 1.08 range. Ex all the noise this quarter, it looks like the first half of 2016 is a little bit above that 1.08, 1.09, despite the fact assets under custody are up quite nicely and obviously you've recouped almost all of the fee waivers. So just help us frame on a go-forward basis, given that some of these revenue tailwinds are behind you guys, what needs to happen over the next 12 months for this ratio to decline? S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : So, Alex, we need to continue to focus on the items we talked about, which is driving through our location strategy, i.e., relocating our employees to where they can, A, best serve the client; B, do that where we can pick up talent; and third, do that in a cost-efficient manner. That program continues in earnest, and that is a meaningful driver of our improvement in that expense-to-fee ratio. But there are others, too. Efforts around procurement, where we have used our leverage, if you will, to purchase things like market data, things to use purchase business promotion items, travel, and use our leverage to drive those down. And then, third is technological spend where we can consolidate things like storage, we can consolidate items like data centers, et cetera, where we can actually improve that ratio. And it continues to be an important driver, and an important internal measure of our productivity. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got you. But I guess, as we look out into the back half of the year, is there anything from a seasonal perspective that could drive that ratio a little bit more in the near term? I know you announced some severance and head count reductions, so I don't know if that's back-end of the year loaded, which could help that ratio over the next couple of quarters, because it feels like we've been a little more range-bound recently. S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : Yes. So, Alex, the actions and the charges that we described earlier were management decisions that we took to help future run rate, absolutely. And so those could benefit potentially the less depreciation that we talked about in the client contract, write down the asset from implementations, and secondly was the severance. Those are items, particularly the severance that we anticipate receiving about a $15 million benefit within 12 months. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. It's $15 million on an annualized fully phased-in run rate basis, right? S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. We won't realize that potentially for the first \u2013 for 12 months as they phase in, but in the run rate when they are, it's $15 million. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Okay. Great. Thanks. S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI. S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : Hi, Glenn. Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI : Hello, there. Quickie on sec lending. First, you got your 18% bump-up quarter-on-quarter, but I think that's a little less than it used to be. I'm just curious on \u2013 you've mentioned higher spreads in the quarter, but are less clients participating in div-arb season, are more countries cracking down on it? Just curious to get some thoughts on the seasonal piece. S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : Yes. So you're right. The sequential last year was up 24% and only up 18% this year, and most of that was probably a more moderated div-arb season this year. Relatively modest, as you saw, our year-on-year was basically flat. But, essentially, there was a modest tightening, if you will, in the div-arb season, so we've experienced slightly less. And I would say, the volumes were down, spreads up, made that difference, but the combination of those really led to sort of flat year-over-year, but a little bit less of a bump than we saw in the previous first quarter to second quarter. Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI : Okay. It sounds like there might be a little bit of a trend there where \u2013 if we were modeling the next couple of years, we might want to gradually bring it down, because you can't always count on the spreads to bail you out on volume? S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : I only have one \u2013 we only have one year as a trend, so I'll (41:18). Yeah. It certainly felt I think that there was some of that in this year's cycle, and that could be different tax rules. Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI : No problem. No problem. And then, a quickie on CCAR. I know we all individually did this, but I figure this is a good venue to do it. The CCAR ask was down a lot as a percentage \u2013 if you look at it as a payout. I know you partially addressed this on your comments. But you got a lot of capital and you make a lot of money, and you don't have big capital-intensive businesses. Just curious, again, to have the conversation of why would you be the only one to have a dramatic decrease in the ask? S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : So when we look at our strategy for capital actions and what levels of capital we retain, we really do focus in on four things, Glenn. First is growth and we have growth plans, and do we really have the right level of capital to facilitate that growth? We've had three consecutive years of very high payout, as you know. An example would be our balance sheet has grown almost twice the growth in our common equity over the last three years. And additionally, if you look from 2013 to now, our assets are up almost at a CAGR of 5.6%, and our common equity is only up 2.7%. So we look at sort of the ratio or the relationship between the growth that we want in our plans and the capital we need to retain to fund that growth. The second issue we look at is how does our business perform under stress and do we have enough capital to deal with whether it's a Fed-mandated stress scenario or our own idiosyncratic, and we look at the proper level of capital to absorb that. Third is credit ratings. As you see, at a 10.6 Common Equity Tier 1 standardized ratio, we're mid-table, maybe even slightly below on a point times. So we're not at the top, but we worry about what that would mean from a credit ratings we want and need to maintain high credit ratings. And then third is \u2013 or fourth is around our clients. In the marketplace, our clients do evaluate what our capital levels look like vis-\u00e0-vis others and they can use things like the ratios that we're talking about now to measure that. And so being in the vicinity of our close-in competitors, we think it's a competitive factor. It doesn't mean we have to be exactly there, but we have to be within the area code to make sure that that's appropriate. We weigh all of those and we come up with an ask. I will say if the retention of that is not generating ROEs that we think if it's supporting risk-weighted asset growth that is not generating the 10% to 15% ROEs, we will revisit that in our next submission. Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI : Perfect answer. I appreciate it. Thanks, Biff. Operator : And next we have Ashley Serrao of Credit Suisse. S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : Hi, Ashley. Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Good morning, Biff. So just first question is just on Brexit. Can you just quantify the revenue and expense exposure here to the pound? And I know the situation is fluid, but in the event the UK is siloed from the EU, do you anticipate any operational changes that you need to make to conduct business in the region? S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : So first, Ashley, we don't provide the revenue breakdown and expense breakdown by the regions. But let me give you a proxy, perhaps. If you look at \u2013 we do provide the assets under custody in certain regions that can give you some indication of the relative importance in size in the marketplace. If I could answer a little bit more the question around Brexit and its impact, I'd just start by saying that the good news is, is the team was ready and executed very well on the immediate impacts of Brexit, which was most important for our clients and that it was relatively seamless and the client was largely unimpacted by that while a lot of volatility was going on. In terms of impact to us, I think it's very early to make a comment on what that would be as we're still watching the situation unfold. But I think it is important to highlight exactly our business mix in Europe. We are largely a C&IS institution, corporate and institutional businesses in EMEA. We have a small wealth business, but largely it's corporate and institutional business that does both administration for pensions and also asset managers. The important characteristics there, particularly, for the fund administration is \u2013 or excuse me \u2013 for all the custody and asset servicing is the right to do that across Europe. Our banking entity is based in the UK today. So if that passport doesn't get negotiated as potentially could happen, we have to look at where we could also conduct businesses. We have large fund administration businesses in Ireland and Luxembourg which we think, their or others, we could leverage to re-domicile or domicile a bank to allow us to conduct our business, and I promise there's working teams actively engaged in that right now. Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. I appreciate all the color there. And just a quick follow-up. Are you able to provide just what constant currency revenue and expense growth was this quarter? S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : The impact on revenue expense from currencies? Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah. S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : Okay. So on a year-over-year basis, the impact to revenue was about 1% drag on revenue, $8 million or so, and the impact on expenses was about $8 million. So it was a 1% benefit. And sequentially, quite frankly, it was immaterial. Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): All right. Great. Thank you for taking my questions. Operator : Next question comes from Brennan Hawken of UBS. S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : Hi, Brennan. Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Hey. Thanks for the question. So the amortization changes that you made and the charge you took on the C&IS servicing contracts, thanks for providing the additional information on that, Biff. So does that eliminate all of that amortization, or is that just a subset? And I believe that you had mentioned in your prepared remarks, Biff, that it was because you didn't expect to recover that any longer, and could you just explain why that would be and what happened? S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : Yes. So it does not reflect all of the asset that's held. There are other clients where this contractual right is still in place. But for certain clients, the situation was this. When we take on their piece of business, we're able to capitalize it and create an asset. The contract language typically had the right for us to claw back the implementation fees and the client had the right, if you will, to terminate the agreement. We negotiated a mutually agreed change to that where we gave up the right to claw back based on our understanding of the relationship at that time, and they gave something back as well. And when we gave up that ability to claw back, we were able to write the asset off and then obviously have the depreciation benefit in future run rates. It does not represent the totality of the asset. It's not every contract did we renegotiate those terms. But, in these cases, we did. I do want to make it clear. These are important ongoing relationships where, quite frankly, the willingness to do that, the claw-back was something we were willing to do. So there's a favorable positioning there. Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. Thanks for clarifying that, Biff. And then, following up on Glenn's question, how do you rank M&A in your capital priorities? And if you're going to think about M&A as a use of capital, which side of the business would you want to grow on? And when we look \u2013 I get that the balance sheet's grown versus equity, but you also ran through all your capital metrics and you're very, very strong on all those metrics on an absolute basis, much less versus your meaningfully lower requirements. And so it did create a little bit of confusion. So was the idea that you wanted to keep optionality for M&A part of the consideration on holding back, too? S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Brennan, when we submit our plan, we absolutely think about organic and inorganic growth. And those opportunities are considered by our board and by our committees and we look at both opportunities. And the consideration of flexibility in a volatile market period is something that we weigh in our capital plan submission. And we do that on an annual basis. And I can't really say much more than that. Our M&A strategy has not changed as a firm. We have typically and will continue it for the foreseeable future to focus in on acquisitions that either add a client capability that we don't have a geographic region where we need scale or a talent source or a technology source where the acquisition provides us with that. But we do consider it in our capital plan submission. Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah. I appreciate that the commentary could be limited and certainly helpful color, Biff. Thanks a lot. Operator : And next, we'll hear from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : Hi, Ken. Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Hey, Biff. How are you doing? S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : Good. Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Biff, can you talk to us a little bit through to some of the dynamics underneath the core trust fees? Obviously, you've got the rest of the fee waivers in both sides, which is really positive. But if we exclude that, the growth rate has slowed. I think in part to your earlier point about the markets starting to comp better \u2013 comp harder, but can you just walk us through the dynamics between core growth rates, fee compression and activity? S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : Sure. So let me start with activity, if I can take your last. In both of our primary businesses, we continue to see strong new business and wins in both Wealth and C&IS. So I would say organic growth rates in both businesses continues to be high. We don't publish that, but it's at or near normal levels that we've seen or if not slightly higher than that, and that pipeline remains strong. So on the fee growth side, organically, we feel it remains strong. If you look at the actual fee growth that you're reconciling, there are some headwinds in there. There was some currency negativity in the comparison, particularly, for the C&IS business, so it was hurt by the stronger dollar. That was one factor. And in the C&IS business, there can also be some lumpiness to that as the wins tend to be very large, but we feel very good about the pipeline and the growth rate. On the Wealth side, the new business flows and, in fact, in the second quarter were very strong, very robust, but they do still have the issues that we've talked about on previous calls, which are around fee compression as we have seen, for instance, the migration from, say, active to passive, particularly, true in the Wealth Management business. So that has created fee compression, which is somewhat offset by growth in new business. So across both, we still feel pretty good about our growth rates in those businesses. And I think particular this quarter if we looked at it, even excluding the benefit of fee waivers, Wealth Management across its regions still had mid- to high-single-digit growth rates, which I think is pretty good, particularly relative to the industry. Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Understood. Thanks. And just one follow-up on a separate thing, just if you normalized the premium amortization quarter-to-quarter, the core underlying NIM looks like it would have been about flat. Given the changes to the rate environments that we've seen in the last couple of months, how are you just looking at the balancing act of net interest income growth with balance sheet versus the spread compression, how you're adjusting to that? S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. You're right, Ken. When we adjust for the premium amortization, we actually think the NIM probably would have been up 1 basis point, taking that out. I know we can't, but if you did, that explains the sequential decline. In terms of forward thinking on the portfolio, if the rates stay at the levels we're at today and the low end of the curve doesn't move, we'll have to think about the delicacy with which we manage that. As you know, we're significantly impacted by the short end of the curve, which has remained relatively flat, if not even slightly up. I think three-month LIBOR has actually moved up just a tick or two. The longer flattening impact has a much more modest impact to us. So we continue to look at that, look at where our runoff in our portfolio is and how we can reinvest that. Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Thanks, Biff. Operator : And Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Your line has been opened. S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : Hi, Marty, Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP : Good morning, Biff. S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : How are you? Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP : Doing well. I wanted to ask you about the outside services. It's been episodic in the past as you had to either go through CCAR or some regulatory pressures. It jumped up almost, I think, around $10 million this quarter. Is there anything in that is like you've given some glide path in the past of some pressures or a project that's going to come off the books and you'll have it come back down to a more normal range anytime soon. S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Let me walk through that line item \u2013 the important line item. So roughly, Marty, one-third of that line item is directly related to revenue. It's sub-custodian expense, it's third party adviser fees, it's brokerage clearing. It's really tied to revenue. About half is, I would say, directly or indirectly tied as well. Things like market data that we have to pay to other vendors. Some of our offshoring work that has \u2013 that's volume-driven, et cetera, is tied to market levels and revenue performance. And then, that's about 80%. About 20% then gets down to what I would say more discretionary spend in that line item, that things like consulting that you've highlighted where perhaps it can move and ramp if we need to take on special initiatives around regulatory environment, or if Jana Schreuder, our Chief Operating Officer, has programs of work around digitization or improvement to lower future run rate, we can, from time to time, see that move. I will say that if you take just the consulting spend portion of that, the rate has actually slowed from the second half of last year. I know you see this number spike. It has slowed. It meaningfully went up in the second half of last year as we ramped up for CCAR and other regulatory. We have seen that start to slow in this quarter, but it's still at elevated levels versus year-on-year. And there is also in there some expense associated with the severance that I talked about and some expense in there that's associated with Aviate, our acquisition. So when you pull all of those down, the growth rate was more modest than the absolute year-on-year or sequential comparison. Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP : Got it. And you had a big gain from Visa and then you had all the charges. I'm trying to just dive a little bit into your psyche about how you're doing that, because you have further gains in Visa that you can use. Did the charges start to evolve as settlements were coming through so then you harvested the gain to help fund some of that? Or did you think it was time to take a gain and move into while looking for ways to invest it and take care of some overhang issues? S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. So they are separate and distinct decisions. And, for instance, the decision to monetize a portion of our Visa is, quite frankly, driven where we think from a risk perspective, we have significant exposure \u2013 as I highlighted at the beginning of the call, we have significant exposure there. And we make decisions on when we think are the right times to monetize that investment. Separate and distinct were charges where we think the right thing to do was address those issues and, quite frankly, change the trajectory of either our expense run rate going forward in some cases or take risk off the table in other cases where we were settling legal concerns. So they are separate and distinct. It does help. The one thing is we do look and care about where our capital ratios are, and it is a way to not degrade our capital ratios if that's something that we view as important. Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP : And then, any appetite still to extend the duration slightly? Like you say, when the premium amortization's taken out, your margin actually improved by 1 basis point. So it looks like you're at least maybe pushing that out slightly still. S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. So we do look at that every month in our ALCO committee and take feedback from our economist and our asset management professionals and make decisions around the duration of the portfolio every month. Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP : Thanks. Operator : And next we have Brian Kleinhanzl with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : Hi, Brian. Brian Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Hey, Biff. How's it going? S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : Good. Brian Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: So I have just two quick questions, I guess. One, on occupancy, I'm trying just to reconcile what you're saying with what the numbers are doing here. So you're saying you have the location strategy plus the people on severance being let go, but yet occupancy is up. Was there a new building that came online or what was driving that? And the rent increase, but it seems bigger than that. S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : Two things. In the first quarter of this year, we had a $3.5 million lease credit. So I would say the run rate in the first quarter if you look historically or look backwards was higher than what you saw. So that growth rate is artificially high. And then, we did also put on Pune, a second site in India. So we do have a second site in India. And third was Aviate. We have some space that we took on from the acquisition. So the increase, first of all, is much more modest if you take the $3.5 million out. And then, if you add in Pune and the Aviate, it explains the more modest increase in occupancy. Brian Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And then, did I also hear you say you had $2 million of losses on OTTI? I just want to make sure that those are distinct from what was listed on the cover of the press release and not included within some of those charges. S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : So they are not included in those charges, and there was $2.4 million of OTTI related to our Community Reinvestment Act investments. And the securities were purchased to help with our CRA efforts and we have to mark those from time to time, and we took a charge as our generally residential mortgage-backed securities. Brian Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with CLSA. S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : Hi, Mike. Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC : Hi. You mentioned \u2013 hi. How are you doing? You mentioned fee waivers a few times, so how much in fee waivers are still in place, if any, and can you just repeat the decline of fee waivers to the whole firm year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter? S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : Yes. Year-over-year, fee waivers declined $28 million, and quarter-over-quarter, they declined $8 million, and lastly, they're effectively at zero in the quarter. I think we weighed $200,000 in the quarter. Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC : All right. So that's \u2013 you got it all back with the first rate hike? S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : Yes. Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC : So there's \u2013 okay, so that's a long time in waiting. So that's good news, I guess, from a profitability standpoint. S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : It is. It is good news. Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC : Okay. S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : So we've been able to recoup (01:05:03) that with one hike. Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC : Okay. Was that faster than you had expected? And what's been the customer feedback? S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : It appears to be in line with what the rest of the industry has done, and we had concerns that there would either be a sharing on that way up or that the pricing would change. And it appears that the industry largely has been able to recoup that on the way up much. (01:05:34). Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC : All right. Thanks a lot. S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks. Operator : The next question we'll take from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : Hi, Vivek. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. A couple of questions for you. One is going back to the capital question that's come up a couple of times. When I look at your balance sheet, year-on-year, just going back a year ago compared to your CCAR a year ago, just use 2Q 2015 as example versus 2Q 2016, your deposits have grown roughly $1 billion whereas your borrowings have grown more than $1.5 billion to $2 billion. So walk me through \u2013 could you walk me through why you would be leveraging up as opposed to doing a bigger ask for share buyback? S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : So the growth in loans that you see there often, in our case, helps us drive other fee-related businesses. And those \u2013 the combination of the credit plus the fee-based business that helps us or enables us to win, we think, can drive north of the 10% to 15% ROE. So in some cases, we have the leverage. To your point, we have to buy the loan or others to get the fee-based business. That's why we think the combination of funding those risk-weighted assets and growth through the retention of earnings can produce an overall ROE that's in our targeted range. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC : But, Biff, why \u2013 okay, I see the loans have grown. Why not slow the growth in securities? Does securities provide enough \u2013 a better return longer term given the interest rate volatility that occurs? S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Vivek, I think the securities growth is probably more a function of our foreign office time deposits and the growth in that line, which is more driven by our C&IS custody business, drags big deposits there where, quite frankly, the opportunity to place those is better suited for a securities portfolio than to use it for loan funding. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. All right. Thanks so much. Another quick one. You mentioned something about, and I didn't quite catch it, is it the lease portfolio that you're shrinking, the aircraft lease portfolio? Is that something else that you're halfway through? S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : No. It was our leasing portfolio. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And do you still have the aircraft leasing portfolio or are you planning to \u2013 are you shrinking that too, because you had charges a year ago also in the second quarter when you had big Visa gains? S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. It's across \u2013 it's the entirety of the portfolio that we're considering. We have not put all out for sale and marketed at this point, but we are looking at the entirety of the portfolio, which would include the airline leases as well, aircraft. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : Hi, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi, Biff. How are you? S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : Good. Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC : As a follow-up to the last question, what's remaining in the leasing portfolio in terms of dollar amount that you will eventually sell off? And second, would there be marks associated with that when you do actually execute a sale of what's remaining? S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : So we're certainly rounded to less than $1 billion. How's that if we interpret what's that in the portfolio. I think rounded down, it would be under $1 billion when we round well under $1 billion. I think it's approximately \u2013 it would round closer to zero than it would $1 billion. How's that? We'll go with that... Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Sure. S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : ...That number. And then \u2013 I'm sorry the second part was... Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yeah. Second part was you took some marks this quarter in the sales of loans and leases. Are there marks remaining \u2013 if you were to sell that, what's remaining upwards to $1 billion, or whatever it is, will we see more marks to do that? S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : So, let me be clear. There's not $1 billion left to sell, so I will make sure... Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay, sure. Okay. S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : It rounds closer to zero than it does $1 billion. The second item would be in terms of the marks, we look at the residual values and other values of that and lower cost to market for items that are for sale, that are held in a held-for-sale category every quarter. So there could potentially be movement there and there could potentially be gains and losses on the actual sale of those in subsequent quarters. But as we said earlier, the total amount left to sell would round to closer to zero than it would $1 billion. Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : So it's a relatively modest impact. Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yeah. In this quarter, the marks that we're taking were they much driven by credit or interest rate or some other factors that you needed to take? S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : So, the marks, I think, were taken by certain types of leases where, for instance, aircraft and/or other types have seen some degradation in their values. And so we have to take residual charges even if we're going to sell them at some point in the future, we have to mark them appropriately. Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. And then, just as a separate question, on the drop in the yield in your GSC portfolio, the government-sponsored agency portfolio, was that primarily due to the premium amortizations that you referenced or was there another issue? S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : That was about 24 basis points of the 31-basis-point yield drop was from the premium amortization. And then the other was just a security \u2013 certain higher yielding agency securities ran off in the quarter that replacement on those was at a lower rate, but the majority \u2013 the significant majority was from the premium amortization. Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Appreciate it. Thank you so much. Operator : And our final question for today comes from Adam Beatty with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : Hi, Adam. Adam Q. Beatty - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you. First, a question about flows in both in Wealth Management and in C&IS investment management. I recognize that you don't give those amounts. From a qualitative drivers and the information you provided, it looks a little bit like maybe inflows on the C&IS side and outflows in Wealth Management. But my question is what trends are you seeing in terms of asset allocation, equity versus fixed income or certain products? And on one hand, what were you seeing in 2Q, and then has Brexit affected that? Thank you. S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, interesting, Adam. Let me take our Wealth Management business. In the first quarter of this year, we saw cash as an asset class with inflows in most of the risk-seeking assets, equities and even in a little bit fixed income instruments with outflows. We saw that trend reverse in our Wealth Management business in the first quarter where we actually saw risk being put on the table at least certainly early in the quarter where we saw our cash balances actually coming down. And we saw increases, particularly in our case, in fixed income. But I think we saw some risk on in the quarter. So interesting. On the C&IS side, our flows tend to be more passive mandates, so S&P 500 and other types. That's not our only, but our biggest flows tend to be there. And we've seen those move around from time to time. Particularly as we cited in certain large sovereign wealth pools, they've actually had to monetize some of those index mandates to deal with local requirements, if you will, in their regions. I think we saw that slow a bit in the second quarter, perhaps, as the price of oil or other factors stabilized to some degree. So we saw that pace slow. But I think that's the color I would say around where we saw flows in the quarter. Adam Q. Beatty - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. That's very helpful. And then, just quickly on Aviate, you gave the number for the balance of the quarter after the May 1 close, should we assume a run rate on that? Or if not, what are the factors that might move that around? Thanks. S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. I think for your models, I'll let you do the modeling. But those numbers are reasonable item to model in. Adam Q. Beatty - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Sounds good. Thanks again. S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : Thank you. Operator : And that does conclude today's conference. We thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect. S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks.",

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Director of Investor Relations, Mark Bette, for opening remarks and introductions. Please go ahead. Mark Bette : Thank you, Lisa. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Northern Trust Corporation\u2019s third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Joining me on our call this morning are Biff Bowman, our Chief Financial Officer; Jane Karpinski, our Controller; and Kelly Moen from our Investor Relations team. For those of you who did not receive our third quarter earnings press release and financial trends report via email this morning, they are both available on our website at northerntrust.com. Also on our website, you will find our quarterly earnings review presentation, which we will use as a guide for today\u2019s call. This October 19 call is being webcast live on northerntrust.com. The only authorized rebroadcast of this call is the replay that will be available on our website through November 16. Northern Trust disclaims any continuing accuracy of the information provided in this call after today. In the current quarter, we elected to early adopt a new accounting standard issued earlier this year that made certain changes for stock-based compensations. One of the most significant changes requires that excess tax benefits and deficiencies be recorded as part of income tax expense rather than as part of additional paid-in capital. This change has been made for all periods in 2016. The impact resulted in a tax benefit of $6.4 million in the third quarter results and a benefit of $12.3 million on a year-to-date basis. Please see page 11 of our earnings release for more information on the impact to our first and second quarter 2016 results. Now, for our Safe Harbor statement. What we say during today\u2019s conference call may include forward-looking statements, which are Northern Trust\u2019s current estimates and expectations of future events or future results. Actual results, of course, could differ materially from those expressed or implied by these statements because the realization of those results is subject to many risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. I urge you to read our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for detailed information about factors that could affect actual results. During today\u2019s question-and-answer session, please limit your initial query to one question and one related follow-up. This will allow us to move through the queue and enable as many people as possible the opportunity to ask questions as time permits. Thank you again for joining us today. Let me turn the call over to Biff Bowman. Biff Bowman : Good morning, everyone. Let me join Mark in welcoming you to the Northern Trust\u2019s third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Starting on page 2 of our quarterly earnings review presentation, this morning, we reported third quarter net income of $258 million. Earnings per share were $1.08, and our return on common equity was 11.7%. Our assets under custody increased 13% compared to one year ago and 6% sequentially. Our assets under management were up 7% compared to one year ago and up 4% sequentially. The current quarter results include two items I wanted to highlight. First, the quarter included $5.4 million of impairment charges and loss on sales related to a non-strategic loan and lease portfolio. Second, we had a $3.5 million charge in connection with the settlement of our remaining securities lending litigation. All securities lending litigation stemming from the 2008 financial crisis is now resolved subject to final court approval. I will highlight these items again as we walk through our detailed results. A number of environmental factors impact our businesses as well as our clients. Before going through our results in detail, let me review how some of those factors unfolded during the third quarter. Equity markets performed well in the quarter. In U.S. markets, the S&P 500 ended the quarter up 12.9% year-over-year and up 3.3% sequentially. In international markets, the MSCI EAFE Index was up 1.6% year-over-year and up 5.4% sequentially. Recall that some of our fees are based on lagged market values and second quarter markets were not as strong as the third quarter. In bond markets, the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index was higher for the year-over-year comparison but lower for the sequential comparison. Currency volatility as measured by the G7 Index was 2.6% higher than the third quarter of last year but 8.4% lower sequentially. Foreign exchange market volumes were down in the third quarter. As measured by two of the interbank brokers, volumes were down 14% to 17% year-over-year and down 9% to 11% sequentially. You\u2019ll recall that currency volatility and client activity influence our foreign exchange trading income. Currency rates influenced the translation of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar and, therefore, impact client assets and certain revenues and expenses. Dollar strength, particularly in the year-over-year comparison, tempered custody asset growth and related fee growth, while benefiting expense growth. The most significant move was in the British Pound which ended the third quarter 14% lower than one year ago. Short-term interest rates were mixed during the quarter. U.S. short-term rates were higher than one year ago and also moved higher sequentially most evident in the three-month LIBOR which averaged 79 basis points during the quarter. In the U.K. however, short-term rates declined driven by the Bank of England\u2019s August rate reduction of 25 basis points. Let\u2019s move to page 3 and review the financial highlights of the third quarter. Year-over-year, revenue increased 5% with non-interest income up 3% and net interest income up 13%. Expenses increased 4% which drove 1.3 points of positive operating leverage. The provision for credit losses was a credit of $3 million reflecting ongoing improvement in credit quality. Net income was 10% higher year-over-year. In the sequential comparison, recall several items which we reported to you last quarter, a pre-tax gain of $118.2 million on the sale of $1.1 million Class B Visa shares, a pre-tax charge of $46.5 million in connection with certain securities lending related litigation, a pre-tax loss of $21.6 million associated with our loan and lease portfolio, a pre-tax charge of $18.6 million relating to contractual modifications associated with existing C&IS fee asset servicing clients, and a pre-tax charge of $17.5 million related to severance and personnel related costs. On an adjusted basis, excluding the second quarter items, revenue declined with non-interest income down 1% and net interest income slightly higher. Expenses were flat compared to the prior quarter and net income was 1% higher sequentially. Return on average common equity was at 11.7% for the quarter, up from the 10.9% reported one year ago but down from the 12.3% in the prior quarter. Adjusting for the previously mentioned second quarter items, the third quarter\u2019s return on average common equity was down from 11.9% in the prior quarter. Client assets under custody of $6.7 trillion increased 13% compared to one year ago and 6% on a sequential basis. In both the year-over-year and sequential comparisons, strong new business and favorable market impacts were partially offset by the currency translation impact of a stronger dollar. Assets under management were $946 billion, up 7% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Favorable market impacts and new business drove the growth in both comparisons. Let\u2019s look at the results in greater detail starting with revenue on page 4. Third quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was approximately $1.2 billion up 5% from last year but down 8% sequentially. Adjusted for the second quarter items that I mentioned earlier, revenue was down 1% sequentially. Trust, investment and other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue and were $788 million in the third quarter, up 5% year-over-year and up 1% from the prior quarter. Lower money market mutual fund fee waivers were an important driver of the performance compared to last year. Fee waivers were essentially zero in the third quarter compared to $28 million one year ago. Fee waivers were not a factor in the sequential comparison. Foreign exchange trading income was $54 million in the third quarter, down 15% year-over-year and down 17% sequentially. Lower client volumes drove the year-over-year decline while the sequential decline reflected lower volatility as well as lower client volumes. Other non-interest income was $69 million in the third quarter, down 8% from last year and down 10% sequentially when adjusting for the second quarter items I mentioned previously. The current quarter\u2019s results include $4.7 million in revenue associated with the Aviate acquisition, which closed during the second quarter. The prior quarter\u2019s results included $2.6 million of Aviate associated revenue. Both the year-over-year and sequential declines were primarily driven by a $5.4 million loss associated with our lease portfolio, a $2.3 million loss associated with the mark-to-market of our Visa related swaps as well as lower brokerage and credit related fees. Net interest income, which I will discuss in more detail later, was $310 million in the third quarter, increasing 13% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. Let\u2019s look at the components of our trust and investment fees on page 5. For our Corporate & Institutional Services business, fees totaled $451 million in the third quarter, up 5% year-over-year and 1% on a sequential basis. Custody & Fund Administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees, were $299 million, up 2% both on a year-over-year and sequential basis. Assets under custody for C&IS clients were $6.2 trillion at quarter end, up 13% year-over-year and up 6% sequentially. These results primarily reflect new business in favorable markets, partially offset by the unfavorable currency exchange rates. Recall that lag market values factor into the quarter\u2019s fees, with both quarter lag and month lag markets impacting our C&IS, Custody & Fund Administration fees. Investment management fees in C&IS of $94 million in the third quarter were up 14% year-over-year and flat sequentially. The year-over-year growth was driven in large part by lower money market mutual fund fee waivers. As was the case last quarter, fee waivers in C&IS were essentially zero during the third quarter compared to $12 million one year ago. Assets under management for C&IS clients were $704 billion, up 6% year-over-year, and 5% sequentially. Securities lending fees were $23 million in the third quarter, 14% lower than the prior quarter but up 17% year-over-year. The sequential quarter decline reflects the typical seasonal pattern with the international dividend season driving wider spreads in the second quarter of each year. The year-over-year increase was driven by increased spreads primarily relating to the widening of the spread between three-month LIBOR and Fed funds. Securities lending collateral was $114 billion at the quarter end and averaged $113 billion across the quarter. Average collateral levels decreased 7% year-over-year and were down 3% sequentially. The decline in loan volumes compared to the prior year was across most asset classes. Securities lending activity has been impacted by the regulatory landscape as actions have been taken by agent lenders and borrowers to calibrate capital usage. Other fees in C&IS were $34 million in the third quarter, up 1% year-over-year, and up 4% sequentially reflecting higher fees from investment risk and analytical services, benefit payments and other ancillary services. Moving to our Wealth Management business, trust, investment and other servicing fees were $338 million in the third quarter, up 6% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Within Wealth Management, the global family office business had strong performance, with fees increasing 12% year-over-year and 2% sequentially due to lower money market mutual fund fee waivers compared to one year ago as well as favorable markets and new business. Performance within the regions also benefited from lower money market fee waivers compared to last year as well as favorable markets and new business. Money market mutual fund fee waivers in Wealth Management were essentially zero in the current quarter, which was equal to the prior quarter and down $15 million year-over-year. Assets under management for Wealth Management clients were $242 billion at quarter end, up 8% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Moving to page 6, net interest income was $310 million in the third quarter, up 13% year-over-year. Earnings assets averaged $108 billion in the third quarter, up 7% versus last year, driven by a higher level of deposits and short-term borrowings. Demand deposits, which averaged $26 billion, increased 6% year-over-year, and non-U.S. office interest-bearing deposits, which averaged $51 billion, were up 3% year-over-year. Loan balances averaged $34 billion in the third quarter up 2% compared to one year ago. The net interest margin was 1.14% in the third quarter and was up 6 basis points from a year ago. The improvement in the net interest margin compared to the prior year primarily reflects a higher yield on earnings assets, short-term interest rates rose volumes following the Fed\u2019s move in December. On a sequential quarter basis, excluding the previously mentioned $2.7 million impairment in the prior quarter, net interest income was up slightly and average earning assets were up 1% while the net interest margin was down 3 basis points sequentially. While our net interest margin saw a benefit due to higher U.S. short-term interest rates, mainly the one-month LIBOR, this was offset by the Bank of England rate-cut of 25 basis points in August and the change in our overall earning asset mix. Day count also had a slight detrimental impact on our net interest margin in the third quarter. Premium amortization was $20 million in the third quarter, up from $14 million one year ago but flat with the second quarter. Turning to page 7, expenses were $843 million in the third quarter, up 4% year-over-year and down 9% sequentially. Excluding the second quarter items I mentioned earlier, expenses were essentially flat on a sequential basis. Third quarter expenses included $6.6 million in cost associated with the Aviate Acquisition compared to $3.4 million in the prior quarter. This quarter\u2019s expenses also included the $3.5 million charge relating to the settlement of certain securities lending, related litigation as I mentioned in the beginning of my comments. Now, let\u2019s go through the components of expense. My comments going forward will exclude the second quarter items I mentioned earlier totaling $82.6 million. Compensation expense of $382 million increased 6% year-over-year, primarily reflecting staff growth, and higher performance based compensation partially offset by the favorable translation impact of changes in currency rates. Staff levels increased approximately 5% year-over-year. The growth in staff was all attributable to lower cost locations which include India, Manila Limerick and Tempe Arizona. On a sequential basis, compensation expense increased 1% driven by the impact of current quarter severance charges, staff growth and higher performance based incentive accruals. Recall that the annual base-pay adjustments were deferred from earlier in the year and were made effective October 1, which we expect will result in a $7 million left to compensation expense in the fourth quarter. Employee benefit expense of $73 million was up 5% year-over-year primarily reflecting higher medical cost partially offset by lower pension expense. On a sequential quarter basis, employee benefit expense was up 4% driven by higher medical cost. Outside service expense of $158 million was flat compared to the prior year as higher technical services, Aviate related expense and sub-custodian costs were offset by lower consulting related spend and third party advisor fees year-over-year. On a sequential quarter basis, outside services expense was also flat as higher levels of technical services, legal and sub-custodian costs were offset by lower levels of consulting spend. Equipment and software expense of $115 million was up 1% from one year ago but down 3% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was due to higher software related expense. The sequential decline was driven by software amortization and computer maintenance and rental related costs. Spending in support of our technology strategy continues as we invest to support clients, improve employee efficiency and meet regulatory and compliance requirements. Other operating expense of $71 million increased 9% year-over-year, primarily related to the previously mentioned $3.5 million securities lending litigation settlement and higher FDIC costs of $3 million associated with the newly implemented assessment surcharge on banks with consolidated assets of $10 billion or more. Sequentially, other operating expense declined 3% on an adjusted basis. Declines associated with asset servicing amortized cost, the timing of charitable contributions and other miscellaneous expenses more than offset increases from the Securities Lending litigation settlement and a $2 million sequential increase in FDIC expense. Our loan loss provision was a credit of $3 million in the third quarter. This compares to a provision credit of $3 million in the prior quarter and a credit of $10 million in the prior year. The credit provision in the current quarter was primarily driven by a reduction in outstanding loans and improved credit quality in the residential real-estate portfolio partially offset by an increase in the specific reserve requirement for the commercial portfolio. Non-performing assets of $181 million were up from $166 million in the prior quarter but down from the $207 million one year ago. Loan quality remains very strong, with the ratio of non-performing loans to total loans equal to only 52 basis points at quarter end. Turning to page 8, a key focus has been on sustainably enhancing profitability and returns. This slide reflects the progress we have made in recent years to improve the expense-to-fees ratio, pre-tax margin and ultimately our return on equity. The ratio of expenses to trust and investment fees is a particularly important measure of our progress as it addresses what we can most directly control. Reducing this measure from where it was previously as high as 131% in 2011 to the levels we see today is a key contributor to the improvement in our return on equity. As you can see on this page our performance in the current quarter has continued to drive the ratio lower and is now at 107%. This metric remains an important barometer of our progress and we remain committed to lowering it on a sustainable basis going forward through continuing to win new business, to drive fee growth and driving productivity within our expense base through our ongoing initiatives focused on location, strategy, procurement and technology. Turning to page 9, our capital ratios remain solid with Common Equity Tier 1 ratios of 11.8% and 11.2% respectively calculated on a transition basis for both advanced and standardized. On a fully phased-in basis, our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the advanced approach would be approximately 11.6% and under the standardized approach would be approximately 11%. All of these ratios are well above the fully phased-in requirements of 7%, which includes the capital conservation buffer. The supplementary leverage ratio at the corporation was 6.6% and at the bank was 5.9%, both of which exceed the 3% requirement, which will be applicable to Northern Trust in 2018. With respect to the liquidity coverage ratio, Northern Trust is above the 90% minimum requirement effective as of January, 2016 and is also above the 100% minimum requirement that will become effective on January 1, 2017. As Northern Trust progresses through fully phased-in Basel III implementation, there could be additional enhancements to our models and further guidance from the regulators on the implementation of the final rule, which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final Basel III rules. During the third quarter, Northern Trust issued $500 million in perpetual preferred stock at an initial fixed dividend rate of $4.6 million through October 1, 2026. Fixed rate dividends for this new issuance are expected to be paid on a semi-annual basis with the first dividend anticipated to be declared at the January 2017 Board of Directors meeting and paid April 1, 2017. Given the early August issuance, the initial preferred dividend payment will cover 8 months and therefore is expected to equal $14.9 million in the first quarter of 2017. Going forward, these fixed rate dividends are expected to be paid every other quarter in the amount of $11.5 million. Beginning October 1, 2026 dividends on this issuance are expected to be paid quarterly at a floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 3.202%. In the third quarter we repurchased 950,000 shares of common stock at a cost of $65 million. During the quarter, we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 6% to $0.38 per common share. In closing, the global macroeconomic environment continues to produce a difficult operating environment in the third quarter of 2016. Low and even negative interest rates around the globe, post Brexit uncertainty, Election uncertainty and debate over Central Bank actions characterize the quarter. Despite that challenging backdrop, Northern Trust produced solid financial results, growing our earnings per share 13% year-over-year. We also produced 1.3 points of positive operating leverage and importantly drove our expense to fee ratio to 107%. Our return on equity of 11.7% represents an 80 basis point improvement over one year ago. Our Wealth Management business grew total revenues 7% year-over-year, with fees up 6%. This business had a pre-tax margin of 41%. New business success in our highest network categories remained strong. Our C&IS business generated 6% revenue growth and 5% fee growth. Our new business in the quarter helped us grow organically and was exemplified with wins such as Rothesay Life and the expansion of relationships with existing clients such as the New Zealand Superannuation Fund. In our asset management business, we celebrated the 5th Anniversary of our ETF franchise of shares. Since its launch five years ago, the suite of ETF has grown from 4 funds to 24 and attracted more than $10 billion in assets. During the quarter, we once again had positive flows that outstripped industry averages. Lastly, in the quarter we successfully executed the issuance of $500 million in preferred stock taking advantage of attractive market pricing and creating capital flexibility for the firm going forward. Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust\u2019s third quarter earnings conference call today. Mark and I would be happy to answer your questions. Lisa, please open the line. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We\u2019ll take our first question from Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse. Biff Bowman : Hi Ashley. Ashley Serrao : Hi Biff, how are you? Biff Bowman : Good. Ashley Serrao : I just wanted to dig a little deeper into NIM dynamics. First, I just wanted to confirm if the decline in yields within the Federal Reserve and other Central Bank deposit bucket was due to the Bank of England rate cut? And then just an update on the usage of short-term borrowings and how are you managing the current reinvestment environment with a potential rate hike on the horizon? Biff Bowman : Sure. So the first part of your question around the Central Bank deposit yield was largely driven by the Bank of England\u2019s move cutting the rates from 50 to 25 basis points. So you are accurate that that was a primary driver of that decline. As we think about using short-term borrowings that you described, what you would see on our balance sheet in short-term borrowings or funding sources, we can from time to time use Federal Home Loan borrowings. They have an advantage if you will around our liquidity needs. So we use them to manage our balance sheet liquidity from time to time. And they help if you will with LCR compliance and other issues. So that\u2019s how we think about the short-term borrowings that in any given period we can utilize for those types of purposes. Ashley Serrao : And just a follow-up on the last part, how you\u2019re thinking about the current reinvestment environment with a potential rate hike on horizon? Biff Bowman : Yes, as we think about the potential rate rise, as you know our portfolio has typically remained short in duration. We would expect that if a rate rise were to happen in November or more likely December based on market prognostication that we would benefit from that. What is important to remember is how did the markets react in advance of that, how well telegraphed is that rate increase. So if it\u2019s unexpected we would anticipate seeing the benefit to come perhaps in the first quarter or second quarter of next year. If the markets anticipate that, well, then we could see some of that benefit in the fourth quarter. And then the last component that I would highlight here is, it also then matters greatly as to how the deposit pricing reacts to that anticipated rate hike. As you know in the last rate hike, the deposit data remained low. We will wait to observe how it unfolds this time. Ashley Serrao : Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Biff Bowman : Hi Alex. Alex Blostein : Hi guys, good morning. Thanks, just staying on the NIM and discussion for a second, just a point clarification. If I think last quarter you guys had a fairly elevated amount of premium amortization running through the numbers. It looks like the yields on the guidance didn\u2019t really move so, was this quarter somewhat elevated as well? And again, kind of create a little bit of bigger drag on the NIM or kind of 114 basis points is it fairly decent run rate for us to start thinking about 4Q? Biff Bowman : Yes. So, we did see comparable levels of premium amortization in the second and third quarters. In absolute amounts, in both the second and third quarter, our premium amortization was approximately $20 million in both quarters. In 2015, our premium amortization in the third quarter was $14 million. So we did not see the seasonal decline that we had in previous cycles in fact a year before that was $13 million. So we did not see the premium amortization seasonal decline that we typically experienced in the third quarter. Traditionally in the fourth quarter and first quarter, we see our lowest levels of premium amortization. But again, in this third quarter we saw slightly elevated premium amortization and less benefit from the seasonal decline. Alex Blostein : Got you, okay. So, all else equal if rates don\u2019t really change we should think about the normal kind of seasonal patterns working for in 1Q? Biff Bowman : Yes. All things being equal, right, refinance levels, market dynamics housing markets etcetera. But all things we should see, we typically see seasonal decline in the fourth quarter. Alex Blostein : Yes, fair enough. And then my second question was around the balance sheet as well. But think about the longer dynamic you guys have obviously had a little bit of a decline sequentially probably due to the charge. But bigger picture, the bucket has been kind of range bound at these levels for the last couple of quarters after seeing a couple of years a really nice long growth. How should we think about that on the forward basis, part of your capital return plan I think was contemplating the fact that you guys are growing and loan growth could be one of a components of why the capital return dynamic was really lower than we had expected. So, maybe kind of tie it together for us as we think about the loan growth outlook? Biff Bowman : Sure, let me - you\u2019re right. Our loan growth year-over-year was 2% but I think we have to decompose that a little bit. First of all, residential real-estate loans declined 12% year-over-year and that\u2019s strategically an initiative that we\u2019ve been on as we look at our wholesale designation and really our up-market practice in our wealth management business. So that\u2019s a conscious decision on residential real-estate. So that has been a drag against that loan growth. The second thing as we look year-over-year as a loan growth, our C&I loans are actually up 6%, commercial real-estate is up 11%. And private client lending is up 17%. So, we actually have seen loan growth in the areas that we\u2019ve targeted and I think it\u2019s important. Sequentially if you look at that, the residential real-estate continued its decline. C&I did decline and I think we\u2019re seeing that across the industry from what I\u2019ve seen in C&I loans. Commercial real-estate was 1% and private client was up 3% sequentially. So we have the right mix of that. As it relates to RWA growth or use of capital and capital returns, what we\u2019re disciplined around is not using our capital to put on whether it\u2019s loans or any other risk-weighted asset growth items that are generating the right level of returns. So we won\u2019t just use it to grow the balance sheet for non-strategic RWA growth. And in this case, as I highlighted for you in the case of residential real-estate for us, the slowing there is something that we\u2019re targeting strategically. Alex Blostein : Got you. Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Biff Bowman : Hi Ken. Ken Usdin : Hi Biff, how are you doing? Biff, this quarter you had really good, just core business growth metrics AUM, AUC, AUA. Of course the market was up and international was up a little bit more. But I was wondering if you could break this out, just an understanding, was there notable good net new business this quarter, was it more about mix and where the dollars came from just thinking about kind of underlying organic growth and wins? Biff Bowman : So, when we decompose those growth rates which were strong, approximately 50% was driven by the market levels that you described but 50% was really driven by what I would say positive flows and/or new business. So at the core, we saw good strong new business across the franchise both in wealth, asset management and C&IS. We saw very, very good strong growth. And I would say generally across the globe, so whether it was in Asia Pacific region and Australia or in our European region, where we had substantial new wins or even here in North America in our C&IS business. And in wealth, largely across our geographies, we continue to see I think accelerated success in some of our large market investments like New York City that\u2019s growing double or triple the overall wealth management averages to date. So, I think it was a broad-based set of successes that really drove that and not just a market-driven beat like I said about 50% was from new business and/or flows. Ken Usdin : Okay, got it, great. Thanks for that. And separately, can you just talk a little bit about the market sensitive revenues obviously we saw the market environment for FX be, kind of in the summer quarters. Can you for us - help us understand, do you think that was more driven by low volume or low volatility and what about the mix of channel with core custody and the electronic piece that you\u2019ve been building? Biff Bowman : Yes, so we\u2019re still heavily linked to both volatility and volume. You\u2019re right, we\u2019ve absolutely tried to invest in our e-platforms for FX trading but we\u2019re still directionally moving in lock-step with both volatility and volume. I would say volatility would be mixed whether year-over-year or sequentially. We had negative sequential volatility, a positive year-over-year. It also matters Ken in whether it\u2019s emerging market currencies or its G7 currencies and the volatility between the two. So, most of our FX though, the vast majority of our FX is really driven by our core custody business. It\u2019s in relation to supporting the asset managers that are supporting our clients or our clients\u2019 needs. There is a proprietary trading element to this. It\u2019s just in support of that. So, it will be and move lock-step with volumes and volatility in general. Ken Usdin : Right, okay. Thanks Biff. Biff Bowman : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Biff Bowman : Hi Brian. Brian Bedell : Good afternoon, hi, how are you? Biff Bowman : Good. Brian Bedell : Maybe just to, and if you would just go into the fourth quarter, I think that you mentioned the $7 million increase in comp linked quarter. But if you could just touch on seasonality trends in the fourth quarter typically there is, it\u2019s usually growth in outside services and equipment and software expense, just want to see if that still seems to be the general trend and also the tax rate in the fourth quarter with the accounting change? Biff Bowman : Okay. Let me breakout outside services first for you. Real quickly, our outside service category which totaled about $158 million in the third quarter, approximately one third of that is directly related to what I would say are market activities. Its items such as sub-custodian expense, third-party advisor fees, brokerage, clearing expense, etcetera. So it will move as the markets move in that quarter and stay linked to that. About half is what I would say is what we call technical services and it\u2019s generally linked to business activity, it\u2019s things like market data, use of market data, systems and processing, client customization work. But it\u2019s generally linked if you will to the directional revenue of the firm in that. The third part, probably the parts that we\u2019re talking about here is about 20%, that\u2019s the most discretionary that things like consulting spend. We would in the third quarter, we saw meaningful decline in our consulting spend. We\u2019re going to work hard to maintain that discipline in the fourth quarter as well around that component of outside services. And then I think you also had a question on the tax rate as well. Brian Bedell : Yes, the equipment and software expenses on that? Biff Bowman : The equipment and software, if you look at past and seasonal trends those have a small increase or modest increase typically in the fourth quarter. Mark Bette : Usually that would be with the software amortization continuing trends. Brian Bedell : Okay. The tax rate you mentioned? Biff Bowman : The tax rate, so that is dependent on a : the amount of equity that would either vest or be exercised and the value of the stock at the point of that exercise that\u2019s how that tax rate works. If the price of the equity size is higher than the point when it was granted it would be a favorable tax benefit and if it\u2019s not then it will - I can\u2019t predict how that will play out in the fourth quarter. But as you know this is a practice that we would have to adapt 11/17 either way. Brian Bedell : Right, great. And then, maybe just longer term question on investment in the business and technology. I think you mentioned a little bit about that as well. But as we think about the average asset servicing business and what some of the competitors are doing, stage 3 with Project Beacon and Bank of New York [ph] with digital efforts. How do you feel your asset servicing business is positioned from a technological perspective and is there, if there\u2019s any more investment required in that? And are you able to leverage the Omnium platform across your franchise more practically? Biff Bowman : Yes, so we\u2019ve made substantial technological advancements and investments. As our industry and our space in the industry as you described, we really are looking at a series of initiatives to invest in that we think will a : first enhance our clients\u2019 experience in terms of the mobile applications or the interface they may have when they come into the firm, but also drive efficiency inside the firm. And that could be efforts around robotics or other efficiencies inside the firm. One of the advantages we have we believe is that our organic growth strategy over time has allowed us to have largely single platforms for all of the areas we need to process on, and so our ability to deploy capital is pretty efficient. And so we think that our, spend which we do highlight I think total capital and technological expense is about $2.4 billion over a three-year cycle. So, we think that\u2019s enough to keep us competitive and on-peer or above our competition. Brian Bedell : Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with CLSA. Mike Mayo : Hi, can you discuss Europe a little bit with restructuring of some global banks? Are you seeing market share potential or do you see potential to pursue deals in Europe? Are you looking to add in Europe or are you repositioning in Europe, what\u2019s happening with the European banks and Brexit and everything else? Biff Bowman : Good question. We certainly do see a lot of movement in Europe right now, as many of the large globally systemic important banks are revisiting their business models. We\u2019ve had tremendous success in Europe particularly in our GFS business where we\u2019ve grown substantially over the last decade. And we are always open and have understanding of what businesses we\u2019re interested in. As we\u2019ve stated before, our approach to any of those opportunities is always first around the client capability, is second about really filling a geographic gap and then third I think a technological gap. But I think the market right now is experiencing some white water. And we stand ready to have dialogues and those that fit our strategic needs. We\u2019ll certainly have dialogues. If I go on just briefly, with Brexit, a little bit linked to your question but while there is still a great deal of uncertainty on the U.K. exit, we have formulated plans to establish a full subsidiary in the EU. We have meaningful presence in Ireland and Luxemburg and several other locations today. And we will evaluate all those for where the optimal location is for us, we are actively engaging in that planning right now. Mike Mayo : So, does Brexit cost you money there or it\u2019s not that big a deal since you\u2019re elsewhere in Europe? Biff Bowman : So, we have physical presence in many of those locations and pallet in those locations but I\u2019m sure there would be some element of cost to look at incorporation and all the legal work that we would have to do with that. We think that\u2019s at a very manageable level relative to our overall financial position. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Biff Bowman : Hi Glenn. Glenn Schorr : Hello there. Forgive if this is a little repetitive. But on the decision on taking down the payout ratio, part of it was rating, part of it was to have a better positioning with your capital ratios, and part of it was for the investment and growth, some of the stuff we talked about here. But I\u2019m curious to revisit, where are we going to see the benefits of that decision, will it be as simple as higher capital ratio but should we see higher growth rates relative to peers, I mean, some of this is technology and some of it is actual growth in the business? Biff Bowman : Yes, I think that we need to demonstrate that it\u2019s driving higher growth rates than our peers and higher returns on our capital over time because of the businesses we\u2019re choosing to invest in that. And as we\u2019ve said on previous calls, if we don\u2019t see the opportunity for that growth, we have an annual opportunity to revisit our capital distribution strategy. And we do with our board and our regulators, we revisit that. When we did that process three, six months ago, really in the planning phases of that, we had certain growth trajectories build into our planning and modeling. And we continue to execute on those. If those don\u2019t manifest then we will revisit that plan in the 2017 submission cycle. What I said earlier though, I\u2019d reiterate is, there is a discipline about not just using that retained capital if you will to put on any assets or any risk-weighted assets. So any loan or any other risk-weighted asset, it is a disciplined approach for those that we think can generate superior returns over time. Glenn Schorr : Fair enough. Just one follow-up. Inside Wealth Management, I\u2019m curious you have these differentiated growth rates across the regions and especially in Global Family. I wonder how much of that relates to the money market fee waiver recapture, and how much of that is just pure business mix of the different type of customer? Biff Bowman : So, in the global family office, money market fee waivers, is a meaningful portion of that driver. As you might imagine, those are large, very high network families that often look more like an institutional type investor and may have had large cash balances in their portfolio so, fee waivers for them was a meaningful driver. Across the other regions I\u2019d say that\u2019s a better mix of fee waiver benefit and actual new business and flows. Glenn Schorr : Okay, thanks Biff. Operator : Our next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Biff Bowman : Hi Geoffrey. Geoffrey Elliott : Hi, thank you for taking the questions. Could you give us an update on the Department of Labor Fiduciary Rule, as you walk through the detail of that how is its impact shaping up relative to your initial expectations? Biff Bowman : Sure. We are continuing if you will to evaluate the impact of the fiduciary rule and we\u2019ve spent a lot of time and energy as you might have suspected in that evaluation and continue together with outside counsel and consulting experts on the DoL fiduciary standards. At this time we expect that any changes to our business model and product offerings will be limited. And the cost associated with the design implementation and ongoing monitoring of compliance will be moderate. We continue to wait for further guidance along with our industry and further clarifications. I think we anticipate perhaps some Q&As and other items to come out to give us further guidance. But at this point in time as I said we think that there will be a moderate impact and limited business model changes, is what we\u2019re anticipating. Geoffrey Elliott : Thanks. And then just to check on one of the previous questions that I understood what you were saying correctly. When you answered about dislocation amount European banks and the impact of that, it kind of sounds like that\u2019s an area you\u2019re focusing on when you\u2019re thinking about M&A opportunities. Did I understand that right? Biff Bowman : No, I would say that we focus on three areas when we think about where we can grow and in your case you\u2019re asking inorganically. The first is, is it filling a client need or gap is there a product gap. Second is, is there geography or a regional gap in our array of capabilities. And third is, is there a technological or talent gap in those? That\u2019s where we start. I think the question is phrased there is European institutions that are contemplating their own organizational structure. So many of those may have a capability or geography or a technological or talent gap where we have a need. So now that may manifest itself I don\u2019t think there is an extraordinary amount of focus on Europe versus any other region in the world. But right now there is, probably a lot of institutions that are contemplating their own business structures now and we stand ready to look at any opportunities that the first three criteria laid out for you. Geoffrey Elliott : Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Biff Bowman : Hi Brian. Brian Kleinhanzl : Hi Biff. One quick question on the move in the Pound Sterling this quarter, I mean, does that have a big impact on the revenues overall or could you quantify that for us? Mark Bette : Hi Brian, it\u2019s Mark. When you look at the P&L, it\u2019s important to remember that we do have a natural hedge where we have both revenue and expense in denominated currencies. And then for the extent that there is an exposure we hedge it. As far as the growth rates go, when you look at it on a year-over-year basis, the trust fee impact would probably be the area of revenue impact at the most by about 1 to 1.5 percentage points. And then on the expense side as well, you\u2019re look at about 1% to 1.5% benefit year-over-year on the currencies. And then sequentially there is also some impact there as well in both trust fees and expense where 1% or so lower due to currency exchange rates. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay, great. And then I heard you say that you had $3.6 million of expenses related to the Aviate Acquisition. Is that just merge related charges or is that the increase in run rate that you were saying was $3.6 million, sorry for the clarification? Mark Bette : So that was, it\u2019s Mark again, that was a $3.6 million impact in the quarter. What I would say is that that would include the quarter\u2019s expense was $6.6 million last quarter was $3.4 million. So, in the $6.6 million there is a modest amount of still integration expenses but we\u2019re calling that out just for the fact that the second quarter was kind of an abbreviated quarter because the acquisition closed in May. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. And then just last one on the tax rate. Could we at least assume that the tax rate guidance before where I think it was 33% with this new accounting change does it at least go over 33%? Biff Bowman : I\u2019m not sure we can provide any guidance on that. It\u2019s depending on again levels of stock that may vest and/or be exercised in the quarter. So, we can\u2019t provide any guidance on that. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay, thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from David Long with Raymond James. Biff Bowman : Hi David. David Long : Hi guys. Looking at the Wealth Management business, the assets under custody and assets under management both this quarter exceeded the movement in the S&P 500. But if I look back over the last few years, say since year-end 2013, the growth in the assets under custody and assets under management has been about 7.5% and 9% respectively when the S&P has been up about 17%. So, just curious as to how you can explain that difference in the Wealth Management business with the assets under custody and management underperforming the moves in the equity markets? Mark Bette : I could start David if you want just by talking a little bit about the allocation amount and then if Biff has anything to add. Currently with Wealth Management, when we look at AUM, about 47% are on equities as of the end of the quarter, 29% in fixed income and 24% in cash and other. So, certainly how the assets are allocated would be part of what the driver is there. David Long : Okay. Just looking at the equity side of it, the equities were up 7.5% since then versus 17%. I\u2019m just trying to see if there is anything that we should be considering that may not be obvious? Biff Bowman : I think just the macro trends and this is a little off the question but just in macro trends, we\u2019ve seen in Wealth Management the migration from active to passive and others have had some imputed impact on the business as well as quite frankly just flows, meaning as people have used their principle to live on other that\u2019s had a drag on our assets under management in particular. The assets under custody in our Wealth business are driven a little bit more by our GFO business, or excuse me, global family office, which where you tend to have larger pools more than the traditional wealth business. David Long : Got it. Thanks. Biff Bowman : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research Group. Biff Bowman : Hi Jim. Jim Mitchell : Hi good morning, just - most of my questions has been asked. So maybe just on money market mutual fund reform. Have you seen any change in behavior whether it\u2019s deposit flows or in the money market space in terms of your corporate or retail customers, just trying to get a sense of how that\u2019s going up? Biff Bowman : Yes, across the industry really $1 trillion in AUM moved in the government funds. And what we\u2019ve seen in our funds is no different. You\u2019ll be able to see the asset levels in each of our funds, on our funds\u2019 website. But overall we have seen a migration from prime and/or other funds of such ilk into government and/or treasury funds meaningfully. Notably for us is that we didn\u2019t see our total AUM drop in that, just the mix moved dramatically into government related funds. In fact I think we\u2019re actually $15 billion since in cash AUM since 2014, since summer of 2014. So, we\u2019ve seen that asset class grow but the mix is clearly shifted into government. What we didn\u2019t see was any meaningful migration onto the balance sheet. So, we did see that shift from prime and/or other gated or various funds into treasury and government funds but not on to balance sheet. Jim Mitchell : That\u2019s interesting. That really just stayed within the money market complex, didn\u2019t shift to deposits? Biff Bowman : That is what we have seen through the third week in October. Jim Mitchell : Okay. Great. Thank you. Biff Bowman : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Biff Bowman : Hi Marty. Marty Mosby : Hi. I wanted to ask you a little bit about the premium amortization and since that prepayments kicked up over the last couple of quarters, is that real-time or is there any lag as we expect that from a seasonal standpoint going down but also just from prepayment speeds slowing, I would expect that some of that premium amortization would also be kind of drift lower because of that as well? Biff Bowman : So, traditionally that\u2019s what we\u2019ve observed into the fourth quarter. And as you rightfully pointed out there is a series of factors other than just seasonality is it\u2019s generally market conditions, interest rates and a series of other factors. Our normal pattern has been to see that in the fourth quarter come off. The $20 million of premium amortization you saw in the third quarter as I said was elevated over the previous year 2015\u2019s third quarter by about $6 million. So we saw some modest decline in \u201815 from Q2 to Q3, this year we saw basically flat between the two. And in both of those years we saw meaningful declines from Q3 to Q4. Marty Mosby : A piece that I was also trying to get at has actually been, initially this year you came in expanding your duration or lengthening duration using what looked to be like a little bit more in the mortgage backed securities. Then you had the premium that then got hit because of the amortization and prepayments. Have you slowed down on your utilization of your balance sheet capacity that put all-in or has this kind of spooked you a little bit at all, I just don\u2019t see the same progress that we saw earlier this year in utilizing that capacity to increase the yield on your securities portfolio? Biff Bowman : Yes, so, the mortgage backed that you\u2019re talking about has increased I would say very modestly as a percent as you described it. I would not say it was because of being spooked by premium amortization because as you know that plays itself out over time. So that isn\u2019t the decision criteria. I think the duration decisions we make are just part of our regular asset liability process and our view on future rate movements. So, I wouldn\u2019t say that first of all it hasn\u2019t moved materially in size as a portfolio and secondly it certainly wasn\u2019t because of your word spooked because of the premium amortization. Marty Mosby : Yes. Last thing I was going to ask is, part of your capital decision was a fact that competitors were under pressure from regulatory kind of capital requirements or liquidity requirements, which was helping push some incremental deposits and balance sheet your way. Do you still like that as starting to settle as we\u2019re kind of seeing some of the others start to have less pressure as they\u2019ve kind of accomplished a lot of the movement that they needed to, over the last year? Biff Bowman : We saw a modest amount of that - to your earlier point, we saw a modest amount of that in the period of time when perhaps the balance sheet shrinkage was at its height. We\u2019ve seen I\u2019d say proportionally a little bit less as you rightfully described as institutions have sort of either right-sized their leverage ratio or right-sized their LCR requirements. I think we would retain and remain committed to the discipline we had in bringing those deposits on in the first place, which is looking at each individual opportunity of any substantial size and determining what the return dynamics are of it. We may be seeing a little bit fewer of those though. Marty Mosby : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Biff Bowman : Hi Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Hi Biff. I got a question on your [indiscernible] expense as a percentage of trust and investment fees on your slide 8. Do you guys have any longer term targeted goal of where you think that can get there? And as part of that question, obviously you\u2019ve had success taking in from 120 down to 107 from \u201812 to where we are today. The strategies used to do that, was it permanently cutting expenses rather than seeing revenue growth or was it more revenue growth and how do you see that playing out to get to an ultimate target in the next two or three years? Biff Bowman : Yes, we would, we\u2019ve not stated a public target for that ratio other than to say that we continue to try to drive it lower. So we\u2019ve not said anything further other than we\u2019re committed to driving it lower over time. The way we think about it Gerard is that our most reliable income source is our trust investment servicing fees. And if we continue to have that cover more and more of our operating expenses, it allows for some of the other profitability line items like foreign exchange that is net interest income to truly flow straight to the bottom line. In terms of how we get after it, it really is a dual effort. It is both the revenue and the expense line. On the revenue line, we think about that as the organic growth in there is controllable by us. So the ability to win new business, retain clients, is 100% inside of our capabilities and efforts around new product capabilities, services that we can bring to our client base is important. And so we focus on the organic growth on the fee side. On the expense side, we\u2019ve highlighted some of those initiatives to you. Probably most prominent over the last three to five years in driving that ratio has been our ability to locate our people in the right cost type locations. A great example is, in this quarter net, our net headcount grew only in what we deem to be tier-2 and tier-3 locations. There are other initiatives, we\u2019ve talked about procurement, we\u2019ve talked about technology saves where it\u2019s cloud based work or storage based work etcetera. But we really get after then the expense side where we do believe there are still levers inside the expense space that we can continue to pull. A combination of those, we think can continue to drive that ratio lower. It is more difficult as we eliminate some of the lower hanging fruit. Gerard Cassidy : Great. And then, as a follow-up, and obviously we\u2019re all familiar with Governor Tarullo\u2019s speech a couple of weeks back about issuing an MPR on the qualitative part of CECAR for banks under $250 billion in assets not having to go through the qualitative portion. Assuming that sticks and the qualitative portion is removed from your CECAR process, will that change your view on how much capital you will return to shareholders, I recognize you always like to keep very strong capital levels because of your reputation. But would that still influence you guys on thinking a little differently about the return of excess capital? Biff Bowman : Well, Gerard, actually we\u2019re what they term 15-18-Bank, we\u2019re not exempt from that language because while our balance sheet is lower than $250 billion another caveat is around more than $10 billion of foreign balance sheet. We do exceed that as you see. So, we are in what they deem the large and complex bank group which is not what Governor Tarullo was discussing in that meeting, so. Gerard Cassidy : True, okay, thank you. I appreciate that. Biff Bowman : Still CECAR qualitative and quantitative in our requirements. Thanks. Operator : And that does conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. Thank you for your participation. And you may now disconnect. Biff Bowman : Thank you.",

Let me turn the call over to Biff Bowman. Biff Bowman : Good morning everyone. Let me join Mark in welcoming you to Northern Trust fourth quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Starting on page two of our quarterly earnings review presentation this morning, we reported fourth quarter net income of $267 million. Earnings per share were $1.11, and our return on common equity was 11.9%. Our assets under custody administration and under management increased 11%, 10% and 8% respectively compared to the prior year, reflecting favorable markets and our continued success in winning new business. A number of environmental factors impact our businesses as well as our clients. Before going through our results in detail, let me review how some of those factors unfolded during the fourth quarter. Equity markets performed well during the quarter. In U.S. markets, the S&P 500 ended the quarter up 9.5% year-over-year and up 3.3% sequentially. In international markets, the MSCI EAFE Index was up 2.3% year-over-year and up 6.7% sequentially. Recall that some of our fees are based on lagged market values and third quarter markets were also up compared to the prior year, as well as sequentially. In bond markets, the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index was down four-tenths of a percent compared to last year, and down 3.8% sequentially. Currency volatility, as measured by the G7 Index, was 8% higher than the fourth quarter of last year and six-tenths of a percent higher sequentially. Foreign exchange market volumes were mixed in the fourth quarter. As reported by one interbank broker, volumes were up 2% sequentially, but now 3% compared to one year ago. You\u2019ll recall that the currency volatility and client activity influenced our foreign exchange trading income. Currency rates influenced the translation of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar and, therefore, impact client assets and certain revenues and expenses. Dollar strength tempered custody asset growth and related fee growth, while benefiting expense growth, both for the year-over-year and sequential comparisons. The British pound ended the third quarter 16.5% lower than one year ago and 5% lower sequentially. The euro ended the quarter 3.2% lower than one year ago and 5.8% lower sequentially. U.S. short-term interest rates were higher during the quarter. Most evident in three-month LIBOR which averaged 92 basis points in the quarter compared to 79 basis points in the prior quarter, and 41 basis points one year ago. Elsewhere, after 25 basis points reduction during the third quarter, the Bank of England total official bank rate steady in the fourth quarter. Let\u2019s move on to page three and review the financial highlights of the fourth quarter. Year-over-year, revenue increased 7% with non-interest income up 6% and net interest income up 11%. Expenses increased 6%, producing 1.2 points of positive operating leverage. The provision for credit losses was a credit of $22 million. Net income was 11% higher year-over-year. In the sequential comparison revenue was up 2% with non-interest income up 1%, and net interest income up 6%. Expenses were up 4% compared to the prior quarter. Net income was 3% higher sequentially. Return on average common equity was 11.9% for the quarter, up from the 11.1% reported one year ago, and up from the 11.7% in the prior quarter. Client assets under custody of $6.7 trillion increased 11% compared to one year ago, and were flat on a sequential basis. In the year-over-year comparison, solid new business and favorable market impacts were partially offset by the currency translation impact of a stronger dollar. For the sequential comparison, the impact of the stronger dollar fully offset the favorable impact of markets and new business. Assets under management were $942 billion, up 8% year-over-year and flat on a sequential basis. Favorable market impacts in new business throughout the year-over-year growth. Let\u2019s look at the results in greater detail, starting with revenue on page four. Fourth quarter revenue, on a fully taxable equivalent basis, was approximately $1.2 billion, up 7% from last year and up 2% sequentially. Trust, investment and other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue and were $794 million in the fourth quarter, up 6% year-over-year and up 1% from the prior quarter. Lower money market mutual fund fee waivers were an important driver of the performance compared to last year. Fee waivers were essentially zero in the fourth quarter compared to $20.5 million one year ago. Fee waivers were not a factor in the sequential comparison. Foreign exchange trading income was $50 million in the fourth quarter, up 10% year-over-year and up 8% sequentially. Both comparisons benefitted from higher client volumes, as well as higher volatility. Other non-interest income was $65 million in the fourth quarter, down 5% from last year and down 6% sequentially. Other operating income in the current quarter included charges of $8.1 million related to the decision to exit the portion of a non-strategic loan in this portfolio. The prior quarter\u2019s results included a charge of $5.4 million related to this portfolio. The decline compared to the prior year was primarily driven by the $8.1 million charge in the current quarter, partially offset by growth relating to the Aviate acquisition, which closed during the second quarter. The decline, sequentially, was primarily due to the larger charge in the current quarter related to the loan and lease portfolio. Net interest income, which I will discuss in more detail later, was $329 million in the fourth quarter, increasing 11% year-over-year and up 6% sequentially. Let\u2019s look at the components of our trust and investment fees on page five. For our corporate and institutional services business, fees totaled $457 million in the fourth quarter, up 7% year-over-year and 1% on a sequential basis. Custody & Fund Administration fees, the largest component of C&ISs, were $303 million, up 6% compared to the prior and up 1% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential comparisons benefitted from new business and favorable equity markets, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates. Assets under custody for C&IS clients were $6.2 trillion at quarter-end, up 11% year-over-year and flat sequentially. These results primarily reflect new business and favorable markets, partially offset by the unfavorable currency exchange rates. Recall that land and market values factor into the quarter\u2019s fees with both quarter lag and month lag markets impacting our C&IS custody and fund administration fees. Investment management fees in C&IS of $94 million in the fourth quarter were up 10% year-over-year and flat sequentially. The year-over-year growth was driven in large part by lower money market mutual fund waivers. As was the case in the prior two quarters, fee waivers in C&IS were essentially zero during the fourth quarter compared to $8 million one year ago. Assets under management for C&IS clients were $694 billion, up 7% year-over-year but down 1% sequentially. Securities lending fees were $25 million in the fourth quarter, 13% higher than one year ago and 9% higher sequentially. The year-over-year increase was driven by increased spreads, primarily relating to the widening of the spread between the LIBOR and overnight rates. The sequential growth was driven by improved spreads, as well as higher volumes. Security lending collateral was a $112 billion at quarter end, and averaged $119 billion across the quarter. Average collateral levels decreased 4% year-over-year and were up 5% sequentially. The decline in volumes compared to the prior year was across most asset classes. The sequential increase of volumes was influenced by market appreciation, increased demand for U.S. treasuries and a larger supply of securities available to lend. Securities lending activities has been impacted by the regulatory landscape as actions have been taken by agent lenders and borrowers to calibrate capital usage. Other fees in C&IS were $34 million in the fourth quarter, up 1% for both year-over-year and sequential comparisons, reflecting higher fees from investment risk and analytical services, benefit payments and other ancillary services. Moving to our Wealth Management business, trust investment and other servicing fees were $338 million in the fourth quarter, up 6% year-over-year but flat sequentially. Within Wealth Management, the global family office business had strong performance with fees increasing 19% year-over-year and 4% sequentially due to lower money market mutual fund fee waivers compared to one year ago, as well as favorable markets and new business. Performance within the regions also benefited from lower money market fee waivers compared to last year, as well as favorable markets and new business. Money market mutual fund fee waivers in the Wealth Management were essentially zero in the current quarter, which was equal to the prior quarter and down $13 million year-over-year. Assets under management for Wealth Management clients were $248 billion at quarter end, up 9% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Moving to page six, net interest income was $329 million in the fourth quarter, up 11% year-over-year. Earning assets averaged $108 billion in the fourth quarter, up 3% versus last year, driven by higher level deposits and short-term borrowings. Demand deposits, which averaged $26 billion, increased 1% year-over-year and non-U.S. office interest bearing deposits, which averaged $52 billion, were up 2% year-over-year. Loan balances averaged $34 billion in the fourth quarter and were flat compared to one year ago. The net interest margin was 1.2% in the fourth quarter and was up nine basis points from a year ago. The improvement in the net interest margin compared to the prior year primarily reflects a higher yield on earning assets due to higher short-term interest rates. On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income was up 6% as average earning assets were up 1%, while the net interest margin increased 6 basis points sequentially, driven by lower premium amortization and higher short-term interest rates. Premium amortization was $10 million in the fourth quarter compared to less than $1 million one year ago, and $20 million in the third quarter. Turning to page seven, expenses were $874 million in the fourth quarter, up 6% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. Compensation expense of $391 million increased 7% year-over-year and increased 2% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential growth was attributable to staff growth, base pay adjustments, which were effective October 1st, and higher performance based compensation, partially offset by favorable translation impact of changes in currency rates. Staff levels increased approximately 6% year-over-year. The growth in staff was all attributable to lower cost locations, which include India, Manila, Limerick and Tempe, Arizona. Employee benefit expense of $77 million included $4 million relating to non-U.S. pension settlements. Benefit expense, including this item, was up 12% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher medical cost, payroll taxes and pension related expense. On a sequential quarter basis, benefit expense was up 6%, driven by higher pension related expense, partially offset by lower medical costs. Outside services expense of $161 million was up 4% compared to the prior year, driven primarily by higher market data costs within technical services. On a sequential quarter basis, outside services expense was up 2% primarily driven by higher consulting expense relating to regulatory work, as well as initiatives such as cyber security. This was partially offset by lower sub-custody costs. Equipment and software expense of $121 million was up 3% from one year ago and up 5% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential growth were primarily driven by increased software amortization, continuing our technology strategy as we invest to support clients, improve employee efficiency and meet regulatory compliance requirements. Occupancy expense of $47 million was up 7% from one year ago and up 6% sequentially. Growth in occupancy expense has been driven by higher rent, as well as $2 million early termination penalty recorded in the current quarter. Other operating expense of $78 million increased 4% year-over-year, primarily related to higher FDIC costs and advertising. Sequentially, the category increased 9%, primarily due to increased business promotion and advertising expense. Advertising spend during the quarter was strategically focused on wealth management markets and our ETF FlexShare products. It is worth noting that on a full year basis our total business promotional spent was down 2% from the prior year. Our loan loss provision was a credit of $22 million in the fourth quarter. The credit provision in the current quarter was primarily driven by improved credit quality in the underlying data used in the quantitative portion of the inherent allowance for credit losses that resulted in a reduction in the allowance described to the residential real-estate and private client portfolios. The credit provision was partially offset by an increase to a specific reserve in the commercial portfolio that was charged off during the current quarter. Credit quality during the quarter remained strong with non-performing assets totaling $165 million compared to $181 million in the prior quarter, and $188 million one year ago. Non-performing loans to total loans equaled only 47 basis points at quarter end. Turning to the full year, our results in 2016 are summarized on page eight. Net income was $1.03 billion, up 6% compared with 2015 and earnings per share were $4.32, up 8% compared with the prior year. On the right margin of this page, we outline the non-recurring impacts that were called-out in our second quarter 2016 earnings release. The net revenue impact of these items was $96.6 million, while the expense related charges were $82.6 million. The page also outlines the non-recurring impact from the second quarter of 2015, which included net revenue impact of $82.1 million and an expense charge of $45.8 million. We achieved a return on equity for the year of 11.9%. This performance was within our target range of 10% to 15%, and an improvement from our 2015 performance. Full year revenue expense trends are outlined on page nine. Trust, investment and other servicing fees grew 4% in 2016. Lower fee waivers and new business across segments and geographies contributed to this result, partially offset by the impact of unfavorable equity markets and unfavorable currency exchange rates. Foreign exchange trading income declined 10%, primarily reflecting mixed volumes across the year compared to prior year. Other non-interest income was down 2% from last year, and was down 3% if adjusted for the items I called out on the prior page. Net interest income increased 15%, and was up 13% if you exclude the items I called out on the prior page. The growth in net interest income was primarily driven by higher short-term interest rates, coupled with earning asset growth. The net result was growth in overall revenue in 2016 both on a reported basis and also if you exclude the items I called out on the prior page. On a reported basis, expenses were up 6% from the prior year, adjusting for the expenses charges, the expense charges in both 2015 and 2016 that I mentioned in the prior page. Expenses were up 5% from 2015, reflecting investments in staffing and technology to support the growth of business, as well as to comply with the evolving regulatory requirements. Turning to page 10, a key focus has been on sustainably enhancing profitability and returns. This slide reflects the progress we\u2019ve made in recent years to improve the expense to fee ratio, pre-tax margin and ultimately our return on equity. The ratio of expenses to Trust and investment fees is a particularly important measure of our progress as it addresses what we can most directly control. Reducing this measure from what it was previously as high as 131 in 2011 to the levels we see today is a key contributor to the improvement and our return on equity. This metric remains an important parameter of our progress and we remain committed to lowering it on a sustainable basis going forward, from continuing to win new business to drive fee growth, and driving productivity within our expense base through our ongoing initiatives focused on location strategy, procurement and technology. Turning to page 11, our capital ratios remained solid with common equity Tier 1 ratios of 12.4% and 11.8% respectively, calculated on a transition basis for both advanced and standardized. On a fully phased-in basis, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the advanced approach would be approximately 12.1% and under the standardized approach would be approximately 11.5%. All of these ratios are well above the fully phased-in requirement of 7%, which includes the capital conversation buffer. The supplementary leverage ratio at the corporation was 6.7% at the bank and 6% -- at the corporation with 6.7% and at the bank 6.0%, both of which exceed the 3% requirement which will be applicable to Northern Trust in 2018. With respect to the liquidity coverage ratio, Northern Trust is above the 90% minimum requirement, effective as of January 1, 2016, and is also above the 100% minimum requirement that became effective on January 1, 2017. As Northern Trust progresses through fully phased-in Basel III implementation, there could be additional enhancements to our models and further guidance from the regulators on the implementation of the final rule, which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final Basel III rules. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 823,000 shares of common stock at a cost of $65 million. In closing, in 2016, we continue to grow the firm profitability for our shareholders, deliver comprehensive solutions for our clients and improve our technology and infrastructures to ensure the sustainability of our momentum. From a financial perspective, we delivered return on average common equity of 11.9% for the full year, moving further into our target range of 10% to 15%. We produced $1.03 billion of net income, surpassing the $1 billion mark for the first time in our corporation\u2019s history. In addition, we returned $778 million to our shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases, while maintaining strong capital and liquidity ratios. Our C&IS business continue to demonstrate strong growth in 2016. Total revenue grew 8% and trust fees grew 5%, even with the strong dollar hurting fees by 2%. We continue to build on our product solutions and capabilities evidenced by our Aviate acquisition. Our Wealth Management business grew revenues 6% year-over-year and continued to produce attractive margins, achieving 38% pre-tax margin for the year. Our focus on large markets pay dividends as we saw strong growth in location such as New York City and Houston. We were also pleased to be named best private bank by Professional Wealth Management and The Banker magazines. Our asset management business had success as well as evidenced by the strong growth and reflects shares ETFs, with assets growing from $7.6 billion at year-end 2015 to almost $12 billion by the end of 2016. Lastly, we continue invest in innovation and technology. Our efforts around robotics, artificial intelligence, distributor ledger, cloud and others continue to advance and are set to help us operate more efficiently and create superior solutions for our clients. Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust fourth quarter earnings conference call today. Mark and I will be happy to answer your questions. Alicia, please open the line. Operator : Thank you, sir [Operator Instructions]. We\u2019ll go first to Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI. Biff Bowman : Hi, Glenn. Hello? Operator : Glenn, please check your mute function, you might be on mute. Glenn Schorr : So I guess, I just want to talk about -- well it could be just some timing differences and some fee compression between AUC, AUM year-on-year and sequentially and in the fee rate. So it\u2019s the age old question of, if assets under custody and assets under management are up 11% and 8% year-on-year, Trust fees were like up maybe 6%. I\u2019m curious, if you could talk to just what\u2019s mix versus what\u2019s timing versus lag pricing? Biff Bowman : So, we\u2019ll be composed that a bit. The first thing that I would say, overtime, the correlation between AUC and fees holds up, but in any given quarter, we could have large inflows or outflows that could skew that. So, that\u2019s one factor to start there, but more specific. As we\u2019ve grown our global fund services business over the past three to five years, the traditional lag that you\u2019ve seen in fees has actually start to migrate away from quarterly lags and more to a balanced or 50-50 type one-month versus three-month type lag overall on our fees. So, you need to consider perhaps a different lag impact in the market when we do that. Also in this quarter, currency impacts were quite meaningful in the fourth quarter. So, that correlation between the assets under custodies and the fees were impacted meaningfully by the currency, particularly the Sterling weakening sequentially. So, combined all of those, explain what I think you\u2019re referring to as maybe disconnect between the AUC growth and the actual fee line. I would end with, in the wealth space too, there is still continued compression. So, the compression that you see, particularly in the wealth from migrations, from active to passive has helped mute some of the correlation between the AUC and the fees. Mark Bette : Glenn, the other thing I would add to is with AUC and AUM, obviously, those were point in time. So they don\u2019t always think up with how fees might build or accrue for over the course of the quarter. But we have the C&IS side when we look at the fund or the custody in the fund number type revenues versus the AUC over a longer period. We\u2019ve seen what we think the fee rates there to hold up pretty well. Glenn Schorr : And maybe just one purposely simple question on the expense side, I think each of the line items are a little higher than I thought than I think other people thought. Could you talk about what you think are good jumping-off point as we go forward versus not? Like, I know, we have the employee benefits special issue but\u2026 Biff Bowman : So, if I could, perhaps there is three items that I think are worthy of special mention in the quarter. The first is the $4 million pension settlement accounting issue that you see in benefits. It\u2019s a quite technical accounting issue, but it is, in essence, if there are departures and/or outflows from our pension plans, and these were in the UK or Europe. It can trigger what is known as settlement accounting, which requires the booking if you will, the unrealized gains or losses in the portfolios. It\u2019s a relatively technical accounting issue that we saw happen in this quarter for the first time since I\u2019ve been CFO. The second item that I think is worthy to call out is we did take an action on the occupancy line, a $2 million settlement to allow us for an early exit from space. So, we think it has a longer term benefit, but came with $2 million line item in occupancy. And there is a last item that I will call out is we had a significant sequential increase in business promotion that you would see approximately $5 million above what, if you look at historical run rates for us. And that was really an opportunistic business decision we took to add additional advertising and marketing in support of two of our very important growth initiatives, which is around our mega market strategy and in particular our flex share ETFs. And the pricing in the market, the timing, was attractive and a decision was done to take that in the fourth quarter. So, that was $5 million increase that was within our control, the one that we felt would generate the right return for all involved. I would suggest those were items that are worthy of special mention for you to think about your models going forward. Operator : We'll go next to Brennan Hawken of UBS. Brennan Hawken : So, wanted to touch-base, it seems like with the AUC movement in C&IS, I know, you touched on FX in your prepared remarks, Biff, but maybe unpacking that a little bit. Was that the driver of why we saw more or less flat sequential AUC, despite equity markets that were generally positive? Or was the headwind primarily given the rising yields, and therefore pressure on prices and bond markets? Biff Bowman : No, the impact was almost all currency sequentially. In fact, I think, it was about 2 points sequentially for C&IS and that would have been a more normalized sequential growth rate historically. So, it was almost all explainable by currency sequentially for C&IS. Brennan Hawken : Sequentially, 2 percentage points of growth, have you actually said? Biff Bowman : That's correct. Biff Bowman : And then next, second question here. Have you noticed any changes in risk appetite in your Wealth Management client base over the past few months given some of the significant moves we\u2019ve seen in the market? And how durable, if you\u2019re seeing any changes, how durable do you think those changes might be? Biff Bowman : So I think there's been amongst our client base a bit of sense of optimism, if I could say that. Post election we have seen some positive flows into the equities in the fourth quarter. And we had slightly negative fixed income flows. So I would generally say that we have seen a positive demeanor towards risk, assets in the portfolio. And we think about the term money and motion. So, our wealth clients think about either investment or in their own businesses or opportunities to do more M&A. We have just generally seen a tonal improvement, but not actual events happening at this point. But from an asset flow, we did see some move to equity some out of fixed income in the quarter, but a general tonally view from our wealth clients. Particularly given they also may be more optimistic about taxes which frees-up a disposable income as well. Operator : We'll go next to Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Biff, maybe just focusing on the balance sheet., maybe if you can just review or refresh the leverage to LIBOR, say versus the 10 year in the loan and leases bucket in terms of getting through the 1% towards. How that might impact if we get commensurate move in LIBOR with the next debt hike? Biff Bowman : I'll take a walk-through the balance sheet a little bit and the impacts from the rising rates, I think the best way to tackle. So if you look at our balance sheet, and I'm going to start with the securities portfolio and I know you talked long term leases, we'll get to that. If we look at the securities portfolio, roughly half of our securities portfolio, roughly half of the $45 billion, is what being the short-term portion of the portfolio. Those assets reprice relatively quickly and certainly under a year. And they are heavily impacted by one month and three months LIBOR movements, and more by one month than three month. So the way we think about that is, over the fourth quarter, one month LIBOR averaged, I believe, 60 basis points. If you use a point in time today, I won't project the average for the first quarter. I'll let you do that in your models. But that's closer to 78 basis points today. We anticipate seeing the benefit of that flow-through in the securities portfolio, inside that year timeframe, we saw it relatively quickly. So, that's a positive, if you will, for the short-term portion of our securities portfolio. On the loan portfolio, we have a very short duration, if you will, as well on the loan portfolio with a meaningful portion. Mark, will get you the exact number here if we get through it. But a meaningful portion floating, I think, around 75% floating\u2026 Mark Bette : 75% repricing within one year\u2026 Biff Bowman : Yes. So the benefits there are from three month LIBOR should flow through relatively quickly on that portion of the portfolio as well. Brian Bedell : And are there floors to get through on those loans so that we should see more of the repricing in future quarters? Biff Bowman : We'll get back to you on that. I don't believe so, but I want to confirm that when we follow back-up. Brian Bedell : And then just on the core business in terms of, I guess, as we think of investment through going to next year. I know you want to keep that expense, because fee ratio improved upon that. But I would say how do you think about incremental margins to higher rates in terms of how you feel about project spend in building out the, mostly the assets servicing business, I guess, I would be thinking about? Biff Bowman : Here\u2019s the way we think about that. And to improve the expense to fee ratio, we obviously have to drive fee operating leverage. So our fees have to grow faster than our expenses. In periods of time where net interest income or foreign exchange is constrained, we view that we need to widen out that fee operating leverage to produce the types of returns our shareholders expect. If net interest income and other items strengthen, then that, we still want to improve and maintain that fee operating leverage and improve it, as I said. But the width of that or the amount of that operating leverage is something that we look at controlling, if I could. So, we still are absolutely committed to growing our fees faster than our expenses, and we did not achieve that for the full year last year. And I can assure you that that is something that is a focal point of the management team. If we do have the benefit of rising rates, we believe that they should widen out the total operating leverage for the firm, but we still want to see that expense to fees improved, even in improving rate environment, that's a key metric for us internally. Operator : We'll go next to Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : Just sticking up on that last point around the operating leverages, so to your point expenses to core fees were flattish, or that ratio didn\u2019t really improved in fact over the last two years, I guess now. Despite the fact that this year you guys did for coupon, 100% of money market fee waivers in equity markets were generally a little bit more supportive, bumpy but overall it's probably somewhat supportive. I guess what are the reasons why we haven\u2019t seen better operating leverage on sea side of the equitation in 2016? And since you think about 2017, what are some of the initiatives that you\u2019re trying to put into place to, just to your point, to still focus on improving it? Biff Bowman : So, you\u2019re right, we had the benefit of fee waivers. Markets actually while up in absolute total the way they manifested themselves with the very rocky start, ended up not really being added and there were slight contractor year-over-year. And currency was also a meaningful contractor. So, they partially offset the waivers. So you\u2019re right in that comment. More importantly in the question is what are the initiatives, and we\u2019ve talked about many here. But let me try to give you something a little more tangible that we anticipate helping them. We are in production now with three areas where we are relying or using robotics to improve our efficiency right now. In 2016, those were probably in proof-of-concept, and were probably accruing expenses to get ready in 2017 actually in the fourth quarter of 2016 late, we put those in, and we actually now have robotics working on three key functions. There is a pipeline of other areas inside of our enterprise enablement operation where we are looking at things like further robotics, artificial intelligence, and that pipeline will manifest during the course of the year. But I hope it\u2019s a tangible example to show that maybe the expense accruing for those in 2016, we will start to get the operational benefits of those in 2017 as they go up in running in live. And we continue to look at things, like our procurement function. One of the larger drivers of our outside service ramp this year was in market data. We continue to look at ways to reduce our market data cost from a procurement perspective as well. And what I will say sort of a usage perspective, are we using it appropriately. Alex Blostein : And then shifting gears, I wanted to touch on just the wealth management business. Again, it looks like outside of the global family office, revenues are down a little bit, kind of flattish over the last three quarters, or so. And I understand that the timing and certainly the mix-shift between active to passive is weighing on this. Can you help us dissect that a little bit more, just thinking through the movement from active to passive, what are the relevant fee rates within that revenue category that we need to think about, and either bucket? And what is the percentage, maybe elastics that are active versus passive, for you guys right now? Because it feels like that fee rate continues to drift lower? Biff Bowman : Let me break the components down a little bit. The active to passive shift that we talk about, we\u2019ve absolutely seen that move up, but we don\u2019t give that number out. So we\u2019ve seen that move up from a modest percentage into something much more meaningful as we\u2019ve seen that shift each year. And so that is one of the drivers. But we break it down a little bit into, what I would say, are the asset management fees and the advisory fees that we charge our wealth clients. The advisory fees has held relatively stable. We\u2019ve seen less of a compression in what we can charge on the advisory line. It\u2019s in the compression around the active to passive movement or other asset management products that has driven some of that flattening that you suggest you see in Wealth Management and we see as well in Wealth Management. So an example would be we\u2019ve seen flows out of our actively and actively priced multi-manager mutual fund family into more passive solutions. That is absolutely a fee compression issue along that change. Advisory fees, however, to our clients, while under constant competitive environment really been able to remain fairly flattish. So, you got to break it into two, it\u2019s really more of the asset management piece that\u2019s driving that compression as opposed to the fees in total. Alex Blostein : But we don\u2019t know the relative sizing of the bucket range? Biff Bowman : Actually, I don\u2019t have the breakdown. We\u2019ll think about that number. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research. Geoffrey Elliott : Could you help us understand the magnitude in million dollars of the benefit from a 25 basis point increase in short-term rates? It just feels like from the disclosures in the 10-Q and so on, it\u2019s a little bit hard to get to a number. So can you help us to think about what sort of benefit we should see, and then how that breaks-down between what you\u2019ve already got in 4Q and what\u2019s still to come in 1Q? Biff Bowman : So, we can\u2019t give the exact guidance. I\u2019m trying to repeat a little bit of what we said. If you look at our balance sheet and look at the pacing with which we would see the benefit of one month and three month LIBOR, largely impacting the short-end of the securities portfolio. And you can do your own calculations on that, and get to what the improvement in that is. The other exercise I would suggest that you look at is if you look at our improvement in net interest income year-over-year and take the balance sheet and make it comparable in size or look at any mix shifts, that\u2019s all information that you would have. You can see what that drove in terms of the year-over-year improvement from the first 25 basis point hike. What I would suggest is that they just could be different with a second rate hike, and maybe that\u2019s another factor in there. Also, the other thing would be to look at what the premium amortization is year-over-year and the impact of that that potentially could have on that year-over-year. It depends on the data, but the 25 basis points that we just saw will definitely be beneficial to our net interest income. And we don\u2019t provide that guidance any further than that, we\u2019ll let you do that in your own model. Geoffrey Elliott : I guess, maybe to focus on this a bit more. You gave some simulations, and the case and cues around for rates, 100 basis points higher, 200 basis points higher. But they don\u2019t really seem to marry up with what we see in the financials, and there actually is a moving rate, I mean, I think on the 200 basis points, you\u2019ve actually got a negative impact in there. So, is there anything you could do around the modeling assumptions on that sensitivity disclosure to get it a bit closer to what we see in reality, because otherwise it just feels like a disclosure that isn\u2019t of a lot of value because it doesn\u2019t seem to match up with what we have observed, in term the asset sensitivity seems to be a lot higher? Biff Bowman : Well, first I would suggest that the disclosures that we put around our sensitivity of earnings are solely disclosure is done from a risk lens. It has above a projected curve, the returns above a projected curve. And the beta assumptions in there are derived from a risk lens from a conservative lens. So your assessment that it may or may not reflect exactly what would happen, it needs to be taken from an perspective of the risk disclosure. And I really can\u2019t say much more than that, that\u2019s where we\u2019re at. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Just wondering, can you quantify for us, both on a fourth quarter and full year basis, what the impact of FX was on revenues and expenses? Biff Bowman : Yes, we can. On revenues, for the full year, I believe it was 1% of an impact from foreign exchange drag on revenue, and similar on expenses. Ken Usdin : And was it bigger, I meant year-over-year fourth quarter. I am just wondering if there was a bigger burden in the fourth. Biff Bowman : Yes. So that was more on a full year basis. For the fourth quarter, on a year-over-year basis, the total revenue impact was closer to 0.5% with Trust fees being almost 2 percentage points, and then expenses also being 2 percentage points. As we\u2019ve talked about before, we do have a natural hedge with revenue and expense coming through in the current season and we had a hedge, the difference in accordance with GAAP. So, we do see a net new pretax impact, generally. But it does impact, as you suspect, mostly the Trust fee and the expense growth. And then on a sequential basis, the Trust fee impact was almost 1 point of growth, which was also in line with what the expenses were as well. Ken Usdin : So my follow-up is then just, if there was a 2% helper on the expense side then the fourth quarter even at some of the items, expense growth number was just really high. And just to your earlier point about managing expenses to Trust fees on a year-over-year basis, going forward, and now having that kind of nice helper on the NII side to alleviate some stress on that. I guess, the question is, you mentioned some of the initiative you\u2019ve been investing in. But I think you guys had also talked about some other regulatory stuff still catching up this year, whether it was living will and additional CCAR expenses. So, is there anything else that you can help us understand that just might allow an absolute number of expense growth to be under better control as we go ahead as opposed to just focusing on the leverage equation? Biff Bowman : So let me start with the regulatory portion of it. We are another year or in our fourth year of CCAR, and we continue to mature and have the right maturity base around something like that. And that was a -- has been a meaningful ramp in expense in '15 and '16. We are anticipating that that, the steepness of that curve flattens out, and maybe completely flattens out around the cost there. We haven't gotten feedback on our resolution plan at this point. So, I'm hesitant to give you any kind of feedback on whether our regulatory spend will go up or down from that. So that's an area in the regulatory spend where we certainly hope and particularly given maybe the regime with the new president elect. Perhaps, we could get some reprieve on the regulatory spend or certainly the trajectory slowing on that line item. And we continue to move on things like I said in procurement, particularly around market date and others, to help drive that expense growth rate that you\u2019re talking about further and further down. Ken Usdin : And one last just quick one, could you just talk about the impact of rates on either the pension expense outlook and premium am? Biff Bowman : Yes, I will start with pension. The rates that we would have, the discount rate would be down from 4.71% to 4.46%. So net of that plus our expected return on our portfolio coming down. The net impact is very-very modest expense increase year-over-year, very modest, I think. Mark Bette : Yes, and you'll see that when we do our 10-K disclosures as well. And then there is one other part, Ken, I think. Ken Usdin : Just on premium am, as you think, contemplating them? Mark Bette : Yes, on premium am, if you believe that that will slow down the refinancing, that should be beneficial to the premium am in our portfolio, if we think that will slow down, again, the refinanciangs that you see, which intuitively makes sense, unless there's some type of rush before a rising rate environment that impacts that. But we had seen historically the fourth and first quarter are the more favorable, and then the second and the third are where we see more unfavorable impacts from that, just from a seasonal perspective. But the rest, I guess, would be based on what we're seeing in the markets from housing and refinance. Operator : We'll go next to Betsy Grasic of Morgan Stanley. Betsy Grasic : I just wanted to follow-up on one of the comments you made earlier around the project that you've got with robotics. And I wanted to understand what that was, what that kind of test phase is all about. And when and how you plan on rolling that out into production? Biff Bowman : Yes. So, we actually have three areas of production, but one I discussed with our Chief Operating Officer today is, if you think about a function, such as reconciliations they have a very automated component-tree to it. We have looked at certain elements of our reconciliations, and this proof-of-concept testing, if you will, in 2016 and are now actually utilizing certain elements of reconciliations with robotics type solution. So that's one example. There were actually two others in production, and I'll leave those to let you know in future quarters. But that's one that we were comfortable discussing here. So, we were in somewhat at expense mode and now we hope to start to see some of the economic benefits of those as they come online, if you will, during '17 and '18. Betsy Grasic : Are these, like marginal benefits or are these more big enough to enable you to scale faster, or actually bring down costs? Biff Bowman : So, in the early quarters, it would probably be incremental to what you said, and on the margin. But we believe that the portfolio of these opportunities is something that will be able to help us address the expense structures that you're talking about. Anyone individual may have some incremental approach, but we've got a portfolio that we're investing in over this year and next year. And we believe the combination is helpful to that expense, the fee [technical difficulty]. Operator : We'll go next to Brian Kleinhanzl of KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : I had a quick question on the tax. I know with the change in accounting now for compensation, there's lot more volatility in the tax line. But how should we think about that going forward now, especially with the ramp in the stock price? Does that impact as well, so that now we look out to '17 and '18, we should be lower than we are at least in the fourth quarter? Biff Bowman : Sure. Yes, you're right. We did the early adoption ASU 2016-9, which is for share accounting. It was beneficial for the entire year, I think, to the tune of about $12 million of provision. And that was largely a factor as we saw larger equity transactions in the back half of the year. So, that helped improve that benefit. But another thing, perhaps more core to improving the tax rate too is, as we have greater earnings from abroad and we bring more legal entities into our APV23, which we look at from time-to-time and assert to, that too has the benefit of lowering the effective tax rate. So, we worked pretty hard this year to work on those things that could help improve the effective tax rate. So, I think if we look, we don't give guidance. But some of those items produce permanent tax benefits or tax benefits if we accrue earnings in those entities. Operator : We'll go next to Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets. Gerard Cassidy : Question on broader picture, I think, this year you were going to start to see the baby-boom generation start to be forced to take money out of there, their defined contribution plans because of the age requirement. How do you guys look at that over the next three or four years affecting any of your businesses on the assets under custody in terms of having customers have to take money out from the funds that are managing that money? Biff Bowman : That\u2019s a good question, I saw the same article. I think the first-generation of baby-boomers have reached that mandatory withdrawal age, right I think, this year. So, we think throughout that we bring a holistic capability. I mean, we really think about what I would say is a life-driven Wealth Management approach. And it recognizes that as you reach certain stages in your life, maybe this is the mandatory withdrawal stage. We got other products and capabilities and help them understand the tax consequences and the reinvestment of that, if you could, from a defined contribution or other plan into other assets that quite frankly marry with where they are in the stage of their lifecycle. So, the question would be, I think, does it impact our AUC and our C&IS business, or does it impact our Wealth Management business. It\u2019s going to impact both, right. So, I can give you the wealth perspective. On the C&IS side, as those assets come out of defined contribution plans, we have a smaller book of business around defined contribution than we do define benefit in general. But we do have a meaningful defined contribution. The pension portion is not as driven by this as the mandatory withdrawals from defined contribution. So, I think, I want to make sure you were asking about it from a wealth perspective or from a AUC in our custody business perspective, to make sure I answered it the right way there. Gerard Cassidy : No, you did. And thank you for addressing in both the areas, I appreciate that. And getting back to robotics, obviously, you talked about how it\u2019s going to maybe reduce expenses and be more efficient, especially in reconciliation and things like that. Is there any use. Because I know you\u2019re very high-touched in talking in Wealth Management. But is there any use of robo-advising for you guys at some point in the future, do you think? Biff Bowman : So we certainly monitor that world. And as we think about inter-generational components to our existing wealth, many want to use something that looks that way. We would believe that our Goals Powered solution application is a form of a high technology, high touch component. It is a very sophisticated way using technology to address the holistic wealth needs of our clients. And so when we think of the assets we have that utilize Goals Powered solutions, it\u2019s quite frankly bigger than the sum of almost all the large robo-advisors you would think of. It's much larger than those in total. We just haven\u2019t necessarily marketed it externally as a robo-advisor or a fin-tech solution. It very much is a high tech rolled-out solution in our wealth space, and has been very widely praised by advisors and widely praised by our clients in terms of its applicability to both, what I\u2019d say current generation and future generations that use it. So, it\u2019s a powerful and important tool. Operator : And we have no further questions. That does conclude our conference for today. We thank you for your participation. Biff Bowman : Thank you all. Thanks Alicia.",

Let me turn the call over to Biff Bowman. S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.: Good morning, everyone. Let me join Mark in welcoming you to Northern Trust first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Starting on page 2 of our quarterly earnings review presentation this morning, we reported first quarter net income of $276 million. Earnings per share were $1.09 and our return on common equity was 11.6%. As discussed on our third quarter call, this quarter includes the impact of the first dividend associated with last year's preferred stock issuance. This initial dividend payment of $14.9 million covers eight months. Going forward, these fixed rate dividends are expected to be paid every other quarter in the amount of $11.5 million, with the next payment scheduled for the third quarter of this year. This is in addition to the quarterly dividend of $5.9 million from our previously issued preferred stock. Our assets under custody and administration, assets under custody and assets under management increased 13%, 14% and 11%, respectively, compared to the prior year, reflecting favorable markets and our continued success in winning new business. A number environmental factors impact our businesses as well as our clients. Before going through our results in detail, let me review how some of these factors unfolded during the first quarter. Equity markets performed well during the quarter. In U.S. markets, the S&P 500 ended the quarter up 14.7% year-over-year and up 5.5% sequentially. In international markets, the MSCI EAFE Index was up 14.7% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. Recall that some of our fees are based on lagged market values and fourth quarter markets were also up compared to the prior year as well as sequentially. In bond markets, the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index was down 2.7% compared to the last year and flat sequentially. Currency volatility as measured by the G7 Index was 4.7% lower than the first quarter of last year and 1.4% lower sequentially. Foreign exchange market volumes were also lower during the first quarter. As measured by two of the interbank brokers, volumes were down 10% to 20% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially. You'll recall that currency volatility and client activity influence our foreign exchange trading income. Currency rates influence the translation of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar and therefore impact client assets and certain revenues and expenses. Dollar strength compared to one year ago tempered custody asset growth and related fee growth, while benefiting expense growth. The British pound and the euro ended the quarter 13% and 6% lower than one year ago, respectively. On a sequential basis as compared to the U.S. dollar, the British pound and euro both strengthened by 1%. U.S. short-term interest rates were higher during the quarter, most evident in the three-month LIBOR, which averaged 107 basis points during the quarter compared to 92 basis points in the prior quarter and 62 basis points one year ago. Let's move to page 3 and review the financial highlights of the first quarter. Year-over-year, revenue increased 8% with non-interest income up 6% and net interest income up 15%. Expenses increased 8% producing two-tenths of a percent points of positive operating leverage. The provision for credits losses was a credit of $1 million. Net income was 13% higher year-over-year. In the sequential comparison, revenue was up 4% with non-interest income up 2% and net interest income up 10%. Expenses were up 2% compared to the prior quarter. Net income was 4% higher sequentially. Return on average common equity was at 11.6% for the quarter, equal to what we reported one year ago and down from the 11.9% reported in the prior quarter. Assets under custody/administration of $8.9 trillion increased 13% compared to one year ago and 4% on a sequential basis. Assets under custody of $7.1 trillion increased 14% compared to one year ago and 6% on a sequential basis. In the year-over-year comparison, solid new business and favorable market impacts were partially offset by the currency translation impact of a stronger dollar. For the sequential comparison, the growth was primarily driven by new business and favorable markets, but also had a slight benefit from the currency exchange rates. Assets under management were $1 trillion, up 11% year-over-year and up 6% on a sequential basis. Favorable market impacts were the primary driver of both the year-over-year and sequential comparisons. Let's look at the results in greater detail, starting with the revenue on page 4. First quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $1.3 billion, up 8% from last year and up 4% sequentially. Trust, investment and other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue and were $808 million in the first quarter, up 8% year-over-year and up 2% from the prior quarter. Fee waivers were essentially zero in the first quarter compared to $7.7 million one year ago. Foreign exchange trading income was $48 million in the first quarter, down 21% year-over-year and down 17% sequentially. Both comparisons were impacted by lower currency volatility as well as lower volumes. Other non-interest income was $75 million in the first quarter, up 1% from last year and up 15% sequentially. Other operating income in the prior quarter included charges of $8.1 million related to the decision to exit a portion of a non-strategic loan and lease portfolio. The prior year's results included a benefit of $2.3 million related to this portfolio. Excluding these items, this line item was up 5% from last year and 3% sequentially. Net interest income, which I will discuss in more detail later, was $362 million in the first quarter, increasing 15% year-over-year and 10% sequentially. Let's look at the components of our trust and investment fees on page 5. For our Corporate & Institutional Services business, fees totaled $463 million in the first quarter, up 7% year-over-year and 1% on a sequential basis. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees, were $308 million, up 7% compared to the prior year and up 1% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential comparisons benefited from new business and favorable equity markets, with the year-over-year growth partially offset by the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates. Assets under custody for C&IS clients were $6.5 trillion at quarter end, up 15% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. These results primarily reflect new business and favorable markets. Currency exchange rates muted the year-over-year growth, while adding a slight benefit on a sequential basis. Recall that lagged market values factor into the quarter's fees, with both quarter-lag and month-lag markets impacting our C&IS custody and fund administration fees. Investment management fees in C&IS of $94 million in the first quarter were up 5% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was driven by favorable markets, lower money market mutual fund fee waivers and new business. Money market fee waivers one year ago within C&IS totaled $1.7 million, while the current year was essentially zero. For the sequential comparison, recall that almost two-thirds of our investment management fees in C&IS are build on a one-quarter lag and C&IS AUM was down 1% sequentially in the fourth quarter. Assets under management for C&IS clients were $741 billion, up 11% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Favorable market impacts were the primary driver of both the year-over-year and sequential comparisons. Securities lending fees were $24 million in the first quarter, 5% higher than one year ago and down 6% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was driven by higher volumes, partially offset by lower spreads. The sequential decline was driven by lower spreads, partially offset by higher volumes. Securities lending collateral was $124 billion at quarter end and averaged $123 billion across the quarter. Average collateral levels increased 7% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. The growth in volumes was driven in part by increased demand for U.S. Treasuries. Other fees in C&IS were $38 million in the first quarter, up 8% for year-over-year, reflecting higher fees from investment risk and analytical services, benefit payments and other ancillary services. In the sequential comparison, other fees were up 11%, primarily reflecting the normal seasonal pattern in our benefit payment business. Moving to our Wealth Management business, trust, investment and other servicing fees were $345 million in the first quarter, up 10% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Within Wealth Management, the Global Family Office business had strong performance with fees increasing 17% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was driven by new business as well as lower money market mutual fund fee waivers, while the sequential growth was primarily related to new business. Performance within the regions also benefited from lower money market fee waivers compared to last year as well as favorable markets and new business. Money market mutual fund fee waivers in Wealth Management were essentially zero in the current quarter, which was equal to the prior quarter and down $6 million year-over-year. Assets under management for Wealth Management clients were $260 billion at quarter end, up 13% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. Moving to page 6, net interest income was $362 million in the first quarter, up 15% year-over-year. Earning assets averaged $109 billion in the first quarter, up 4% versus last year, driven primarily by a higher level of deposits. Non-U.S. office interest-bearing deposits, which averaged $52 billion and were up 6% year-over-year. Loan balances averaged $34 billion in the first quarter and were down 1% compared to one year ago. The net interest margin was 1.35% in the first quarter and was up 14 basis points from a year ago. The improvement in the net interest margin compared to the prior year primarily reflects a higher yield on earning assets due to the higher short-term interest rates. On a sequential quarter basis net interest income was up 10%, as the net interest margin increased 15 basis points sequentially, driven by lower premium amortization and higher short-term interest rates. Premium amortization was $1 million in the first quarter compared to $6 million one year ago and $10 million in the fourth quarter. Turning to page 7, expenses were $894 million in the first quarter, up 8% year-over-year and up 2% sequentially. Compensation expense of $426 million increased 12% year-over-year and increased 9% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was attributable to higher performance-based compensation, base pay adjustments, which were effective October 1 of last year, and staff growth, partially offset by favorable translation impact of changes in currency rates. The sequential growth was attributable to higher performance-based compensation and staff growth. Staff levels increased approximately 6% year-over-year. The growth in staff was all attributable to lower cost locations, which include India, Manila, Limerick and Tempe, Arizona. The higher level of performance-based compensation was driven by long-term equity-based compensation increasing $30 million compared to one year ago and $36 million compared to the prior period. Both comparisons are primarily attributable to a change in the vesting provisions associated with retirement-eligible employees, which allows their restricted and performance stock units to continue to vest upon retirement. This change impacted restricted and performance stock units related expense beginning with the 2017 grants. The change requires the immediate expensing of restricted stock unit grants to retirement-eligible employees. Performance stock unit expense attributable to retirement-eligible employees is recognized from the date of the grant through the end of a requisite service period, which ends on June 30, 2017. Stock option-based compensation expense already included a continue-to-vest provision, which results in the immediate expense recognition of stock option grants made to retirement-eligible employees. The current quarter's results included $30 million in retirement-eligible related expensing compared to $5 million one year ago. The performance stock unit expense attributable to 2017 grants to retirement-eligible employees will approximate $8 million in the second quarter. Another way to look at this change in the equity-based compensation I have outlined for you can be summed up in this way. Approximately 50% of the expense associated with this year's grants will have been recognized by the end of the second quarter, leaving the remaining 50% to be expensed over the normal three- to four-year vesting periods. Under the prior plan provisions, we estimate that approximately 15% to 20% would have been expensed by the end of the second quarter, with the remaining 80% to 85% being expensed across the three- to four-year vesting period. Therefore, this change is largely an expense timing issue. Staying with the compensation category, you will recall that last year we deferred the salary-based pay increases to October 1. For the current year, we have returned to our traditional date of April 1, and this will result in approximately $8 million of additional compensation expense in our run rate for the second quarter. Employee benefit expense of $78 million was up 10% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher medical costs and payroll taxes. On a sequential quarter basis, benefit expense was up 1%. Recall that the prior quarter's results included a $4 million impact relating to non-U.S. pension settlements. Excluding this item, benefit expense increased sequentially driven by higher payroll tax, partially offset by lower medical costs. Outside service expense of $153 million was up 2% compared to the prior year, driven primarily by higher market data costs within technical services and higher sub-custody costs, partially offset by lower consulting spend. On a sequential basis, outside service expense was down 5%, primarily driven by lower consulting and legal expense. Equipment and software expense of $127 million was up 11% from one year ago and up 5% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential growth were driven by increased software amortization as well as software support and rental costs, continuing the implementation of our technology strategy as we invest to support clients and improve employee efficiency. Occupancy expense of $45 million was up 11% from one year ago and down 3% sequentially. The growth from last year was mainly relating to a credit in last year's results relating to a lease adjustment in Europe. The sequential decline related to an early termination penalty recorded during the prior quarter. Other operating expense of $65 million declined 13% year-over-year, primarily related to lower business promotion and advertising expense, partially offset by higher FDIC insurance costs. Regarding the decline in business promotion and advertising, recall that we announced during 2016, we would become the title sponsor of the lead FedEx playoff event during the third quarter. The event to be named to Northern Trust will be held in New York area in August. We had expense associated with the Northern Trust Open in our first quarter expenses for the past several years, thus the reason for the year-over-year decline. Moving ahead, that expense will now be carried in the third quarter, when the new tournament will be held. Sequentially, other operating expenses declined 16%, primarily relating to lower business promotion and advertising as well as lower staff-related expenses. Turning to page 8, a key focus has been on sustainably enhancing profitability and returns. This slide reflects the progress we have made in recent years to improve the expense to fees ratio, pre-tax margin, and ultimately, our return on equity. The ratio of expenses to trust and investment fees is a particularly important measure of our progress as it addresses what we can most directly control. Reducing this measure from where it was previously as high as 131% in 2011 to the levels we see today is a key contributor to the improvement in our return on equity. This metric remains an important barometer of our progress and we remain committed to lowering it on a sustainable basis going forward through continuing to win new business to drive fee growth and driving productivity within our expense base through our ongoing initiatives focused on location strategy, procurement and technology. Turning to page 9, our capital ratios remain strong, with common equity Tier 1 ratios of 12.9% and 12.2%, respectively, calculated on a transition basis for both advanced and standardized. On a fully phased-in basis, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the advanced approach would be approximately 12.8% and under the standardized approach would be approximately 12.1%. All of these ratios are well above the fully phased-in requirement of 7%, which includes the capital conservation buffer. The supplementary leverage ratio at the corporation was 6.9% and at the bank was 6.1%, both of which exceed the 3% requirement, which will be applicable to Northern Trust in 2018. With respect to the liquidity coverage ratio, Northern Trust is above the 100% minimum requirement that became effective on January 1, 2017. As Northern Trust progresses through fully phased-in Basel III implementation, there could be additional enhancements to our models and further guidance from the regulators on the implementation of the final rule, which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final Basel III rules. In the first quarter, we repurchased 812,000 shares of common stock at a cost of $70 million. On April 5, we submitted our 2017 capital plan to the Federal Reserve. In closing, despite remaining geopolitical uncertainty across the globe, the first quarter of 2017 was characterized by strong global equity markets, rising rates in the U.S., and low currency volatility as measured by the VIX and other measures, such as the JPMorgan G7 Currency Volatility Index. Northern Trust delivered solid financial results in the quarter, growing earnings per share 6% and delivering a return on equity of 11.6%. This was accomplished while implementing a change in vesting with \u2013 for our restricted and performance share units that require the accelerated or immediate expensing for grants to retirement-eligible employees. We generated both positive fee and total operating leverage in our commitment to improve the profitability of our firm and continue to maintain strong capital ratios. Our assets under custody and administration, assets under custody, and assets under management were up 13%, 14%, and 11%, respectively, compared to the prior year. Our Wealth Management business grew trust fees 10% year-over-year, driven by solid new business coupled with favorable markets. This was done while maintaining a very attractive pre-tax margin of 37%. The success in the business was well diversified across our regions and our Global Family Office, which continues to demonstrate double-digit growth. Our C&IS business also continued its strong growth trajectory. Trust fees were 7% year-over-year, largely driven by organic factors as markets and currency impact essentially offset each other. The quarter also included the announcement of our definitive agreement to acquire the Fund Service Units of UBS in Luxembourg and Switzerland. This acquisition will significantly enhance our client capabilities in these two very important Global Fund marketplaces. On the regulatory front, there are two areas to highlight for you. First, as a result of changes to capital plan rules announced on January 30, 2017, we became a large and non-complex firm subject to SR 15-19 rather than a large and complex firm subject to SR 15-18, effective with the 2017 capital plan cycle. With this change, our capital plan submissions are no longer subject to objection by the Federal Reserve Board on qualitative grounds in the CCAR process. In lieu of the qualitative assessment, we will be subject to a targeted horizontal review of specific areas of capital planning conducted as a part of the Federal Reserve Board's normal supervisory process. Second, as noted in the Federal Reserve and FDIC joint press release, the agencies did not find the resolution plan submitted by Northern Trust at the end of 2015 to be not credible or that it would not facilitate an orderly trend resolution. Although the agency did not identify any deficiencies, there were three shortcomings noted. We are working diligently to address the shortcomings in connection with our 2017 resolution plan submission, which is due by December 31, 2017. We remain committed to advancing our resolution planning capabilities. Before I conclude, as is customary for our first quarter earnings call, we will need to end today's call to allow sufficient time for all of us to get to our annual meeting, which begins at 10 :30 Central Time this morning. Please accept our apologies in the event that we have to close off the question-and-answer period earlier than our normal practice. Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust first quarter earnings conference call today. Mark and I would be happy to answer your questions. Don, please open the line. Operator : Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.: Hi, Alex. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, guys. Good morning. So just first question around NIR, obviously very strong growth in the quarter and I was hoping to get a little more clarity around the jumping off point as we're thinking about 2Q. So, given the kind of relief on premium am, is 1.35% NIM still a good kind of run rate to think about and obviously whatever happens with the rates will be on top of that? Or was there any sort of catch-up that we need to think about that helped the NIM this quarter? S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.: Yeah. In the quarter, if we look at the NIM expansion sequentially, first, let me give some color to that, the NIM expansion was roughly driven up by about 10 or 11 basis points of what I would say were market factors, and 3 [basis points] was sort of a premium amortization benefit in the quarter. So, it was largely driven by rates. In terms of \u2013 I know you're asking jumping off point to go forward. There's a couple of factors that I think that are important to consider in that. One is, whatever view you have on future rate increases, but the second is around deposit betas. And if I look at our deposit betas and if you look at our cost of funding, you can see that, generally, the betas remained low in the first quarter on our wealth deposits or our retail-based deposits that was very low betas. And on the institutional side, we have seen those betas move up to some degree, but they still remain relatively low. How those move with subsequent hikes will impact the NIM's ability going forward. And then lastly, I would say, is the duration of our portfolio remained short. So the ability to reprice assets with any ramp in LIBOR will benefit us relatively quickly as those assets roll off and reprice into new assets. Mark Bette - Northern Trust Corporation : And then I'll just add to that. The premium amortization, we do usually see the fourth quarter and the first quarter as being more favorable than the second and the third quarter from a housing market activity standpoint. So, based on history, we have seen that track higher in the second quarter versus the first quarter. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. That's helpful. And then just around the size of the balance sheet, down a little bit sequentially, not terribly. And I was just wondering whether or not it's some sort of a seasonal dynamic. I think we saw something like that in the first quarter last year as well. Or is this just a reflection of higher interest rates and there's a little bit more kind of rate chasing? S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.: As you rightly pointed out, it's largely flat sequentially. There was some rundown, very modest rundown in non-interest bearing deposits in the U.S. that was partially offset by growth in some foreign office time deposit growth that we've seen. But in general, if you look at our non-interest bearing deposits in particular, they've held around the $25.5 billion to $26 billion range fairly consistently. How that reacts to ever increasing rates will be important to watch and it is possible that some of that could start to move into interest bearing. I would say, generally, the flattish balance sheet that we've seen reflects growth particularly in Europe where we've seen actually the foreign office time balance grow, I think, about 6% year-over-year. Operator : We will go next to Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.: Hi, Glenn. Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI : Hi. Thanks very much. Hello. You mentioned all the good double-digit growth across the board. In such an environment, do you think the expense to trust fee ratio would be better? How much of it do you think was impacted by some of this quarter's extracurricular expenses related to comp and all that? And do you have a pro forma number on what it would have been? S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.: Yeah. So, the first item I think that's important to think about in there is the compensation item that we walked you through into the script. That is just a change in vesting and an acceleration, if you will, of the expense into the first quarter. If you were to back that out, our expense growth rate which would have also been offset by the Northern Trust Open not being in this quarter. If you net those two out, the expense to fee ratio probably would have come down to around the 1.08, 1.09 levels, there's other moving parts in there, so it was better. I would like to think that the growth rate, excluding the two items I mentioned, would have been about 6.3% expense growth rate versus the 8% as reported, which would have produced 1.75 points of operating leverage in the quarter. And that's probably a better way to think about that. There are other puts and takes in the quarter, but I think if you think about 1.75 to 2 points of operating leverage is probably a better way to think about what was truly in the quarter. Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI : Perfect. Exactly what I'm looking for. And then just a follow-up question to the NIM discussion. Why \u2013 I get the lower deposit betas on the retail Wealth Management side? Why do you think institutional betas are low now and should we expect to have a significant ramp on future hikes, I mean, don't clients want that? S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.: Yeah. I won't speculate on why they haven't moved at this point. That's a behavior of our clients that we've seen. In the case for, I think, the custody banks in general, there's still meaningful portions of that that are operational in nature and I think viewed as such by our clients. And so I think they have a certain level of stickiness to them. Those that are probably truly excess, I think we do feel that as rates continue to move up, we will see that concern, if you will, around rate advancement moving forward. So I mean, they'll be interested in those rates on excess deposits. I don't know where that trigger point is. We're already experiencing clients who are seeing this now as we get closer to the 1% environment really make decisions between balance sheet and off balance sheet opportunities for what I will deem to be their excess cash. But meaningful portions of that, for us, really are operationally driven. Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI : I understand. Thank you very much. Operator : We'll take our next question from Brennan Hawken with UBS. S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.: Hi, Brennan. Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Hey. How are you doing? Biff, just wanted to walk through a little bit of this comp color that you gave on the script, which is definitely appreciated. So it seems like what you're saying is, most of what happened here was the 2017 grants, right, and so you're changing \u2013 you're accelerating the expense. Half of the expense is going to be done for 2017 here versus previous 15% to 20%. So does that mean that we take about 30% of that $30 million dollar uplift? So really, if we think about how much this might impact next year, we still have the same uplift, because you'll be still expensing. You will just have a lesser amortization from 2017. And so net, instead of going up $30 million next year, it'd be more like $9 million higher? Is that right or am I missing something? S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.: So your thinking is right. The way you described it is absolutely right. We pulled forward the expensing to be about 50% this year. Assuming we do another grant in 2018 under the same terms, which is something we will decide at that point in time, but assuming we do, you will have the acceleration of the grants in 2018, plus some residual from grants in 2015 in previous years in there. So you're right to assume, this year would have the highest percentage. It will be on a declining basis in each of those years, but it will still be \u2013 there will be some seasonal expense associated with this change in vesting. What I want to be clear on the call is, this change in vesting fundamentally isn't changing the overall expense amount associated with LTI other than in the past for retirement-eligible employees if they left, they could have had some forfeitures. That was a relatively small number relative to the size of the overall grant. So the total isn't different. It's just that it's going to be seasonal and accelerated into the first quarter over the next four years, while we have a four-year vesting on our restricted stock. And the reason we did this, Brennan, just so everyone understands is it was for competitive positioning with our employees. We were in a minority of large financial institutions that did not continue to vest equity upon retirement. We do not continue to vest upon leaving for other reasons, but we do upon retirement now. Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks for walking through that. I think I get it at this point. So the next question that I would have would be on the AUC and AUM front. You said that on a sequential quarter basis, FX was a small uplift, so that's I think nice to see that switch to a tailwind, but \u2013 and that new business was positive, too. Is it possible to give us some specificity around how much came from FX on a sequential quarter basis, how much came from FX tailwind versus new business? Just so we can understand some of those components? Mark Bette - Northern Trust Corporation : On a sequential basis, Brennan? Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Please. Mark Bette - Northern Trust Corporation : So the currency impact would have been less than 1% on a sequential basis for the AUC. And really the market and the client flows were the main driver, a little bit more on the market than the client flows, but not by a whole lot. S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.: And, Brennan, on a year-over-year basis, of the 8% growth in fees, a little more than half was organic if we look at it that way, so if we strip out all of the things. So very healthy organic growth rates in AUC on a year-over-year. Operator : We'll go to Brian Bedell for our next question with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much. S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.: Hey, Brian. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Maybe just \u2013 one more on the balance sheet, if you can talk a little bit about the loan repricing dynamic. You actually had a very good quarter there. Should we \u2013 in terms of how those loans are repriced and moving through core, should we expect a similar type of repricing dynamic in the second quarter based on the March hike? And then if you can just comment on your view on deposit beta within the Wealth Management unit, if you think that will be a little more elastic? S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.: Let me take the second part of your question first, which is around the deposit betas. I would highlight for you that we are very much a follower in our liability pricing on that front. Our clients in the Wealth side generally \u2013 excuse me, our competition in that isn't always traditional regional banks, for instance, for our Wealth Management clients. So our ability to sort of lag the market a little bit as we think about our deposit beta pricing there has historically held true. That being said, we do need to remain competitive. Our clients have choices and they're savvy investors, so they look at that. But the reality is that we're not funding an asset book, a loan book, as aggressively as some of the regional banks need to fund their balance sheet. So, we're very much aware of the markets, but not generally leading in terms of deposit beta there. So if the market continues to have relatively low betas, I believe that we will follow suit. I don't \u2013 what we do have interestingly from our Wealth clients is, the opportunity to think about moving their assets from balance sheet to our funds. And as you know, we have a large cash fund complex, so we have the ability to capture those assets as they move between balance sheet and off-balance sheet opportunities. Do you want to talk about the loan side? Sure. Mark Bette - Northern Trust Corporation : Yeah. On the loan side, Brian, about 75% of our loan balances reprice within one year and much of that would be linked to one month LIBOR. The one thing I would say about the \u2013 when you look at the sequential growth and the loan yield, we saw about a 22 basis points sequential increase. There was a small amount of that that was relating to client overdraft that get recorded within loan balances. When we look at the core loan yield, we saw about an 18 basis points sequential increase when you strip out the impact from the overdrafts. So, hopefully that helps. But the loans do generally reprice 75% within one year. And like I said, the best measure to look at it would probably be one month LIBOR there. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And so in that repricing dynamic then, looking back, I guess, you had more leverage to essentially the December 2015 Fed hike within that one year pricing dynamic in the first quarter than the recent December hike? S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.: Yeah. So, we did \u2013 we have a bit more leverage to the first hike, yes. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. And then just lastly on expenses, on the expense to trust fee ratio, how should we think about? If we do get several more hikes over the next year and you generate, obviously, a lot more NIR, how should we think about your management of that expense to trust fee ratio, because obviously you'd have a much bigger denominator on the NIR side that would allow you theoretically to invest more in the business? Should we think of that as sort of stabilizing or even increasing the expense to trust fee ratio if that happen? S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.: No. So we remain focused on improving that expense to fee ratio in periods of time when we get strong net interest income revenue or if we're constrained by the interest rate environment. In fact, I would state that in periods of time when we get the net interest income benefit that we're seeing now, we still need to remain vigilant on the controllable expenses and the fee growth, and continue to create fee leverage. What is partially true is if we've got strong net interest income revenue flowing through, that may allow us to invest some of that in our businesses, but we're still committed to improving that expense to fee ratio regardless of the benefits that we see coming through the net interest line on a regular basis. If the net interest income were to constrict in some ways, then it's even more important to drive more leverage through the expense to fees in that environment. But by any measure, we're going to continue to try to improve that expense to fee ratio even with market rate tailwinds. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. That's great color. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.: Hi. Ken. Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Hi, thanks. Hey, Biff, how are you doing? Just one more level set on the expense side then. So, just understanding the starting point and the incremental vesting, can you just help us understand the natural new first to second quarter seasonality and the netting of what comes down versus what goes up in terms of the high point versus starting to get the merit in, in the second quarter? I've assumed that's a net down, but can you help us understand the type of magnitude of what comes out of that comp and benefit side? S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.: Sure. So, in the first quarter, you would have seen traditionally somewhere with the new \u2013 with the new vesting, you will see approximately 35% to 40% vesting of our LTI in Q1 with another, let's call it, 12% to 15% in Q2. That gets us somewhere to that 50% we would say we'd see in the first two quarters. That will then start to ramp down in Qs three and four in terms of an overall vesting. So, Ken, if in the past we had $100 million worth of LTI, if you look at the previous year in our SEC filings of LTI, we would have historically expensed 25%, 25%, 25%, 25% over four years. Now, you will see roughly $50 million in the first two quarters and then $50 million delivered over the next three \u2013 50% or $50 million of $100 million over the next remaining quarters over four years. So that dynamic will take place so that the rate of expensing will go down meaningfully then over the third quarter of 2017 through the end of the vesting life of the equity grant. In terms of the salary in the second quarter, as we said in the script, that our merit raise will take effect April 1, that will be an $8 million increase, but you will see the compensation associated with LTI come down meaningfully in the second quarter versus the $30 million that we quoted earlier on the call. Mark Bette - Northern Trust Corporation : And, Ken, so we had $30 million in retirement-eligible expense in the first quarter. And we did mention in the script because of the performance shares, they are expensed over the service period for retirement eligible. So not all of the performance share expense retirement-eligible hit in the first quarter, and we did mention that there would be $8 million of that that would hit the second quarter. So, you have $30 million of retirement-eligible expense this quarter, $8 million in the second quarter and that in addition to that color, we mentioned the $8 million for the base pay adjustments will be a sequential increase as well. Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Yeah. And then also, do we have typically lower payroll, just payroll in the second as well? Not merits, but just FICA and whatnot. Mark Bette - Northern Trust Corporation : Right, yeah, usually ... S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.: Yeah, it starts to run down. Mark Bette - Northern Trust Corporation : Right. S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.: Yes. It does start to run down during the course of the year. Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Okay. So that's still a net decline, and then it declines in the second half and then we see how big next year's grant is. But if we presume the grants are about the same size, then this is more just about timing and reallocation across more into the first half than the second? S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.: Yes. Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And then \u2013 so just for the follow-up, it looks so \u2013 in a really good revenue quarter, and you exited out in response to Glenn's question, 6% year-over-year just absolute expense growth with some help from FX translation is still a sizeable expense growth number. I know you're still adding staff, I know you had the resolution plan stuff. But can you just talk about just that from an absolute growth perspective still being a pretty high rate of growth? And is there anything underneath the surface that we can see on the \u2013 looking forward to show that we're either getting towards a peak or eclipse of some of that spend? S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.: Yeah. So let me walk through a couple of line items I think to help explain that what I'd call core expense growth rate. One of the meaningful lines that you see is the depreciation and amortization or the equipment software line was up 11% year-over-year. Some of that was a reflection of the capital investments that we've made to try to create some of the efficiencies that we help drive that run rate down that you described. And we've always said that that is the one of the line items that would outgrow our fees while we utilize that capital spend. We saw that come through in this quarter and particularly it ramped up. Part of that was driven by \u2013 we've had some substantial capital projects that we effectively turned on for depreciation reasons. They were sitting in work in process and we turned on those in the fourth quarter \u2013 early first quarter work in process that was turned on. So that increased the depreciation rate. That's one of those. We don't anticipate is that you would see that kind of sequential ramp going forward in that line item. So in equipment software, if you look at our location expense, if you will, or a rent expense, that had noise in it. We had a $3 million, $3.5 million decline year-over-year. And so while it looks like a double-digit increase, really it's getting closer to our run rate. And that's up about $1 million really if you strip out the year-over-year comparator. So, we continue to try to drive on those expenses. We do need some expense growth to fuel 8% fee growth. So it's a story of trying to create the maximum amount of leverage that we can, Ken, but there is a certain amount of expense growth to fuel 8% growth in our top line as we did this quarter. And so we're trying to maximize that delta or that operating leverage versus fees and continue to try to drive net expense to fee ratio down further. Mark Bette - Northern Trust Corporation : And, Ken, you had commented on the current fee favorability on expenses and that was just under 1.5 points, but on the flipside, the trust fee growth was about 1.5 points less than what it would have been because of currency, so a drag on both side. Revenue was down a little bit more than a percentage because of that. So, the currency kind of net out, but adjusting for those, we would have had higher expense, but we also would have the higher fee growth and the higher revenue growth. Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Thanks a lot. Understood. Mark Bette - Northern Trust Corporation : Okay. Operator : We will go now to Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.: Hey. Good morning, Jim. James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Hey. I'm just scratching my head a little bit on foreign deposit rates, why they went up about from 11 basis points to 17 bps. Is that sort of hedging activity? Why would foreign deposit rates be increased \u2013 rates paid be increasing? Mark Bette - Northern Trust Corporation : So, this is Mark, within the non-U.S. dollar deposits \u2013 I'm sorry, the non-U.S. office deposits, there is a significant amount of those. In fact, most of those are U.S. dollar-based. So even though they're non-U.S. office deposits, and there is a mix of about \u2013 two-thirds of it, I believe, is the mix that's U.S. dollar. So, we did see higher rates in the U.S. So that's part of function of the deposit beta, but there is a mix there where the other non-U.S. currencies would not have seen the movements that U.S. did. James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Right. Okay. That makes sense. S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.: Correct. James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: And just maybe on just the deposit behavior, understanding uncertainty, but what have you seen over the last month since the March rate hike? Have you seen betas or flows change dramatically since the March hike? S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.: We have not seen them since the March hike, the behaviors meaningfully change. James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. All right. Thank you very much. Operator : We will take our next question from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.: Hi, Marty. Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP : Hey. Biff, I wanted to ask you about capital a little bit. You're going into the CCAR now. Last year, you were looking at the growth as a reason to deploy less capital, because you were really still wanting to kind of have that flexibility, especially with the balance sheet growth you were seeing last year. As we've now kind of moved forward here, things have stabilized a little bit more. Do you feel like you could go back to what you were kind of deploying earlier in a sense of how much earnings you give back each year? S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.: So I would say that we're entering \u2013 or we entered the capital planning cycle from a position of strength. So as you rightly point out, our risk-weighted asset growth has slowed meaningfully. And that's a result of discipline inside the firm and looking at quite frankly loan-by-loan what the return on equity is for use of the balance sheet, particularly when we think about credit. And what that's created is that those uses of balance sheet capital aren't returning the types of returns we talked to you about, the 10% to 15%, that we're judicious with the use of that capital. That then leaves us with decisions to make about how we then utilize that capital and maximize for our shareholders, and that's either internal usage. You saw us with the acquisition that we entered into an agreement with UBS. There's inorganic uses that we could do. And then there's obviously the return of that capital through the dividends and share buybacks that we would have asked for in our capital plan. And I would just say that we certainly entered that cycle from a position of strength. As we said on previous calls, last year's total payout ratio as calculated by the Street was not a new trend. It was just simply meant to be what our 2016 ask was. And our 2017 ask will be appropriate for where we see our capital needs going forward. So I think that's all the color I can give on that right now, but based on our CET1 ratio, we're in a position of very strong capital. Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP : Good answer to a sensitive question. Now, I got an even more sensitive question to ask you. It's been a subject that we've talked about a lot, which is eventually when we get to some normalization of rates. We're not there yet. But restructuring the balance sheet to protect against what Northern Trust experienced in the last downturn. Are you still thinking about at least rebalancing down the road as we think that rates are kind of getting to a point where there's as much chance that they go down as up? So just wanted to see if you were still thinking in that direction. S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.: Well, we meet every month and consider from our ALCO committee the directions and the nature of the balance sheet and the structure of the balance sheet, and have active dialogues with input from our Chief Investment Officer, our Chief Economic Research, Carl Tannenbaum and others. And we have a view on the construct of the balance sheet. That has generally been guided, as you know, and kind of observed, by a conservative shorter duration construct to the portfolio. We will weigh all the macro factors and come up with an asset allocation and an ALCO policy that we think does our best to generate returns for our shareholders, while protecting the strength of the balance sheet. And we've all worked here long enough to know that the strength of the balance sheet here is one of our most important items to protect. Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP : It is and conservative in the past was meant to avoid any mark-to-market adjustments. But when you have the strength in capital and the balance sheet you have, and we saw how much of the pain that came from short and \u2013 rates going down as far as they did, there is a little bit of riskiness left in that position that we had and Northern Trust had as they went into the last cycle. And maybe rethinking that as you go through the next cycle could be productive. So thanks. Operator : We'll take our last questions from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning. Hi. Two quick questions. One just \u2013 one more on expenses, and it just has to do with the outing in the third quarter that you moved. We talked a lot about getting the expenses right between 1Q and 2Q. Could you just remind us roughly what the dollar spend is incremental that we should make sure we have in our 3Q numbers for the golf outing? S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.: Yeah. So one way to look at that would be, if you look at the other operating expense in the quarter, it's a reasonable proxy for what it would cost, but I want to add a little bit of color here. The tournament in the third quarter is taking place in New York. It is a FedEx Cup event. It is the first round of the FedEx Cup event. And we can't, even for disclosure reasons, not only for ourselves but because of our contracts with the PGA Tour and others, give exact dollar amounts. But you might imagine that a tournament in New York that's a FedEx Cup event would come at a premium and the entertainment around it would come at a premium. So if you look at that variance and put whatever multiplier you are used to putting on for something in New York versus other parts of the world, I would probably go ahead and do that. Sorry, we can't give the exact numbers on the cost. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Mark Bette - Northern Trust Corporation : And in our 10-Q, you break out the other operating expense. You'll see the business promotion line is down about $11 million on a year-over-year basis. And we would say that very much the key driver on that was the Northern Trust Open. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Mark Bette - Northern Trust Corporation : So that gives you some idea. Not specifically, but some idea. S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.: Put whatever premium you think you should put on that for a tournament that is generally higher TV viewership in the New York marketplace. So we'll leave it at that. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Okay. Last question is on the Luxembourg acquisition you mentioned during the prepared remarks. I just wanted to understand how you plan to leverage that. I know that you went up quite significantly in ranking with the acquisition in Luxembourg, but I would expect that you could leverage that position into your existing customer set a little bit more. Maybe you can give us some color around that. S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.: Yeah. That's absolutely the strategic intent. We were subscale in Luxembourg, which is one of the two or three largest fund markets in the world. We'll be able to \u2013 for our large global clients who have fund complexes in the Lux marketplace, this will give us an opportunity to more holistically service their needs. We've been able to service a lot of these large asset managers in the UK or in Ireland. And now, we'll have the capability to service their Luxembourg funds as well. It also gives us access to the Swiss marketplace, which I believe will be one of the two, I think, the largest fund administrator in Switzerland when we move in there. So, we're really excited about the strategic fit and opportunities to leverage existing relationships where we really didn't have a scalable service in Luxembourg and now we will. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.: Thank you. Operator : That concludes today's question-and-answer session and brings to an end today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. S.

These items are outlined on Page 12 of today's presentation. In the current quarter, we recorded a charge of 22$.8 million related to severance and personnel related costs. As outlined in our earnings release, $19.5 million of that charge appears in the compensation line, $2.5 million in employee benefit expense, and $0.8 million in outside services expense. Excluding this charge, our expense in the second quarter totaled $915 million. Our actions taken this quarter reflect a continued focus on improving profitability and returns and we expect the charge to produce annual ongoing savings of approximately $18 million once fully implemented. In the prior year's results, you'll recall that there were several items that we reported to you last year. A pretax charge of $118.2 million and other operating income on the sale of $1.1 million Class B visa shares, a pretax loss of $21.6 million associated with our loan and lease portfolio, of the $21.6 million in losses, $18.9 million was reflected on the other operating income line with the remaining $2.7 million reflected within net interest income. A pretax charge of $46.5 million and other operating expense in connection with the settlement of certain securities lending related litigation. A pretax charge of $18.6 million and other operating expense relating to contractual modifications associated with existing C&IS asset servicing clients, and a pretax charge of $17.5 million related to severance and personnel related costs. Excluding these items, the prior-year quarter's revenue was $1.2 billion and expense was $842 million. Thank you again for joining us today. Let me turn the call over to Biff Bowman. Biff Bowman : Good morning, everyone. Let me join Mark in welcoming you to Northern Trust second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Starting on Page 2 of our quarterly earnings review presentation, this morning we reported second quarter net income of $268 million. Earnings per share were $1.12 and our return on common equity was 11.6%. Excluding the current quarter severance charge that Mark noted, net income was $283 million, earnings per share were $1.18 and our return on common equity was 12.2%. Our assets under custody and administration, assets under custody and assets under management increased 15%, 16% and 14% respectively compared to the prior year reflecting favorable markets and our continued success in winning new business. A number of environmental factors impact our businesses as well as our clients. Before going through our results in detail, let me review how some of those factors unfolded during the second quarter. Equity markets performed well during the quarter. In U.S. markets, the S&P 500 ended the quarter up 15.5% year-over-year and up 2.6% sequentially. In international markets, the MSCI EAFE Index was up 18.9% year-over-year and up 1.7% sequentially. Recall that some of our fees are based on lagged market values and first quarter markets were also up compared to the prior year, as well as sequentially. In bonds markets, the Barclays U.S. aggregate Index was down 3.4% compared to the last year and up 0.7% sequentially. Currency volatility as measured by the G7 Index was 28.3% lower compared to last year and 21% lower sequentially. Foreign exchange market volumes were also lower during the quarter. As measured by two of the interbank brokers, volumes were down 6% to 14% year-over-year and down 2% to 8% sequentially. You'll recall that currency volatility and client activity influence our foreign exchange trading income. Currency rates influence the translation of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar and therefore impact client assets and certain revenues and expenses. The British pound ended the quarter down 3% compared to last year while the euro ended the quarter 3% higher. On a sequential basis as compared to the U.S. dollar, the British pound and euro both strengthened by 4% and 6% respectively. U.S. short-term interest rates were higher during the quarter most evident in three-month LIBOR which averaged 121 basis points during the quarter compared to 107 basis points in the prior quarter and 64 basis points one year ago. Let's move to Page 3 and review the financial highlights of the second quarter. Year-over-year revenue was flat. Excluding the items Mark noted, revenue was up 8% compared to last year with noninterest income up 7% and net interest income up 13%. Expenses increased 1% from last year. Again adjusting for the items that Mark noted, expenses were up 9% from one year ago. The provision for credit losses was a credit of 7 million. Net income was 2% higher year-over-year. Excluding the previously called out items, net income was up 11% from the prior year. In the sequential comparison revenue was up 3% with noninterest income up 5% and net interest income down 3%. Expenses were up 5% compared to the prior quarter and net income was down 3%. Excluding the current quarter severance charge, both expense and net income were up 2% sequentially. Return on average common equity was at 11.6% for the quarter down from 12.3% one year ago and equal to the prior quarter. Excluding the current quarter severance charge return on average common equity was 12.2% up from last year's adjusted 11.9% and up from last quarter's 11.6%. Assets under custody and administration of 9.3 trillion increased 15% compared to one year ago and 4% on a sequential basis. Assets under custody of 7.4 trillion increased 60% compared to one year ago and 4% on a sequential basis. For both the year-over-year and sequential comparisons, strong new business and favorable market impacts were the driver. On a sequential basis, currency translation was [indiscernible]. Assets under management were $1 trillion up 14% year-over-year and up 3% on a sequential basis. Favorable market impacts were the primary driver of both the year-over-year and sequential comparisons. Let's look at results in greater detail starting with revenue on Page 4. Second quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $1.3 billion. Excluding last year's call out items that Mark highlighted, revenue was up 8% from last year and up 3% sequentially. Trust investment and other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue and were $848 million in the second quarter up 9% year-over-year and up 5% from the prior quarter. Foreign exchange trading income was $50 million in the second quarter down 22% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. Both comparisons were primarily impacted by lower currency volatility. Other noninterest income was $82 million in the second quarter. This was down 53% from one year ago. Excluding last year's net gains on the sale of Visa Class B shares, other noninterest income was up 8% from one year ago and up 10% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential performance were primarily driven by higher securities commissions and trading income, as well as net gain on hedging activities. Net interest income which I will discuss in more detail later was $350 million in the second quarter increasing 14% year-over-year but down 3% sequentially. Let's look at the components of our trust and investment fees on Page 5. For Corporate & Institutional Services business, fees totaled $487 million in the second quarter up 9% year-over-year and 5% on a sequential basis. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees were $327 million up 12% compared to the prior year and up 7% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential comparisons benefited from strong new business and favorable equity markets with the year-over-year growth partially offset by the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates. On a sequential basis currency exchange rates were benefit. Assets under custody for C&IS clients were $6.8 trillion at quarter end up 16% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. These results primarily reflect new business and favorable markets. Currency exchange rates were also a benefit on the sequential comparison. Recall that lagged market values factor into the quarter's fees with both quarter lag and month lag markets impacting our C&IS custody and fund administration fees. Investment management fees in C&IS of $99 million in the second quarter were up 5% year-over-year and up 6% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential comparisons were driven mainly by favorable markets. Assets under management for C&IS clients were $763 billion up 13% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Favorable market impacts were the primary driver of both year-over-year and sequential comparisons. Securities lending fees were $25 million in the second quarter, 8% lower than one year ago and up 3% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was driven by lower spreads partially offset by higher volumes. The sequential increase was driven by higher volumes but partially offset by lower spreads. Recall that during a rising rate environment spreads can at first narrow as the maturity profile investments results in a lag before the cash reinvestment yields adjusted the higher rate environment. Securities lending collateral was $131 billion at quarter end and averaged $133 billion across the quarter. Average collateral levels increased 14% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. The growth in collateral amounts and associated loan volumes compared to a year ago was driven by loans of U.S. and international fixed income securities. The sequential increase was driven by loans of both U.S. and international equities. Other fees in C&IS were $36 million in the second quarter up 10% year-over-year reflecting higher fees from investment risk and analytical services, benefit payments and other ancillary services. In the sequential comparison, other fees were down 6% primarily reflecting the normal seasonal pattern in our benefit payment business. Moving to our wealth management business, trust investment and other servicing fees were $361 million in the second quarter up 9% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. Within wealth management, the Global Family Office business had strong performance with fees increasing 17% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. Each of the regions also performed well during the quarter. Across Global Family Office in each of the regions both the year-over-year and sequential growth was driven by favorable markets and new business. Assets under management for wealth management clients were $266 billion at quarter end, up 14% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Moving to Page 6, net interest income was $350 million in the second quarter up 14% year-over-year. Earning assets averaged $110 billion in the second quarter up 3% versus last year driven primarily by higher level deposits. Non-U.S. office interest-bearing deposits which averaged $57 billion were up 12% year-over-year. Loan balances averaged $34 billion in the second quarter and were down 2% compared to one year ago. The net interest margin was 1.28% in the second quarter and was up 12 basis points from a year ago. The improvement in the net interest margin compared to the prior year primarily reflects a higher yield on earning assets due to higher short-term interest rates. On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income was down 3% as the net interest margin declined 7 basis points sequentially as the favorable impact from higher U.S. short-term rates was more than offset by higher premium amortization and a change in the currency mix of our balance sheet. During the quarter we saw U.S. dollar denominated deposits decline. These declines were more than offset by increases in non-U.S. dollar deposits mainly in British pounds and Euros. These non-U.S. dollar deposits are lower margin and U.S. dollar deposits given the low interest rate still persist in euro. Thus this currency mix shift adversely impacted the net interest margin. Premium amortization was $15 million in the second quarter compared to $20 million one year ago, and $1 million at first quarter. Turning to Page 7, expenses were $937 million in the second quarter and were 1% higher than the prior year and up 5% sequentially. Excluding the charges in both years, current quarter expenses of $950 million increased 9% year-over-year and were up 2% sequentially. Compensation expense was $433 million and increased 11% compared to last year and 2% sequentially. Excluding the severance-related charges in the current quarter and the prior year's results, compensation was up 10% year-over-year and declined 3% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was attributable to base pay adjustments, staff growth and higher performance-based compensation, partially offset by the favorable translation impact of changes in currency rates. Recall that for this quarter we had two sets of base pay adjustments in the year-over-year comparison as the 2016 increases were deferred until October 1 of last year, and the 2017 adjustments were effective April 1, of this year. Staff levels increased approximately 6% year-over-year with the growth all being attributable to lower cost locations which include India, Manila, Limerick, Ireland and Tempe. The higher level of performance-based compensation was driven by long-term equity-based compensation, as well as a higher level of accrued cash-based incentives. Equity-based compensation increased $8.5 million compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily attributable to a change in the vesting provisions associated with the retirement eligible employees which allows their restricted and performance stock units to continue to vest upon retirement. Recall that we discussed this change on last quarter's call and we highlighted that with this change approximately 50% of the expense associated with this year's grants wasn't been recognized by the end of the second quarter compared only 15% to 20% having been recognized under prior plan provisions. Therefore, this change is largely an expense timing issue. The sequential decline of 3% in compensation expense excluding severance charges was driven by a $27.6 million decline in equity-based compensation primarily relating to the timing of retirement eligible expense partially offset by base pay adjustments, higher short-term cash incentives and staff growth. Employee benefit expense excluding severance costs was $73 million and was up 3% year-over-year primarily reflecting higher payroll taxes and retirement costs partially offset by lower medical costs. On a sequential quarter basis, benefit expense was down 6% reflecting lower medical costs and a decline in payroll taxes. Outside services expense including severance related costs was $166 million and was up 5% compared to the prior-year driven primarily by higher market data costs within technical services, higher sub-custody costs and higher third party advisor fees partially offset by lower consulting spend. On a sequential basis, outside service expense was up 8% primarily driven by higher consulting, legal, sub-custody and market data costs. Equipment and software expense of $134 million was up 13% from one year ago and up 5% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential growth were driven by increased software amortization, as well as software support and rental costs continuing the implementation of our technology strategy as we invest to support clients and improve employee efficiency. Occupancy expense of $46 million was up 2% both on a year-over-year, as well as a sequential basis driven by higher rent and building operational costs. Other operating expense of $82 million increased 12% from last year after adjusting for last year special items. The year-over-year growth was primarily related to higher charges associated with account servicing activities, higher business promotion spend, as well as higher FDIC insurance costs. On a sequential basis, the category increased 27% driven by higher charges associated with account servicing activities, higher business promotion spend and an increase in staff relocation costs. Turning to Page 8, our key focus has been on sustainably enhancing profitability and returns. This slide reflects the progress we've made in recent years to improve the expense to fee ratio pretax margin and ultimately our return on equity. The ratio of expenses to trust and investment fees is a particularly important measure of our progress as it addresses what we can most directly control. Reducing this measure from where it was previously, as high as 131% in 2011 to the levels we see today is a key contributor to the improvement and our return on equity. Although this ratio has flattened in recent periods, we remain committed to driving a lower by continue to focus on what we can directly control. Winning new business to drive fee growth and driving efficiencies in our cost base. Our productivity efforts include further implementing our location strategy driving procurement efficiency and using technology to drive productivity. Turning to Page 9, our capital ratios remain strong with common equity Tier 1 ratios of 13.2% and 12.3% respectively calculated on a transition basis for both advanced and standardized. On a fully phased-in basis, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the advanced approach would be approximately 13.1% and under the standardized approach would be approximately 12.1%. All of these ratios are well above the fully phased-in requirement of 7% which includes the capital conservation buffer. The supplementary leverage ratio at the Corporation was 7% and at the bank was 6.2%, both of which exceed the 3% requirement which will be applicable to Northern Trust in 2018. With respect to the liquidity coverage ratio, Northern Trust is above 100% minimum requirement that became effective on January 1, 2017. As Northern Trust progresses through fully phased-in Basel III implementation, there could be additional enhancements to our models and further guidance from the regulators on the implementation of the final rule which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final Basel III rules. In the second quarter we repurchased 1.8 million shares of common stock at a cost of $158 million. The repurchases during the quarter did include our utilization of the diminimus exception as we finished the 2016 capital plan year. As we announced in June, our 2017 capital plan received no objection from the Federal Reserve. In it we requested authority to increase our quarterly common dividends to $0.42 per share. Yesterday our Board of Directors formally approved the plan dividend increase. The capital plan also provides the flexibility to repurchase up to $750 million common stock. The timing and amount shares repurchased will depend on various factors including but not limited to Northern Trust business plans, financial performance, other investment opportunities and general market conditions. In closing, the second quarter 2017 was characterized by favorable global equity markets, rising short-term interest rates in the U.S. and lower currency volatility. Northern Trust delivered solid financial results in the quarter growing earnings per share by 10% and delivering return on average common equity of 12.2% both on an adjusted basis. We achieved positive fee operating leverage both on a sequential and year-over-year basis when excluding the previously called out items in both periods. Our assets under custody administration, assets under custody and assets under management were up 15%, 16% and 14% respectively compared to the prior-year. During the quarter, we also returned to $252 million to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases while maintaining strong capital ratios and funding our growth. Our wealth management business grew revenue 10% year-over-year and continue to produce attractive margins achieving a 39% pretax margin. Our success in wealth management has been well diversified across our regions in our Global Family Office. Our C&IS business also continued strong growth trajectory with revenue growth of 12%. During the quarter we've been working diligently towards closing the previously announced acquisition of UBS Asset Management's fund administration servicing units in Luxembourg and Switzerland and we continue to expect the transaction to close before year-end. This transaction which remain subject to applicable regulatory and fund board approvals and other customary closing conditions will significantly enhance our client capabilities in these two very important global fund marketplaces. As we discussed on last quarter's call, we are looking forward to being the title sponsor of the lead FedEx playoff event next month. The event to be named the Northern Trust will be held in the New York area. Recall in past years we had expense associated with the Northern Trust Open in our first quarter expenses, while moving ahead the expense associated with our sponsored event will now be carried in the third quarter when the new tournament will be held. We are expecting the expense associated with the sponsorship, advertising, marketing and surrounding events to be approximately $0.05 per share in the quarter. Our sponsorship of this event is in line with our strategic focus on continuing to grow our business in the Northeast and in particular the Greater New York area. Finally, earlier this morning we announced that we will be establishing an EU banking presence in Luxembourg. We are implementing these plans to continue to meet client and business needs in a post Brexit environment and this combined with the pending acquisition underscores our continued focus of growing our business in Continental Europe. Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust second quarter earnings conference call today. Mark and I would be happy to answer your questions. Anthony, please open the line. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Biff, just I'll focus on the net interest margin and balance sheet side. Could you help us explain if you separate the sides of the balance sheets, how much of that mix shift effect from U.S. to non-U.S. was either temporary, permanent, something you control, something you can't control meaning, is this the new run rate or are there some certain things across the business it just happened that were out of your control? Biff Bowman : So let me break that into two parts because the first part of that was the growth in the foreign office deposits that you saw. I would characterize that growth that we saw which is $4 billion to $5 billion that we saw grow there, as largely business as usual. It reflected new business and it reflects our clients normal activities where they\u2019re transitioning in and out of portfolios, and in and out of different currencies. I would call that growth that we saw there, business as usual nothing structural. The $3 million that you see that left the balance sheet from the non-interest-bearing deposits in dollars, I would say has been driven by client reactions to a rising rate environment. So, in that non-interest bearing component we have clients who heretofore have bits remained in that bucket but as we've seen the rate rises, many had comments that I need to look at alternatives for my cash. Of the $3 billion that moved off, a $1 billion or so moved into our cash vaults so they chose an off-balance sheet solution. $1 billion or so we retained but have moved to an interest-bearing because they represent broader clients of the Northern and about $1 billion left in the balance sheet where that relationship with us was either very narrow or did not exist other than it just being a deposit. So that bucket of non-interest bearing deposits I think is a very important part of the story Ken. That $3 billion runoff it sits in a line item today that represents about 20% of the balance sheet which is non-interest bearing deposits. Pre crisis that represented about 12% of the balance sheet, it\u2019s been as high as 23% of the balance sheet. We're looking at how that part of the balance sheet will move in a rising rate environment. I can tell you that much of it is still core operating deposits but there is a portion that has been here temporarily particularly as we've grown our hedge fund servicing business and our GFS business our Global Fund Service business, they attract large asset-based clients. So we probably need to calibrate or the analysts need to calibrate between kind of where we're at 20 and historical 12 as to where do you think as a portion of the balance sheet. Those could go in a rising rate environment. Our current dialogues in many cases have led them to consider as I just pointed out our own off-balance sheet opportunities so this may move from a net interest income line to an investment fee line in that case. Ken Usdin : Okay. So that explains the right side of the balance sheet which makes a lot of sense. Can you now also just follow-up, I think the bigger surprise then that is the fact that a lot of the asset side line items on the average earning income statement actually had flat to down yield. So can you just give us kind of that same kind of understanding of why the assets of the asset side sensitivity did not show through on many if any lines at all aside from the expected premium amortization? Thanks. Biff Bowman : So first let me give - the $14 million of that was premium amortization and you can see that flowing largely if you\u2019re on our trend report through the government sponsored agency that you would have expected probably to see move up with a rate rise and in fact it moved down. If you go to the loans, let's look at the asset side, so if we go to the loans while that did move up there a couple of factors inside of loans that I think are worthy of call out. The first is that we actually had about $2 million worth of lease residual write-downs in the quarter so that constrained it by about three basis points the loan yield. And then we also have somewhat of the phenomenon of the repricing timing in those loans based on their structural elements that we see more of that repricing happened in the first quarter just from a unique timing of that component. So that probably - people were looking for larger yield move on that loan and lease line. Those are some of the factors that somewhat constrain that. If you look on any of the other asset lines that I don't know if you had any Ken in particular that you wanted to highlight rather me going through asset-by-asset but\u2026 Ken Usdin : I would just, you know just - I would just say I mean - if you can just focus on even the ones that were just down like interest-bearing deposits was down, the Fed fund line only moved up five, U.S. government was down, Munis was flat and the other was flat. So either the rate - the short-term nature of the securities book just didn't pull through in most of those lines so I don't know if there is a specific reason on each but that's what people were asking? Biff Bowman : So Ken on interest-bearing due from banks, the 91 bps move in the first quarter down to 74, that would mainly be a currency impact. So the fact that we've highlighted that we've had U.S. dollar deposits decline but we had non-U.S. dollar deposits increase and that mix would also come through on the asset side. So that's a little bit of what we\u2019re seeing on the asset side as well and especially on net interest-bearing deposit with bank line. Ken Usdin : So I guess if you could wrap NIM just any thoughts \u2013 just on the trajectory of NIM from here, I'll leave it there? Thanks. Biff Bowman : Sure. Obviously there's a series of factors there you know them well Ken. If we talk about the deposit betas that we've seen on the retail side, they\u2019ve remained low although we are sensing that maybe there is some movement in the marketplace for that to come under pressure. And we monitor and track that to remain competitive. So the deposit betas on the retail side that's a story. On the institutional side, we've seen the deposit betas obviously move up and you can see that in our cost of funding fallen through the balance sheet. It's continued to move kind of on a trajectory that we would have anticipated and continues to be competitive on that front. On the asset side, remember that in the third quarter traditionally we have seen premium amortization be high so that could be a factor in the third quarter as a second and third quarters typically our highest two quarters for premium amortization. Generally because of retail deposit beta is low and because the institutional deposit beta isn't the one, there is still upward possibilities in the NIM. Those factually say there are still upward NIM possibilities that we will see in a normalized environment. In any given quarter that can be matched with the premium amortization, but we still think that there is based on the beta score I just gave you upward NIM possibilities. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Maybe just shift to expenses, if you could talk a little bit about some of the legal and consulting expenses in the outside services bucket is - do you see that as sort of continuing to recur or more oriented to the second quarter. And then the other expense line you mentioned the accounts - servicing charges are those more like processing errors or something related to that that are also one-time? Biff Bowman : Sure. Let's me if I could maybe walk through a little bit of the expense story and some detail and I'll start with the last question you had Brian is, we did see a higher than normal run rate if you will in the costs associated with account servicing. Those are operational cost and errors associated with servicing clients. We had approximately one full point of expense growth above our normal run rate in that area. So if you look at our 8.5% expense growth rate that we talked about early, about 1% of that was in a couple of instances in the quarter in that line item. The second item that I would point out in the expense structure is that we did have about one point of expense growth that was still residual from the LTI the long-term incentive decision around equity that we took in the first quarter which we said would be in this quarter as well, and told you it would be about $8 million that was flow through this quarter. That was about another one point of the expense growth, so that explains two. And the third item is which we talked about in the script is the fact that our comparison for salary increases, we have two salary increases in this quarter versus none in the comparative quarter a year ago. If you had a normalized view where you were - if you were lapping just one, that would have produced about one more point of growth. So those areas drop three points of growth or they explain, I should say drop they explain three points of the growth. In terms of your question around the sequential increase on consulting and legal, I think what's important here is year-over-year both of those are down, consulting is down meaningfully year-over-year but in a sequential period, you can have some spiky nature to that. It could be that we need assistance on specific regulatory matters for instance or specific operational initiatives that we've embarked on but we look at it in kind of six-month buckets and over the last four sets of those six-month periods, we've actually seen the consulting spend come down. It did have a spike in the second quarter around some specific items that we're working on. Resolution planning which would be familiar with being one of those. You can read our 10-Q but our IPO is very modest so the legal can just have some spikiness this quarter. Brian Bedell : Just looking forward to getting to the third and fourth quarters, of course you've got the golf outing in the third quarter and then you\u2019re establishing the bank in Luxembourg. Is that mostly in the run rate in terms of that cost or is that still in process? Biff Bowman : So we gave you the Northern Trust ramp in the third quarter. There are some cost we've already incurred as we've embarked on the Luxembourg and there will be some going forward. Those are modest in terms of the way you should think about those flowing through in terms of the cost of those and they will be spread out over the coming quarters. So probably in any one quarter not worthy of any special callout. Brian Bedell : And just a clarification, thanks for all the detail on the balance sheet. The loan repricing, if I recall that's a better one year lag, so would we expect I guess to the December '16 hike. Fee material loan repricing shifted to the fourth quarter of this year, or do you think it\u2019s a little bit either before that or after that. And then, do you plan on changing your investment strategy on the balance sheet as a result of the things that you're monitoring for client deposit behavior in a rising rate environment? Mark Bette : So actually about 75% of our loans reprice within a year but that repricing - that 's not necessarily been a floating repricing necessarily so a lot of it will depend on the timing and there are more of those renewals that kind of come up in the fourth quarter early in the first quarter so they would've been more fully realized in the first quarter run rate than what we saw come through on the second quarter. So it can fluctuate just based on the timing of when certain renewal come up. Biff Bowman : And it in terms of changing the portfolio strategy, the investment strategy, again we're liability driven, so we're out crying and winning new business and serving our existing client base and they bring their balances and others and we always have and continue have philosophy of conservatively managing those liabilities and turning them into what is and what we see as a relatively conservative but one that\u2019s produced I think consistent net interest income for the firm. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Michael Carrier : Just looking at on Page 8, where you have the operating leverage and the efficiencies. Since 2015 both the fee to expenses and the margin, it was kind of flat line yet the environment has been very favorable both rate in market. Just wanted to get your perspective, like something changing on the investment side, the run rate expenses is so much higher that we would expect. And going forward I know you guys have talked about some of the things that you\u2019re working on in order to try to bring efficiencies but the expense growth rate continues to be elevated. So just wanted to get some sense, when we can start to see those - like the profitability metrics will improve? Biff Bowman : You're right, the line has flattened out and I would suggest in this quarter we remain focused on it and would like to see that continue to widen out we did not - we did have some fee leverage in the quarter but with \u2013 the backdrop of a pretty strong market. So we remain focused on that. Let me try to pull that part a little bit. Take the equipment software line it's up 13%. Underpinning that has been a capital expenditure program over the past one, two, and three years that we think will drive investment for our franchise going forward but you're seeing right now run through that that depreciation and amortization in some cases ahead of the expense savings initiatives. We clearly have got to keep that balance correct. As I just highlighted, there were some unique items in this quarter's expense rate, so that the leverage can be different depending on how you look at those items that I called out. So there was probably wider than sort of flat leverage but we continue to remain focused on the initiatives around location and moving our people to the right place to drive that fee leverage as wide as we can, but yet still produce what we think was pretty strong top line fee growth in 9%. So we need some expense to do that. The last part of that question Mike was, in some areas like the outside services line remember that while that item grows when you saw sequentially or year-over-year, much of the expense in there is actually sort of tied to market levels and revenue levels and volume levels. For instance market data is often priced off of AUM or AUC. We got sub-custody expense that is tied to our holdings around the globe. So there is a linkage that will naturally flow in the growth in some of those line items to that. How far we can widen that out from our fee growth is what we remain focused on. Michael Carrier : And then this is a follow-up, getting back to the net income, I get your comment on into the balance sheet is liability driven. When you look at some of those clients as you mentioned as the normal course of business, on the non-U.S. deposit side. How do you guys think about that client like overall for Northern meaning obviously it pressures, like the net interest income but what else is going on with that client as these balances are coming in. Are you benefiting more on the fee side or the transaction revenues and then anything on the cost that overtime your increase scale. Just trying to put the pieces together. Biff Bowman : So we actually look at our clients and their profitability on a client by client basis and we do it not only on the margins but we do it on a return on capital. So we look at our clients individually to understand that do they bring the right mix of services, albeit they may bring deposits, they may bring fee-based business, in some cases they bring credit and loan income, we look at that land and we look at the capital allocated to another client level. And so to your question clearly that - the growth rate that you saw there, certain clients were utilizing capital and they were utilizing or pressuring if you will in some cases our net interest margin. But we look at them across the broad array services and have great dialogues with them about you know if they are not producing the right kinds of relationship with this we have dialogues about other products and services and capabilities that we can bring to the table to help balance that out. And that's generally - this quarter that allowed us to generate a 12.2% return on equity that type of approach in one of - as we say were committed to deliver between that 10% to 15% range on a client-by-client kind of approach. Operator : Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : I just wanted to follow up on some of Ken's questions but instead of the start out maybe on the funding cost side. We saw the U.S. office interest-bearing deposit costs increase this quarter and given that there is growth there and given how low the yields are overseas, I guess I'm just - get how putting those assets to work way on yields wouldn't that though also or shouldn't that translate into a cheaper funding costs. So could you help me understand either why I\u2019m thinking about that incorrectly or what was going on that might have created some noise there? Mark Bette : I think you're referring to the non-U.S. growth and the fact that the interest expense on that increased as well is part of the question. Brennan Hawken : Yes, exactly and thanks Mark. Mark Bette : So for the non-U.S. office deposit, a significant part of those deposits are actually in U.S. dollars but you know they're on that line of the balance sheet because we collect them in non-U.S. offices. So if we look at the totality of the deposits though, we\u2019re at about for this quarter about 71% of our total deposits were U.S. dollar and that compares to 74% of our total deposits one quarter ago and 75% one year ago. So the movement that you see in the interest rate on the non-US office interest-bearing from 17 bps to 24 bps is actually a function of the U.S. dollar or the U.S. dollar interest rate and there been a significant proportion of U.S. dollar within that category. And then on the savings money market and other line I think you referred to the U.S. deposits that our rates going up in that that there would be most of that is retail which we haven\u2019t seen a lot of movement, but there is some institutional that sits on that line. So when we have U.S. rates going up we expect both the non-U.S. office deposit line, as well as the savings money market and other line to move higher. Brennan Hawken : So I guess following up on that with the non-U.S. side, if you collect in non-U.S. offices and you put it on the balance sheet in U.S. dollar, but then you put it to work in other markets where the yield may not be as favorable. Are you basically allowing your clients to negatively - yield geographies and is that the best way necessarily to price out the funding construct for those assets, I'm just a little confused there so if you could help out that will be great? Mark Bette : So we do match off the currency on the balance sheet. So if we do collect in our non-U.S. office locations and we collect U.S. dollar deposits, we do put those to work - on the asset side in U.S. dollars. So we do match those up. It just so happened that the growth that we had this quarter in non-U.S. offices was not in the U.S. dollar part of it, it was in the non-U.S. dollar part of it. Biff Bowman : Yes, sterling and euro. Brennan Hawken : I\u2019m still a bit confused but I can follow up no need to drag on the call. Thanks for taking the questions. Operator : Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Can you give us your 30,000-foot kind of view with the Federal Reserve's actions that are coming with the unwind of the balance sheet? There's an expectation that the deposits in the banking system will be affected by this, where there'll be a decline. Can you give us a view what you guys think you may see on your balance sheet from the Fed action as it goes full speed next year? Biff Bowman : As you know when the QE was put in place many and in particular the Trust banks saw their balance sheets grow. If you believe that the unwind will drive the interest rates up faster than expectations it's not unreasonable to think that our clients and money that's on balance sheets will be looking at alternative places to find that treasury portfolio and funds et cetera. Our view right now, our house view is that it will be very orderly and that we would see any rate rises be reasonably measured and that deposit flows would be measured to in their movement on and off balance sheet in that environment. I think one of the things that we have to think about is we\u2019re not constrained not really terribly constrained by leverage ratio and other items. So if there's opportunities to take some of those deposits on to the balance sheet if they make sense from a relationship standpoint, we don\u2019t have some of the regulatory constraints if they\u2019re flowing between banks or between funds and banks balance sheet. I think right now we think it will be done in a measured way and have a moderate to modest impact for us. Gerard Cassidy : And can you also share with us - quite often, business customers use compensating balances to pay for services rendered by you and your peers. And obviously, as rates go higher, I would assume then that the amount of the compensating balance doesn't need to be as great when we're in a lower rate environment. Is that a safe assumption? And if it is, should we see some deposit outflow if rates continue to move for compensating balances? Biff Bowman : So I think compensating balances is generally only linked to our treasury management business which is fairly modest on our revenue line. Our trust and custody balances are not traditionally build on a compensating balances type format. So, I would say that for our overall financial statements that would have a very limited potential impact for us. Gerard Cassidy : And then just a technical question. You gave us that, I think, $0.05 per share for the golf expense in the third quarter. Was that after tax or pretax, the $0.05, if I heard you correctly? Biff Bowman : $0.05 after, after. Operator : Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr : Just a couple of quicky follow-ups. Share count flat to drop up year-on-year but you got a pretty big buyback in place. Can you just talk about the offsets and if any that\u2019s related to timing? Biff Bowman : Yes, largely you have option exercise and other share issuances in the quarter, but largely from an option exercise driver. Glenn Schorr : I mean with the cap rate on it? Biff Bowman : No share count that\u2019s not capital because that\u2019s the capital - that share count - yes, I\u2019m sorry that\u2019s on the capital on the share count you would ask share count not capital. On the share count I\u2019m going to have get back to you I\u2019m not sure we bought back but we stayed relatively flat so we'll get back to you. Glenn Schorr : I mean it\u2019s something that I assume would trend down given the size of your capital return. You mentioned when you talked about sec lending down 8% year-on-year, you talked about the spread lags but eventually lists in a rising rate environment. Is there a particular reason why that is it just that market dynamic in other words it gets passed initially off a low base and then eventually you get to keep little a bit more? Mark Bette : There's really there is a lag from the time when the - we do think a higher interest rate environment is a positive factor overall for sec lending. So eventually when you get to the higher level, that's a positive thing but the process getting there sometimes pinches the margin and it's really because the rebate rates on loans against the cash collateral adjust more quickly than the cash reinvestment returns. Those cash reinvestment returns are pretty short, so it doesn't take long for them to reprice, but if they\u2019re out 30 days or so that could have a minimal impact on the spread. And spreads were - they were minimally down sequentially it wasn\u2019t a large decline but they were minimally down. Glenn Schorr : And last one, I had heard that there might have been some strategic decisions on passive versus active in part of your asset management business. Is that something that you\u2019ve been thinking about and have been contemplating lately? Mark Bette : I don't have any comment on that I\u2019m not sure what that it's in reference to. Glenn Schorr : I can ask in a different way, I guess you have a fantastic passive franchise and good in parts active franchise and I guess how are you growing the asset management business I know - there's is a piece that there to service the current client base but there's also another great piece that has asset management only customers? Mark Bette : So we remain focused on all of the capabilities from passive, we've grown our ETFs to about $14 billion and AUM and we\u2019ve continue to grow our engineered equity program across all asset classes. Internally we have traditionally distributed through our - and maybe this was what you're trying to get to, we've traditionally distributed through our existing client base. We continue though to be committed to distributing through third-party and intermediary as well and there is investment in that product and capability that we've really been going after for few years but in earnest in the last year or so. Biff Bowman : And as an example of the growth that we seen on ETF side, a pretty good share of that has come through a third-party as opposed to directly through the wealth management or C&IS channels. Operator : Our next question comes from Betsy Grasic with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Grasic : I just wanted to get a sense of when you do close the acquisition of Luxembourg Bank, could you give us a sense as to how we should anticipate the impact on the balance sheet and on the income statement if there is going to be a mix shift even further in certain currencies that we should anticipate? Biff Bowman : Yes, for the acquisition I don't know that the balance sheet - we would see a significant impact on the balance sheet side unless. Mark Bette : No, there will be limited to know balance sheet impact from the acquisition. So we are acquiring fee-based services from - in the acquisition. Betsy Grasic : So there is no deposit coming in? Biff Bowman : I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ve disclosed that at this point, but we bought the fund administration and the fees associated with that business. So yes, that\u2019s how we keep the assumption. Betsy Grasic : And then at the quarter you mentioned that there was an influx of deposits in the European region. Could you just give us a sense as to what drove that because the end of period balances obviously did go up quite a bit relative to the average. And I'm just wondering what type of activity would drive that big of a move. Biff Bowman : So, they're likely two areas that could drive that. One could be we could have clients with large pools of assets particularly in Europe that could be restructuring portfolios and moving certain portions of their assets around in transitional type periods while they reconfigure or restructure portfolios. And that could have very short-term impacts. And we also have an Edge Act subsidiary that does certain clearing for certain foreign entities and they can in important time keep large euro or other balances that could be the client could leave those balances with us at period ends. So we do typically see some spiking from those two types of activities. Betsy Grasic : So one is transition management and one is Edge Act clearing related I guess? Biff Bowman : So clients themselves transition not necessarily our transition management business, but the clients are moving some of their assets around in periods near quarter and significantly? Betsy Grasic : Sure. And then is there anything in there around just the rate outlook on the euro that you think - based on what you saw in this quarter that you would expect would drive increased behavior like this going forward I am just wondering if there is a link in it all to improving outlook and rates in Europe that would lead us to expected this kind of activity would continue? Mark Bette : Yes, I don't believe so. I don't know that there is anything fundamentally that\u2019s triggered the activity and the growth we saw that fundamental to either and improving or an increasing rate environment in Europe at least at this stage. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : I have a quick question follow up on the loan yields here. So if I'm thinking about this right, is the right way to think about it that since most of your loans repriced later in the fourth quarter and beginning of the first quarter, you\u2019re not really seeing much of the pickup in the March Fed funds increase, you\u2019re not seeing a pickup in the June and if there is another Fed funds increase in December that you\u2019ll really be - you\u2019ll have a three Fed funds hike catch up in your loan yields in the first quarter of 2018? Biff Bowman : Yes, so I think it's a portion of the story that you just described is because of that, what I will say earlier in the first quarter. I think you also have to look at the loan mix where some of our loans that are driven by more fixed basis may not follow the pattern you just described. You really have to decompose that loan portfolio and look at the repricing structures of that loan portfolio to make the assumption you just did. Might be a little - it maybe on the high side that it's all going to catch-up in one year from now from a repricing perspective, but what you think that would be some lumpiness to that. Brian Kleinhanzl : I'm not saying it goes up by 75 basis points, what I\u2019m saying is can you refresh maybe your memories as to what the percentage of variable is as a percentage of loans. Biff Bowman : 75% - I don't have the actual flowing but 75% does reprice within a year - but we're not necessarily implying that most of that all happens around year end. It's just that there will be on average probably a larger part of it that would happen at the beginning of the year which would impact the first quarter but that's not to say that every year would be in the first quarter when we would see the stuff up for loans. Brian Kleinhanzl : You mean they don\u2019t follow a similar repricing schedule, so it would be year-over-year? Biff Bowman : It would depend on the timing, it would depend on timing of loan renewals and a lot of those might be - a handful of those more in proportion might be set up to roll over at the beginning of the year versus at the beginning of April let\u2019s say as an example. So in this sequential comparison we picked up a little more maybe in the first quarter then what we would have picked up just from a timing perspective in the second quarter. Brian Kleinhanzl : What if I compare first quarter 2018 to first quarter 2017, shouldn't that be an accurate comparison? Biff Bowman : On a year-over-year basis, yes you\u2019d probably - you\u2019re right yeah. Brian Kleinhanzl : And then just a second question on the other operating expenses. I mean how much of that spend this quarter was discretionary, I heard you say business promotion to me that sounds discretionary, you could pull that back to help improve operating leverage, staffing, maybe or maybe not but how of much of that $17 million increase that you saw sequentially really could drop off next quarter? Biff Bowman : In the other operating\u2026 Mark Bette : Other operating expenses. Biff Bowman : Yes, so first of all we saw as I said about one point of growth so you can do that - that was due to account servicing losses. So call that $8 million to $9 million, I can't tell you if it will repeat we certainly hope it doesn't repeat, but the reality is that you can call that discretionary and that's one item in there and there is clearly items, while the Northern Trust Open is in the next quarter and we gave that there are clearly discretionary items in there like business promotion. There's other discretionary items in there that we look carefully at and manage carefully on an ongoing basis but we'll continue to be laser focused on them going forward. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. Mark Bette : The other thing Brian I would mention on the expense side is, we did take the $22.8 million severance charge in the current quarter and indicated approximately an $18 million run rate savings on that. And it will be - the timing of that will come in over the next six quarters. So the full run rate impact of that wouldn't really be in place until the end of 2018. So that's just one other thing on the expense side as far as looking out beyond the current quarter. Operator : And at this time, I'd like to turn the conference back over to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks. Mark Bette : Appreciate you joining us for the quarter, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thank you. Biff Bowman : Thank you. Operator : That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.",

This will allow us to move through the queue and enable as many people as possible the opportunity to ask questions as time permits. Thank you again for joining us today. Let me turn the call over to Rick Waddell. Frederick Waddell : Thanks Mark and good morning everyone. I join Mark in welcoming you to our third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. As you all know, late yesterday we announced that I\u2019ve decided to step down from my current role as Chief Executive Officer, effective the first of next year January 1st. And I am very pleased to report that Michael Grady will be assuming the role of Chief Executive Officer next year in addition to his current position as President. As we stated, I will remain Chairman of the board. The announcement reflects what I can assure you is a robust and deliberate success in planning process that was undertaken by our Board of Directors, personally I\u2019ve been thinking about this transition for 10 years, because I think it\u2019s extraordinarily important for the CEO of any company to develop a management team and a group of successors to take his/her place and I\u2019m very proud of that. All of you are familiar with Mike from his previous role, many of you, and his service as our Chief Financial Officer. And you won\u2019t be surprised, you shouldn\u2019t be surprised to know that our board, myself obviously and our management team and all our leaders are deeply confident in Mike\u2019s ability to lead Northern Trust as CEO. I look forward. Honestly I look forward to continuing to work with my Mike in my role as Chairman and we will \u2013 I\u2019m going to answer any questions you have about our leadership changes during the Q&A period after our prepared remarks. Before Biff walks you through the numbers, I\u2019d like to give you some specifics in the comment on our value for spend initiatives that we announced in our third quarter earnings release yesterday. As you all know, we\u2019ve been focused on driving greater efficiencies across our businesses for some time. And value for spend which is what we\u2019re calling this is a companywide expense management initiative that we believe is designed to create the capacity for additional investment and growth. And I want to underline the growth aspect of our strategies, you see in our top line, we talk about where we\u2019re growing this company and creating that capacity is important. Through value for spend, we will embed new expense management discipline across the organization. And I can assure that we understand the important to the organization on executing on the value for spend initiative and we look forward to providing you update as we have done in the past on our progress in this area. So now, let me turn it over \u2013 turn the call over to Biff. Biff? Biff Bowman : Thanks, Rick. Good morning, everyone. Let me join Rick and Mark in welcoming you to our third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Starting on Page two of our quarterly earnings review presentation, this morning we reported the third quarter net income of $298.4 million. Earnings per share were a $1.20 and our return on common equity was 12.2%. This quarter\u2019s results included a $17.6 million tax benefit related to Federal and State Tax research credits. A $4.3 million tax charge related to an increase in the Illinois state deferred income tax resulting from an increase in the Illinois income tax rate. Expense charges of $7 million associated with severance and related activities. And acquisition integration expense of $3.5 million associated with the acquisition of UBS Asset Management\u2019s fund administration units in Luxembourg and Switzerland. Our assets under custody and administration, assets under custody and assets management increased 14%, 16% and 19% respectively compared to the prior year, reflecting favorable markets and our continued success in winning new business. A number of environmental factors impact our businesses as well as our clients. Before going through our results in detail, let me review how some of those factors unfolded during the third quarter. Equity markets performed well during the quarter. In U.S. markets, the S&P 500 ended the quarter up 16.2% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. In international markets, the MSCI EAFE Index was up 15.9% year-over-year and up 2.8% sequentially. Recall that some of our fees are based on lagged market values and second quarter markets were also up compared to the prior year, as well as sequentially. In bonds markets, the Barclays U.S. aggregate Index was down 3% compared to the last year and up one-tenth of a percent sequentially. Currency volatility as measured by the G7 Index was 20% lower compared to last year and 2% higher sequentially. Foreign exchange market volumes were also higher during the quarter. As measured by two of the interbank brokers, volumes were flat to up 12% year-over-year and up 3% to 9% sequentially. You'll recall that currency volatility and client activity influence our foreign exchange trading income. Currency rates influence the translation of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar and therefore impact client assets and certain revenues and expenses. The British pound and Euro ended the quarter up 3% and 5% respectively versus the prior year as compared to U.S. dollar. On a sequential basis, the British pound and euro both strengthened by 3%. The strengthening of these currencies compared to the U.S. dollar favorably impacted revenue that had an unfavorable impact on our expenses. U.S. short-term interest rates were higher during the quarter most evident in three-month LIBOR which averaged a 131 basis points during the quarter compared to a 121 basis points in the prior quarter and 79 basis points one year ago. Let's move to Page three and review the financial highlights of the third quarter. Year-over-year revenue increased a 11% with noninterest income up 9% and net interest income up 18%. Expenses increased 11% from last year. The provision for credit losses was a credit of 7 million. Net income was 16% higher year-over-year. In the sequential comparison, revenue was up 2% with noninterest income up 1% and net interest income up 5%. Expenses were flat compared to the prior quarter. Net income was a 11% higher sequentially. Return on average common equity was at 12.2% for the quarter up from a 11.7% one year ago and up from a 11.6% in the prior quarter. Assets under custody and administration of 9.7 trillion increased 14% compared to one year ago and 4% on a sequential basis. Assets under custody of 7.8 trillion increased 60% compared to one year ago and 5% on a sequential basis. For both the year-over-year and sequential comparisons, strong new business, favorable market impacts and moves and currency exchange rates were the drivers. Assets under management were $1.1 trillion up 19% year-over-year and up 9% on a sequential basis. The year-over-year increase was driven by favorable markets and net new business flows. On a sequential basis the growth was driven by new business flows and favorable market impacts. Let's look at results in greater detail starting with revenue on Page four. Third quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $1.4 billion, up a 11% from last year and up 2% sequentially. Trust investment and other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue and were $868 million in the third quarter up 10% year-over-year and up 2% from the prior quarter. Foreign exchange trading income was $49 million in the third quarter down 8% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was primarily driven by lower volatility. Other noninterest income was $74 million in the third quarter, up 8% compared to one year ago and down 9% sequentially. This increase from one year ago is primarily driven by a loss in our lease portfolio in last year\u2019s result. The sequential decline was due to clients and securities commissions and trading income, treasury management fees and lower net hedged related income. Net interested income which I will discuss in more detail later was $366 million in the third quarter increasing 18% year-over-year and up 5% sequentially. Let's look at the components of our trust fee investment \u2013 trust and investment fees on Page five. For Corporate & Institutional Services business, fees totaled $501 million in the third quarter up a 11% year-over-year and 3% on a sequential basis. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees were $338 million up 13% compared to the prior year and up 3% sequentially. These results primarily reflects strong new business, favorable equity markets and the favorable impact of currency exchange rates. Assets under custody for C&IS clients were $7.1 trillion at quarter end up 16% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. These results primarily reflect new business, favorable markets and the benefit of the moves in currency exchange rates. Recall that lagged market values factor into the quarter's fees with both quarter lag and month lag markets impacting our C&IS custody and fund administration fees. Investment management fees in C&IS of a $104 million in the third quarter were up 10% year-over-year and up 5% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential comparisons were driven by favorable markets and net new business flows. Assets under management for C&IS clients were $841 billion up 19% year-over-year and 10% sequentially. Favorable market impacts and net new business for the drivers of both the year-over-year and sequential comparisons. Securities lending fees were $23 million in the third quarter, 1% lower than one year ago and 73% lower sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential declines were driven by lower spreads partially offset by higher volumes. Securities lending collateral was a $162 billion at quarter end and averaged $149 billion across the quarter. Average collateral levels increased 32% year-over-year and 12% sequentially. The growth in volumes compared to a year ago was driven by demand for U.S. treasuries. The sequential volume increase was driven by U.S. treasuries and U.S. equities. Other fees in C&IS were $36 million in the third quarter up 6% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. The year-over-year growth reflects higher fees from investment risk and analytical services and other ancillary services. Moving to our wealth management business, trust investment and other servicing fees were $367 million in the third quarter up 9% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Within wealth management, the Global Family Office business had strong performance with fees increasing 18% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Each of the regions also performed well during the quarter. Across Global Family Office in each of the regions both the year-over-year and sequential growth was driven by favorable markets and new business. Assets under management for wealth management clients were $284 billion at quarter end, up 17% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Moving to Page six, net interest income was $366 million in the third quarter up 18% year-over-year. Earning assets averaged $112 billion in the third quarter up 4% versus last year driven primarily by higher level deposits. Total deposits averaged $97 billion and were up 4% year-over-year. Interest bearing deposits increased 11% from one year ago to $75 billion. This growth was partially offset by a 16% decline in non-interest bearing deposits which averaged $22 billion during the third quarter. Loan balances averaged $33 billion in the third quarter and were down 1% compared to one year ago. The net interest margin was 1.29% in the third quarter and was up 15 basis points from a year ago. The improvement in the net interest margin compared to the prior year primarily reflects the impact of higher short-term interest rates partially offset by the change in mix of our balance sheet. On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income was up $16 million or 5%. Average earning assets increased 2% sequentially, funded by increases in interest bearing deposits and short-term borrowings, partially offset by decline in noninterest bearing deposits. For the quarter, average noninterest bearing deposits declined $1.8 billion sequentially. On a sequential basis, the net interest margin increased one basis point with the benefit of higher short-term interest rates being partially offset by the change in mix of our balance sheet, higher premium amortization and day count. Net interest income for the quarter totaled a $2.7 million benefit due to the accounting for certain taxed managed investments. This benefit was offset on the fully taxable equivalent line. Looking at the currency mix of our balance sheet, for the third quarter U.S. dollar deposits represented 70% of our total deposits. This compared to 75% one year and 71% in the prior quarter. Premium amortization was $19 million in the third quarter, compared to $20 million one year ago, and $15 million in the second quarter. Turning to Page seven, expenses were $936 million in the third quarter and were 11% higher than the prior year and flat sequentially. Recall that the prior quarter\u2019s results included severance and personnel charges up $22.8 million. The current quarter included severance and personnel charges of $7 million and acquisition integration cost of $3.5 million. Compensation expense was $418 million and increased 9% compared to last year and declined 3% sequentially. Excluding the severance-related charges in the current quarter and the prior quarter\u2019s results, compensation was up 8% year-over-year and was flat sequentially. The year-over-year growth was attributable to base pay adjustments, staff growth, higher performance-based compensation, and the unfavorable translation impact of changes in currency rates. Recall that for this quarter we have two sets of base pay adjustments in the year-over-year comparison as the 2016 increases were deferred until October 1 of last year, and the 2017 adjustments were effective April 1, of this year. Staff levels increased approximately 5% year-over-year with the growth all being attributable to lower cost locations which include India, Manila, Limerick, Ireland and Tempe Arizona. On a sequential basis, a decline in long-term equity-based compensation was offset by higher cash-based incentives, salaries due to staff growth and the unfavorable translation impact of changes in currency rates. Employee benefit expense excluding severance costs was $74 million and was up 1% by on a year-over-year and sequential basis. Outside services expense including service \u2013 severance related costs was $172 million and was up 9% compared to the prior-year driven primarily by higher consulting expense, higher sub-custody costs, higher market data cost within technical services and slightly higher third party advisor fees. On a sequential basis, outside service expense was up 4% primarily driven by higher consulting and sub-custody costs. Equipment and software expense of $131 million was up 14% from one year ago and down 2% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was driven by increased software amortization and equipment depreciation, as well as higher maintenance support and rental cost. Occupancy expense of $47 million was up 7% compared to the prior year and up 2% sequentially. The higher level of expense was primarily due to accelerated depreciation expense related to a previously announced facility exit in one of our Chicago locations. Other operating expense of $92 million increased 29% from last year and 12% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was driven by higher business promotion spend primarily associated with the Northern Trust golf tournament which was held during the quarter. On a sequential basis, the increase was driven by cost associated with the golf tournament, partially offset by lower account service related cost and lower staff relocation expense. Turning to Page eight, our capital ratios remain strong with common equity Tier 1 ratios of 13.3% and 12.2% respectively calculated on a transition basis for both advanced and standardized. On a fully phased-in basis, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the advanced approach would be approximately 13.2% and under the standardized approach would be approximately 12.1%. All of these ratios are well above the fully phased-in requirement of 7% which includes the capital conservation buffer. The supplementary leverage ratio at the Corporation was 6.9% and at the bank was 6.2%, both of which exceed the 3% requirement which will be applicable to Northern Trust in 2018. With respect to the liquidity coverage ratio, Northern Trust is above the 100% minimum requirement that became effective on January 1, 2017. As Northern Trust progresses through fully phased-in Basel III implementation, there could be additional enhancements to our models and further guidance from the regulators on the implementation of the final rule which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final Basel III rules. In the third quarter we repurchased 1.4 million shares of common stock at a cost of $125 million. During the quarter, we increased our quarterly cash dividend by a 11% to $0.42 for common share. Turning to Page nine, a key focus has been on sustainably enhancing profitability in returns. This slide reflects the progress we\u2019ve made in recent years to improve the expense to fee ratio, pre-tax margin and ultimately our return on equity. The ratio of expenses to trust and investment fees is particularly important measure of our progress, as it addresses what we can most directly control. Reducing this measure from where it was previously, as high as a 131% in 2011, to the levels we see today as a key contributor to improve net and our return on equity. Now turning to Page 10, as Rick previewed, we would like to spend some time today walking you through a focused expense management initiative that we have launched this quarter which we refer to as value for spend. I\u2019ll start by describing where we have been and where we are focused with respect to growth, productivity and returns. First, focusing on growth, since 2014 our trust investment and other servicing fees have growth at a compound annual rate of 6%. Our revenue is growth at a rate of 7% over the same period. The growth has been achieved within both of our client segments with C&IS revenue growing at an annual rate of 10% and wealth management growing 6%. Assets under custody and assets under management have also grown through this period by 10% and 7% annually respectively reflecting our success in winning new business. From a productivity perspective, expense growth over this period has kept pace directly supporting our business expansion. To meet client needs now and in the future, we have made strategic investments and new technologies, talent, products, capabilities and markets. We have also invested in our risk infrastructure. However, our fee operating leverage and expense to fee ratio has [Inaudible]. We are committed to building on our growth momentum to achieve a better balance between revenue expansion and the expense needed to support that expansion. Turning to page 11, with our value for spend initiative, we will be focused on realigning our expense base in the short-term. Expenses throughout the company with a focus on non-client facing functions are under review. A portfolio of initiatives will support profitable growth by permanently taking expense out of our operating model. Initiatives fall into three categories, organizational alignment, process optimization and strategic resourcing, strategic sourcing. We expect to realize $250 million and expense run rate savings by 2020. Our longer term goal is to sustain profitable growth. We are embedding new management discipline across the enterprise. Additionally, we will review an ongoing pipeline of cost savings initiatives. Now turning to page 12. We are confident that these actions will ensure that we remain focused on delivering greater returns to the long-term. We will maintain a well-positioned balanced growth portfolio. We will continue to invest in targeted growth opportunities, we will maximize value for spend and we will optimize deployment of our capital and liquidity. We will execute on value for spend, while maintaining the high quality balance sheet and strongly capitalized franchise that is aligned with our history. These actions I\u2019ve outlined will help us continue toward a return on common equity that is in the upper end of our 10% to 15% targeted range, while delivering positive fee operating leverage. Overtime, we expect our expense growth rate to be more closely aligned with our organic fee growth, which we have seen track in the mid-single digit percent. We are confident in our ability to execute on the initiatives we have discussed today and look forward to providing updates on our progress in future for us. Before opening up the line for questions, I wanted to provide an update on our acquisition of UBS Asset Management\u2019s fund administration units in Luxembourg and Switzerland. As we announced earlier this month, the transaction closed on October 1. The acquisition is a quarter stone of our strategic expansion plan for Continental Europe and represents significant opportunity brought our scale, capabilities products and market reach across Europe. The acquisition positions Northern Trust as a leading administrator in Switzerland and a top 10 assent servicing provider in Luxembourg. From a financial standpoint, the annualized revenue run rate is approximately $75 million. For the fourth quarter and throughout 2018, we expect the acquisition to be modestly accretive on an operating basis and modestly dilutive if you include the integration cost. As I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, integrate cost in the current quarter were $3.5 million. We expect transaction and integration cost to be $8 million to $10 million in the fourth quarter. Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust third quarter earnings conference call today. We would be happy to answer your questions. Nichole, please open the line. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And we will take our first question from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Hi, good afternoon. Biff Bowman : Hi Brennan. Brennan Hawken : Yeah, thanks for taking the question, appreciate it. And congrats to both Mike and Rick on the announcement last night, it\u2019s great. Just want\u2026 Michael Grady : Thank you. Brennan Hawken : Sure. Just wanted to ask a quick on here on expenses and the program. I think you guys \u2013 it\u2019s great to see here with the release and you have highlighted that this positions you well and well with the focus on instilling discipline throughout the organization. Just to clarify, you also had said though that you wanted to free up capacity to invest. So what I\u2019m trying to think about as far as looking forward the impact of this program, it\u2019s my understanding that you guys have always been investing for growth and that\u2019s been a priority in order to maintain long-term value in the franchise. And so when we think about the impact of this $250 million program versus last night right before we knew about it, how should we think about the impact to how we\u2019re previously thinking about your bottom line and expense trajectory, is the idea that the $250 million will go to the bottom line and your continued investment would remain the same as we were expecting previously or will this $250 million free up greater capacity to invest and therefore the $250 won\u2019t end up falling to the bottom line in the end? Biff Bowman : Let me start with this, I would say as Rick pointed out in his comments and I will say here again that, we have always focused on growing our franchise. What this initiative allows us to do is to increase the profitable growth trajectory of our firm. But we still are doing this to ensure that we can invest in those targeted areas of our franchise that we think generate the best return and the best return on equity to our shareholders. So these initiatives align our expense base and our \u2013 and the growth in our expenses more in line with our organic growth rates and they do allow us to invest in those targeted areas that we describe at many times on these calls whether that\u2019s in our wealth management franchise or asset management franchise or asset servicing franchise. Mike, I don\u2019t know if you want to\u2026 Michael Grady : Okay, you got it. Biff Bowman : So, we think this will allow for the trajectory of profitable growth to continue to improve with these initiatives, but there will be growth still in our franchise. Brennan Hawken : Sure, sure. I totally appreciate that and it\u2019s been a long-term priority of Northern. Okay, so I guess thinking about the $250 million over the next few years, I know the end result is 2020. So, how should we think about the various years and when these benefits would begin to impact results that we might actually see in the expense trajectory that we would see? Biff Bowman : Yeah. So, a couple of things here, one, as we said, we will update you as we proceed through the program but we do believe the progress will be fairly evenly distributed across the horizon we\u2019ve laid out for you. So there will be some initiatives that come in at different times and there will be some variation in the size and the magnitude of those, but it\u2019s probably best to think of it as a fairly evenly distributed improvement across that $250 million expense initiative program we laid out. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Thanks for taking my question. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Carrier from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Michael Carrier : Thanks guys. One other question just on the cost and the efficiencies. And Biff, I think you\u2019re kind of getting to this but if I look at sort of the core expense growth that you think you need for the business, it sounds like you maybe had some investment initiatives recently and that you should be long-term like in that mid-single digit so I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s 5%. But just want to understand is that how you guys think about the core for investing and operating the business and a lot of the \u2013 I don\u2019t know if it was the ramp up in spend, whether it\u2019s regulatory related or other initiatives that\u2019s starting to moderate and so we shouldn\u2019t see this elevated spend going forward. Biff Bowman : Yeah, couple of points on that. As we said in our prepared remarks, calibrating the expense growth rate of the firm more in line with the organic growth rate that you just described is one of the outcomes of these initiatives, so getting that $250 million out gets that relationship that are co-related. And the second part of your point is, we have had investment as we talked about in our risk infrastructure and other areas that we\u2019ve build out over the last three to four years that we think, I think the best we\u2019ve bent the curve there to flatten out that expense trajectory which should allow us to get our organic growth rate closer to the expense growth rate that we think is a firm is better aligned. And this initiative should create that alignment over the next three years that we laid out. Michael Carrier : Okay, thanks. And then just as a follow-up, just on the balance sheet and net interest income, maybe just the outlook or what you\u2019re seeing in terms of deposit betas the level of non-interest bearing deposits that\u2019s come down, based on the interactions with the clients, where do you think you are maybe in that process? And when you look at some of the, maybe the international money that comes in and is, you know, it\u2019s somewhat pressuring the net interest margin on the balance sheet. Are there other like options or cash products either that you can be offering and maybe you\u2019re already doing this but in terms of like money market funds or something to offset maybe some of that pressure even though the overall relationship remains favorable. Biff Bowman : Yeah, sure that\u2019s a big \u2013 there were a lot of questions on there, there is a lot of detail. Let me walk you through a few of those answers if we take a look at how we think about the deposit betas first. If I look our retail deposit beta, it has stayed relatively low, it moved up modestly from Q2 to Q3 but still is low on the retail deposit beta. On the institutional beta that we\u2019ve seen, it has migrated north, it has migrated higher over the last two quarters. I would highlight that what we described coming out of last quarter, we have the ability to re-price our balance sheet daily and in periods of time if our market was higher or if our beta was higher or lower than the market we\u2019ve been able to adjust that and have taken some of those actions in the third quarter. So we have seen that beta begin to rise on the institutional side but still flat. We\u2019ll see with another rate hike if it manifests in December if that\u2019s a trigger point on the retail or wealth side in particular. As it relates to non-interest bearing deposits, the second part of your question was, how do we think about non-interest bearing deposits, and let me walk you through our non-interest bearing deposits to give you some color as to the breakdown of that. About $21 billion to $22 billion in non-interest bearing deposits, and the way we think about it is, about a quarter of those are wealth management deposits, those have traditionally been sticky non-interest bearing deposits. A quarter of those are cash management or treasury management related deposits, those two have been there in support of operating business. That leaves about half of the remaining portion of our non-interest bearing that are really supporting our asset servicing business. A meaningful portion of that half is also in support of operating businesses, let\u2019s call it a quarter to 30% of that which leaves us with a residual of about maybe a quarter or so of the $21 billion that is what could be deemed to be excess. We have regular dialogs with those clients and in many cases, they\u2019re not excess, they\u2019re there for their own operational reasons. We do offer to your second point alternatives for those deposits, should they become rate sensitive. Those deposits have the alternative we could pay for those deposits and that has what we have seen as you\u2019ve seen the non-interest bearing deposits reduce, many of those are in this bucket of whether we call that excess but they are rate sensitive, the most rate sensitive in that bucket. We have alternatives for them of either making them interest bearing or move into our off balance sheet cash products and you can see our cash AUM has moved up to capture some of those and then you can also see that our interest bearing deposits particularly in the savings and money market line has also in the recipient of some of those as we move them into interest bearing. The last part of your question was about international deposits, particularly those that are non-dollar I think you were focused on and what our alternatives are for those. We do offer cash funds in Europe for those. Traditionally those balances however have stayed on the balance sheet, it\u2019s just more historical norms and the nature of our custody business there has been that we do have off balance sheet alternatives but tradition has been much more to use the balance sheet. So I hope that\u2019s a, a quick walk through the non-interest bearing deposits. And the outlook for those is, we have regular dialogs, we saw the majority of \u2013 or we saw a largest amount move in the second quarter, we saw less this quarter as you saw but we did still see some clients in that quarter piece of that bucket that are having dialogs with us. Michael Carrier : All right, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Biff Bowman : Hey Alex. Alex Blostein : Hey guys, hey, good morning, sorry good afternoon I guess. This snowfall operating expenses, I just want to kind of clarify couple of things. So, if I knew you correctly Biff, it sounds like mid-single digit kind of expense growth is what you\u2019re targeting. And I just want to make sure or heard you correctly that $250 million is inclusive in this mid-single digit growth. Is that right? A, and then B, maybe the easier way to think about it is just to kind of help us think through the expense to fees ratio or target that you\u2019re hoping to get to by the time this program is done so kind of 2020, what do you hope to be assuming your goals for organic growth kind of normal markets in this expense program, I just think it\u2019ll clarify things a lot. Thanks. Biff Bowman : So the first part of your question is right, it is correct, the $250 million is in that calibrated ratio that we talked about which is organic growth rate and the expense growth rate of the firm. In terms of the expense to fee ratio, I think what we would describe to you is, we talked about our focus on driving fee operating leverage into our business on a regular basis, that will inherently drive that ratio down from the 108, 109 levels that it is today on a continuous path. We are not putting a firm target out there because we need to continue to drive that ratio further down through that fee operating leverage I just described. And again I would highlight Alex that for some of our businesses, if we put one target down it\u2019s different by business and I internally as well as externally, we don\u2019t want to necessarily anchor to one number. If we do anchor to driving fee operating leverage into our franchise, that will inherently bring that ratio down overtime and we\u2019re going to continue to talk about that and describe the progress we make. Alex Blostein : Got it, thanks, that\u2019s helpful. Second question just kind of going back to slide 10 where you guys outlined various initiatives and sort of, kind of the history in the targets. When it comes to returns, you say optimize. Can you spend just a minute on what that means whether you\u2019re talking about just return of capital going higher, utilizing balance sheet slightly differently, growing the balance sheets in various areas, just you guys obviously have lots of excess capital, that\u2019s always been one of the key pillars for Northern Trust and I\u2019m just trying to think about if something is different when we should think about excess capital utilization in that comment. Biff Bowman : Yeah. I think you\u2019re thinking about the right way. It\u2019s opportunities that we can both optimize the capital and the strong capital position we\u2019re in, it\u2019s ways that we can put that to work and whether that\u2019s utilizing our balance sheet, you will have seen in this quarter that we did some I would say relatively modest leveraging but we\u2019re in this position of capital strength and we\u2019re able to do that to generate some incremental net interest income for instance. We can put it to use if the demand is there in our securities lending business, we can put that capital to use in there. But we are talking about generally optimizing that capital that we have, if we\u2019re not in a mode where we\u2019re returning it through share repurchases and the dividends, obviously we will do with regular dividends but if we\u2019re not in the practice of share repurchases then how do we put that to work, and that\u2019s what we mean by optimizing our capital and liquidity to enhance returns there. Alex Blostein : Got it. Thanks for a clarification on both fronts. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : Hello there. I guess just\u2026 Frederick Waddell : Hello Glenn. Glenn Schorr : Hello. I would just wanted to see if I sum this up correctly, I hate putting words in people\u2019s mouths but I feel like what you\u2019re saying is, we\u2019re going \u2013 we still want to grow, we\u2019re going to do it hopefully at better ROEs. No commitment on pre-tax margins, operating leverage or expense to fee target but hopefully those goes hand-in-hand and the share accounts not likely go down because we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019d rather grow that\u2019s a better use of our dollar. So when I add that up, earnings still grow nice, it\u2019s just \u2013it feels like just a sharpen version of the same Northern story, that\u2019s not a bad thing, I\u2019m just making sure I got it all right. Michael Grady : Yeah, Glenn, it\u2019s Mike. I would say that\u2019s the case. Just to broaden out on it a little bit, so we feel like the business is extremely well positioned. And I say that from the perspective of thinking about wealth management, asset management or asset service business and the market positions that we have, the segments that we\u2019re in and the growth that we\u2019re experiencing right now. And when we look at the opportunity, we think that we can continue to grow at an above average organic growth rate. At the same time, in order to do that, it does require investment. And what we\u2019ve seen over the last few years is, in order to attain that organic growth that essentially we\u2019ve had to invest at the same rate, and so we\u2019re not improving what we would consider this, the overall productivity for the business and not seeing the level of increases in returns that would meet up with our expectations. And so as much as we\u2019ve been focused on productivity going back to driving performance and through then, so it\u2019s not as though we stop thinking about productivity. We\u2019ve just acknowledged the fact that we have to be even more discipline around attaining that profit, that productivity. So, putting more initiatives in place and being more discipline around the tracking of those both internally and externally so that to your point we can continue on the same strategy which we think is attractive but improve both the profitability and returns of that growth. Frederick Waddell : And Glenn, it\u2019s Rick. I\u2019ll just eco what Mike said and Biff has said. I think that external focus, I mean you all have asked for more transparency and more clarity around these initiatives. We\u2019re \u2013 we intend \u2013 we\u2019ve given you a number internally that\u2019s the number we\u2019re going to talk about and we have a variety of initiatives. I think that brings discipline and I mean the fact that we\u2019re going to \u2013 we will continue to update you as we did in the past around things like driving performance and where you saw us make that progress, I think we need to be held accountable for that \u2013 for those update. So, I think it is the same strategy, we\u2019ve got a lot of moving parts, they were all good parts but we\u2019ve got to execute on those and we\u2019ve got to show you the results, and I think that\u2019s different. I mean we \u2013 you\u2019ve been asking for this, we\u2019re now giving you, we got a number. And you may like or not like the number but that\u2019s the number, we expect to beat that number, but it\u2019s going to take work, it\u2019s going to take a lot of hard work and we want all the \u2013 we want the discipline, we want everybody behind it and so I think that is what is different this time, not different in the past because we\u2019ve had these initiatives underway. But I think that\u2019s a major difference, and one that we heard from you all that you want it going forward. Glenn Schorr : Great. I appreciate all of that. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Frederick Waddell : Hi Ken. Ken Usdin : Thanks guys, thanks. Hi guys. One more different way of asking about leverage, so Biff, when you talk about organic fee leverage and you talk about managing the expense growth rate relative to that organic fee leverage, what are you including or not including in organic fee leverage? Because my second part of the question is, if the markets are helpful to that, if rates are helpful to that, will you still be committed to managing that fee operating leverage no matter what and then also on the downside, what happens if organic fee growth slows, will you have flexibility to manage underneath as well? The commitment to that underlying leverage is really the main question. Biff Bowman : Yeah, let me back up just a bit. I think we\u2019ve talked about trying to generate fee leverage is what we\u2019ve talked about. But to do that, we wanted to focus on those items that we have the most control over, which is new business primarily on the fee line with markets creating and currency creating movement on that but primarily new business on the few line and on the expense line it\u2019s primarily our control of the expenses inside of our franchise impacted by currency is kind of stripped out. What we think about is, we want to generate that positive fee leverage and so to do that, we recognize it overtime markets and currencies and rates are going to \u2013 markets and currencies primarily are going to move around. We want to focus in on those things that we can. On the expense line that\u2019s making sure that our expense growth rate is more closely co-related or tied if you will to the organic growth rates that we see in our business. And I hear you\u2019re saying those can move around too and that\u2019s where we have to have the disciplines to try to move the expense rate if the organic growth rate slows for whatever period in that time. We\u2019re trying to get those calibrated. What we\u2019re not saying here is that we\u2019re going to publish a organic fee leverage ratio or that we\u2019re going to describe that in great detail each time, but we are using it internally to help calibrate the growth rates for our franchise, particularly on the expense side. Ken Usdin : And Biff, I guess is what I\u2019m really getting at is, in a market that we\u2019ve got right now where we\u2019ve got rates up a 100 basis points, we got markets up 16%, that\u2019s the extra stuff. But the expense rate this year obviously has been elevated for several reason, so going forward, with help from the markets result in kind of extra leverage to that? Again, is the commitment to just kind of driving that incremental profitable growth that you\u2019re talking about I think is still key to discipline going forward. Michael Grady : Yeah, I mean I would say that\u2019s where a lot of it comes, that improvement in markets for example should drop to a positive fee operating leverage. Biff Bowman : Yeah. Michael Grady : And what Biff is saying, when you strip out markets rates currency that we are looking to still have positive fee operating leverage on an organic basis, definitionally. And on the downside, I would say, to the extent that you get into a very difficult market environment, you still have to react to that as well which we have in the past. Ken Usdin : Okay, thanks guys. Michael Grady : Thanks. Operator : And our next question comes from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Biff Bowman : Hey Brian. Brian Kleinhanzl : Yeah \u2013 hi, how is going Biff? Quick question on the AUM and AUC growth, both are pretty strong quarter-on-quarter and you called out a couple of different things between market returns, flows and effects. But can you maybe break that down a little bit further into the individual components there may be on a percentage basis as to which was, what was the contribution from market returns, flows or new business and the FX? Biff Bowman : Yeah. If you\u2019re talking AUC first or do you want AUC and AUM both? Brian Kleinhanzl : AUC first is fine. Biff Bowman : AUC was roughly 40% driven by flows and 60% driven by I would say markets and currencies roughly. In AUM\u2026 Frederick Waddell : Yeah, AUM would be similar but a little bit less on the flow side on a sequential basis on AUM. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. And then a quick question on the UBS asset management as you\u2019re bringing out, so in UBS\u2019s disclosure they \u2013 now that that there was a three basis point gross margin on the business, I think you said it\u2019s going to be $35 [ph] million annual run rate revenues so it implies $1.8 billion \u2013 or excuse me, 1.8 basis point fee rate. Is that just a cost of doing business and outsourcing that was just the reduction in fees there? Biff Bowman : No. What that reflects is what you saw in there disclosures was the full array of products and services that they provided to those clients. There are certain elements of those services that Northern Trust did not acquire if you will or will not be providing. So, we were not providing what you would say was the full three basis points that they disclose value of services, so we did not acquire all of those. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : And we have a question from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Great. Okay, thanks for taking my questions. And congrats to Rick and Mike as well. I mean Mike, a question for you on the \u2013 how you view the competitive position in terms of in the context of the cost save program to what extent do you see a need to spend more expensively in one area versus the other, and specifically where I\u2019m getting at is, is that a servicing in terms of how you\u2019re competitively aligned there versus wealth management do you see of the cost save, do you see more of a need to incrementally spend on growth initiatives in servicing versus wealth management or vice versa? Michael Grady : Sure. So, the first type of investment I would talk about because it runs across all of the businesses is in technology. And how we are investing our technology dollars both to enhance the client experience for each of those businesses but also to be able to provide those services more efficiently, and do so in a much more digital fashion than the way it\u2019s been done historically. And that is a key driver of investment where we get benefits across all of the businesses. And then to your point beyond that, the nature of the investments are different in each of the businesses. If you think about wealth management, again we\u2019re very well positioned with that business primarily in the U.S. but from market-to-market we have different levels of market share if you will. And so if you think about some of the markets that we have not been in as long historically and have lower market penetration, then we need to make the investments in the form of hiring people, marketing, those types of investment dollars. Biff mentioned the gold tournament this past quarter, and that\u2019s an example where we have previous done that on the West Coast. This year it\u2019s been moved out to the New York area, that\u2019s an area that we have lower market share but growing, and an opportunity for us to invest dollars and change the trajectory if you will of the growth rate for wealth management. In asset management, it comes in the form of having to hire new people and develop new products. Again a perfect example of that which we\u2019ve talked about before is our ETF business where going back six years ago was \u2013 didn\u2019t exist but it was launched and now we\u2019re up approximately $15 billion and over 20 ETFs within the flex year\u2019s complex. That does require investments but now sitting here six years from now, that\u2019s an attractive profitable business for us. But it demonstrates what you need to do if you want to be able to do expand in that business and then also comes in the form of distribution for that business. So once we develop the products, how we distribute those both through our existing partner channels if you will, wealth management and C&IS but then also directly to third party investors as well. And then I would say within C&IS, again just thinking about investment a little bit differently as much as the business has grown and expanded I would say organically over the years to the extent that we do want to accelerate that in a particular area whether it\u2019s a product capability or market, we may make the investment in the form of an acquisition. Though UBS again perfect example there of where we\u2019ve deployed approximately $175 million to change the positioning of our business in Luxembourg which is a market we\u2019ve been in for over 10 years and have done nicely but this puts us as a top 10 provider in that market place. So, again, technology across the board and then I would say beyond that it comes in different forms. Brian Bedell : That\u2019s a great color. And maybe just to segway into that, I was going to actually ask about the profitability of the UBS, Biff as you brought that on, is that coming in at margin levels excluding the \u2013 any charges through an operating basis \u2013 margin levels that are similar to your overall franchise. And then you mentioned the idea potentially doing more types of deals, I guess what other areas within asset servicing do you think you might want to expand into the M&A? Michael Grady : Yeah. So, as we talked about, the primary growth opportunity is organic, it\u2019s not to say that we won\u2019t consider additional acquisitions like this but just to be clear on it, we don\u2019t view it as a consolidation type strategy in that business. And to the first part of your question, as Biff mentioned, on an operating business \u2013 operating basis, excuse me, the UBS acquisition is profitable from day one but it is a pretty significant integration that we have over the next several quarters. And as we get the business completely onboard, move off of any transition services agreements, then the profitability is consistent with the rest of our business. Brian Bedell : Got it, got it. Thanks so much. Operator : And we have a question from Betsy Grasic with Morgan Stanley. Michael Grady : Hi Betsy. Betsy Grasic : Hi, I have a question. Just want to follow \u2013 hi. Just want to follow-up on the last question around the integration cost, I know it\u2019s a ticky-tacky question but I think you mentioned $8 million to $10 million coming over the next year. Is that going to fade like a straight line from 3.5 this quarter or do you think that it\u2019s a couple of more quarters around 3.5 when it falls lower levels, I\u2019m just trying how to model that as we\u2019re thinking about our estimates for 2018? Michael Grady : So, the $8 million to $10 million that we described in the fourth quarter includes both integration and direct transaction cost associated with this. So there is, and that\u2019s not backing in the [Inaudible] and others that are directly associated with the close. So the integration expenses from meaningful amount lower math as we said in the last\u2026 Betsy Grasic : Got it. Michael Grady : ...in this quarter was 3.5 and you can probably back out of that $8 million to $10 million whatever you think the transaction of fees were and think about that as a more normalized integration expense run rate. Biff Bowman : Yeah, and Betsy I would say that we\u2019ll \u2013 on the January call we\u2019ll provide an update of what we experience from the fourth quarter and try to break that out for you in better detail. Betsy Grasic : Okay, all right. And then separately, if it\u2019s planning on shrinking the balance sheet a little bit here as we go through the next 12 months, could you give a sense as to whether or not you think that\u2019s going to be impacting your business and how to manage for it? Michael Grady : Yeah. Our current pass view on that is that it \u2013 given the orderly nature of what they\u2019ve described and sort of what I\u2019ll call the incremental approach that they\u2019re taking to the balance shrinkage that the impact should be fairly modest and moderate. So, at this time we don\u2019t think that we\u2019ll have a material impact on either deposit attractiveness or yields in the securities portfolio, not meaningful. Betsy Grasic : And is there an opportunity to potentially reinvest with a little more duration as this fed action comes through, are you seeing a little bit shorter on that, I\u2019m just wondering if there is any yield pickup that we should be expecting overtime? Michael Grady : Yeah, so as we said earlier, we on a regular basis look at ways we can optimize the balance sheet whether that\u2019s through duration or credit or other uses of the balance sheet and we \u2013 we continue to look at that. And if you think you\u2019ve got a raising right environment, whether this is the right time to add duration or not is something we look at very closely. Betsy Grasic : Okay. And then just lastly on flex shares, wondering if you could give us an update on how that\u2019s going and what kind of take up that you\u2019re seeing? Biff Bowman : Yeah, flex shares continues to grow nicely. We\u2019re at about $15 billion now and over 20 different strategies within flex shares. So, going well and I would say continues to be an area of focus for us. Just to remind you, again those are not index oriented directly but rather either factor based or some type of tilt strategy to them. So, we\u2019re not looking for just volume there, it\u2019s what we believe to be strategies that are of interest to the client base that we have. Betsy Grasic : Okay. Okay, thanks so much. Operator : We have a question from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell : Hey good afternoon. Biff, maybe a question on the balance sheet, you think the average positive up about $400 million but the balance sheet was up $2 billion or so or a little more, $2.5 billion. Is that just some odd moving parts or is that part of your deploying capital strategy maybe increase leverage a little bit to \u2013 because that\u2019s a higher return in buybacks. How do we think about the increase in the balance sheet this quarter? Biff Bowman : Yeah. So, it was definitely a deploying capital with some additional discretionary leveraging we do would be deemed I think to be very low risk discretionary leveraging, placing it in typically fit deposits and elsewhere. So, it\u2019s a pretty low risk leveraging strategy but that incremental $2 billion was \u2013 generally we leverage around $3 billion and this quarter we moved it up to closer to $5 billion in the quarter of deploying\u2026 Jim Mitchell : And that should be pretty sustainable. Biff Bowman : Yes. Jim Mitchell : Okay. And then maybe just on the premium amortization, given the kind of the backup in rates of the late, should we expect \u2013 I know there is a bit of lag in terms of how that impacts you\u2019re the NII and then there are some seasonality to, how do we think about fourth quarter on the premium amortization side of rates stay where they are? Biff Bowman : Yeah, historically the fourth quarter has been low and premium amortization. And if you look over the last few years, it\u2019s been the second lowest quarter, the first quarter is typically the lowest. Plus what you described is the macroeconomic factors that are going on right now that would tend to lead us to believe that that will be lower and certainly lower than the third quarter and the fourth quarter. Jim Mitchell : Right. No way to size that\u2026 Biff Bowman : Not \u2013 it might be a little premature to size that at this point but as we get greater clarity on that and have a public forum, we\u2019ll discuss with that. Jim Mitchell : Okay, thanks. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research. Jeffrey Elliott : Hi guys, it\u2019s Elliott from Autonomous, thanks for taking the question. Just operationally, how do you think value for spend is going to compare with driving performance? What are the differences going to be in terms of focus when you\u2019re working on this initiative? Biff Bowman : I\u2019ll start, I\u2019ll let Mike or Rick comment. So when we described driving performance, that was also a $250 million but that was a combination of revenue and expense, and what we described here is expense first of all. So these are all buckets of expense initiatives. This has, as we described sort of three legs to the stool, the productivity, the sourcing and I\u2019ll call it alignment \u2013 organizational alignment, so if you think about this it\u2019s how are we structured and are we efficient in that structure, how do the processes we have to process trades or to complete work operationally, are they optimized, could they automated, could they \u2013 tools like AI robotics assist in that. And then the third leg of where we think we can get after these is in sourcing. An example I would give to you there is manage services. We are looking at outsourcing if you will the management of mainframes and other pieces of our technology. So, inside those three buckets is where we have a series of initiatives. We do have line of sight to those initiatives. And as Mike said it\u2019s \u2013 and Rick said it\u2019s about the execution of those initiatives now. Jeffrey Elliott : And then just back to the comments about expenses tracking in line with organic growth, I guess another way of looking at that is to say, if all the growth you have is organic if markets are flat, then growth is all going to be organic and revenues kind of track in line with expenses and margins stay where they are. Is that the right way to think about it or do you think there would be some scope to [Inaudible] margin improvements in that flat market environment? Michael Grady : Yeah, if you think about that framework, we would like to be able to have organic fee leverage as well to your point, that is a \u2013 we\u2019re not there today if you look at the financials we have. But to your point, if all that we had was organic growth and markets gave us nothing, we would still like to be able to see some organic leverage in that business. This $250 million helps get us to a point or very close to that point of doing that. Hopefully that answers what I think you were trying to get out there Jeffrey. Jeffrey Elliott : Okay, thank you. Michael Grady : Thanks. Operator : The next question is from Mike Mayo, Wells Fargo. Mike Mayo : Hi. I have one very concrete question and one very big picture question. The concrete question is, can you give any earnings guidance for value for spend, I guess there is three choices, one is where we have some of the $250 million of savings for the bottom line in 2018 or 2019. Choice two is you pay as you go, as you get savings you invest or choice three is, you assume a earnings hit as you invest in people, products and technology with a delayed payback. So, should we be increase \u2013 just for value for spend if you can give guidance, were you increasing your estimates keeping them the same or lowering them? Michael Grady : Well, Mike, we don\u2019t give guidance, forward looking guidance on that. So, I appreciate the question but I \u2013 I\u2019m not sure that we can give you guidance as to whether we\u2019re going to increase our numbers or flat or have them decrease as a result of this. So, I\u2019m not trying to dodge it, I just \u2013 we don\u2019t provide that kind of guidance. Mike Mayo : Okay, but should we think of this as, as you get the savings you\u2019ll be investing more in people, products and technology or I guess where I\u2019m really trying to get to is, which external metric should we track, you mentioned that you have some internal metrics like organic fee, ratios and things like that. Externally, I get by 2020 you\u2019re looking to be on the high-end of your ROE target of 10% to 15%, so that\u2019s pretty concrete but what other external metrics should we look at with the external filings? Michael Grady : I think the expense to trust fees is a ratio that we\u2019ll give some clarity as to the improvement we\u2019re making and the success we\u2019re having on this initiative. I think that\u2019s a pretty critical line item for you to measure. Mike Mayo : Okay. And then the big picture question, and correct my numbers, but when I look back a few decades I\u2019m looking for the big picture CEO perspective here. Northern had revenue growth of 13% in the 90s, 6% last decade and 4% to 5% revenue growth this decade. Always exceeding period but certainly a lot less than it was in times past. Is that the backdrop for saying that you want to now have more profitable growth, are you assuming that we\u2019re more in this kind of mid-single digit revenue growth for several years to come? Frederick Waddell : Mike, its Rick. Your history lesson is resonates very well, because I remember the heady 13% days and we \u2013 it\u2019s obviously tracked down lower. But part of that is, the interest rate environment and what we\u2019re saying is, you go through a decade of no changes in interest rates, it affects our revenue growth. All the while we\u2019re trying to manage this growth thing because our \u2013 the markets in wealth and asset servicing and institutional asset management are really, really great markets to be in. Organically they\u2019re terrific and they attract a lot of competitors, so we have to be competitive to operate in those market. So, if you can tell where interest rates are going to be in the next 10 years or where the market will be, it makes our job a lot easier. So, what we\u2019re really saying is we\u2019re trying to get the expense growth rate more in line with those important revenues that we control which are trust fees, broadly speaking. And we think we can grow those trust fees and I can\u2019t \u2013 I mean we\u2019re not going to tell you whether we can grow on that 4%, 5%, 6%, we\u2019ve grown close to double digit this past quarter but there is market in there. But organically we\u2019re trying to find out what that level of trust fee growth is and kind of match off our expenses against that, and that\u2019s the model that we have. Those numbers you gave would include net interest income and lot of other things which again foreign exchange \u2013 the foreign exchange market structurally changed big time, securities lending structurally changed over the last 10 years. So, we have to \u2013 we have to deal with that but we also have to make sure that our expense phase is lined up against these very attractive markets where our trust fees are the most important source of revenue. Mike Mayo : And then lastly the handoff Rick from you to Mike, any nuance changes in style, clearly you\u2019re a part of that decision process and Mike, what should we be looking for that might be a little bit different? Frederick Waddell : Well, I\u2019ll go first. First of all, Mike is a lot taller than I am. So, that\u2019s not very nuance. I\u2019ll say that just, he is very, very smart. He is a Harvard MBA, so he is the numbers guy and I\u2019m the Kellogg MBA, I\u2019m the marketing guy. So, if you want to read Mike a little nuance into that, Mike is different for all the right reasons, and he will bring a fresh set of eye he has. I mean he has been with us since upon 2011 as our CFO and I said that when I gave the job [Inaudible] poor you, you got to follow Mike as the CFO and just doing a great job. But Mike brings a different perspective and he has all the qualities of leadership that I think and the board importantly are important at this company. He is humble, he has low ego, he connects with people and I don\u2019t care whether it\u2019s the CEO of a Fortune 100 company or the teller at downstairs. Mike has an ability to connect with people that is very, very important in our culture and in this organization. So, not so nuance there but that\u2019s how I viewed it and it\u2019s clear how the board viewed it. Mike, you want to add to that? Michael Grady : With all those nice things I probably shouldn\u2019t add anything, but I would say clearly that there are number of things that won\u2019t change. So things like are principles are not going to change, our culture is not going to chance, the strategy has worked extremely well. Now, we look at that strategy on an annual basis and obviously on an ongoing basis through a very robust process but right now as you\u2019ve heard, we think we have the right strategy and we think we have great opportunities and then it comes down to execution. And that\u2019s where I think these differences maybe in either backgrounds or approaches or personalities play through is just how we then execute on that strategy. The last thing I would say is, Rick is obviously been just a tremendous leader through that time period. I think you all recall, his first day was January 1st, 2008 as CEO, so that an interesting time to have to take over a financial institution and took us all the way through this time period. But I would also say, this is a team sport. And so, Rick was leading the team and in the same way the rule that I have going forward is to lead the team and I think we have the best team. Mike Mayo : Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Hi Biff. Biff Bowman : Hi Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Question, you\u2019ve given us good color on your deposits in such on the balance sheet, and you talked a little bit about leverage. What I noticed was that the end of period debt when you look at all of the short-term debt and senior notes, long-term floating rates is up about $4 billion quarter-to-quarter, it\u2019s up over 50% year-over-year. But the average number of course is not up much as you look at the average is. Is this just a short-term strategy or is this something that we should expect to continue at this elevated level which then could, since its expense, vis-a-via your deposits, should we expect some pressure on the margin because of it? Biff Bowman : I think the end of period balance sheet Gerard can move around quite a bit just because of position changes at the end of a quarter or even sometimes at the end of the month. But I wouldn\u2019t necessarily read into that as a launching point for an average on the fourth quarter. Michael Grady : Well, and Gerard, what I would add to that is, the leveraging can move around on any given day, so the followings can \u2013 we can leverage two one day and three and other. So I think you need to probably look at average balance sheet to get a better picture as to what the true picture was in any given period. Gerard Cassidy : Good, okay. And then just as a follow-up, obviously you guys have demonstrated double-digit ROE, you want to push it higher into that 11% to 15% range. If we see mid-single digit operating expense growth on a go-forward basis, can you still get to a mid \u2013 13%, 14%, 15% type of ROE? Michael Grady : If our expenses are calibrated to our organic growth rate and with some leverage in there, yes, because we think overtime markets and other income sources will drive that right, if we have rising rates to drive the NII and then we have the leverage that we\u2019re talking about with fees, the answer is we think we can continue to drive the ROE higher towards the \u2013 as we said in our prepared remarks, towards the higher end of the range. And the efficiencies we get \u2013 yeah. Gerard Cassidy : I got you, okay, great. Thank you. Operator : And we have a question from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Vivek Juneja : Hi. Biff, your comment about the $250 million going back to the value for spend, the investment spend that\u2019s required for that, how should we think about that and would that offset part of this $250 million in the initial years? Because you said it would be \u2013 the $250 million would come equally, that\u2019s the savings. Is that net of the investment spend or, and so is even the savings going to be net of the investment spend and if so, how are you going to get to work that with that all of the investment that you need for the automation and the digitization that completely offset in each year? Biff Bowman : So we do think about the net impact of this overtime but the expense and the investments and the savings may not all be perfectly matched in the same quarters and/or periods. You\u2019re absolutely right, there will be some investments to unlock some of the savings that we\u2019ve talked about and that can come in the form of technological investment capital that can come in the form of potentially if there is charges needed in some cases to get that run rate right. So those expenses are being calibrated in and how we think about our overall financial position. So there will be some investment, they may not always match perfectly with the economic savings that you see in terms of the same period but as we managed just over a three year program or a three year set of initiatives, we do believe that the investment needed to drive the $250 million is been calibrated into our financial. Thank you. Vivek Juneja : Okay. So that means when you\u2019re talking about expense growth matching organic revenue growth, you\u2019re talking about it over the sort of three year time period recognizing that there could be a little ups and downs? Michael Grady : Yeah, exactly. It\u2019ll effect the timing of the realization of the benefits there, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s not just a smooth progression because of the investment expenses and otherwise as Biff just mentioned. Vivek Juneja : Okay, it makes sense Mike. One more thing, shifting gears completely, deposits, going back to that topic. Did \u2013 was there a little pickup in the outflows in non-interest bearing deposits in the third quarter, I recognized not to \u2013 either you said, don\u2019t look at period end balance sheets but that decline was faster in the third quarter in the period end basis than second quarter. Is that just an recognition that where the rates are going you\u2019ve seen a little pickup there? Michael Grady : Yeah, the outflow of from interest bearing \u2013 from non-interest bearing to interest bearing slowed between the second and third quarters. We had about $3 billion in the second quarter and I think we had a $1.8 billion in this quarter, so it actually on average slowed somewhat so\u2026 Vivek Juneja : But what about period end? Biff Bowman : Yeah, again the period end is, I would say it\u2019s tough to look at the period end balance sheet. Like what we might be doing with our balance sheet, clients as well are positioning deposits with us at period end. Michael Grady : Yeah. Biff Bowman : So, I would say that I wouldn\u2019t use it as a launch point but there was a \u2013 from the second quarter, the clients that we had that that alone had an impact on the average for the third quarter as well just like what we saw during the third quarter that now come out on July 1st, so there would be a potential residual impact that carries into the fourth quarter as well. Vivek Juneja : Okay, all right. Thank you. Operator : And we will take our final question of the day from Jeff Harte with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Michael Grady : Hi Jeff. Jeff Harte : Hey guys. A couple of things, one, the tax rate. How should we be thinking about the tax rate in the way of Illinois July hike and the UBS acquisition closing? Michael Grady : Yeah. So, the change in the Illinois tax rate in the period, in the third quarter we have to be threw up our differed tax position, and as we call it out that was $4.3 million. The ongoing impact from the Illinois income tax rate is relatively modest for us, even though we\u2019re headquartered here, our revenue is really earned across the country and across the globe. So the income tax impact of that rate rise is relatively modest for us in the Illinois state income tax rate. We did have to threw up as we said the differed tax position this quarter but that was a onetime tax threw up. In terms of the overall tax rate, we continue to \u2013 you saw that we had research tax credits in this quarter, we continue to look at ways to bet tax efficient. The UBS again, I don\u2019t think that transaction in and of itself will have a meaningful on our overall effective income tax rate. Jeff Harte : Okay. And just looking at net interest margin, given the seasonal volatility of premium amortization which seems to be somewhat unique to Northern Trust. Is it overly simplistic to add back the $19 million of premium amortization which is something close to seven basis points of NIM and kind of figure our starting point head against to the fourth quarter and was something like a 136 basis points to which we can kind of make adjustments for the environment? Biff Bowman : We have seen the premium amortization on a \u2013 if you were to look at it over the long run rate of it, of fourth quarter run rate, you\u2019re probably looking at a normalized level of $10 million to $12 million depending on the size of the portfolio. So that might be one way of looking at if you were going to try to rebase the margin by taking the difference between the $10 million to $12 million and the $9 million. Michael Grady : And the volatility Jeff that we see at Northern in premium amortization, when we have the January earnings call beginning in 2018, we\u2019re going to change our approach to premium amortization. And it should produce less volatility in that between quarters. Jeff Harte : Okay, great. Thank you. Michael Grady : Thanks. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to hand the call back to our speakers for any concluding remarks. Frederick Waddell : It\u2019s Rick, I just say thank you all very much for supporting Northern your interest and your continued involvement with the company. And we are as Mike said, we\u2019re extraordinarily well positioned and we look forward to keeping you informed of our progress into 2018. It\u2019s been a lot of fun. Thanks. Operator : And once again, that does conclude today\u2019s conference. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Let me turn the call over to Biff Bowman. Biff Bowman : Good morning, everyone. Let me join Mark in welcoming you to our fourth quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Starting on page two of our quarterly earnings review presentation. This morning, we reported fourth quarter net income of $356.6 million, earnings per share were $1.51, and our return on common equity was 15.1%. As noted on the second page of our earnings release, this quarter's results included a net $53.1 million tax benefit associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, a $12.9 million expense related to special onetime employee cash bonuses paid in connection with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and $17.6 million charge associated with severance related and restructuring charges. This is also the first quarter which includes the impact from our acquisition of UBS Asset Management\u2019s, fund administration unit in Luxemburg and Switzerland. The quarter included $21.1 million in fee revenue and $24.2 million in expense, which was inclusive of integration and transaction expense. In regards to our effective tax rate following tax reform, we currently expect our ongoing effective tax rate to be approximately 23% to 24%. Of course, it should be noted that a number of factors can and do impact our effective tax rate from quarter-to-quarter. Before going through our results in detail, I would note that macro factors impacting our business and clients during the quarter were generally positive. Both domestic and global equity markets were favorable. Short-term interest rates continued to increase during the quarter, driven by rate hikes from both the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, during the quarter. Currency rates influence the translation of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar and therefore impact client assets and certain revenues and expenses. The British pound and euro ended the quarter up 9% and 14%, respectively versus the prior year as compared to the U.S. dollar. On a sequential basis, the British pound and euro also strengthened. The strengthening of these currencies compared to the U.S. dollar favorably impacted revenue but had an unfavorable impact on our expense. Let\u2019s move to page three and review the financial highlights of the fourth quarter. Year-over-year, revenue increased 16% with non-interest income up 14% and net interest income up 20%. Expenses increased 15% from last year. The provision for credit losses was a credit of $13 million. Net income including the tax benefit associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was 34% higher year-over-year. In the sequential comparison, revenue was up 6% with non-interest income up 5% and net interest income up 8%. Expenses were up 7% compared to the prior quarter. Net income was 19% higher sequentially, including the tax benefit. Return on average common equity was at 15.1% for the quarter, up from 11.9% one year ago and up from 12.2% in the prior quarter. The return on average common equity during the quarter benefited by approximately 1.5% from the tax benefit net of the expenses associated with severance and one-time bonuses. Assets under custody/administration of $10.7 trillion increased 26% compared to one year ago and 11% on a sequential basis. Included in assets under custody/administration is $568 million relating to the acquisition of UBS Asset Management fund administration units in Luxembourg and Switzerland. Assets under custody of $8.1 trillion increased 20% compared to one year ago and 4% on a sequential basis. For both the year-over-year and sequential comparisons, favorable market impacts, strong new business and favorable moves and currency exchange rates were the drivers. Assets under management were $1.2 trillion, up 23% year-over-year and up 3% on a sequential basis. The year-over-year and the sequential increases were primarily driven by favorable markets and net new business flows. Let\u2019s look at the results in greater detail, starting with revenue on page four. Fourth quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $1.4 billion, up a 16% from last year and up 6% sequentially. Excluding the acquisition, revenue was up 14% from last year and up 5% sequentially. The favorable translation impact of changes in the currency rates benefited year-over-year revenue growth by approximately 1%. Trust, investment and other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue and were $910 million in the fourth quarter, up 15% year-over-year and up 5% from the prior quarter. Excluding the acquisition, fees were up 12% year-over-year and up 2% sequentially. Foreign exchange trading income was $63 million in the fourth quarter, up 8% year-over-year and up 28% sequentially. The increases were primarily due to higher volumes. Other non-interest income was $72 million in the fourth quarter, up 11% compared to one year ago and down 3% sequentially. This increase from one year ago was primarily driven by a loss in our lease portfolio in last year\u2019s result. The sequential decline was primarily due to lower net hedge related income, partially offset by higher security commissions and trading income. Net interested income, which I will discuss in more detail later, was $396 million in the fourth quarter, increasing 20% year-over-year and up 8% sequentially. Let\u2019s look at the components of our trust and investment fees on page five. For our corporate and institutional services business, fees totaled $533 million in the fourth quarter, up 17% year-over-year and up 6% on sequential basis. The quarter included $21.1 million in fees relating to the acquisition UBS Asset Management's fund administration business in Luxemburg and Switzerland. Excluding the acquisition, C&IS fees were up 12% compared to the prior year and up 2% sequentially.  Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees were $369 million, up 22% compared to the prior year and up 9% sequentially. This line does include the acquisition-related fees. Excluding the acquisitions, fees were up 15% compared to the prior year and up 3% sequentially. Both increases were driven by strong net new business, favorable markets and a benefit in currency exchange rates. Assets under custody and administration for C&IS clients were $10.1 trillion at quarter-end, up 26% year-over-year and 11% sequentially. These results include $568 billion relating to the UBS fund administration acquisition. Excluding the acquisition, the increases primarily reflect favorable markets, new business and the benefit of the moves in currency exchange rates. Recall that lagged market values factor into the quarter\u2019s fees with both quarter lag and month lag markets impacting our C&IS custody and fund administration fees. Investment management fees in C&IS of $106 million in the fourth quarter were up 13% year-over-year and up 2% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential comparisons were primarily driven by favorable markets and net new business flows. Assets under management of C&IS clients were $871 billion, up 26% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Favorable market impacts and net new business were the drivers of the year-over-year growth while the sequential growth was driven by favorable markets. Securities lending fees were $25 million in the fourth quarter, flat with the prior year and up 11% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, higher volumes were offset by lower spreads. For the sequential comparison, higher volumes were partially offset by lower spreads. Securities lending collateral was $168 billion at quarter-end and averaged $173 billion across the quarter. Average collateral levels increased 45% year-over-year and 16% sequentially. The growth in volumes compared to year ago was driven by demand for U.S. treasuries. The sequential volume increase was driven by U.S. treasuries and U.S. equities. Other fees in C&IS were $33 million in the fourth quarter, down 4% year-over-year and down 9% sequentially. The year-over-year decline reflects lower sub-advisor fees, partially offset by higher fees from investment risk and analytical services. The sequential decline was primarily attributable to lower sub-advisor fees. This decline in sub-advisor fees has corresponding impact within expenses and the outside services category. Moving to our wealth management business. Trust investment and other servicing fees were $377 million in the fourth quarter, up 12% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Within wealth management, the global family office business had strong performance with fees increasing 17% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Each of the regions also performed well during the quarter. Across global family office and each of the regions, both the year-over-year and sequential growth was driven by favorable markets and new business. Assets under management for wealth management clients were $290 billion at quarter-end, up 17% year-over-year and up 2% sequentially. Moving to page six. Net interest income was $396 million in the fourth quarter, up 20% year-over-year. Earning assets averaged $113 billion in the fourth quarter, up 4% versus last year. Total deposits averaged $97 billion and were up 3% year-over-year. Interest bearing deposits increased 11% from one year ago to $76 billion. This growth was partially offset by an 18% decline in non-interest bearing deposits which averaged $21 billion during the fourth quarter. Loan balances averaged $33 billion in the fourth quarter and were down 2% compared to one year ago. The net interest margin was 1.39% in the fourth quarter and was up 19 basis points from a year ago. The improvement in net interest margin compared to the prior year primarily reflects the impact of higher short-term interest rates, partially offset by the change in mix of our balance sheet. On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income was up $30 million or 8%. Average earning assets increased 1% sequentially, funded by increases in interest bearing deposits and short-term borrowings, partially offset by a slight decline in non-interest bearing deposits. On a sequential basis, the net interest margin increased 10 basis points with the benefit of higher short-term interest rates and lower premium amortization being partially offset by the change in mix of our balance sheet. Net interest income for the quarter included $4 million sequential benefit due to the accounting for certain tax advantaged investments. This benefit was offset in the fully taxable equivalent line. Looking at the currency mix of our balance sheet. For the fourth quarter, U.S. dollar deposits represented 70% of our total deposits, this compared to 74% one year ago, but was in line with where we were in the prior quarter. Premium amortization was zero in the fourth quarter, compared to $10 million one year ago, and $19 million in the third quarter. As we have discussed, previously beginning with 2018, we are shifting our remaining life assumption methodology for premium amortization, which will lead to a more consistent quarterly amount that we would expect to be within the $10 million to $12 million range. In this first quarter that we change over to the new method, there is a one-time true-up to align the remaining amortization. We currently expect this one-time true-up to result in additional amortization of $10 million to $13 million, bringing the overall expected premium amortization in the first quarter to a range of $20 million to $25 million. Turning to page seven. Expenses were $1 billion in the fourth and were 15% higher than the prior year and 7% higher sequentially. As previously mentioned and as outlined on the second page of our earnings release, the current quarter included $24.2 million in expense associated with the acquisition. As outlined earlier, the current quarter also included $30.5 million in expense associated with severance and other charges, as well as the special one-time employee cash bonus. In the prior quarter, we had $7 million of severance and personnel charges. Excluding both the acquisition and called out expense items, expense for the quarter was 8% higher than a year ago and 2% higher sequentially. Now, keeping to total non-interest expense, I would like to decompose those growth rates further. Starting with the adjusted 8% year-over-year increase, approximately 1.5 points of growth was from the unfavorable translation impact of changes in currency rates, primarily the British pound and euro, which strengthened versus the U.S. dollar by 9% and 14%, respectively. Excluding currency impact, therefore, our year-over-year expense growth rate was approximately 6.5%. Of the remaining increase in year-over-year expense growth, following items were key drivers within the categories. Compensation was higher, driven by staff growth, base pay adjustments from April of this year, and higher cash-based incentive accrual. Benefits was higher, primarily due to an increase in medical costs and higher payroll taxable withholding compared to the prior year. Occupancy-related costs were higher compared to the prior year, due to accelerated depreciation related to a previously announced facility exit in one of our Chicago locations and a onetime provision relating to our London location. Equipment and software expense was up year-over-year due to the higher software amortization and equipment depreciation. Outside service costs were higher, driven primarily by sub-custody and technical services including market data costs, partially offset by lower consulting and sub-advisor expenses. And other operating expenses was higher due to increases in certain miscellaneous expense categories, partially offset by lower business promotion and staff-related costs. Shifting to the sequential expense view. As I mentioned, excluding the acquisition, the expense charges in both the current and prior quarter and the impact of onetime bonuses, expenses increased 2% from the prior quarter with compensations, benefits and occupancy costs being the principal drivers. Compensation was higher due to the higher cash-based incentive accruals and higher salaries from staff growth; benefits were higher sequentially primarily due to higher medical costs; and occupancy related costs were higher sequentially primarily due to the Chicago and London occupancy actions I highlighted in the year-over-year explanation. Elsewhere, outside service costs were down sequentially, primarily relating to the lower sub-advisor cost. The decline in these costs had a direct offset in lower C&IS other trust fees. Other operating expense declined from the prior period, primarily due to the lower business promotional spend due to the third quarter Northern Trust-sponsored golf event. This decline was partially offset by higher miscellaneous expense within the category. Staff levels increased approximately 6% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. The growth includes the addition of approximately 230 partners as a result of the acquisition. The remainder of the growth was all attributable staff increases and lower cost locations which include India; Manila; Limerick, Ireland; and Tempe, Arizona. Turning to the full year, our results in 2017 are summarized on page eight. Net income was $1.2 billion, up 16% compared with 2016 and earnings per share were $4.92, up 14% compared with the prior year. On the right margin of this page, we outlined the non-recurring impacts that were called out for both years. For 2017, this includes the fourth quarter net tax benefit of $53.1 million as well as $60.3 million in expense items, which includes the onetime employee bonuses and severance and restructuring charges. The third quarter also included a tax benefit of $17.6 million related to federal and state research tax credits. For 2016, this includes a net revenue impact of $96.6 million while the expense related charges were a total of $82.6 million. We achieved the return on equity for the year of 12.6%. This performance was within our target range of 10% to 15% and an improvement from our 2016 performance of 11.9%. Full year revenue and expense trends are outlined on page nine. Trust, investment and other servicing fees grew 10% in 2017. Favorable markets and new business across segments and geographies contributed to this result. Foreign exchange trading income declined 11%, primarily reflecting lower volatility across the year compared to the prior year. Other non-interest income was down 21% from last year, but up 7% if adjusted for the items I called out on the prior page. Net interest income increased 17%. The growth in net interest income was primarily driven by higher short-term interest rates coupled with earnings asset growth. The net result was 9% growth in overall revenue on a reported basis in 2017 and 11% excluding the 2016 items I called out on the prior page. On a reported basis, expenses were up 9% from the prior year. Adjusting for the expense charges in both 2016 and 2017 that I mentioned in the prior pages, expenses were also up 9% from 2016, reflecting investments in staffing and technology to support the growth of the business, as well as to comply with evolving regulatory requirements. Turning to page 10. A key focus has been on sustainably enhancing profitability and returns. This slide reflects the progress we have made in recent years to improve the expense to fee ratio, pretax margin and ultimately our return on equity. The ratio of expenses to trust and investment fees is a particularly important measure of our progress as it addresses what we can most directly control. Reducing this measure from where it was previously, as high as a 131 in 2011, to the levels we see today is a key contributor to the improvement in our return on equity. Turning to page 11. Our capital ratios remained very strong with common equity Tier 1 ratios of 13.5% and 12.6%, respectively, calculated on a transition basis for both advanced and standardized approaches. On a fully phased-in basis, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the advanced approach would be approximately 13.3% and under the standardized approach would be approximately 12.4%. All of these ratios are well above the fully phased-in requirement of 7% which includes the capital conservation buffer. The supplementary leverage ratio at the corporation was 6.8% and at the bank was 6.1%, both of which exceed the 3% requirement, which is applicable in Northern Trust in 2018. With respect to the liquidity coverage ratio, Northern Trust is above the 100% minimum requirement became effective at the start of 2017. As Northern Trust progresses through fully phased-in Basel III implementation, there could be additional enhancements to our models and further guidance from the regulators on the implementation of the final rule which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final Basel III rules. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.8 million shares of common stock at a cost of $171 million. We remain focused on our value for spend initiative. As we highlighted on our third quarter call, we are focused on realigning our expense base in the short-term. Expenses throughout the Company with an emphasis on non-client facing functions are under review. A portfolio of initiatives will support profitable growth by permanently taking expense out of our operating model. We expect to realize $250 million in expense run rate savings by 2020. Through these efforts, we expect to slow our expense growth to be more closely aligned with our organic fee growth. We will begin to provide more specific updates on our progress beginning with our first quarter earnings. Let me provide you some examples of actions that we have been taking which demonstrate our commitment to the value for spend initiative. Over the last three quarters, we have taken severance and restructuring charges of $47 million. On a combined basis, these charges will create approximately $35 million in annualized net savings, and we expect these savings to be fully realized by the first quarter of 2019. Within our technology group, we are in the process of moving to a managed services approach for certain technology services. Select support services are in the process of transitioning to new third-party vendors, while Northern Trust retains infrastructure engineering, application development and core architecture functions. Through these efforts, we will have enhanced alignment and flexibility for our global operating model as well as better optimized use to partner skills, knowledge and experience. In closing, in 2017, we continued to grow the firm profitably for our shareholders, deliver comprehensive solutions for our clients, and improve our technology and infrastructure to support the sustainability of our momentum. From a financial perspective, we delivered a return on average common equity of 12.6% for the full year, moving further into our target range of 10% to 15% and we produced a $1.2 billion of net income. In addition, we returned $196 million to our common shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases, while maintaining strong capital and liquidity ratios. Our C&IS business continued to demonstrate strong growth during the year. We closed on the acquisition of UBS Asset Management's fund administration units in Luxemburg and Switzerland, which further underpins our growth strategy in Continental Europe. In wealth management, we continued to grow the business and build out our goals-driven approach, while continuing to produce attractive margins, achieving a 40% pretax margin for the year. We were also pleased to be named the best private bank in the U.S. by the Financial Times Group for the 8th time in the last nine years. In asset management, we surpassed $1 trillion in assets under management during the year. We continue to see significant growth in our strategic offerings such as FlexShares, our exchange traded fund family. FlexShares assets ended the year at $16 billion, representing growth of 37% for the year and a doubling of assets since the end of 2015. As we move into 2018, we are confident in our competitive positioning and as well as our focus on profitably growing our business. Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust fourth quarter earnings conference call, today. Mark and I would be happy to answer your questions. Hanna, please open the line. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Mike Carrier of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Mike Carrier : Hi. Thanks guys. Hey, Biff. Maybe first question, just you mentioned the tax guidance. But, when we think about maybe uses whether it's from an expense standpoint or capital priorities, has anything changed given that you're operating at that lower rate? And on the flip side, you guys have been investing quite a bit over the past years and you\u2019re focused on the value for spend, but I just want to frame that dynamic with the lower tax benefit and how much you expect to drop to the bottom line? Biff Bowman : Thanks. I appreciate it, Mike. Tax reform is expected to be meaningfully beneficial to our firm and its shareholders and that it will favorably impact our financial performance. It does allow us to grow, as you said, and it does allow us to reinvest in our business and our people and our communities in which we operate. What it doesn\u2019t do, what the tax change doesn\u2019t do is it doesn\u2019t alter our strategic focus on profitable growth, our value for spend initiative, and quite frankly, driving more leverage into our business. That is our focus; that is the strategy of the firm. If we accomplish that, if we continue to drive more leverage into our business and we increase the profitability as a result of that and we apply the lower tax rate you just cited, that should lead to much improved returns for our shareholders. But, all other constituent groups may benefit from that as well. But, certainly, as I outlined, it will drive more profitable growth for the firm. Mike Carrier : And then, just follow-up on net interest income. You mentioned the benefit in the quarter in the lower premium amortization. Just when we think about going forward, given the organic growth of the Company, what you think you can kind of grow from the deposit coming in? And then, also, where you think about managing the capital ratios, how should we be thinking about that going into 2018-2019, like both those dynamics? Obviously, the rate environment is where it is and deposit betas seem like those have been trending in line with expectations. But just, how to be thinking about more the balance sheet growth with the capital ratios? Biff Bowman : Sure. There is a couple of questions in there. One, if I look at the balance sheet and I look at the net interest income and the NIM as we exited the year, it is a reasonable basis to establish next year\u2019s thought process for all of you. But, I want to put a few caveats or a few explanations around that and both a balance of positive influencing factors and some that could be drags. You cited one and it\u2019s positive or a negative, it depends on how betas unfold during the course of the year. To your point, if we look at our betas over a 12-month period from sort of fourth quarter of 2016 to fourth quarter of 2017. On the institutional side, they\u2019re obviously a bit higher but in line with what competitors have talked about, generally. On the wealth side, they have been low over that period, but we did see with the most recent hike, some increase in the beta on the retail side, really for the first time. So, how the betas unfold next year is important. We have seen some increase, but we have also seen some discipline in the rates of those increases. So, we\u2019ll have to observe how those unfold and make sure that our -- we\u2019re aligned with the competitive landscape. As you also said the, right now, our betas, if you look across wealth and institutional combined, they\u2019re generally -- our beta for the last year is under 50%. So, there is still the ability for NIM expansion in the franchise, if that holds true and the betas rise at a regular type range. Obviously, the balance sheet size and the balance sheet mix are also key components of that factor that you just talked about. We have had and if you\u2019ve seen, our organic growth rate is pretty high. That often comes with deposits, liabilities. And as such, you\u2019ve seen our balance sheet grow in that 4% to 5% range. So, we don\u2019t give forward guidance, but we do anticipate having 4% to 5% type organic growth rate, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve historically cited to you as our growth rate. That produces some balance sheet expansion. But, the mix could shift between non-interest bearing and interest bearing, and so we have to watch that and as we go forward. So, I think there is a fair balance between positives and negatives on how the balance sheet could go, but we do think there is still the potential for NIM expansion and NII growth as we look at that. The second part of your question was around capital and the current capital process. And I think it's fair to say right now that we're entering the CCAR cycle. We have a robust process to evaluate our capital position, what we need for growth, what we need to be safe under stress, and then what are the best uses of that capital; is it to return it our shareholders or to put it to work in other phases. We're in the early stages of that for CCAR right now. We've got that process. The only thing I would say is we have the flexibility to be thoughtful in that process, given our capital strength that we -- as measured by say CET1 right now. We've got that pretty good flexibility as we enter that cycle. Operator : We'll go next to Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : Hi. Thanks very much. I wonder if we could talk about the acquired UBS business for a sec. I'm just curious what you can tell us about the mix of business and profitability thereof. I noticed on the revenue side, it looks like 1.5 basis points versus 2 basis points for Northern and overall, but I don't know if that's really a good apples-to-apples comparison. And then, of the $24 million in expenses this quarter, what would you consider ongoing versus integration-related, so we can just get a glimpse of profitability? Thank you. Biff Bowman : Yes, sure. Let me take the mix question first and I'll let Mark talk to you about the ongoing expenses. But, if you think about that mix, the 1.5 basis points that you talked about, this is a pure fund administration type business and does not have a custody piece to it. So, comparing that to a more blended C&IS portfolio probably can produce different dynamics. There is obviously different product components in those items. And so, I would be hesitant to tell you that that's a perfect assessment. I think, you've got to do a little bit more of a blend across. And even that 1.5 basis points may not be indicative of other fund administration business in different geographies, because they have different dynamics in different regions. So, the way I think of that is the mix matters here and the business profile matters. And this is a pure fund administration capability here with no custody aligned to it. And Mark, if you want to add? Mark Bette : Yes. On the expenses, the $24 million, about $7.5 million of that was integration. We would say though, as you look at the $21 million in fees and $24 million in expense as far as we enter 2018, there will be integration activities that are going on throughout 2018. So, both of those are probably fairly good run rates, as you think about building off of the fourth quarter. Glenn Schorr : Okay, I appreciate that. One quickie on wealth management. There has been some changes to the broker protocol on the broker dealer side of wealth management. It usually wouldn't have much of an impact on Northern. But, I guess my question is, what are you doing to help drive organic growth in wealth management, both in your current client base and then in terms of attracting and growing new relationship managers? Biff Bowman : So, my first part of that is, you\u2019re right. We don\u2019t really have a brokerage-led model. So, some of the nuance that you discussed there is less applicable to us. We do have the capability but it\u2019s not the core, it's more of a fiduciary-led type model that we have in our wealth management front. In terms of growing that franchise, I think there has been significant investment in time in our goals driven investing, comprehensive approach to the wealth profile of our clients. And we\u2019ve seen tremendous growth and take up in that business or that capability and approach, if I could say that. And as you could see in the growth rates in our wealth management business with double-digit fee growth and double-digit fee growth for the year in that business, while maintaining 40% margins, we\u2019ve been very pleased with what we\u2019ve seen in that. And then, in terms of attracting talent, it is a competitive landscape but we do believe that the Northern Trust brand is an important differentiator in attracting that talent, as is the fiduciary kind of based model, I think in some cases versus a more transactional based model. So, it\u2019s competitive out there but we think the brand and the performance shows we're still very focused on that business, and it had a strong performance this year. Operator : We will go next to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Couple of questions, one is on the acquisition. Was there any balance sheet impact from that? Biff Bowman : No. There is none. Betsy Graseck : And then, you did have end-of-period, noninterest bearing deposits grow up nicely. I think on average base, it was down but EOP was up. Is that something you think can persist as we go through the next couple of quarters here? Biff Bowman : I would say unlikely. Our balance sheet end-of-period quite frankly can have very onetime or transactional oriented balances in that. I think it\u2019s probably better for you to look at the average balance sheet over the period. We did still see that noninterest bearing deposits essentially were flat sequentially, I think they were down $300 million. And as we tried to outline on the last call, if we look at that balance, about 21 billion, about three quarters of it we think is -- we've got pretty good line of sight and it\u2019s traditionally been fairly stable. It\u2019s that last order or about $5 billion that we keep regular tests on to see how interest rate sensitivity it is. It didn\u2019t move. So, we do think that it has a sticky component to it in a rate-sensitive environment but it\u2019s that quarter that we keep regular tabs on. This quarter, it remained fairly stable. Betsy Graseck : Got it, okay. And then, you talked little bit about increasing the leverage in the business model over time and the funding side of that. Could you speak a little bit to how you're thinking about stack rank, any opportunities on the deployment side? Biff Bowman : On the capital deployment side? Betsy Graseck : Correct. Biff Bowman : Yes. So, we do look at a balance of dividend and stock buyback. We're in interesting period of time for that evaluation. If you look historically, our dividend payout ratio has been around the mid-30s with the reminder of our payout coming in the form traditionally in stock buybacks. We\u2019re in the process of evaluating the current environment we\u2019re in. We\u2019re looking at what we think is the maximum ability to -- excuse me, the maximum performance for our shareholders in that mix. And we\u2019re early start into the process of CCAR working with our Board and others. But, we do think about the dividend payout levels versus stock buyback in this environment very closely. And more to come on that as we go through our process and we get feedback from our Board and our regulator. Betsy Graseck : Okay. I get that. It\u2019s -- and just kicking off CCAR period here. But when we think back, some this has been seen for a while, we think back to before the 2008, 2009 period, your dividend payout was 40% north of that. So, I\u2019m just wondering if that\u2019s at all in the mix on expectations over the next year or two. I know, you can\u2019t comment on that. But that\u2019s background to the question. Biff Bowman : Thank you. Understood. Yes. Betsy Graseck : Yes. And then, just lastly on the FX revenues, really strong quarter, especially relative to peers. I know you mentioned that you took share. Could you just give us a senses to drivers for that, especially given the volatility is relatively low? Biff Bowman : Yes. Thank you. Our strong performance in FX trading was driven by higher volumes, which can be unique to a client base or a client portfolio versus other competitors in any period. But, it was also -- it included a higher level of swap activity. We have regular balance sheet management activities where we look at opportunities to place excess cash on a hedge basis. And in this quarter, as a part of that normal balance sheet management, we did see a greater level of benefit than we typically do from sort of this FX swap hedging that we do in our treasury balance sheet. That in any typical quarter can produce low to $4 million or so of FX of our total FX. This quarter, it was probably $4 million to $6 million higher than that normal run rate that I talked about because of those swap opportunities that we saw, that may continue into the quarter. There is a bit of an offset to that. So, that helped drive a little bit more than half of the sequential increase you saw in FX with sort of the normal balance sheet treasury activities. There is a bit of an offset of that, because we take cash out, in this case out of dollars and swap them into sterling and euro. And so, you would have had some reduction in net interest income as we were putting those in lower yielding central bank. But, the offset was the swap FX income in this, which ended up being a positive trade for the bank. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Maybe to circle back on the deposit beta. I think you mentioned in the wealth management division, Biff, since the December hike, you did see an uptick. Can you quantify that as we move into the first quarter? I mean, obviously, your fourth quarter deposit betas were pretty low. But as we look at the trajectory coming into 1Q, can you give us a sort of a sense of maybe how much of those rates, deposit rates have gone up, I guess for January or the trajectory into 1Q? Biff Bowman : Yes. On our wealth management side, the betas remain low. But we establish a review and we look at a certain subset of our competitors in the wealth space. We target to stay within a certain range of that competitive landscape for our depositors, maybe sometimes at a premium or a discount to that, but we got a set of competitors that we view. So that beta will depend to some degree on how the competitive landscape unfolds in that space. As you rightly said, throughout 2017 that beta remained low. We did see, again, in December, we did see some increase in the beta. But still -- if you looked at it on a yearly basis, at a really pretty low level in the wealth side. I don't know, I can't forecast how that will unfold during 2018 and kind of how that competitive landscape moves. But we've done very disciplined with that approach. Brian Bedell : And these would be wealth management peers, other private banks plus the warehouses as well? Biff Bowman : Yes. So, broad based basket of competitors. Yes, absolutely. Brian Bedell : And then, just back to the spending both the value and spend program. As you think about tax reform, as we sort of go through the year on tax reform and I guess, what would be your view on -- obviously, I heard you -- continue to focus on profitable growth. But, as you think about the timing of that and the willingness to spend on some initiatives that might have some upfront expenses for some very strong long-term benefits. How do you think about that as we move to 2018 and what we should be thinking about for the expense to trust fee ratio, which did come down nicely this quarter, down to the 107 or 106 ex the bonus? Maybe some color on that. Biff Bowman : Yes. As you said, we are focused on driving that expense to fee ratio further down. But not completely -- if there are opportunities out there to actually improve that ratio, but require expense but can improve the expense to fee ratio by driving the fee line harder or faster, we obviously evaluate those on a regular basis. And I'm not really sure that the tax reform is going to impact how we think about that. Those are decisions that we think about in our business at its core. We do and we talked to you with our value for spend, we are striving and working hard to improve the expense to fee ratio during the course of the year. That doesn't mean that our normal business model does produce enough internal income, if you will, to reinvest in our business. And it doesn't always require additional returns from taxes or whatever to do that. It's a business model that produces enough to invest internally. So, that's how we think about it. I think if we were sitting around the table, we would say that the tax reform is beneficial in the sense that we\u2019re going to pay 7, 8 points, based on the range I gave you, less than our current effective tax rate, and that\u2019s a benefit at all levels. But we still need to drive more leverage into the business, strategically and from an execution standpoint and we\u2019re committed to it. Brian Bedell : And longer term, do you see the competitive environment changing because of tax reform outside of you in terms of pricing and other companies\u2019 willingness to spend. Biff Bowman : That\u2019s a good point. The one -- we\u2019re in the early innings of tax reform. I think we have to assess what others do with the financial benefits. And if pricing changes in our industry or investment changes in our industry, we will absorb that. That\u2019s why the view of probably early into this that in -- the returns from the tax benefit will probably flow -- will increase profitability. But boy, the competitive landscape, we have to see how it unfolds. We\u2019re three weeks into tax reform right now and have to see how the discipline and approach is taken by other institutions. Operator : We will go next to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Biff, if I could be more little more technical on the expense question. So, if you had 6.5% kind of core expense growth this year, what would you say the organic fee growth was this year? Biff Bowman : So, we had 10% fee growth and I think the range was probably about half was organic. So, the way we think about it is, if we're 5% organic, our organic expenses were probably like you said close to 6.5%, we\u2019re not generating positive organic fee leverage. And that\u2019s why value for spend and still continued focus on expense discipline. Ken Usdin : And that\u2019s really my question, then. So, accepting that as yesteryear and now moving forward, if you expect organic fee growth to still be in that four to five range as you expected before, is that where we should expect the range of core expense growth to be and would that be inclusive of any incremental restructuring charges you take? Biff Bowman : So, I think that we've said last time that we\u2019re trying to drive positive fee, organic fee leverage. So that\u2019s where we're trying to get. So, what you just describe is what we publically said we want to try to drive organic fee leverage. And we remain focused on that. The second part again\u2026 Mark Bette : Is that inclusive of charges? Biff Bowman : Is that inclusive of charges? As it relates to charges, I would say it is not inclusive of charges in our 2018 thinking. And while we don\u2019t give guidance, right now there will be the need for some charges. We think they are largely in line with the magnitude of the charges you saw in 2017. They might fluctuate a little bit from that. So, on a year on year basis that won\u2019t create much of the growth that you just described. But, we're in a process here where that could change, if we see the right opportunities, but that\u2019s where we\u2019re right now. Ken Usdin : Okay. So, I'm still just trying to get to the can you commit to that fee operating leverage, regardless? But then also can you help us understand next year\u2019s growth rate also will have the full year of UBS and can you help us understand what that would be plus the Omnium purchase? So, the rest of the tech would -- how much of that would add incrementally, if separate from the organic growth? Mark Bette : Well, this is Mark, Ken. On the Omnium tech acquisition, at this point, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily view as layering on additional expense, and we\u2019ll share more on that as we work through that. On the -- when we do look at our organic growth rate, we do on an internal basis, we do acquisition kind of out of that picture. So, as we look at let\u2019s say the first quarter of 2018 versus the first quarter of 2017, we would be looking to kind of strip back the expense growth and the organic fee growth excluding the acquisition. Obviously, eventually, it becomes part of your business, once it\u2019s fully integrated. But, when you have those periods when there\u2019s a year-over-year issue, we do adjust for those. Ken Usdin : Right. And UBS already came on slightly positive on that front. So, hopefully on a full year basis, we would get that as an increment? Mark Bette : Yes. I mean, about 3 -- on a pre-tax, including integration about 3 million drag on pre-tax. Ken Usdin : Okay. I mean, on a non -- on a go forward basis, right. Because if you said 8 million was the non-organic part of that and you\u2019re bringing on 21 against 16ish, and that would be kind of organic positive leverage onto its own, just presuming that carries forward? Mark Bette : Yes. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : So, sorry to go back to this, but I guess just a follow-up to Ken\u2019s point and the discussion there. I guess, 2017 was a pretty noisy year for you guys in terms of expenses, numerous charges, you kind of outlined some of the severance related activity, but there is also some others. You kind of -- and then there is UBS. So, if you strip all that out, it feels like the core expense base, I\u2019m excluding UBS here, is a little under $3.7 billion. Is that the right way to think about it, as we\u2019re kind of contemplating, kind of layering on more normal kind of 4% to 5% organic expense growth or I guess what would you consider to be the baseline for expenses? Again, keeping UBS aside because you gave a lot of useful color on that one. Mark Bette : Yes. And this is Mark, Alex. I would say that if you took the charges out and you adjusted for the fourth quarter acquisition, that 3.7 is about the right number. I mean, I would also say that -- and again, we don\u2019t give specific guidance, but the value for spend program, the intention is that to get to that point where we have that neutral to positive organic fee operating leverage by 2020. So, as far as -- if you look at 2018 on its own, there is work obviously we have to do. And the goal is, by the time we get to 2020, we\u2019ll have that expense growth in line with the organic. And there might quarters before then where we are able to achieve it. But by 2020, we want to be able to consistently deliver that. Alex Blostein : And then, the strategic question for you guys just around the Omnium tech transaction. So, it\u2019s a bit of a wash on the expense side, sounds like. But any incremental opportunities that gives you on the revenue side? I mean I know that's been a pretty successful partnership for you guys in the past. That\u2019s kind of how you got into the hedge fund administration business and that's been a big driver of servicing growth for you. But, as I think about it you\u2019re now doing that in-house. Any revenue implications that are sort of tangible you can point over the next 12 to 18 months? Biff Bowman : Yes. I think when we announced the agreement, as you've pointed out, we basically -- with Citadel, we're bringing the technology in-house and the flexibility that gives us and the talent quite frankly that it brings with it is powerful for us to think about how we go out and compete. And if you think about that in some competitive environments not having that in-house could be a detriment in a competitive environment, if they say who owns the technology and who supports the technology in certain competitive environments. Having that being able to be in-house, I think will allow them in that competitive environment to not face that hurdle in certain parts of the discussion. And then, we also think we get the benefit of bringing that in and fitting that into our IT infrastructure and understanding the benefits and a bigger and broader set of IT infrastructures that it can sit within. And again, we get some very talented individuals who we think can benefit, not just the Omnium platforms but some of ours as they look at some of the Northern Trust platforms as well. So, we're quite positive on the transaction. And again, it's unfolding as we speak here in the first three or four months of the year. Mark Bette : Yes. And I would also add that over time, we do expect this transaction to be cost beneficial to us. And like Biff said, be able to create greater efficiencies in the future. But, we will share what we can with you as we work through the process of closing. Operator : We'll go next to Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : So, quick follow-up on capital. In past, you guys -- I totally appreciate that you're going through the process and it certainly seems like very -- front and center in your minds is shareholder returns and returning capital to shareholders. I just wanted to clarify something. In the past, you've talked about how staying close to competitors and keeping capital ratios close to competitors is a key consideration competitively, which is fair. We've heard that in the press more and more attention to relief for on the leverage ratio upfront. So, if we end up seeing that relief for peers and if it is only focused on SIFIs not directly on you, won't that also benefit you all and provide some relief on a measure that has in the past constrained you to some degree? Biff Bowman : Yes. So, if you look this quarter, while our capital ratios are still strong as is our leverage ratio, our binding constraint would be the leverage ratio not supplementary but the leverage ratio. So, the relief that's been proposed or the reaction to price share quarrels, reports are earlier this week or late last week are positive directionally for us. And if those come to being, they do give us even greater flexibility in our capital thinking and returns than we already have, which is like I said in a position great opportunity, given the strength of where we are and our capital ratios. I'm not sure how fast those will come. They were thoughtfully put in. And I'm not sure how fast we will be able to change those, but if they do, we would benefit. I think some of our peers have supplementary leverage ratio concerns that\u2019s less impactful for us, but the leverage ratio is absolutely impactful for us and would again give us even greater capital flexibility in our thinking. And you\u2019re right to say, it is front and center in our thinking right now. Brennan Hawken : Great, thanks for that. And then, following up on your NIM outlook comments, Biff. Respectfully, just a little push back here, like, why so caveat it, right? They deserve pretty low in your deposit base, as you walk through still. And even if they go up, they are still going to be at a level that\u2019s manageable. And when you look at the asset side, you guys are more levered to the front end of the curve, you guys have now -- I think a great move to get rid of the premium amortization noise. So, we don\u2019t have that to worry about. So, why not a more confident outlook in the rate leverage for you guys as you move into 2018, particularly given the market is now looking for three hikes. And by the way, all that\u2019s before even considering the Bank of England, where we could see higher rates there too which matter to you guys. Biff Bowman : So, Brennan, without giving guidance, we think our NIM can expand. Okay? We think it will expand. Just we're cautious in the sense of if betas move to 1 with the next hike in a competitive landscape, an unlikely scenario, I might add. If we come on here and told you that the NIM would be meaningfully expand, that may not be the case. If we see the NIMs expand at what we project and what we think and what we\u2019ve observed -- excuse me, the betas expand, what we have seen here, our NIM will expand and it will. If you\u2019ve seen the trajectory of our net interest income and our NI, it\u2019s moved I think quite nicely, relative to the industry, given the disciplines we deploy on that beta. And I think it\u2019s been beneficial to the firm. So, I think we will but we have a degree of caution there. Brennan Hawken : That\u2019s totally fair, and I completely agree, like especially now that you guys have the balance sheet stable, I would think it\u2019d be a pretty nice positive for you. But thanks for clarifying that, appreciate it. Operator : We will go next to Jim Mitchell of Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell : On wealth management, some of your discount guys have pointed to significant activity pick up among retail investors, obviously not necessarily you're same. The high net worth space is not as a different customer base. But, if you\u2019ve seen sort of the animal spirits getting better with your wealth management high net worth customers, you\u2019ve seen flows improve. Just trying to get sense of how to think about organic growth, what you\u2019re seeing in flows and activity levels among your wealth management client base? Biff Bowman : So, the answer to that is yes, we did see a strong year-end flows. And I think our clientele which tends to be at the higher end of the network spectrum is reacting to a very successful or high returning equity markets. They are looking at lower, perhaps personal income taxes, depends on what state you're in probably. They are looking at -- to your phrase, maybe a little bit more in the animal spirits, which allows them to invest in their own company businesses, allows them to perhaps take those businesses public or to sell those business. And so, we have seen that flow and new business pick up. There was a meaningful improvement in our organic growth rates from \u201816 to \u201817 in our wealth management franchise. And I think you see that in the fee growth line and you see that in the overall performance of our wealth management business. Again, with tax perform starting this year and the market that\u2019s starting, healthily we think those animal spirits are still intact and long may they last. Jim Mitchell : And are cash balances at low points still reasonably usually high? I mean, what\u2019s sort of the dry powder? Biff Bowman : Yes. So, they\u2019re not at low points, they\u2019re actually still high. So, I think you\u2019ve got people that are looking at where those opportunity sets are. And our cash balances inside of our firm increased across our asset management portfolios nicely year-over-year, both institutionally and on the personal site. But, we are seeing -- I think when I looked -- if you looked at our traditional wealth portfolio, we were at the highest level of equity as a component of that portfolio since 2009 when we kind of bottomed out. So, people existing equity investment in their portfolio were back to the high at the low-50% range across the average portfolio. Jim Mitchell : Maybe just one question on clarification. Your tax rate guidance of 24 to 25, I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s FTE? Biff Bowman : 23 to 24. Jim Mitchell : I\u2019m so sorry. Is that FTE or GAAP? Mark Bette : That\u2019s on GAAP. Biff Bowman : GAAP. Jim Mitchell : That\u2019s GAAP? Okay. All right. Thanks for that. Mark Bette : Yes. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Look, I\u2019m going to give a little windup to my question. So, on the positive side, look, Northern had the best top-line growth among peer in 2017. You guys played the long game, you did very well through the crisis. So, I don\u2019t want to take anything away from you guys. But, did I hear it correctly that you\u2019re not committing to positive fee operating leverage until 2020. In other words, I think you said, you did not get it on a core basis in 2017 and you\u2019re not planning on that for either this year or next year because it\u2019ll take time for the $250 million of savings to come through? Biff Bowman : No. That isn\u2019t what we said. So, we\u2019re going to work hard to do what we can on that front over the next 12 months to get to that level. Obviously, the organic fee part of that equation requires a lot execution. But, I can tell you that we\u2019re committed to getting to that before 2020, all things being equal. Mark Bette : And Mike, when I was comment earlier, I was focused on the organic leverage. So, we\u2019ve been running at about 6.5, even if you adjust for things on expenses, our organic fees or let\u2019s say 4.5 to 5. And the value for spend initiative has the intention of closing that GAAP. Mike Mayo : Okay. I\u2019m glad I asked the question. And as it relates to the pre-tax margin, it\u2019s another way to ask this question a little bit differently. Again, notwithstanding the strong top-line last year, the pre-tax margin was flat and still down a little bit from a couple of years ago. Your peers tend to highlight that in the first few slides and you guys have it in the appendix. Do you have a target for the pretax margin for the firm? Do you expect that to increase? And just more generally, it goes to the question, how much are you willing to sacrifice the pretax margin to have better performance in the future. Biff Bowman : Mike, we focus on the expense to fees more than we do to pretax margin piece of that. But, pretax margin is I can tell you internally something that we look at. And as you know we've historically and I think our competitors all are able to drive something in that low30s. And we think it's important to be in that range as well. Now, we've got a wealth business that does better than that. And so, we're trying to get I think that blended rate and improve that pretax margin along with all other expense initiatives we talked about. We just don't call that out as something that we set an established target for. But, I think our pretax margin actually improved during the course of the year. And I can tell you that we continue to focus on, not just giving up margin to get the profitability you described. Mike Mayo : And if I could squeeze one more in. I guess, what I'm getting to, it just seems like you're increasing some investment spending to somewhere. And it might be logical, some of your peers are increasing their tax spending. Are you increasing spending in certain areas, again with an eye for that payback and you're a lot more conscious to this profitable growth and getting more leverage through the franchise. But, if you're increasing investment spending, what areas are you focused on? Biff Bowman : Yes. So, we obviously -- you can see it in the equipment software line, if you look at the depreciation growth rate. We absolutely are making investments in our business. And we hope many of those generate the returns that you would expect to drive that expense to fees down further. The areas in many cases, I took the wealth side, there is investment in Goals Driven investment, capability and product that drives both revenue and operating efficiencies. But, a lot of that investment is in our core operating platform to support our C&IS business, so that we can produce and perform at as what you described the better margins and the better returns. And that's a technology intensive business, and we need to continue to invest. Our business generates I think enough to make that investment. But that's where we've seen that. And then there has been investment also in things like robotics and others that are largely in place for driving operating efficiencies. So, it's combination of all those. Operator : We'll go next to Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Gerard Cassidy : I got a question for you. You guys have done a very good job of driving that return on equity higher, not return on tangible common equity. And I think you have right now the goal to keep that number -- the range is 10% to 15%. And I go back and I think back to your old days before all the banks had to air all that capital and you had a long term target for ROE of 16% to 18%. And I understand, we\u2019re probably not going to get there. But with the tax rates now coming down, and your profitability and your peers' profitability going higher as a result of that. Should we see this range increase or how are you guys looking at pushing that higher as your profitability goes higher? Biff Bowman : Thanks, Gerard for the question. If we think back to when we established the range originally, the 10 to 15, the industry had kind of gone through -- I guess you described it as a secular change. We had all been asked to put more capital on the balance sheet and we all had to look at how we could return across the cycle, and that\u2019s when we established the 10% to15% range. What I would suggest is at this point, if the tax reform is indeed the secular change, we think it is, that we have to think about that and what that is to our targeted range and how the reform itself will impact us and move this up. So, this type of secular change will prompt that type of evaluation inside the firm. Gerard Cassidy : And then, second sticking with taxes, obviously, we all know about the SALT part of the new federal tax code. In your state, your home state, Illinois is one of the higher tax states. At what point -- I know it\u2019s only a couple of weeks into the new tax bill, so we don\u2019t have the answers yet. But, will you guys take a look at what that might mean in terms of the cost to your operations of -- for your employees and other factors in the state of Illinois because of the higher cost of doing business there versus other states and possibly shifting to lower cost areas, should that make sense? Biff Bowman : I'm going to tell you that I think that it\u2019s early in the stages and I probably don\u2019t have a much more detailed answer for you on that right now. We obviously conduct and do business around the globe. We have a global franchise, we have operating centers and offices around the globe. And we\u2019ll have to take a look and see how this unfolds and what the impacts to our people et cetera. We\u2019d certainly let that unfold over the next period of time while we absorb this. Operator : We will go next to Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Vivek Juneja : Just a quick clarification. Firstly, On MBS premium amortization, you said have a onetime charge which gets you to 20 to 25, so the charge -- the increase is 10 to 13, so the rest would imply what 10 million to 12 million. And since you said you\u2019re going to make it pretty similar quarter-over-quarter, so is that to say that you\u2019re expecting that 10 million to 12 million to continue on a quarterly basis through the rest of the year? Biff Bowman : Yes. Vivek Juneja : Even though the long end has gone up so much? Biff Bowman : Yes. As we sit here today, that\u2019s our expectation. Yes. Vivek Juneja : Secondly, consulting service costs did decline, are you done with pulling pack on all the increase it had in consulting fees and projects for the living will or is there still more to come out of that? Biff Bowman : We submitted our 165, at the end of the year. We believe in that that we\u2019ve addressed regulator\u2019s concerns but we will get that feedback from them in short order. So, the expenses we needed to do that work. Right now, we were able to have some of the consulting spend associated with that pull back and in other areas too. I wouldn\u2019t say just related to that but in other consulting spend as we discussed, the spend pulled back. And then, we have to observe our feedback and we\u2019ll go from there. But, yes, as of today. We also have to submit our CIDI plan by July 1st. But, we\u2019re well underway on that front. Vivek Juneja : And lastly, going back to, I think Gerard\u2019s question earlier, which was the ROE goals. I mean, from what I can see, the guidance that you\u2019re giving on taxes, ongoing taxes should add a good 1.5 points to your ROE levels. So, at the very least, shouldn\u2019t we expect that 10 to 15 to go up by that 1.5 percentage points? Biff Bowman : So, we will evaluate that as we said on the call in terms of -- this is the type of secular change that promotes that. I think, the math you\u2019ve done is something we can all do and that\u2019s a reasonable mathematical equation, but we\u2019ve got a balance that across the series of other strategic factors, and that\u2019s where we are. Vivek Juneja : Meaning you might use some of this for something else? Any color on what you might be thinking? Biff Bowman : Yes. That\u2019s not what we were trying to say there. We\u2019re just saying, we\u2019ve got process, we\u2019ve got reviews and other things that we\u2019ve got to look at and we\u2019re going to let that process unfold. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : Just a quick question. Can you maybe just outline the strategy behind using the wholesale funding that kind of help fund the balance sheet growth? I mean, are you seeing suitable yields? On the earning asset side to make -- improve the margin still with that strategy? Biff Bowman : Yes. Sure. So, as you saw, we did do some discretionary leveraging and used some wholesale funding. With our strong capital positions, we felt that we could put the balance sheet to work with discretionary leveraging and/or other kind of wholesale funding sources, as you described. But the nature of those is obviously very short. We\u2019re generally putting those at central banks. Because, as we look at the flexibility we would like in the deployment of that capital, we\u2019re not looking to lock those up into longer term assets. So, whether those are loans or something else as you described. Right now, we like that short-term flexibility around using that wholesale funding for, call it discretionary leveraging and the likes. It was additive to the quarter. And then, also to give you some idea, roughly for every 1 billion of discretionary leveraging, it\u2019s about a 1 basis-point of a drag on the NIM. But we still felt that driving the NII was important. Mark Bette : And Brian to give you some color as far as volumes go. There was about 8 billion of leveraging during the current quarter compared to about 5.5 to 6 last quarter and 3 a year ago. So, at this point, when you think about the basis point impact on NIM, that gives you some color on that. Brian Kleinhanzl : And could you just give what the duration of the securities book is now? Have you had to extend duration at all? Mark Bette : We\u2019ve not. The total securities -- still remains 1.2, 1.1 years. Operator : It appears there are no further questions in queue at this time. That concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. Biff Bowman : Thank you.",

Let me turn the call over to Biff Bowman. Biff Bowman : Good morning everyone. Let me join Mark in welcoming you to our first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Starting on page two of our quarterly earnings review presentation, this morning we reported first quarter net income of $381.6 million. Earnings per share were $1.58, and our return on common equity was 16%. As noted on the second page of our earnings release, this quarter's results included a net $6.8 million tax benefit associated with the true up relating to the Tax Cuts and Job Act, and a change in accounting method for software development-related expense deductions and $8.6 million charge associated with severance-related and restructuring charges. The quarter also included $23.9 million in fee revenue and $23.7 million in expense related to our acquisition of UBS Asset Management's fund administration units in Luxembourg and Switzerland, which closed at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2017. Included in the $23.7 million in expense was $4.1 million relating to integration activities. Additionally, the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard resulted in an $8 million increase in both wealth management fees and outside services expense. Before going through our results in detail, I would like to comment on some macro factors impacting our business during the quarter. Equity markets were mixed during the quarter. Markets were favorable on a year-over-year basis with the S&P 500 and MSCI EAFE indices increasing 11.8 and 2.5 respectively. But on a sequential basis, both indices declined with the S&P 500 down 1.2% and the EAFE down 5.1%. Short-term interest rates continued to increase during the quarter driven by a rate hike from the Federal Reserve. Currency rates influenced the translation of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar, and therefore impact client assets and certain revenues and expenses. The British pound and euro ended the quarter up 12% and 16% respectively versus the prior year as compared to the U.S. dollar. On a sequential basis, the British pound and euro also strengthened. The strengthening of these currencies compared to the U.S. dollar favorably impacted revenue, but had an unfavorable impact on expenses. Let's move to page three and review the financial highlights of the first quarter. Year-over-year, revenue increased 15% with non-interest income up 17%, and net interest income up 8%. Expenses increased to 11% from last year. The provision for credit losses was a credit of $3 million. Net income was 38% higher year-over-year. In the sequential comparison, revenue was up 3% with non-interest income up 5%, and net interest income down 1%. The expenses were down 1% compared to the prior quarter. Net income was 7% higher sequentially. Return on average common equity was at 16% for the quarter, up from 11.6% one year ago, and up from 15.1% in the prior quarter. Assets under custody/Administration of $10.8 trillion, increased 21% compared to one year ago, and 1% on a sequential basis. Included in assets under custody and administration is $607 billion relating to the acquisition of UBS Asset Management's fund administration units in Luxembourg and Switzerland. Assets under custody of $8.1 trillion, increased 14% compared to one year ago, and was up slightly on a sequential basis. For the year-over-year comparison, favorable market impacts, new business, and favorable movements in foreign exchange rates were the drivers. For the sequential comparison the favorable moves in currency exchange rates and new business were mostly offset by unfavorable market impacts. Assets under management were $1.2 trillion, up 16% year-over-year and up slightly on a sequential basis. The year-over-year increase was driven by favorable markets and new business flows, while sequentially a negative market impact was offset by new business flows. Let's look at the results in greater detail starting with revenue on page four. First quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $1.5 billion, up 15% from last year, and up 3% sequentially. Excluding the acquisition, revenue was up 13% from last year. The favorable translation impact of changes in currency rates benefited year-over-year revenue growth by approximately 1.5%. Trust, Investment & Other Servicing Fees represent the largest component of our revenue, and were $938 million in the first quarter, up 16% year-over-year, and up 3% from the prior quarter. Excluding the UBS acquisition fees were up 13% on a year-over-year basis. A change in presentation of certain fees resulting from the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard increased fees by $8 million during the quarter within our wealth management business. There was a corresponding increase of $8 million within the outside services component of expense. Foreign Exchange Trading Income was $78 million in the first quarter, up 63% year-over-year, and up 25% sequentially. The increases were primarily due to higher volumes and increased foreign exchange swap activity in our treasury department. Volatility, as measured by the G7 Index, was up sequentially, but down from one year ago. Other non-interest income was $76 million in the first quarter, up 2% compared to one year ago, and up 6% sequentially. This increase from one year ago was primarily driven by higher security commissions and trading income, partially offset by foreign currency adjustments within other operating income. The sequential increase was primarily due to higher transition management and core brokerage revenue. Net interest income, which I will discuss in more detail later, was $393 million in the first quarter, increasing 8% year-over-year, and down 1% sequentially. Let's look at the components of our trust and investment fees on page five. For our Corporate and Institutional Services business fees totaled $544 million in the first quarter, up 18% year-over-year, and up 2% on a sequential basis. The quarter included $23.9 million in fees relating to the acquisition of UBS' Asset Management's fund administration units in Luxembourg and Switzerland. Excluding these fees, C&IS fees were up 12% compared to the prior year. The favorable translation impact of changes in currency rates benefited year-over-year C&IS fees by approximately 3%. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees, were $374 million, up 22% compared to the prior year and up 1% sequentially. This line does include the UBS acquisition-related fees. Excluding these fees, Custody and fund administration fees were up 14% compared to the prior year. The year-over-year growth was driven by new business, favorable currency translation and market. The sequential increase was primarily driven by favorable currency translation and markets. Assets under custody/administration for C&IS clients were $10.1 trillion at quarter-end, up 22% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. These results include $607 billion relating to the UBS fund administration acquisition.  Year-over-year excluding the acquisition, the increases primarily reflects favorable markets, new business and the benefit of movements in foreign exchange rates. Sequentially, the benefit of movements in foreign exchange rates and new business were offset by unfavorable markets. Recall that lag market values factor into the quarter's fees with both quarter lag and month lag markets impacting our C&IS custody and fund administration fees. Investment management fees in C&IS of $110 billion in the first quarter were up 17% year-over-year and up 3% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was primarily due to favorable markets, new business, and the favorable impact of movements in foreign exchange rates while sequential comparison was primarily due to favorable markets. Assets under management for C&IS clients were $878 billion, up 19% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Favorable market impacts and net new business were the drivers of the year-over-year growth while the sequential growth was driven by new business flows partially offset by unfavorable markets. Securities lending fees were $26 million in the first quarter, up 9% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, higher volumes were partially offset by lower spreads. For the sequential comparison, the slight increase was driven by higher volumes. Securities lending collateral was $187 billion at quarter-end and averaged to $182 billion across the quarter. Average collateral levels increased 48% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. The growth in volumes was driven by demand for U.S. treasuries. Other fees in C&IS were $35 million in the first quarter, down 9% year-over-year and up 6% sequentially. The year-over-year decline reflects lower sub-advisor fees. The income associated with sub-advisor fees has an associated lower expense in the outside services category. This decline in sub-advisor fees is consistent with the prior quarter we discontinued a service offering. The sequential increase was primarily attributable to seasonally higher benefit payment fees in the current quarter. Moving to our Wealth Management business, trust investment and other servicing fees were $393 million in the first quarter, up 14% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Within wealth management, the global family office business had strong performance with fees increasing 17% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Both increases were primarily attributable to new business and favorable markets. Each of the regions also performed well during the quarter. Both the year-over-year and sequential growth in the regions were driven by favorable markets, higher fees resulting from the adoption of new revenue recognition standard of $8 million and new business. There is a corresponding increase to outside service expense as a result of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard. Assets under management for wealth management clients were $287 billion at quarter-end, up 10% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. Moving to page six; net interest income was $393 million in the first quarter, up 8% year-over-year. Earning assets averaged $116 billion in the first quarter, up 6% versus last year. Total deposits averaged $98 billion and were up 3% year-over-year. Interest bearing deposits increased 10% from one year ago to $76 billion. This growth was partially offset by a 14% decline in non-interest bearing deposits, which averaged $22 billion during the first quarter. Loan balances averaged $32 billion in the first quarter and were down 4% compared to one year ago. The net interest margin was 1.38% in the first quarter, and was up three basis points from a year-ago. The improvement in the net interest margin compared to the prior year primarily reflects the impact of higher short-term interest rates partially offset by higher premium and amortization due to a change in estimation methodology and the balance sheet mix shift. On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income was down $3 million or 1%. Average earning assets increased 2% sequentially funded by increases in interest bearing deposits, short-term borrowings and non-interest bearing deposits. On a sequential basis, the net interest margin decreased one basis point with the benefit of higher short-term interest rates offset by higher premium amortization due to a change in estimation methodology, and a balance sheet mix shift. Net interest income for the quarter included a $7 million sequential decline due to the accounting for certain tax advantaged investments. This decline was fully offset on the fully taxable equivalent line. Premium amortization totaled $19 million in the first quarter, compared to $1 million one year ago, and zero in the fourth quarter. As we have discussed previously, beginning with this quarter, we are shifting our remaining life assumption estimation methodology for premium amortization, which will lead to a more consistent quarterly amount that we expect to be within the $10 million to $12 million range going forward. In the first quarter, there was a one-time $7 million true up adjustment to align the remaining amortization. This was included in the total amortization amount of $19 million. Looking at the currency mix of our balance sheet, for the first quarter, U.S. dollar deposits represented 69% of our total deposits. This compared to 74% one year ago and 70% during the prior quarter. Turning to page seven, expenses were $995 million in the first quarter, and were 11% higher than the prior year, and 1% lower sequentially. As previously mentioned, and as outlined in the second page of our earnings release, the current quarter included $23.7 million in expense associated with the UBS acquisition. The current quarter also included $8.6 million in expense associated with severance and other charges. In the prior quarter, we had $30.5 million of severance and other charges, as well as a special one-time employee cash bonus paid in connection with the adoption of U.S. Tax Reform. Excluding both the UBS acquisition and called out expense items, expense for the quarter was 8% higher than a year ago. Excluding charges in both the current and prior quarters, expense was 2% higher sequentially. Now keeping to total non-interest expense, I would like to break down those growth rates further. Starting with the adjusted 8% year-over-year increase, approximately two points of growth was from the unfavorable translation impact of changes in currency rates, primarily the British pound and euro. Excluding currency impact, therefore our year-over-year expense growth rate was approximately 6%. The adoption of the new revenue recognition standard added expense of $8 million, but was partially offset by lower sub-advisor costs due to the discontinuance of a product line. Both of these items were within outside services, and had corresponding fee revenue impacts. Combined these two items drove just under one-half of a point in expense growth, bringing our core expense growth rate to approximately 5.5%. With respect to the remaining increase in year-over-year expense growth, the following items are key drivers within the categories. Compensation was higher driven by increased incentive compensation and base pay adjustments from April of last year. The impact of staff growth on salaries was offset by staff actions and location strategy efforts. Benefits were higher primarily due to an increase in retirement plan expenses, medical costs, and higher payroll tax withholding compared to the prior year. Outside service costs were higher driven primarily by higher sub-custodian and technical services including market data costs. Equipment and software expense was up year-over-year due to higher software amortization and equipment depreciation. Occupancy-related costs were higher compared to the prior year, primarily due to accelerated depreciation related to a previously-announced facility exit in one of our Chicago locations. Shifting to the sequential expense view, excluding the expense charges in both the current and prior quarter, expenses increased 2% from the prior quarter. Compensation expense increased primarily reflecting higher expenses related to long-term performance-based incentive compensation due to divesting provisions associated with the grants to retirement eligible employees in the current quarter. This quarter's compensation included 32 million in expense associated with retirement eligible staff. As a reminder, similar to last year, there were also be approximately $11 million in expense associated with the retirement eligible employees in the second quarter. Additionally, next quarter's compensation will also be impacted by base pay adjustments of approximately $8 million, which were effective on April 1. Outside services costs were down sequentially, primarily relating to lower consulting, legal, and technical services expense, partially offset by higher third-party advisor costs resulting from the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard. There is a corresponding increase to trust investment and other servicing fees as a result of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, as I mentioned earlier. Equipment and software expenses were higher sequentially primarily due to increased software amortization and software support cost. Elsewhere, other operating expense declined from the prior period primarily due to a lower business promotional spend, staff-related costs, and lower miscellaneous expenses within the category. Staff levels increased approximately 5% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. The growth year-over-year includes the addition of approximately 240 partners as a result of the UBS acquisition; the remainder of the growth was all attributable staff increases and lower cost locations, which include India, Manila, Limerick, Ireland, and Tempe, Arizona partially offset by reductions in our higher cost locations. Turning to page eight, as we have discussed on previous calls through our value per spend initiative, we are realigning our expense base with the goal of realizing $250 million in expense run rate savings by 2020. Concurrently, we are embedding a sustainable expense management approach. We expect these efforts to slow our expense growth to be being more closely aligned with our organic fee growth. Our first quarter results reflect approximately $14 million in expense savings, reducing the year-over-year expense growth by approximately 1.5 points. This would equate to approximately 55 million on an annualized basis against the $250 million goal. I would like to highlight a few examples of our progress to date for you. We have focused on eliminating redundancy by strategically realigning employees and leveraging our location strategy. We continue to drive improvement and vendor pricing across multiple areas, and remain focused on reducing our consulting spend. We continue to cultivate a healthy pipeline of opportunities that we expect to discuss in future quarters. Turning to page nine, a key focus has been on sustainably enhancing profitability in returns. This slide reflects the progress we have made in recent years to improve the expenses to fee ratio, pre-tax margin, and ultimately our return on equity. The ratio of expenses to trust and investment fees is a particularly important measure of our progress as it addresses what we can most directly control. Reducing this measure from where it was previously as high as of 131% in 2011 to the levels we see today as a key contributor for the improvement in our pre-tax margin and ultimately our return on equity. Turning to page 10, our capital ratios remain strong with our common equity tier 1 ratio of 13.1% under the advanced approach, and 12.4% under the standardized approach. The supplementary leverage ratio at the corporation was 6.7% and at the bank was 6.1%; both of which exceed the 3% requirement, which became applicable to Northern Trust effective at the start of this year. With respect to the liquidity coverage ratio, Northern Trust is above the 100% minimum requirement that became effective at the start of 2017. As Northern Trust progresses through fully phased in Basel III implementation, there could be additional enhancements to our models and further guidance from the regulators on the implementation of the final rule, which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final Basel III rules. In the first quarter, we repurchased 2.5 million shares of common stock at a cost of $263 million. In closing, Northern Trust delivered strong financial results in the quarter, growing earnings per share by 45% over the prior year. Our assets under custody and administration and assets under management were up 21% and 16% respectively versus the prior year. Our return on average common equity, up 16%, expense to trust investment and other servicing fees of 106 were our best performance since the financial crisis. As we seek to drive profitable growth we were pleased to deliver strong positive operating leverage of 3.6 points and positive fee operating leverage of 4.7 points. On an organic basis our fee and expense growth rates were better aligned. While growth across our segments were strong, so too was the profitability of each business. Our wealth management business grew pretax income by 24% versus the prior year while improving the pretax margin from 37% to 41% and driving the expense-to-fee ratio down to 93%. Our C&IS business similarly drove strong year-over-year performance with pretax income growing 42% versus the prior year, and the pretax margin improving from 29% to 34%, and driving the expense-to-fee ratio down to 108. We are confident in our competitive positioning within growth markets and our ability to continue profitably growing our business. Before I conclude, as is customary for our first quarter earnings call, we will need to end today's call a bit earlier than in other quarters to allow sufficient time for all of us to get to our annual meeting, which begins at 10 :30 A.M. Central Time this morning. Please accept our apologies in the event we have to close off the question-and-answer period earlier than our normal practice. Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust's first quarter earnings conference call today. Mark and I would be happy to answer your questions. Paula, please open the line. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks, good morning folks. Mark Bette : Hi, Brian. Brian Bedell : Hi, good morning. Maybe just to start off with FX trading, obviously another strong result, can you talk about the portion that you think is due from the FX swap activity in the treasury business, and it looks like even adjusting for currency volatility, we\u2019re -- in the last two quarters, now we're seeing a big step up in that run rate, so just like to sort of think about that going forward. Biff Bowman : Yes, thanks, Brian. So we had really solid growth both sequentially and year-over-year in foreign exchange, as you highlighted. And that was really driven by two key factors. The first was that in our core trading, if you will, our core trading business volumes were higher, and we did see some higher volatility. And so that produced approximately $63 million to $64 million of the FX volume you see, which is above our traditional run rate there. The remainder, approximately $15 million, is from the treasury swap activity that we called out. And if I could I'd like to give a little bit of an explanation on that. As a part of our normal balance sheet management we manage our currency and put it in the most effective currency. We have been able to, because of a demand for dollars from certain institutions, take dollars from our Fed balances, swap them into sterling and euro and place them with the ECB or the Bank of England. So when we've done that the resulting benefit from the currency swap flows through the FX line. As you would understand, we gave up some net interest income to get that. So the $15 million improvement you have seen in the FX line that's attributable to treasury trades was there was about $10 million of net interest income give-up to do that, but that's still a good economic trade for our shareholders if you think about that. And right now that's because of the widening we've seen in that swap trade because of the demand for dollars. So it's hard to project where that trade and that spread will go, but we've taken the right currency decisions and the right balance sheet decisions in the first quarter of this year, and even a bit of the tail end of 2017. So about $63 million to $64 million was core FX and $15 million was driven by the treasury swaps. You'll be able to see that in the 10-Q as well that shows up under the treasury trading line in the segment reporting. Brian Bedell : Great, and that's fantastic color, thank you. And then maybe just to follow up on expenses. Obviously, a very good expenses controlled quarter. And you've achieved a little over 25% of the 250 programs so far on a run rate basis. So could you just talk about the trend going into 2Q and into the rest of this year, if 1Q was a sort of a high achievement for the year or do you see this continuing into the year? And then I think that you did mention something about -- talking about reinvestment in other growth initiatives on some of that, if you can detail that as well. Biff Bowman : Let me talk on the expense side around it. So our core expense growth rate that we highlighted for you, at about 5.5%, we think that's what our core actually was in the quarter. If I look at any individual lines there I would call out perhaps in the other operating expense line, there can be some seasonality, some lower seasonality in that because our business promotion tends to be a little lower in the first quarter, and staff-related expenses which generally are attributed to ex-pat hypothetical tax or hypo tax can also have some episodic nature in the first quarter and be a little bit lower. But the trend along the other expense lines is generally, as you would've seen, historically unfold, that\u2019s the only line item I would say is lower than maybe a traditional run rate. I think it's probably better to look at other operating expense over a year -- over a calendar year because we'll have the Northern Trust open in the third quarter and others. I'd look at that expense line over a year, and it could have a little seasonality. The other line items, obviously there's equity compensation in the first quarter that is traditionally larger than it would be in subsequent quarters. So you, I'm sure, can adjust for that in your models as you go forward. And I'm not sure where we talked about investments. I'm not sure where we said that, but we continue to reinvest in our business where the opportunity is there, but we continue to execute on value for spend as you saw the highlights in this quarter. That execution needs to continue throughout the year and that helps provide for that investment opportunities in the company. Operator : And moving on, we'll go to Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Biff Bowman : Hi, Alex. Alex Blostein : Hi, guys. Good morning, and thanks. So first question is around the NIR and some of the funding dynamics we saw from you guys in the quarter. I guess two questions there. First on the balance sheet side itself, so continued nice growth in average earning assets up 2-ish percent I think quarter-over-quarter. How much of that is due to new customer business versus some of the discretionary leveraging you've done in the past? Biff Bowman : Yes, it's a bit of both. So we have continued to see the strong new business, but there was also some increased discretionary leverage. Mark Bette : So, yes, Alex, the discretionary leveraging was actually down about $1 billion sequentially, on a year-over-year basis though it was about $3 billion last year and closer to $7 billion this year. Alex Blostein : Got you. And then I guess on the -- yes, go ahead. Biff Bowman : I'll just say it's a bit of both. Alex Blostein : Yes, got you. And then I guess on the, more importantly, on the funding side. So if we look at the deposit betas and just the level of non-interest bearing deposits, so maybe we can unpack both of those. But I guess on the deposit beta side, looks like costs are up only three-ish basis points sequentially, which again is kind of nice to see given the fact that rates continue to move higher. So maybe help us unpack what's going on there. And then on the non-interest bearing deposit side again went up nicely. The balance went up nicely sequentially for the first time in a while, so maybe speak to kind of what drove that, how sustainable do you think that is, and do you guys think there might actually be an opportunity to reduce some of the short-term borrowings you had to put into place given the fact that the deposits seem to be holding up better. I know there's a bunch of stuff in there, but all kind of funded [ph] related. Biff Bowman : Yes, let me start on the -- yes, we'll go to the liabilities, so -- but on the betas. I think it's probably easier to look at the betas over a longer period than any one quarter because, Alex, we can have period where it seems like our betas lower than you may think but we may have been ahead of the market in some periods. And there's other periods where maybe there's catch-up in any one given period, but if you look over time it's probably a better measure. The second part of that, I would say, is we really do follow the markets both for our retail deposits and for our institutional deposits. And particularly on the institutional side it's a competitive marketplace. We've got rate environment to look and see what our competitors are doing, and we try to match that in the marketplace or move with that in the marketplace and keep track of it. On the retail side or on the wealth management deposit side we have seen some increased competition in that marketplace or some increased rate from some of the peer competitors that we would have in the wealth space. And we've got a process, a disciplined process to look at our rate environment and pass those betas on. So, so far, the betas are what you see in there, and we'll probably continue to move in lockstep with where you anticipate markets going. In terms of the non-interest bearing deposits you're right. They had a slight increase in the quarter, a modest increase. I would be hesitant to tell you that I think that is the new flat level. We saw some monies come in that could be rate sensitive in the quarter. But that's three quarters in a row that it's been around the $21 billion to $22 billion level. We track that very closely, particularly the piece of that which is about a quarter of that or $5 billion to $6 billion of that, that we would deem to be the most rate sensitive. The remainder of that is wealth deposits and other things that are traditionally supporting what I would say core operating businesses. But we continue to have regular dialogues with that sort of $5 billion to see the sustainability of that and the long-term rate sensitivity of that. So far it's held up for three quarters. Operator : And moving on, we'll go to Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Biff Bowman : Good morning, Brennan. Brennan Hawken : Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So just wanted to circle back to, I believe you highlighted in your commentary, Biff, about a balance sheet mix shift on the NIM front. And I know that you had talked a little bit about the FX swap. Was that what you were referring to? Was there something else? Could you maybe provide a little bit of additional clarity on what was behind that, and what was behind that comment? Biff Bowman : Sure. That is one piece of it. And as you've also seen the loan portfolio as a portion of the balance sheet has gone down over time as our loan growth has flattened out or even gone slightly negative. So if you look at those two items. Plus, there's also some currency mix shift, some of that was caused by the swap as we moved out of dollars into other currencies. But the combination of those two essentially was the mix shift that I was talking about in the earlier question. Brennan Hawken : Okay, got it. And then thinking about loan book and the proportion, can you remind us and maybe update us in so far as how things have changed. How much of that book re-prices in the beginning of the year. How show we think about re-pricing of the loan book as rates continue to -- or assuming rates continue to rise as they are, as the forward curve would suggest, and the potential for that to work its way through, just in thinking about sort of the blocking and tackling of bottling that book for you guys? Thanks. Biff Bowman : Yes, so in terms of the seasonality component you asked first, it's really very modest. I think you're probably better off not thinking about it being that seasonal based on the current loan portfolio as our portfolio has changed over time. I think probably your better indicator is to look at where the loan yields moved sequentially between December and March of this year. And you saw pretty meaningful pickup from the spreads. As you might imagine, our funding for those loans is shorter in nature, kind of overnight to one month kind of LIBOR. And the asset spread has been able to move a little bit faster with some of the widening you've seen based on our funding levels. So I think we -- I would focus more on what you saw sequentially here and think about that as a better indicator of the yield pickups across those loan instruments. The other thing I would say to remember is we have a portfolio where the residential real estate has been in decline now for some time. And it's being replaced by what I would say, or we would call, investment management account secured loans, secured by your portfolio. Those tend to have lower yields. They also have lower credit risks associated with them. So that part needs to be factored into as you think about pricing. Operator : And next from Autonomous Research we'll go to Jeffrey Elliott. Biff Bowman : Hi, Jeffery. Jeffrey Elliott : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Thank you for giving that 5.5% figure for core expense growth. Can you help us think about organic revenue growth, clearly an important target for you to run with that in line with or above expense growth, but what do you think that is right now? Biff Bowman : Yes, in the quarter, we would say it was approximately 5%. And in relations to that 5.5% core that I gave you, remember in that 5.5% core there are some inflationary or inorganic factors, right, our sub custody fees are tied to -- our expenses are tied to market levels. And there are other factors in those expense bases that are -- so we would say our organic expense growth rate is probably a little lower than the 5.5% that I quoted you. But the 5.5% is a good core sort of expense growth rate from our view. And then whatever you want to adjust out of that from your own organic or inorganic. And then on the organic revenue side or fee side -- on the organic fee side, let me be clear, we would say was about 5% in the quarter. Jeffrey Elliott : Thanks very much. And then on the target ROCC range of 10 to 15, clearly this quarter you came ahead of the top end of that range. I mean, how do you think about that in an environment where the tax rate is lower? Is it time to think about moving the 10 to 15 up? Biff Bowman : Yes, I think the change that's happened with the Tax Cut and Jobs Act has caused us to look at target range. And we will go through that process and look at that. We also want to see that unfold for a bit though, right. We're one quarter in. We want to see how the markets react. It is one quarter, as you saw in this quarter. The benefit of that tax cut flowed largely through to our shareholders in this quarter. But I think we'd like to observe the behavior of the competitive landscape for some time. But we are taking all of those factors into play. I do believe this is the kind of secular change, much like when we all had to add capital coming out of the crisis when we revisited our ROE target. This is the type of secular change that causes that revisitation. But we'd like to have some observation of the marketplace to help inform that process. Operator : And next we'll go to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Thanks, good morning. Biff Bowman : Hi, Ken. Ken Usdin : Hey, Biff, how are you doing? Biff, on the capital front you've mentioned the willingness to leverage the balance sheet a little bit more. And then also, given that we've got this notice of proposed rule-making and that you're not a GSIB, can you talk about just how you think that might change your view of what's binding and how much excess capital you truly have to hold versus minimums and versus peers? Does it give you any flexibility upon first glance? Biff Bowman : If I look at the NPR, is it related to, first was the CCAR when that came out, I would say that was largely as we expected. And it basically, I think, is what Governor Tarullo had largely highlighted before. And I would say from our standpoint we're supportive of it. It does increase our flexibility as we think about it around our capital planning. But I don't know that it has a material financial impact to us at all in terms of how we run our business, because we've been operating under the capital rules for a while. In terms of flexibility as I think about leverage and some of the commentary that's come out from the supplementary leverage ratio, we're not bound by that. And that was really something that I think was more impactful to the GSIBs than it was for us. So if they change tier 1 leverage that is currently our binding constraint. So you ask about our capital levels, we would be bound by tier 1 leverage, although not terrible bound by that as you can see from our capital levels. And lastly, Ken, I would end by -- we've just submitted our capital plan, we await the feedback that we will get in June, but we entered that from a position of strength and as we think about the uses of our capital, we can either deploy it on the balance sheet and put it to work or we can return it. We've made an ask to our regulator and we will see how that is opined on. Ken Usdin : Understood. And to that last point, Biff, can you just help us understand how you think about those two factors, the decision tree to use a little bit more leverage and get some NII versus the decision tree to put it into an extra ask if you had extra flexibility. Biff Bowman : Yes, sure. So the first thing we look at is if we're contemplating return, if you think about that we've got a dividend range that we've been comfortable, if you look historically, we talk about in our dividend returns and it's been somewhere in the 30% to 40% dividend payout ratio over time. Then we think about the rest of that return in the form of buyback. When we think about it in the form of buyback, we first look at -- to make sure we offset dilution. As you saw in this quarter, we did a little bit of larger amount of buyback particularly because we've had shareholder dilution that we wanted to offset, but then the second part I think that gets to your question is we look at the return to shareholders. And so if there are internal uses or external uses for that capital to drive a higher shareholder return than a buyback, that's something we contemplate as management do. If we think the buying of shares back is the maximum return, we do that. If we think not buying the shares back and using it as a leverage on the balance sheet is the maximum return, we do that and we weigh all three of those and end up choosing the one that we think is the best return path for our shareholders. Operator : And moving on we'll go to Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : The all-in yield on the securities book came down and governments moving up and everything else moving down, it's a little counterintuitive as people think of high rates and also how much of your business is growing. So maybe we can just get an update on pictures floating in the securities book, what does it float off of, and just if we should expect it to move up from here? Biff Bowman : Yes, so let me walk you through the securities portfolio, because it is an intuitive that it would've gone down, but it'll be, I hope, more intuitive when we walk you through that. First of all, in the securities portfolio, about 16 basis points was premium amortization. So that in itself would've started to move the securities yield to where you wanted. We also had about 5 basis points of drag from FTE, which is offset in the FTE line. But we had about five basis points of drag from that. And then we had about five basis points of drag from the mix shift that I talked about earlier. That was really then offset by about 20 basis points for rates and offset by day count, because obviously we had fewer days, so that improved the securities yield. I hope that's better color, because if you add all of that together, that securities yield very much moved the way you would've thought. In fact, it would've been one of the biggest moves we've seen in the securities yield sequentially. It just was masked somewhat particularly by the premium amortization in the quarter. So I think that's a pretty good walk. Mark Bette : And Glenn, as far as the mix, we would still look at it -- if you look at the portfolio, roughly, half and half the shorter portfolio versus the longer and the shorter would move with both one-month and three-month, with one-month a little bit more weighted than the three-month and then for the longer portfolio, you're looking at two, three, five-year type of maturities overall kind of weighted slightly above one year for the whole portfolio. So hopefully that helps. Operator : And moving on we'll go to Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Michael Carrier : Maybe just one follow-up on the asset yields and then the overall NIM, if I put everything together and just think of a starting point for Q2, is it really just the premium amortization change and I think you mentioned it might've been 7 million yield increase in the first quarter. So should we normalize for that or are there other components you mean that we should be normalizing and thinking about it like a starting point for this second quarter? Mark Bette : Yes, I would say if you think about the NIM sequentially from fourth quarter to the first quarter, the things that impacted it, that you could factor in as the NIM benefited by day count. So there could be some drag, if you will, because the day count will be higher in the second quarter, but that was about 1 basis point. Premium amortization was about seven points of NIM drag in the quarter and then you can subtract what you think is a normalized impact. That's the total impact, but I'll let you do that and then there was some from the FTE adjustment, about two bips of drag and then there was about 5 basis points of that currency and mix shift that I talked about on the balance sheet. But rates themselves probably would've added about 12 bips. If you do all of that math and you go back, I think you can get to probably a NIM that's a better launch point mark. I don't know if you got anything to do with that. Biff Bowman : No, I don't think so. But in reiterating the point that Biff made about the FX trading line, which we had 15 million of benefit there from our treasury swap activity that actually -- if that had not occurred, we estimate we would've had about 10 million more of NIM or net interest income in the quarter, so that was part of that mix change that this highlighted sequentially. Operator : And moving on, we'll go to Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Vivek Juneja : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Can you hear me? Biff Bowman : Yes. Hello. Vivek Juneja : A couple of quick questions, the $250 million cost cuts, Biff, can you give a little more color on it, what are we going to be getting this from, timing, when should we start to -- we were expecting you'll start to give more granularity around this, so\u2026 Biff Bowman : Yes, so as we said in our prepared remarks, in-quarter we had $14 million of savings, which on a run rate basis would be approximately 55. The categories that those savings would've come from were in some cases what we would call \"Organizational alignment,\" that's things like aligning our staff to the right locations, aligning our staff from eliminating redundancy, et cetera. So those programs are under way and they're producing the savings we see. But we also have savings in areas like procurement where we negotiated different contract arrangement with a variety of vendors that also provided some of that $14 million in savings in-quarter. And then we are continuing to get what I would call, \"Process optimization opportunities,\" where we are utilizing robotics and other artificial intelligence opportunities on things like document ingestion et cetera. All of those are starting to contribute to that, and we have a portfolio of opportunities that on a regular basis we will update you with how they help drive those savings. As we said consistently, we anticipate that that savings will be roughly evenly distributed across the 3 years, and as you can see we're off to a pretty good start with $55 million in the first quarter this year. Vivek Juneja : Okay, so when you're saying evenly distributed over three years, let me just clarify, the 250 -- let's say, I'm going to round the number $80-ish million, we should see this year, so it's 14. It's not taking the 55 annualized it's actually 14 plus whatever you get additional in the next quarter and the following three quarters and all of that adding up to 80 or are you talking about some kind of annualized run rate? Mark Bette : Vivek, this is Mark. I think the way you're thinking about it would probably be the right way where you would add up the quarters and the impacts. Again, it's still early in this, it's not going to be a smooth straight line and to the extent that we get more visibility around that as we go, we'll update you, but we do think at this point we're looking at -- the way you outlined it for now is the best way to think about it. Vivek Juneja : Okay, because what I'm trying to understand is how much more incremental this year, given that you are already at annualized 55? Mark Bette : Right. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Secondly, what's your -- go ahead. Mark Bette : Yes, I mean we have planned so far in year saving, so yes, but\u2026 Vivek Juneja : No, no. My point is that the 14 or 15 whatever you want to use it, the annualized is 55 already. So if you were to let say so you have got 25 left, if you were to achieve a little more in the second quarter, you could be done. So is it really just 1/3rd each year, or is that not much this year and therefore the rest there is some -- I am trying to understand is there like a something going on that pushes some of the savings to year two? Or, the interpretation should be more that even if you just simply add $5 million or so per quarter incremental, you could actually be a -- we may be running little bit ahead of the 1/3rd? Biff Bowman : Vivek, I think we have got a portfolio that will unfold over quarters and over years. And we are going to continue to execute on it. I don't think you should interpret that we are largely done for the year because we are at 55. I think you should anticipate that we will give you updates. And we are continuing to progress on our portfolio of opportunities. Operator : And moving on, we will go to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Biff Bowman : Hi, Mike. Mike Mayo : Hi, just following up on the last question. So, your pre-tax margin of 33% is the highest in several years. Do you expect the pre-tax margin to stay at that level? Or, is there more investment spending that we should expect going forward? Biff Bowman : We are going to continue to try to drive the profitability in the firm in all of the key metrics. If we continue we think to drive that expense to fee ratio even harder that we think we can improve that pre-tax margin over time. But -- and we think our current plans we have -- we can both execute on value per spend and have investment opportunities inside of our business. So, we do think there is still some opportunities to improve both. We moved meaningfully this quarter as you saw in that expense to fees, but we do think there is opportunities. As you saw in our wealth business actually improved its margin meaningfully in the quarter as did our C&IS business. So, yes, we do. We think there is opportunities. Mike Mayo : And is the expense to fee ratio is still the right measure has opposed to expenses to total revenues? I mean you get paid in compensating balances and a period of higher rates. I mean at some point do you want to look at that more holistically? And then one of your competitors recently said let's look at performance excluding the market impact. Just questioning whether you are exploring some alternative ratios to evaluate your performance? Biff Bowman : Yes. Good question. So, I would say there's not one absolute perfect ratio. But given that fees are our largest revenue line, we've kind of anchored to the expense to fees as an important ratio. We absolutely though care about operating leverage to your point as well because obviously we saw the power of net interest income and foreign exchange flowing through the revenues. And we are not dismissive of that. So we do look at operating leverage. But we look at core fee operating leverage because FX and to some degree net interest income can have a bit more volatility to those earnings stream. In terms of the second part of the question around the organic, we've been talking for several years now about how important we think the organic growth rate is in the firm. And so, we do internally look to at what type of leverage we are getting organically. So how are we growing our fees versus our expenses on a more organic basis, we have not published anything about that externally. But I would say that is absolutely internally one of our key drivers and metrics. It's something that I can tell you that management team and our board look at not only our absolute financial performance, but they look at the organic performance on a regular basis. And that's the way we report it to them so they can understand what management drove versus what the macro environment drove. And under consideration, they both are impactful to our business. Operator : And our final question will come from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Biff Bowman : Hi, Marty. Marty Mosby : Hi, Biff, thanks for taking the question. I want to drill in on this premium amortization and think of a more as you roll forward because when rates are low, you have to buy securities that have premiums and not just because rates are rolling lower. So, it kind of just creates that phenomenon. Now, rates are going higher so those securities you can buy really won't have that kind of premium. So, as you are thinking of this rolling off, you have such a short duration, this premium amortization while a new setup in a negative to net interest income has a finite life and should be kind of replaced with bonds that don't have as much premium on them. So, you could think of this in a year all of sudden this $19 million that goes to 12 goes to 0 in a reasonable period of time. So, just want to see what you thought about that? Biff Bowman : Yes. So, as we said it was 19 in the quarter because to the tru-up it was we think we 10 to 12 going forward. To your point, it depends on where we are buying those instruments. If your premise which is right quantitatively if that continues, then we could potentially be buying in that lower premiums which could move that 10 to 12 and will give you updates if we think it moves off of that. I would also say though another factor, Marty, is if we change the total amount of those securities that we hold on our portfolio, so even though it may be a lower amortized amount, it's on a bigger balance that could indeed create that still $10 million to $12 million range. We will give updates. But, right now our best thinking on that based on the current environment is in that $10 million to $12 million range for premium amortization. Marty Mosby : And the securities that you are buying now, do they still have like you said the securities get bigger but they will have significant less premium than what you bought over the last couple of years I would think. Biff Bowman : I don't know that for certain that would make intuitive sense to me, but we would have to confirm that you after the point because I don't -- it makes sense from where you describe it from the rate environment. That makes sense. Mathematically, I don't know if the team is buying portfolio -- if the team is buying instruments that have some different kind of premium amortization profile than what markets would suggest. I would guess not. My guess is your premise would be right. Operator : Thank you. And that does conclude our question-and-answer session as well as our conference. Once again, we thank you for joining us for the Northern Trust Corporation first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions]. Thank you again for joining us today. Let me turn the call over to Biff Bowman. Stephen Bowman : Good morning, everyone. Let me join Mark in welcoming you to our second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Starting on Page 2 of our quarterly earnings review presentation. This morning, we reported second quarter net income of $390.4 million. Earnings per share were $1.68 and our return on common equity was 16.5%. As noted on the second page of our earnings release, this quarter's results included $6.6 million of severance-related and restructuring charges. The quarter also included $22.1 million in fee revenue and $21.8 million in expense related to our acquisition of UBS Asset Management's fund administration units in Luxembourg and Switzerland, which closed at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2017. Included in the $21.8 million in expense was $2.6 million relating to integration activity. Before going through our results in detail, I would like to comment on some macro factors impacting our business during the quarter. Equity markets had a mixed impact for us during the quarter. End-of-period markets were favorable on a year-over-year basis with the S&P 500 and MSCI EAFE Indices increasing 12.2% and 3.3%, respectively. On a sequential basis, both indices increased with the S&P 500 up 2.9% and the EAFE up about 2.5%. Average daily markets for these indices were slightly lower on a sequential basis. As you will recall, some of our fees are also are based on lagged pricing. And in the prior quarter, the S&P 500 was down 1.2% while the EAFE was down 5.1%. The markets were also lower for some of our month-lagged pricing. Short-term interest rates continued to increase during the quarter driven by a rate hike from the Federal Reserve. Currency rates influenced a translation of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar and, therefore, impact client assets and certain revenues and expenses. Both the British pound and euro ended the quarter up 2% versus the prior year as compared to the U.S. dollar, favorably impacting revenue, but negatively impacting expense. On a sequential basis, the British pound and euro declined 6% and 5%, respectively, compared to the U.S. dollar. The sequential changes had an unfavorable impact to revenue and a favorable impact to expense. Let's move to Page 3 and review the financial highlights of the second quarter. Year-over-year, revenue increased 14% with noninterest income up 12% and net interest income up 21%. Expenses increased 6% from last year. The provision for credit losses was $1.5 million versus a credit of $7 million 1 year ago. Net income was 46% higher year-over-year. In the sequential comparison, revenue was up 2% with noninterest income flat and net interest income up 8%. Expenses were essentially flat compared to the prior quarter. Net income was 2% higher sequentially. Return on average common equity was at 16.5% for the quarter, up from 11.6% 1 year ago and up from 16% in the prior quarter. Assets under custody and administration of $10.7 trillion increased 15% compared to 1 year ago and decreased slightly on a sequential basis. Included in assets under custody/administration is $575 billion relating to the acquisition of UBS Asset Management's fund administration units in Luxembourg and Switzerland. Assets under custody of $8.1 trillion increased 10% compared to 1 year ago and were flat on a sequential basis. The year-over-year growth was driven by favorable market impacts and new business. On a sequential basis, the benefits from favorable markets and new business were offset by unfavorable moves in currency exchange rates. Assets under management were $1.1 trillion, up 12% year-over-year and down 1% on a sequential basis. The year-over-year increase was driven by favorable markets and new business flows while, sequentially, the decline was primarily relating to lower end-of-period securities lending collateral levels as well as unfavorable moves in currency exchange rates. Let's look at the results in greater detail, starting with revenue on Page 4. Second quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $1.5 billion, up 14% from last year and up 2% sequentially. Excluding the acquisition, revenue was up 12% from last year. The favorable translation impact of changes in currency rates benefited year-over-year revenue growth by approximately 0.5%. Trust, investment and other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue and were $943 million in the second quarter, up 11% year-over-year and up 1% from the prior quarter. Excluding the UBS acquisition, fees were up 9% on a year-over-year basis. Foreign exchange trading income was $79 million in the second quarter, up 58% year-over-year and flat sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher client volumes and increased foreign exchange swap activity in our Treasury department. Volatility, as measured by the G7 Index, was down both on a year-over-year and sequential basis. Other noninterest income was $71 million in the second quarter, down 13% compared to 1 year ago and down 6% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to nonrecurring net hedge gains recognized in the prior year and a decline in the current quarter relating to the valuation of existing swap agreements related to Visa Inc.'s Class B common shares. The Visa swap evaluations were also the key contributor of the sequential decline. Net interest income, which I will discuss in more detail later, was $423 million in the second quarter, increasing 21% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. Let's look at the components of our trust and investment fees on Page 5. For our Corporate & Institutional Services business, fees totaled $552 million in the second quarter, up 13% year-over-year and up 1% on a sequential basis. The quarter included $22.1 million in fees relating to the acquisition of UBS Asset Management's fund administration units in Luxembourg and Switzerland. Excluding these fees, C&IS fees were up 9% compared to the prior year. The favorable translation impact of changes in currency rates benefited year-over-year C&IS fees by approximately 1%. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees, were $377 million, up 15% compared to the prior year and up 1% sequentially. This line does include the UBS acquisition-related fees. Excluding these fees, custody and fund administration fees were up 8% compared to the prior year. The year-over-year growth was driven by new business, favorable currency translation and markets. The sequential increase was primarily driven by new business, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation and lower markets. Assets under custody/administration for C&IS clients were $10.1 trillion at quarter-end, up 16% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. These results include $575 billion relating to the UBS fund administration acquisition. Year-over-year, excluding the acquisition, the increases primarily reflect favorable markets and new business. Sequentially, the benefit of markets and new business were offset by unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates. Recall that lagged market values factor into the quarter's fees with both quarter-lagged and month-lagged markets impacting our C&IS custody and fund administration fees. Investment management fees in C&IS of $113 million in the second quarter were up 14% year-over-year and up 3% sequentially. The year-over-year and sequential growth were both impacted by new business as well as a change to gross revenue presentation for certain clients. Markets had a favorable impact to the year-over-year growth, but had an unfavorable impact on a sequential basis. There was a corresponding increase to third-party advisor cost in outside services expense as a result of the change to gross revenue presentation. Assets under management for C&IS clients were $862 billion, up 13% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially. Favorable market impacts and net new business were the drivers of the year-over-year growth, while the sequential decline was driven by a lower level of end-of-period securities lending collateral as well as unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates. Securities lending fees were $30 million in the second quarter, up 23% year-over-year and 16% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, higher volumes were partially offset by lower spreads. For the sequential comparison, higher spreads were the primary driver of growth. Securities lending collateral was $174 billion at quarter-end and averaged $184 billion across the quarter. Average collateral levels increased 38% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Other fees in C&IS were $32 million in the second quarter, down 10% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. The year-over-year decline reflects lower sub-advisor fees. The income associated with sub-advisor fees has an associated lower expense in outside service category. This decline in sub-advisor fees is consistent with the prior 2 quarters when we discontinued the service offering. The sequential decline was primarily attributable to seasonally higher benefit payment fees in the first quarter of each year. Moving to our Wealth Management business. Trust, investment and other servicing fees were $391 million in the second quarter, up 8% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. Within Wealth Management, the Global Family Office business fees increased 11% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was driven by new business and favorable markets while the sequential performance was driven by new business, partially offset by unfavorable markets. Within the regions, the year-over-year growth was driven by favorable markets, higher fees resulting from the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard and new business. Sequential performance was impacted by unfavorable month-lagged markets. Assets under management for Wealth Management clients were $287 billion at quarter-end, up 8% year-over-year and down slightly sequentially. Moving to Page 6. Net interest income was $423 million in the second quarter, up 21% year-over-year. Earning assets averaged $114 billion in the second quarter, up 4% versus last year. Total deposits averaged $96 billion and were down 1% year-over-year. Interest-bearing deposits increased 1% from 1 year ago to $74 billion. This growth was offset by a 9% decline in noninterest-bearing deposits, which averaged $21 billion during the second quarter. Loan balances averaged $32 billion in the second quarter and were down 5% compared to 1 year ago. The net interest margin was 1.48% in the second quarter and was up 20 basis points from a year ago. The improvement in net interest margin compared to the prior year primarily reflects the impact of higher short-term interest rates, partially offset by a balance sheet mix shift. On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income was up $30 million or 8%. Average earning assets declined 1% sequentially driven by decreases in deposits, partially offset by higher short-term borrowing. On a sequential basis, the net interest margin increased 10 basis points, primarily driven by the benefit of higher short-term interest rates as well as lower premium amortization. You will recall that premium amortization totaled $19 million in the first quarter as we shifted our remaining life assumption estimation methodology. That change will lead to a more consistent quarterly amount that we expect to be within the $10 million to $12 million range going forward. The prior quarter's results included a onetime $7 million true-up adjustment to align the remaining amortization. The current quarter reflects the new methodology with premium amortization at the lower end of the $10 million to $12 million range. Looking at the currency mix of our balance sheet for the second quarter, U.S. dollar deposits represented 69% of our total deposits. This compared to 71% 1 year ago and is unchanged from the prior quarter. Turning to Page 7. Expenses were $997 million in the second quarter and were 6% higher than the prior year and up slightly on a sequential basis. As previously mentioned, the current quarter included $21.8 million in expenses associated with the UBS acquisition. The current quarter also included $6.6 million in expense associated with severance and other charges. For comparison purposes, note that 1 year ago, our results included severance and other charges of $22.8 million while the prior quarter included $8.6 million. Excluding both the UBS acquisition and called out expense items, expense for the current quarter was 6% higher than a year ago. Excluding charges in both the current and prior quarter, expenses was up slightly. Now, keeping to total noninterest expense, I would like to break down the year-over-year growth further. Starting with the adjusted 6% year-over-year increase, approximately 0.5 point of growth was from the unfavorable translation impact of changes in currency rates, primarily the British pound and the euro. Excluding currency impact therefore, our year-over-year expense growth rate was approximately 5.5%. With respect to the remaining increase in year-over-year expense growth, the following items were key drivers within the category, compensation was higher driven by increased incentive compensation and this year's base pay adjustments, which were effective in April. The impact of staff growth on salaries was more than offset by staff actions and our ongoing location strategy efforts. Benefits were higher primarily due to an increase in retirement plan expenses, medical cost and higher payroll tax withholding compared to the prior year. Outside service costs were higher, driven primarily by higher third-party advisor fees, sub-custodian costs and technical services, partially offset by lower consulting and sub-advisor costs. There was a corresponding increase to trust, investment and servicing fees as a result of the higher third-party advisor fees due to the change to gross revenue presentation. Equipment and software expense was up year-over-year due to higher software amortization costs. Occupancy-related costs were higher compared to the prior year, primarily due to accelerated depreciation related to a previously announced facility exit in one of our Chicago locations. Other operating expenses were lower than the prior year, primarily driven by a lower level of charges associated with accounting -- account servicing activities, lower FDIC costs and lower staff relocation expense, partially offset by higher business promotion costs. Shifting to the sequential expense view. Excluding the expense charges in both the current and prior quarter, expenses were up slightly. Compensation expense declined sequentially primarily reflecting lower expenses related to long-term performance-based incentive compensation resulting from higher charges recorded in the prior quarter associated with incentive grants to retirement-eligible employees. This quarter's compensation included $11 million in expense associated with retirement-eligible staff versus $32 million in the prior quarter. Partially offsetting the decline from equity-based compensation were higher accruals for cash-based incentives and the impact of base pay adjustments, which were effective April 1. The impact of the base pay adjustments on salaries was partially offset by staff actions and our ongoing location strategy efforts. Outside service costs were up sequentially primarily relating to higher levels of third-party advisor fees, technical service, consulting cost and sub-custody expense. Equipment and software expenses were higher sequentially primarily due to increased software amortization and software support costs. Other operating expense increased from the prior period primarily due to higher business promotional spend and staff-related costs, partially offset by lower FDIC and other miscellaneous expenses within the category. Staff levels increased approximately 4% year-over-year and less than 1% sequentially. Approximately 1/2 of the year-over-year staff growth was the impact of the UBS acquisition. The remainder of the growth was all attributable to staff increases in lower-cost locations which include India, Manila, Limerick, Ireland and Tempe, Arizona, partially offset by reductions in our higher-cost locations. Turning to Page 8. As we have discussed on previous calls, through our Value for Spend initiative, we are realigning our expense base with the goal of realizing $250 million in expense run rate savings by 2020. Concurrently, we are betting a sustainable expense management approach. We expect these efforts to slow our expense growth to be more closely aligned with our organic fee growth. Our second quarter results reflect approximately $23 million in expense savings, reducing the year-over-year expense growth rate by approximately 2.5 points. This would equate to approximately $92 million on an annualized basis against the $250 million goal. I'd like to highlight a few examples of our progress to-date for you. We continue enhancing productivity by leveraging automation technologies such as robotics to increase efficiency of existing processes within our fund accounting and transfer agency businesses and we have optimized the organization of technology and operations to streamline processes and decision-making, enhance productivity and more closely align these functions within our clients' needs. We continue to cultivate a healthy pipeline of opportunities. Turning to Page 9. A key focus has been on sustainably enhancing profitability and returns. This slide reflects the progress we have made in recent years to improve the expense-to-fee ratio, pretax margin and, ultimately, our return on equity. The ratio of expenses to fees is a particularly important measure of our progress as it addresses what we can most directly control. Reducing this measure from where it was previously, as high as 131% in 2011, to the levels we see today is a key contributor to the improvement in our pretax margin and, ultimately, our return on equity. Turning to Page 10. Our capital ratios remained strong with Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 13.2% under the advanced approach and 12.4% under the standardized approach. The supplementary leverage ratio of the corporation was 6.8% and at the bank was 6.2%, both of which exceed the 3% requirement to become -- that became applicable to Northern Trust effective at the start of the year. With respect to the liquidity coverage ratio, Northern Trust is above the 100% minimum requirement that became effective at the start of 2017. As Northern Trust progresses through fully phased-in Basel III implementation, there could be additional enhancements to our models and further guidance from the regulators on the implementation of the final rule, which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final Basel III rules. In the second quarter, we repurchased 1.8 million shares of common stock at a cost of $191 million. As we announced in June, our 2018 capital plan received no objection from the Federal Reserve. In it, we requested authority to increase our quarterly common dividend 31% to $0.55 per share. Yesterday, our Board of Directors formally approved the planned dividend increase. The capital plan also provides the flexibility to repurchase up to $1 billion of common stock. The timing and amount of shares repurchased will depend on various factors, including but not limited to Northern Trust's business plans, financial performance, other investment opportunities and general market conditions, including share price. In closing, Northern Trust continued to deliver solid financial results in the quarter, growing earnings per share 50% over the prior year and achieving return on average common equity of 16.5%. Our assets under custody/administration and assets under management were up 15% and 12%, respectively, versus the prior year. Importantly, as we seek to drive profitable growth, we delivered positive operating leverage and positive fee operating leverage both on a year-over-year and a sequential basis. On an organic basis, our fee and expense growth rates were better aligned. Profitability continues to be strong in each of our businesses. Our Wealth Management business grew pretax income by 16% versus 1 year ago while improving the pretax margin from 39% to 41%. Our C&IS business similarly drove strong year-over-year performance with pretax income growing 41% and the pretax margin improving from 28% to 33%. Both businesses delivered strong year-over-year operating and fee operating leverage. This year's THE NORTHERN TRUST will again kick off the FedExCup Playoffs August 21 through 26 at Ridgewood Country Club in Paramus, New Jersey. THE NORTHERN TRUST Tournament remains a strategic asset for us as we continue to grow our business in the Northeast and, in particular, the greater New York area. Last year's business promotion expense increased approximately $17 million sequentially in the third quarter and we would expect a similar trend this year. Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust's second quarter earnings conference call today. Mark and I would be happy to answer your questions. Jonathan, please open the line. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Maybe just to start out with the balance sheet and just look at sort of the growth maybe on a year-over-year basis. The deposit levels have come down a little bit on a year-over-year basis. Maybe if you can just talk about sort of what you're seeing on deposit behavior in the Wealth Management segment and -- versus your C&IS segment and think about how we should think about balance sheet growth going forward given you certainly have a lot of capacity -- capital capacity. And then, your use of borrowed funds as well does -- have doubled on a year-over-year basis, so maybe just talk about the strategy behind that as well. Stephen Bowman : Okay. I'll start with question one around the balance sheet and the growth and I'll focus first on the Wealth Management deposits. We have seen that level come down a bit. I think it's -- there are a couple of factors that we would highlight there. First is, obviously, we've moved into an increasing rate environment. And those clients, particularly our clients at the higher end of the wealth spectrum, have an array of opportunities to invest their cash. It could be on our balance sheet and we do what we can to provide competitive pricing and opportunity on our balance sheet, but they also may be looking at cash funds and/or other investments to deploy their cash. So when we've seen that -- over the span of a year, we've seen those balances move. Most of those, more than half, about 2/3 have moved somewhere inside of The Northern Trust into either cash funds or other products and capabilities where we've seen those move internally. The second thing on the deposit side which we see sequentially in the second quarter is we do see some sequential moves for tax purposes and that's -- we've seen that seasonally in the past. So on the Wealth deposits, while we've seen some of that come down on the Wealth side, it's really the deployment of that and, in some cases, that just moved from balance sheet to other funds at The Northern Trust. Some, approximately 1/3 or so as we described it, could have moved to other products somewhere outside of The Northern. We remain competitive. We track our peer set closely and do what we can to ensure that our pricing remains competitive to attract and pay on those wealth deposits because they're very valuable deposits as you know. On the institutional side, I would say that those deposit balances can demonstrate a little more volatility based on, A, our growth profile. We grow and they go up, but those are large sophisticated asset owners who may deploy those assets into the market at any time -- an opportune time. A meaningful portion are very operational in nature, but we can see some movement in that from quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year. The pricing on those, the competitive nature of the pricing on those, we have fewer competitors than we do in the Wealth, but it's a little less transparent. So we monitor and have dialogues with our clients and do what we can to price those deposits appropriately. As you might imagine, some clients are on pre-negotiated rates and some are on standard rate cards. And again, we monitor that closely. We're competitive in the world in deposits and we will be in both spaces and continue to be competitive. I think, generally, the growth on our balance sheet that we've seen over time has just been the success of our business growth strategy. You've seen high single to low double-digit growth rates in our firm and fees and that generally manifest itself in, over time, a growing balance sheet. Mark Bette : Short-term funds. Stephen Bowman : And then short-term borrowed funds, the second part of that, I would say what we do -- because of our strong capital levels, we have the ability to do some discretionary leveraging, which does produce incremental net interest income for our shareholders. And given our financial strength and the leverage or lack of leverage constraints that we have as you see in our results, it's allowed us to utilize that. It can have the added benefit, the borrowed funds, of helping the LCR as we manage that so it does add to that. Those borrowed funds where we typically borrow can have the added benefit of helping out on the LCR as well. Brian Bedell : That's super helpful. And maybe just a follow-up, just the organic growth, we've had -- obviously had some headwinds on the FX side and the market returns were mixed on a sequential basis, but if we look at the actual AUM in Wealth Management, if you can just talk about your general organic growth in Wealth Management maybe in the second quarter versus, say, to the first quarter and a year-over-year basis? Stephen Bowman : Yes. I'll start maybe -- well, I'll talk the whole firm first. The organic growth rate, which we fairly consistently have been talking about in fees, has been -- we've talked about in the mid-single digits. Let's call it the 4% to 5% range. We, again, had a quarter where we were in that range, we saw. Specifically to Wealth, we did see some slowing of the organic growth rate in Wealth from first to second quarter and, again, that was impacted less by gross new business than it was by flows. And the flows, if we think about it, can have things like tax payments in the first quarter when -- early second quarter, excuse me, on tax day and/or deployment of that cash and/or investment in the markets and/or potentially even loan pay downs as second homes or other items have become less tax-attractive. Those combined could create some flow pressures on values and AUM inside of our portfolios, but generally, the gross new business portion of that organic growth continue to be very strong in the business. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Michael Carrier : Maybe just one more on the net interest revenue outlook. Just how should we be thinking about it for the rest of the year in terms of balance sheet growth given that it doesn't seem like maybe there's a lot of demand, but you're able to use the short-term funding? And then, if we do get another rate hike, what's the expectations in terms of that flowing through either to the NIM? Stephen Bowman : Yes. So we obviously don't give guidance, but if I look at the impacts of a future hike, what I would say is the first thing we've got to look at is the asset side of the balance sheet for us. And I would say you can see that we remain asset-sensitive. We are heavily impacted by short-term rates, 1-month LIBOR primarily and three months LIBOR moving. So if those move up with a rate hike, which they would likely, the asset sensitivity remains in the balance sheet as you can see via a relatively low duration. So I think the asset side still has sensitivity to rate moves. Then we go to the important factor, which is what happens with the liability pricing in that. And what I would just say there is we're doing our best to be both disciplined in our pricing on the liability side, but we also need to be competitive. So we have to be both. And you have a view on what the competition is doing and others do. We monitor them as well and we remain competitive. It's important for us to be competitive in that landscape. I think we want to be a disciplined firm. I think you can see that in our betas and others, but we also have to be competitive. Our clients expect and deserve competitive rates and we will be mindful of the market when we do that. So the betas haven't reached one. So they are expensive to at least the NIM. And then the second part of your question was on the balance sheet side. That's a reflection of our new business opportunities and some of the nuances of where our clients are either deploying cash or elsewhere. So I'm certainly not going to be able to give you a projection on that, but I did give you some of our thinking on how we think the asset and liability side could move. Michael Carrier : Got it, okay. And just as a follow-up, on the FX -- on the trading income, you mentioned the swaps again this quarter. Just, I don't know if you mentioned the magnitude, but just wanted to get some color because we saw the activity. But maybe like -- I know it's volatile [indiscernible] lumpy in the quarter. Stephen Bowman : Yes. So you're right. So if we looked at our FX total of $78 million, $79 million, approximately $18 million of that was from the treasury swap. But remember, as we said last quarter -- and that was largely swapping dollars into euros, and that drove a positive FX variance. As you might imagine, that actually hurt or suppressed net interest income to the tune of about $14 million. So the trade produced $18 million of FX at the expense, if you will, of $14 million of NII. That trade, if you look at sort of a euro-dollar swap kind of curve or something like that, you can see that spread has narrowed some. So it is possible that in the quarter, if that maintains, you could see some redistribution between FX, that $18 million in NII in the quarter. We'll provide better color later in the quarter as we see that unfold. So I would say that's generally what we've seen on the FX trade. Our core FX supporting our clients was actually up 20% year-over-year when we look at what we would consider our traditional FX support of our asset servicing business as well. So good trends in both of those components. Operator : Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alexander Blostein : So a question on expenses for you guys. So I heard your $92 million of annualized kind of run rate expenses [indiscernible] $250 million in 2Q. I think that's up from $55 million last quarter. So I guess, can you walk us through the pace of realizations for the remaining of this year and how we should be thinking about it for 2019? And I guess, secondly, as I think about it, I guess, sort of the jumping off point for expenses, backing out severance, it looks like you guys are around $990 million for this quarter. Other than the Northern Open, is there anything else we need to be mindful of as we think about 3Q expenses specifically? Stephen Bowman : So I'll take those in two parts, right? The first is on Value for Spend and the run rate. Alex, the answer on that is we continue to have a really strong pipeline of opportunities to get after, and we're getting after it as fast as we can. So the pacing of that, you did see some acceleration in there. And the team here remains focused on getting after it as fast as we can. I know we have talked about it being fairly evenly distributed over three years. We're going as fast as we can. And if we exceed that expectation, we're happy. But we also are getting after some of the things that have the quickest and -- I won't say easy because none of them were easy, but the fastest return. But we continue to look at an array of opportunities. So we think and are committed to that $250 million. So can't give you much more on that front. In terms of the third quarter, we gave you the Northern Trust Open. I would say the only other item in the quarter is we have actually some modest decline in equity incentives from, I think, we had 11 in this quarter, Mark... Mark Bette : That's right. Stephen Bowman : And then we should see some modest decline in the equity incentives as they ratchet down during the course of the year. I'd say other than that, it would be nothing that you wouldn't jump off. And your run rate of jumping off at $991 million was $990 million, $991 million is reasonable. Alexander Blostein : Got it, great. And then just as a quick follow-up on cost but slightly on the cost. Credit, not a huge deal, obviously, but we've seen you guys put up a negative provision for many quarters. The first time it turned positive. Obviously, credit remains quite benign. So maybe just kind of what's going on there would be helpful. Stephen Bowman : Yes. So we had one credit that we had a specific reserve for that drove it, one individual credit. So we would not see any trends unique, and credit quality remains at a very strong and positive levels. And that's about all I could say that we have very, very strong credit quality right now in the cycle. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Kenneth Usdin : Just one more question on the expense growth rate. So you showed on the slide 6% year-over-year growth, and I believe that would also be inclusive of the change in accounting presentation. Stephen Bowman : Yes. Kenneth Usdin : So I'm just trying to understand if you adjust for that change in FX translation what you really saw as the underlying core growth rate in expenses on a year-over-year basis? Stephen Bowman : Yes. Ken, let me walk you through that real quick, if I could. I think that's a good question. If we took the charges out of the second quarter from last year and the charges out of this quarter, we think the expense growth rate would have been closer to 8%. I would take two points of that out for UBS is attributable to UBS. Currency is about 0.5 point. And then revenue recognition or net to gross presentation, however you want to call it, is about another point of that. And that point is also offset by some of our... Mark Bette : On the fee side... Stephen Bowman : No, while it's offset on the fee side, it's what we got out of in our GFS business. Mark Bette : Subadvisory. Stephen Bowman : Excuse me, subadvisory, thank you. So if you do that walk, Ken, you go from 8% down to about 4.5% as a core expense growth rate in our expenses. So that [indiscernible] rev rec or subadvisory, yes. Kenneth Usdin : Okay, got it. And that's all right. And then that's a -- well, we'll see what happens going forward to your points about the comp comparisons, but Northern Trust and the comps [indiscernible] those are year-over-year things that were already in there, right? So it's really just about how the business grows in terms of that rate of growth from here? Stephen Bowman : Yes. Mark Bette : That's right. Stephen Bowman : That's right. Kenneth Usdin : Okay, perfect. Great. And then just a question on just core business and wins and such. Obviously, the markets were down, so -- and it looked like the global piece was more of a negative in terms of the AUC, unless I look at the global assets under custody. Can you just talk us through just what type of win quarter it was in terms of new assets put on? And any updates on your just kind of underlying growth pipeline will be great. Stephen Bowman : Yes, we continue across both businesses to see a strong new business opportunities, and we highlight some of those with press releases, very strong. In the AUC piece, particularly the sequential comparator, the currency was really a pretty meaningful driver of what was flattish sequential. It was, I think, about two points of a currency impact. As you remember, we have a fairly significant global custody asset mix of our AUC, so we have a lot in other currencies. I think about 65% is in dollars but 35% isn't. And so the currency impact was pretty meaningful. So I know you asked about the new business trends, but in the AUC specifically, I would say that the currency was a meaningful driver. It more than offset market and new business uplifts in the quarter. We continue to have a significant pipelines and healthy, healthy growth opportunities in both businesses. Operator : Our next question comes from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Marlin Mosby : So you know where I'm heading. If you look at your NII number, it only represents 28% of your revenues, but it actually generates about 82% of your bottom line pretax profit. So it's a pretty important portion of what you manage. We've got the data now that show that look, interest-bearing deposits rates haven't increased precipitously. You may get a little bit more as we think you will get elasticity from here forward, so you'll get that low curve. DDAs have been relatively sticky, so there's not like they're running off in big portions. And yet, we still have $25 billion sitting in cash, and we got a duration on our securities portfolio that's probably about a year and a half. So at some point in the cycle, we need to defend against the next cycle, which is when rates come down and which that 82% of our profits get squeezed. So I just wanted to kind of put that back out there again and see how you're thinking about that now [indiscernible] what timing of that you might be looking at. Stephen Bowman : Yes, thank you, Marty. Well, what I would say is all of the points you made are factors that we contemplate in our ALCO committee. And we meet regularly, and we think about duration management. We think about liquidity management. We think about credit and quality in the portfolio. We have active and regular dialogues. And I'm certainly mindful of your views on those, and we continue to have active debates about what we should be doing to that portion of the balance sheet on a regular basis. So appreciate your comments. Marlin Mosby : And you've been continuing to roll the expenses relative to your core business -- core fees down. So where you were -- expenses are still 6% higher, but that is significantly better than what we've seen in the past. The efforts that you have should continue to push that ratio closer to 100%, I would expect, over the next couple of years. So that's the other piece of the initiative that really does create a lot of leverage to the income statement. Stephen Bowman : Yes. We're internally very focused on that measure because we think the majority of our expenses -- the majority, not all, but the majority of our expenses are tied to generating trust fees. So we think it's a very prudent measure. It's not a perfect measure, but it's a very prudent pressure to look at operating leverage in our business and performance leverage in our business, and we continue to drive that down. If you did the calculation in our Wealth Management business, you will see it's actually sub that 100%, and you see that manifest in 41% pretax margin in that business. But there's still opportunity left in there, and we talked about that a little bit in our Value for Spend options, our opportunities, and we're committed to continue to focus on that and drive it to the best levels we can. Marlin Mosby : That's been impressive improvement, so appreciate that. And that other leverage piece we have on the balance sheet with 3% yields out there in the marketplace, there's a lot of income that can still be kind of garnered through this process and yet still derisk and not risk the balance sheet anymore. Stephen Bowman : Thank you, Marty. Operator : Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Apologize if you hit on this before. I don't think you did. Any update on the -- I think you've previously called it the $5 billion to $6 billion of nonoperating balances [indiscernible] interest-bearing deposits. Stephen Bowman : Yes, and we haven't commented on it. We continue to have regular dialogues with those because those are typically large clients that are associated with our GFS business, our Global Fund Services business. And we have regular dialogues. It has remained at that level for 4 to 5 quarters now, so we think that at least a pretty meaningful portion of that is there for operational or other liquidity needs. We haven't seen that move. It could. We talked about that. So I can't predict. But in our regular dialogues with our relationship people and the owners of those balances, they continue to seem to need them there for liquidity and/or other strategic investment purposes. So they're ready to go. So we've -- we haven't seen that change now for 4 quarters. Brennan Hawken : Okay, that's encouraging. And then thinking about -- I believe you said that 69% or so of the deposits are not in U.S. dollar. Are you still mostly pound oriented? Can you remind us of that mix? And then how should we think about -- from what we hear, expectations are pretty good for an August rate hike from the BOE. How should we think about that? How should we think about expectations for beta given that the Bank of England is still in very much the early stages of raising rates? Stephen Bowman : Yes. So to clarify, 69% of our deposits are in dollars. I think you said aren't... Brennan Hawken : Yes, sorry, sorry. I got it backwards. Stephen Bowman : Yes. 69% are in dollars. So the 31% that aren't, I think, pound is our largest next balance 12%... Mark Bette : About 12%. Stephen Bowman : Of ours, and then euro would be next. But to your specific question then around the BOE rate rise, look, our clients that are -- that we have that have pound balances, we would benefit from another hike from the BOE. Our betas are not one there. Again, as I said earlier, we have clients in all currencies that are on what I would say more negotiated rates, and then we've got some that are on standard rate cards. The standard rate card's betas would be more preestablished. And then the majority that are on select rates, we would -- are on standard rates, excuse me, would be able to affect the beta through the cycle. Still coming off of a pretty low base. So if it behaves like it has in the U.S., there should be some opportunity there for expansion. Operator : Our next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Geoffrey Elliott : You've now have been above the top end of the 10% to 15% ROE range for a couple of quarters. Can you give us an update on what you're thinking there given lower taxes? And we seem to be in a bit of a higher rate environment when you were kind of down at the lower end or even below the lower end of the range a few years ago. Stephen Bowman : Yes, so we don't have any change or nothing that we would comment on as of today. But we continue to look at this, and we'll keep you posted. I think, the one item that you pointed out in there that we look at is a truly secular change is if the tax rate is changed. So that will certainly be one of the important factors as we consider that range that we will contemplate. And a quick example would be, in this quarter, you can do this calculation, but effectively, it added about 1.7 points of ROE. So ex that, we would have been at the very high end of our existing 10% to 15% range. But as I said, we'll keep you posted as we look at that. Geoffrey Elliott : What's kind of held you back from changing that sooner? I guess, we're kind of 7 months post tax reform now, and the tax impact at least is fairly mechanical. So what stops you coming straight out and adding 1.7 points or whatever the number is to that range? Stephen Bowman : I think, Geoff, your comment assumes that all of those dollars flow through. The competitive landscape didn't change. The people didn't choose to price that away. We're six months into the tax reform here [indiscernible] perspective. And our view is we certainly wanted to observe how the tax reform was absorbed into the economy and to our clients and to our P&L before we raise to make those changes because you don't know exactly how it would end up flowing through financial statements until you looked at the competitive landscape. We're taking that time to observe that, absorb it and observe it, and then have the right strategic dialogues with all of our key constituents. Operator : Our next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Vivek Juneja : Couple of questions. So I want to go back to the short-term borrowings leverage question. I guess, try and look -- try a different tack. How much more leverage can you add here? How much more room do you have? Stephen Bowman : Well, that's a complicated question in this sense as some of that borrowing that we do is, I will say, dry powder that we want available for liquidity purposes and others. So we don't always necessarily want to tap that fully because we like it available for other reasons in the marketplace. The second is as you might imagine, that is -- it has somewhat constrained the NIM. It is producing incremental NII, which I know is valuable. But we do look at the overall balance of that and then we do also look at leverage ratio and others, which we're not terribly tight on, as you say, but we do evaluate all those factors when we look at the amount of discretionary leveraging we choose to do. Vivek Juneja : And would you say you still can bump this up a little bit further? Stephen Bowman : Our ratios would allow it, but we have to put it into the calculus that I just gave you where we're looking a whole series of factors, like liquidity and other items. So we can move it around and contemplate that from quarter-to-quarter. Vivek Juneja : Okay. It's completely a different question. Technology investments, can you give us an update on where you are in that trajectory of investing? Because I know you've been trying to automate and digitize. And where are you? And any color, any details on that? Stephen Bowman : Yes. So we continue to have significant investment in the business. This is a technologically intensive and capital intensive from that perspective business. I think we published in our K. We spent somewhere around $2.5 billion on both CapEx and expenditure on a rolling 3-year kind of program. So I think we've given about $2.5 billion from '17 through '19 that we would contemplate in terms of technology spending and/or expense associated with that. And that's meaningful against our revenue base. It's meaningful against the competitive landscape in which we operate. And we think that our technology efforts are certainly competitive and we hope, in many cases, leading the competition. But I know it's a primary focus and discussion point amongst our board and our management team. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Michael Mayo : I just wanted to confirm one more time the way you look at core revenue growth and core expense growth year-over-year. What I think I heard you say is that a core -- and we can get rid of the accounting impact, the FX, the UBS deal. Core revenues were up 12% year-over-year and core expense was up 4% year-over-year. Is that right? Or do you want to change my assumption there? Stephen Bowman : No, you're pretty close. I would say, Mike, we would probably look at core revenue was up if I exclude any year-over-year currency or the acquisition would be up mid-11%, so 11% -- a little over 11%. And you're right on, on expenses. So that's what we would look at core revenue and core expenses sort of 11% and 4.5%, something like that. Michael Mayo : All right, so I think you're going to win the award for greatest operating leverage for the quarter, measured that way. But how should we think about that going ahead? Should we think of some of these expense being lumpy? Or you don't get 700 basis points of positive operating leverage 1 quarter with -- I assume, without having not as good of operating leverage in future quarters. You did mention the $17 million of marketing in the third quarter, so I guess, that will impact that though, I guess, you still have that comp year-over-year. So I mean, what kind of operating leverage are you looking for, for this year and on a go-forward basis? Stephen Bowman : Well, there's obviously both the revenue and expense component to that. So it depends on how markets perform and rate lifts and others. But I know that we're focused on driving operating leverage into the franchise and particularly fee operating leverage into the franchise. So if we look at that, our fees grew somewhere adjusted around 7% if we stripped out all of that noise versus that 4.5%. So we still were driving 2.5 to 3 points of fee leverage. That is a very important focus. And then the second thing I would say is -- Mike is, we're very focused on organic leverage. So the rate we can organically grow our fees versus the rate that our expenses grow organically. So if our expense growth rate was 4.5%, some of those were inorganic factors in there. So that growth rate would've been lower. And if our fees were, as I've told you, somewhere in that 4% to 5% range, we're getting to that organic fee leverage -- I think we wrote in the script as well. So organic fee leverage, fee operating leverage and total operating leverage remain commonly held discussions around here in terms of focus. Michael Mayo : And to be clear, so that 7% year-over-year fee growth excludes the UBS impact? And if it doesn't, what is the growth year-over-year excluding UBS? Michael O\u2019Grady: So excluded. Stephen Bowman : That does exclude it. And excluded -- I took currency and I took the acquisition out of our fee numbers, and that's where you get it. Michael Mayo : And how is UBS doing in terms of retention, cross-sell, kind of the metrics that you guys had internally? Is it above, in line, below? Stephen Bowman : Yes, it's exceeded expectations to date in terms of revenue growth and performance. Mark Bette : Yes. And the one thing, Mike, I would add is the AUA related to the UBS that we called out was $575 billion, which is down sequentially from $607 million, and that was really a currency factor there. So not a lost business this year or anything like that. So everything is going along really well. Stephen Bowman : Substantially from the acquisition though. Mark Bette : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Sticking with the comments on M&A, can you give us your outlook for opportunities? Obviously, the UBS transaction sounds like it's going well. You guys have done a number of deals over the years. Is there anything that you see in the horizon that could look interesting to you, whether it's in a different product line or just enhances an existing product line? Stephen Bowman : If you look at some announcements that were public, we closed, what I will call, the CTEC technology, Omnium technology acquisition in the quarter. We talked about an investment in Lumint and others. What we've done is found opportunities, I think, to partner with or work aside or acquire some products and capabilities to get to market quicker and to, I think, create some speed and solutions for our clients. So rather than a large acquisition, that's where we have over the last twos quarters focused more of our energy and some of our capital is those types of moves. We obviously stay attuned to the market. And should opportunities come up, we pay attention and we get the people that call on us that give us those advices, but I'd say what you've seen in the public domain is more of a targeted smaller acquisitions or investments in products and capabilities or technologies that I think help can move us forward. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then just going into the organic side, over the years, you've obviously grown organically the private wealth business by expanding into different geographies outside the home base in Chicago. Can you give us an update on what your thinking over the next 12 to 18 months of potential organic expansion of the private wealth, personal wealth business geographically? Stephen Bowman : Yes, so we are absolutely continuing to look at anywhere where we -- there's a high opportunity set for wealth markets there, pockets along the East Coast where we're -- there's high net worth opportunities where we're underpenetrated. What I would highlight for you though in that strategy is that we don't always need to have a physical location there. There are some markets where virtual teams have covered that, and we've had tremendous success in certain cities where we actually cover them with virtual teams and have been successful with that approach. So we feel pretty good about our coverage in the wealth space, but we will continue to look at those opportunities if we have a geographical gap. But I think we're pretty excited with our model to be able to close that. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : Just real quick on the new business wins. I know you don't want to quantify the numbers. But can you at least directionally say if it's up or down quarter-on-quarter? Stephen Bowman : Our new -- we don't -- I mean on a year-over-year basis, I would say yes. I mean, I don't know especially when you think about the institutional business quarter-on-quarter. There was a positive impact on the fees, I would say. The actual new business that's recognized can be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter. But there was sequential benefits as well as year-over-year benefits from new business. Brian Kleinhanzl : And just as you look out for the organic revenue growth, I mean, when you look out at the asset servicing, what's the driver of this organic growth that you're seeing? Is it coming from client switching from other providers? Is it really just the new phase of outsourcing you're seeing picking up? I mean, can you help us give a better understanding of where it's coming from? Stephen Bowman : Yes, sure. Good question. I would say, we have seen a lot of it in our institutional side has been with asset servicing -- excuse me, asset manager clients providing asset servicing to asset manager clients. And to your point, some of that has been their drive to look at their cost structures in a difficult environment. And so opportunities for middle, back office and/or other places where they can outsource or partner with somebody has driven some of that. Look, many of -- if you're with the right managers, they also have growth. So we get some distributed growth as well. I think that's particularly true in our hedge fund services space, where we've had the opportunity and good fortune to partner with some partners, some clients who've been very successful in growing their own books and therefore our organic growth goes with them as they either launch new funds or grow their AUM themselves. And then geographies, I would add. We've had great growth as we talked about in Australia, but we've had great growth in other regions of the world. The Netherlands has had terrific success. We opened an office in Seoul, South Korea, and other parts of the world. So geographical, it's some distributed growth by partnering with the right folks. And then the macroeconomic environment is causing some folks to look at outsourcing and/or other opportunities. And that's driven a lot of our C&IS growth. You're right, in the more traditional pension space, that's more of a takeaway game. We do very well in that takeaway game, but there's probably not a lot of new defined benefit plans being open for instance, so it's really a market share kind of gain there, which we continue to do well in. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

Let me turn the call over to Biff Bowman. Biff Bowman : Good morning, everyone. Let me join Mark in welcoming you to our third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Starting on Page 2 of our quarterly earnings review presentation, this morning, we reported third quarter net income of $374.5 million. Earnings per share were $1.58 and our return on common equity was 15.1%. As noted on the second page of our earnings release, this quarter\u2019s results included $8.1 million community development investment impairment within other operating income, $2.7 million of severance-related and restructuring charges within expenses, a $5.5 million tax benefit relating to adjustments recorded in the current quarter associated with IRS guidance issued with respect to the Tax Cuts and Job Act. Before going through our results in detail, I would like to comment on some macro factors impacting our business during the quarter. Equity markets had a favorable impact on us during the quarter. End-of-period markets were favorable on a year-over-year basis with the S&P 500 and MSCI EAFE Indices increasing 15.7% and 2.3% respectively. On a sequential basis, both indices also increased with the S&P 500 up 7.2% and the EAFE up 1.8%. Also on a sequential basis, the average daily market value of the S&P 500 was up 5.4%, while the EAFE declined 0.2%. As you will recall, some of our fees are also based on lagged pricing and in the prior quarter, the S&P 500 was up 2.9%, while the EAFE was up 2.5%. Short-term interest rates continued to increase during the quarter driven by a rate hike from the Federal Reserve as well as for the Bank of England. Currency rates influenced the translation of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar and therefore impact client assets and certain revenues and expenses. The British pound and euro versus the U.S. dollar ended the quarter down 3% and 2% respectively compared to the prior year. The British pound and euro also declined sequentially. The year-over-year and sequential declines for the pound and euro against the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact of revenue and a favorable impact to expense. Let\u2019s move to Page 3 and review the financial highlights of the third quarter. Year-over-year revenue increased 9% with non-interest income up 8% and net interest income up 14%. Expenses increased 7% from last year. The provision for credit losses was a credit of $9 million compared to a credit of $7 million 1 year ago. Net income was 26% higher year-over-year. In the sequential comparison, revenue declined 2% with non-interest income down 2% and net interest income down 1%. Expenses increased 1% compared to the prior quarter. Net income declined 4% sequentially. Return on average common equity was at 15.1% for the quarter, up from 12.2% 1 year ago, but down from 16.5% in the prior quarter. Assets under custody and administration of $10.8 trillion increased 12% compared to 1 year ago and increased 1% on a sequential basis. Approximately half of the year-over-year growth was driven by the acquisition of UBS Asset Management\u2019s fund administration units in Luxembourg and Switzerland. Assets under custody of $8.2 trillion increased 6% compared to 1 year ago and were up 1% on a sequential basis. The year-over-year growth was driven by favorable market impacts and new business partially offset by unfavorable moves in currency exchange rates. The sequential growth was primarily due to favorable markets partially offset by unfavorable moves in currency exchange rates. Assets under management were $1.2 trillion, up 4% year-over-year and up 2% on a sequential basis. The year-over-year increase was driven by favorable markets and new business flows while the sequential increase was primarily related to favorable markets, partially offset by lower end of period securities lending collateral levels as well as unfavorable moves in currency exchange rate. Let\u2019s look at the results in greater detail starting with revenue on Page 4. Third quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $1.5 billion, up 9% from last year and down 2% sequentially. Excluding the acquisition revenue was up approximately 8% from last year. Trust investment and other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue and were $939 million in the third quarter, up 8% year-over-year and down slightly from the prior quarter. Excluding the UBS acquisition, fees were up approximately 6% on a year-over-year basis. Foreign exchange trading income was $72 million in the third quarter, up 46% year-over-year and down 9% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to increased foreign exchange swap activity in our treasury function as well as higher client volumes. The sequential decline was driven by lower client volumes. Other non-interest income was $55 million in the third quarter, down 25% compared to 1 year ago and down 22% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to the previously mentioned investment impairment, lower impacts from net hedge activity, a decline relating to the valuation of existing swap agreements related to the Visa Class B common shares and lower banking and credit related service charges. The sequential decline was also impacted by the investment impairment and the Visa swap valuations as well as lower security commissions and trading income, lower treasury management fees and lower banking and credit related service charges. Net interest income which I will discuss in more detail later was $418 million in the third quarter, increasing 14% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. Let\u2019s look at the components of our trust and investment fees on Page 5. For our corporate and institutional services business fees totaled $541 million in the third quarter, up 8% year-over-year, but down 2% on a sequential basis. Approximately one half of the year-over-year growth was due to the UBS acquisition. The translation impact of changes in currency rates reduced year-over-year C&IS fee growth by approximately one half of a point. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees was $375 million, up 11% compared to the prior year and down 1% sequentially. The slowing does include the UBS acquisition related fees. Excluding these fees custody and fund administration fees were up approximately 4% compared to the prior year. The year-over-year growth was driven by new business and the impact of favorable markets, partially offset by currency translation. The sequential decline was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of currency translation and lower transaction volumes, partially offset by favorable markets. Assets under custody and administration for C&IS clients were $10.2 trillion at quarter end, up 12% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. Approximately half of the year-over-year growth was attributable to the UBS fund administration acquisition. Excluding the acquisition the year-over-year increases primarily reflect favorable markets and new business, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation. Sequentially, the benefit of markets were partially offset by unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates. Recall that lagged market values factor into the quarter\u2019s fee with both quarter lag and month lag markets impacting our C&IS custody and fund administration fees. Investment management fees in C&IS of $109 million in the third quarter were up 4% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was primarily due to favorable markets and a change to gross revenue presentation for certain clients. The sequential decline was primarily due to outflows and adjustments made in the prior quarter due to a change to gross revenue presentation for certain clients. Assets under management for C&IS clients were $876 billion, up 4% year-over-year and up 2% sequentially. Favorable market impacts and net new business were the drivers of the year-over-year growth. The sequential performance was driven by favorable market impacts, partially offset by a lower level of end of period securities lending collateral as well as unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates. Securities lending fees were $24 million in the third quarter, up 6% year-over-year, but down 20% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, higher volumes were partially offset by lower spreads. The sequential quarter decline reflects the typical season pattern with the international dividend season driving wider spreads in the second quarter of each year. Securities lending collateral was $167 billion at quarter-end and averaged $170 billion across the quarter. Average collateral levels increased 14% year-over-year, but declined 8% sequentially. Other fees in C&IS were $34 million in the third quarter, down 7% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. The year-over-year decline reflects lower sub-advisor fees. The lower income associated with sub-advisor fees has an associated lower expense in the outside services category. This decline in sub-advisor fees is consistent with the prior three quarters when we discontinued our service offering. The decline in sub-advisor fees was partially offset by higher fees associated with other ancillary services such as risk and analytics services. The sequential growth was also driven by higher fees associated with ancillary services. Moving to our Wealth Management business. Trust, investment and other servicing fees were $398 million in the third quarter, up 9% year-over-year and up 2% sequentially. Within wealth management, the Global Family Office business fees increased 9% year-over-year and were flat sequentially. The year-over-year growth was driven by new business and favorable markets. Sequential performance reflects new business and favorable markets partially offset by a decline in transaction volumes. Within the regions, the year-over-year growth was driven by favorable markets, higher fees resulting from the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard and new business. Sequential performance benefited from favorable markets and new business as well as higher service-related fees. Assets under management for wealth management clients were $296 billion at quarter-end, up 4% year-over-year and up 3% sequentially. Moving to page six, net interest income was $418 million in the third quarter, up 14% year-over-year. Earning assets averaged $113 billion in the third quarter, essentially flat with the prior year. Total deposits averaged $94 billion and were down 4% year-over-year. Interest-bearing deposits declined 2% from one year ago to $74 billion. Non-interest-bearing deposits, which averaged $19 billion during the third quarter were down 11% from one year ago. Loan balances averaged $32 billion in the third quarter and were down 5% compared to one year ago. The net interest margin was 1.47% in the third quarter and was up 18 basis points from a year ago. The improvement in the net interest margin compared to the prior year primarily reflects the impact of higher short-term interest rates and lower premium amortization, partially offset by a balance sheet mix shift. On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income was down $4 million or 1%. Average earning assets declined 2% sequentially, driven by decreases in deposits. On a sequential basis, the net interest margin decreased 1 basis point as the favorable impact of higher short-term rates was offset by balance sheet mix and day count. As we've discussed in our most recent quarters, we did continue to see the opportunity for foreign exchange swap activity with our treasury function. This activity has the impact of reducing our interest income relating to Central Bank deposits as we swap out of U.S. dollars, but increase our level of foreign exchange trading income. For this quarter, we saw additional foreign exchange trading income of $19 million, offset by $17 million less in net interest income. Looking at the currency mix of our balance sheet, for the third quarter, U.S. dollar deposits represented 69% of our total deposits. This compared to 70% 1 year ago and is unchanged from the prior quarter. Turning to Page 7, expenses were $1 billion in the third quarter and were 7% higher than the prior year and up 1% on a sequential basis. As previously mentioned, the current quarter included $2.7 million in expenses associated with severance and other charges. For comparison purposes, note that 1 year ago, our results included severance and other charges of $7 million, while the prior quarter included $6.6 million in severance and other related charges. The UBS acquisition contributed just under 2.5 points of year-over-year growth. Excluding both the UBS acquisition as the called out charges, expense for the current quarter was just over 5% higher than a year ago. With respect to the remaining increase in year-over-year expense growth, the following items were key drivers within the categories. Compensation was higher driven by increased incentive compensation in this year\u2019s base pay adjustments which were effective in April. The impact of staff growth on salaries was more than offset by staff actions and our ongoing location strategy efforts. Benefits were higher primarily due to an increase in retirement plan expenses, medical costs and higher payroll tax withholding compared to the prior year. Outside service costs were higher driven primarily by higher technical services expense and third-party advisor fees partially offset by lower consulting, legal and sub-advisor expenses. There was a corresponding increase to Trust Investment and other servicing fees as a result of the higher third-party advisor fees due to the change to gross revenue presentation. Equipment software expenses, was up year-over-year due to higher software amortization and disposition charges. Occupancy-related costs were higher compared to the prior year primarily relating to higher building operation costs, real estate taxes and rent expense. Other operating expenses were up slightly from the prior year due primarily to higher business promotion and other miscellaneous expense. Shifting to the sequential expense view, excluding the expense charges in both the current and prior quarter, expenses were up 1% primarily reflecting higher other operating expense partially offset by a decline in compensation expense. Compensation expense declined sequentially due to lower equity and cash-based incentives. The decline in equity incentives was driven by lower expenses related to long-term performance-based incentive compensation resulting from higher charges recorded in the prior quarter associated with grants to retirement eligible employees. Other operating expense increased 29% from the prior period driven by higher business promotional spend, primarily associated with the Northern Trust golf tournament, which was held during the quarter as well as other miscellaneous expense. Staff levels increased approximately 4% year-over-year and less than 2% sequentially. Approximately one half of the year-over-year staff growth was the impact of the UBS acquisition. The remainder of the growth was all attributable to staff increases in lower cost locations, which include India, Manila, Limerick, Ireland and Tempe, Arizona partially offset by reductions in our higher cost locations. Turning to Page 8, as we have discussed on previous calls through our value per spend initiative we are realigning our expense base with the goal of realizing $250 million in expense run-rate savings by 2020. Concurrently, we are embedding a sustainable expense management approach. We expect these efforts to slow our expense growth to be more closely aligned with our organic fee growth. Our third quarter results reflect approximately $28 million in expense savings reducing the year-over-year expense growth rate by approximately by 3 points. This would equate to approximately $114 million on an annualized basis against the $250 million goal. We continue to cultivate a healthy pipeline of opportunities. Turning to Page 9, a key focus has been on sustainably enhancing profitability and returns. This slide reflects the progress we have made in recent years to improve the expense to fee ratio, pre-tax margins and ultimately our return on equity. The ratio of expenses to fees is a particularly important measure of our progress as it addresses what we can most directly control. Reducing this measure from where it was previously as high as 131% in 2011 to the levels we see today is a key contributor to the improvement in our pre-tax margin and ultimately our return on equity. Turning to Page 10, our capital ratios remained strong with our common equity Tier 1 ratio of 13.4% under the advanced approach and 12.9% under the standardized approach. The supplementary leverage ratio at the corporation was 6.9% and at the bank was 6.4%, both of which exceed the 3% requirement that became applicable to Northern Trust effective at the start of the year. With respect to the liquidity coverage ratio, Northern Trust is above the 100% minimum requirement that became effective at the start of 2017. As Northern Trust progresses through fully phased-in Basel III implementation, there could be additional enhancements to our models of further guidance from the regulators on the implementation of the final rule, which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final Basel III rules. In the third quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares of common stock at a cost of $236 million. We also increased our dividend 31% to $0.55 per quarter. These two actions combined represent a payout ratio of just over 100% for the quarter. In closing, Northern Trust continued to deliver solid financial results in the quarter, growing earnings per share of 32% over the prior year and achieving return on average common equity of 15.1%. Importantly, as we seek to drive profitable growth, we delivered positive fee operating leverage and positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis. As compared to the prior year, our organic fee and expense growth rates were better aligned. Performance has also been strong on a year-to-date basis with earnings per share growth of 42% and return on average common equity of 15.9%. Through three quarters, we have achieved 4.4 points of positive operating leverage and 3.5 points of positive fee operating leverage. Profitability continues to be strong in each of our businesses. On a year-to-date basis, our wealth management business grew pre-tax income by 18% versus 1 year ago, while improving the pre-tax margin from 39% to 42%. Our C&IS business similarly drove strong year-over-year performance with pre-tax income growing 33% and pre-tax margin improving from 30% to 33%. Both businesses delivered strong year-over-year fee operating leverage and total operating leverage. The consistency of our relationship focused strategies positions us as a leader in attractive markets. We are focused on continuing to invest for the future to accelerate our growth and improve our profitability. Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust third quarter earnings conference call today. Mark and I would be happy to answer your questions. Todd, please open the line. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We have our first question from Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Biff Bowman : Hi, Mike. Michael Carrier : Good morning. Biff, first question, just on the C&IS, I guess the assets and then the fund administration and the investment management revenues, when I look sequentially just seems like when we look at the market trends, whether it\u2019s end-of-period, average and lag, it still seems like the growth rates, there is something else that\u2019s off and I understand the FX too, but when we look at the markets we usually include those in the market returns. So, I am just trying to understand on a sequential basis, was there anything else that was impacting the growth rates both in the custody and fund administration investment management because both came in lighter relative to sort of the market expectations? Biff Bowman : Yes. So, let me walk you through that. There was a sequential decline as you pointed out and I will try to add color to that. If we look, we were down about $11 million sequentially. About half of that, about $6 million of that was securities lending fees, which have as you know some sequential between the second and third quarter, some seasonality. That was driven really by lower volumes, lower borrower demand, particularly in global equities and the spreads tightened as we saw versus LIBOR in that. Then you get to investment management fees. They were also down sequentially, about a little over $4 million. About half of that decline was driven by what I would say there were some outflows and modest re-pricing captured in that line. So, that drove some of that along with we had about half of that $4 million was from a net to gross true-up in the second quarter, so couple of million dollars from that, that we \u2013 when we lap it sequentially it could create some of the variance. And then you get to the custody and fund administration fees and the growth rate there or lack of growth rate there, there was some currency translation as you put out, but I think it\u2019s important to remember the transaction volumes are also a factor in this line item and somewhere between 20% to 25% of our C&IS custody and fund administration fees are really driven by transaction volumes, they are not driven by market levels. So, that was an important driver in the decline there. As it relates to growth in the business or organic growth in the business, I would like to bring this point out. I think that when we look at organic growth in our businesses, we like to look at it on a year-to-date or over longer periods of time. And when we look at where we are through three quarters of this year, we are in the range that we have discussed with you around the organic growth rates in our businesses and we have talked about that being in the 4% to 5% range as a firm. We are in that year-to-date. In any given quarter, we could be slightly lower than that. In this quarter, we were slightly lower than that and particularly in the C&IS business, we were below their trend rate. That being said, as we look out into the fourth quarter, where we have known new business implementations both in our pipeline and known new business implementations, we still feel very good about getting to that historical organic growth rate that we have talked to you about in any given quarter that could potentially drive the fees going directionally at different ways, but we feel good about what we know. In the fourth quarter, some implementations, particularly in the C&IS business can be pushed from quarter-to-quarter and that can cause a little bit of fluctuation in any one given quarter, but still like I said feel good about the year\u2019s view of the organic growth rate in both of our businesses quite frankly. Michael Carrier : Okay, thanks. And then just as a follow-up, just on the net interest revenue, you mentioned the $17 million, I think that was included as a headwind given the swap activity. I guess just when we think about going forward anyway to think about how much of that activity will continue and then given the reduction that you saw on the deposit side, your comments on the growth organically, just any kind of outlook in terms of how we should be thinking about the balance sheet going forward? Biff Bowman : Okay. So, couple of questions in there, right. I got a balance sheet question and then the FX trade. On the FX trade as we pointed out, it was $19 million of additional FX in the quarter, but with a $17 million net interest income give up in the quarter. One of the ways to look at this is the\u2026 Mark Bette : 3-month cross currency U.S. dollar euro swap is one that you can look at, because euro is an area where we have been doing these trades during this quarter. Biff Bowman : So, if you go on to Bloomberg, you can look at that and pull that up and if that spread narrows, that trade becomes with there is more NII give up and less FX spread over that. So, that\u2019s one way on that line item. We will continue to look at that and determine if it\u2019s in the best interest of our shareholders to leave that trade on or not and we just have to look at market trends and where we are so far in the quarter that trade particularly euros versus dollars is still profitable for our shareholders and that\u2019s what you would see if you looked at it on the Bloomberg terminal. Mark Bette : And that\u2019s something Mike that we will look to give an update on as we get later into the quarter and we have an opportunity. Biff Bowman : In terms of the second part of your question, which is probably get into what others, let\u2019s say around the balance sheet. What I would say on the balance sheet is this, we certainly continue to monitor the non-interest bearing deposit and have regular dialogs with our clients, you saw the $2 billion or so that came off of our balance sheet in non-interest bearing deposits. In the quarter, we provide them with a number of solutions for their liquidity needs whether that\u2019s on balance sheet off balance sheet etcetera. As far as the declines we saw this quarter on that $2 billion. About 40% of that decline was within the category that we have discussed before here which represents mainly from our fund services business and these would be asset managers and hedge funds, etcetera. This is also the category that we saw the most declines in when you think back to the second quarter and third quarter of 2017. What we do believe is that most of what remains within that category is now just under $5 billion, which is now just under $5 billion is that there is \u2013 they are there for day-to-day operational needs that we are actually seeing the interest rate sensitivity in that bucket. Most of those clients we think the balances are that stay with us are there for operational needs. So i.e., we have seen much of the rundown in that buckets that we think we would see. If you look at the remainder of where that $2 billion went, the other part of the $2 billion was split really between two categories. The first was what I would say is our global institutional asset servicing business or kind of BAU custody business. And I think those deposits can ebb and flow from a quarter-to-quarter basis depending on our clients cash and capital deployments, that\u2019s putting it to work as a part of their regular BAU business as usual dealings. We see this kind of fluctuation on a regular basis. And then the last portion of that $2 billion was really more around our treasury management, our commercial DDA type accounts. And it\u2019s quite transactional in nature and so we can see that kind of volatility to that was a little bit more pronounced than we would normally see, but was a little bit more in the commercial DDA bucket. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Hey Biff. Thanks for all that color you just gave. On the outflows, I guess the bigger question is, is that \u2013 it\u2019s really tough to this game just the size of the balance sheet moving forward and I guess I wanted to ask you underneath all of that, do you still see or expect to see deposit growth from core customers as the business grows, are we still at the point where we are just going to be sun-setting the proportion the non-interest bearing directionally and we might not see the overall balance sheet grow that much from here, how do you guys think about that big picture? Biff Bowman : Yes, we do. Ken we think we will still get that growth from the core custody business and we do a lot of modeling around that as we need to do understand for instance our liquidity coverage ratio and others. But there is significant correlation between our growth in AUC and other things that absolutely drive the balance sheet larger, but we got to continue to grow the core business. But we do believe that the balance sheet will grow from core asset servicing wins over time. There could be some bumpiness in that as we look at the balance sheet and it seeks certain yield. But I think over long periods of time if we continue to grow the franchise with the organic growth rates we have talked about here, we will see the balance sheet respond with that type of growth as well. Ken Usdin : Okay. And then within the buckets, can you just talk about just deposit pricing, interesting we saw not unexpected faster deposit pricing we see in terms of the rates paid, sequentially even with some of the declines shown in the savings money and other, so can you just talk us about the trajectory there and split it across the businesses like you have done in the past when have you gotten to in terms of those betas and how are deposits continuing to act in that regard? Biff Bowman : Yes. Sure. I will start off by saying I think we have a very disciplined process when it comes to our deposit pricing and \u2013 but we got to be competitive. So if I look at deposit betas that offer you some of the following color it\u2019s a little difficult to just look at one quarter, but I am going to try to break this apart for you. I am sorry if we look at just one quarter we can have catch-ups and I think you need to look at the deposit betas over a longer period of time, perhaps looking at it on a couple of quarters or a year. So if you look our betas over the last couple of quarters, here is what I would say. For the U.S. dollar portion of our non-U.S. office deposits were probably between a 65% and a 75% beta. The vast majority of these deposits as you know are institutional type deposits. Roughly 55% of our non-U.S. deposits are U.S. dollar and there is also some wholesale deposits within that mix. If you look at the savings, money market and other line, I think of that as largely our wealth management deposits or a portion of them, we\u2019re probably in the 50% to 60% range for betas over the last couple of quarters in aggregate. I think that line includes our retail wealth management deposits as I just said, which are a little bit below that range, but there\u2019s also some institutional deposits in the savings, money market and other line, which are above that range, which brings the blend somewhere into that 50% to 60% range. And I\u2019d just add that we continue to monitor what money funds and other alternatives bring in terms of the viability of those inside and the competitiveness of those as we think about the betas going forward. So hopefully that\u2019s enough color. Mark? Mark Bette : And then Ken I think you had also asked about the decline that we saw in savings, money market and other, and within that bucket about 75% of that is wealth management deposits and that is where we saw declines during this quarter, was on the wealth management side, and we did see of that about half of that would have moved into off-balance sheet funds and then what\u2019s left with kind of split between whether there was deployment from clients whether it was investments or debt pay-downs, and then there were some that we would have seen of that other bucket that would have just left our balance sheet or balances were pulled down by clients. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Biff Bowman : Hi, Brennan. Brennan Hawken : Hey good morning, guys. Actually I just \u2013 I want to follow up on that last comment. I believe Mark that you made about the proportion of the decline in the non-interest bearers rolling on to the balance sheet. Given those dynamics, does that result in a bit of a catch-up on the deposit cost when you see those wealth management clients roll into interest-bearing and can that put some temporary upward pressure on what would look like a single quarter beta, which I think Biff you referenced earlier? Biff Bowman : Yes, one thing I would say Brennan, so the decline that we saw in wealth management deposits, the non-interest part of wealth management deposits was actually pretty stable in the quarter. The decline that we saw was in the interest-bearing side for the wealth management deposit. Mark Bette : That was already in there. Biff Bowman : But Brennan to the larger point you brought up there that\u2019s why I try to say in any given quarter, the beta is going to look large if there\u2019s catch-up from either being slightly lagging markets and disciplined, and we really do try to look at them over a year or some longer period of time to understand how the beta has actually moved. In any given quarter there could be pricing catch-up, sometimes there can be pricing slowdown if we\u2019ve gotten ahead in any quarters. This quarter would look like more like pricing catch-up in some of the lines. Brennan Hawken : Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you. And then when we think about the transactional volumes which you referenced having an impact on the C&IS rate so to speak, the way kind of have to model it from the outside. Was that transactional weakness fairly consistent through the quarter or was September particularly weak and then I\u2019m guessing when you think about fourth quarter given your comments about looking at the pipeline and your outlook and expectation of rebound that would suggest that fourth quarter volumes look like a return to a more normal pace. Is that fair? Biff Bowman : Yes. They were slower in the early part of the quarter and certainly slowest in August with some pick up a little bit in September, particularly as we got near the end of September. And I don\u2019t have the numbers through October, we\u2019ll give you some color on that in December, but I would say the earlier quarter was the slower periods from transactions. Brennan Hawken : Okay Thanks for clarifying that. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Biff Bowman : Hi, Brian. Brian Bedell : Hi, great, thanks \u2013 hi, good morning. Not to beat the dead horse on the deposit beta, but maybe just come out from one different angle on the non-interest-bearing side, just looking at the last tightening cycle in \u201804-\u201906, and I appreciate the company is structured a little bit different, but just looking at non-interest-bearing versus total deposits, I think that came down from something like 20% or 21% at the start of that cycle down to about 11% to 12% by the end of the cycle. This cycle so far you are starting in at around 28% and now you are down to about 21%, so just \u2013 and again that\u2019s the non-interest bearing deposits divided by the total deposits. So just wanted to understand the nature of the structural difference and thinking about that bucket going forward from here? Sorry if I missed to breakout of the total balance between wealth management and CINF, but if you could bifurcate that just so we could understand maybe some of the risks to that on at least the wealth side and of course you mentioned money market products being another substitute, how do you view clients switching into those types of products? Biff Bowman : Okay. Here is what I would say. I think we have a fairly significant different business mix between 2004 and 2006 when you look at the construct of the balance sheet. There are more institutional, large institutional asset management type clients that exist on the balance sheet for that period of time. So, that measure you had of it moving from 20 to let\u2019s call it 12 over that period of time may not necessarily translate to now, because the mix of clients on the balance sheet could be fairly meaningfully different. We did our largest acquisition in the GFS space in 2005 and it\u2019s moved to be a much different proportionality of our business. If I look at that mix though of the 19, the second part of your question was sort of how is that $19 billion mix today. First, let me start off about 90% of that is in dollars, just under 90% of it is in \u2013 about 87%, and then about 30% of that is in wealth management deposits, 20% is what I would say are in support of our treasury cash management business and then the remaining 50% is really attributable to what I just described the C&IS business, some core and some supporting asset managers in there. So, that\u2019s kind of the breakdown of that $19 billion to $20 billion. But I wouldn\u2019t want to pre-suppose that it moves back down to 11% or 12% as a percent of the balance sheet, because our mix is different. I don\u2019t have that answer, but I don\u2019t think that you can make that assumption correctly given the different specs for the company and that need to be passed to be there to support large asset managers\u2019 activities. Brian Bedell : Great. That\u2019s super helpful. Thanks. And then just a follow-up, I guess just on the expense side is how should we think about your target on that expense to trust fee ratio and bringing that down? How should we think about that behaving if we get more pressure on the equity markets that would obviously reduce the denominator of that or do you feel that you can be responsive on the expense side to downturns in market-based fees or should we just think of that as sort of a natural outcome of any pressure in the market that that expense to trust fee ratio may drift back up? Biff Bowman : So, I would say, let me give you a longer term view first is we absolutely think that we can continue to drive that lower with things like value for spend and a lot of initiatives that we have going on. In the short-term to be able to react to market volatility or down perhaps in the market in any given quarter that maybe difficult. Remember that some proportionality of our expenses, are going to move with that same market decline. So, they move directionally with that, so we get that benefit, but there are others that are more fixed or not directly tied to that market level and we are getting after those. We think though over quarters that we can have an expense discipline that\u2019s more closely aligned with the revenue fees that we are seeing. That\u2019s why I would just add that we talked on these calls a lot about continuing to do what we can to drive the organic fee leverage into our business, meaning the things that we can most control are how much fast we grow it organically and how much expense we need to support that growth. And as long as we get those in line with some leverage, the markets over long periods of time will likely be upward sloping and be our friend. So, hopefully that answers your question. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Biff Bowman : Hi, Alex. Alex Blostein : Hi, guys. Good morning. So maybe just to wrap up the NII conversation, couple of things I wanted to follow up on. I guess one thing in the past, you talked about just the overall size of non-interest bearing deposit, would you guys consider sort of at-risk around off, I think was in about $5 billion to $6 billion range and now if you gave us budget, you can\u2019t break it down by bucket now is helpful, but is the total 5 to 6 still the right number. So you kind of said look too left. So we are still dealing with like maybe 4ish or so at risk, is that sort of the right framework still or is the 5 to 6 maybe a higher number? That\u2019s part one. And then I had a quick follow-up on the deposit beta. I\u2019ll just ask that after. Biff Bowman : Alex, I think that, that number is actually smaller than 5 to 6. Now, I think that where the rate moves we have seen with what eight hikes I think we have had now, we actually think that the rate sensitive money in there has probably already in our discussions with that pool, we think that the rate sensitive portions of that have started to move or have already moved, I should say have already moved. So, it\u2019s smaller, it\u2019s not zero, I should be clear, but I think it\u2019s smaller than the 5 to 6 that we talked about. So I think we are seeing some of that rate sensitivity money already of taking action. So I would size that little smaller than that. I can\u2019t give you the exact number, but I think we have seen a lot of that action. Some of what you saw in this quarter as I tried to describe earlier, there was some that moved from that bucket I think we said about 40%, so I think that part. The others, I would say, was more what I would say BAU kind of moves that we could see from normal transactional volume, they could leave and come in any given quarter of that. Hopefully that helps give a little more color. Alex Blostein : Yes, that\u2019s helpful. And then with respect to deposit betas, so I know you guys said I think like 55% or 60% deposit betas, I wasn\u2019t sure what you are talking about kind of over the course of the year, because if I look at Q3, it seems a bit higher than that especially when you consider a portion of deposits outside the U.S. So was there any particular catch-up. I know you said occasionally there might be one or two over there and outsized catch-up in deposit pricing this quarter. So again kind of looking out into Q4 perhaps we are not going to see us making the move? Biff Bowman : I think it would be fair to assume that the outsized or the larger beta that you saw in the quarter would have some competitive catch-up in it where we have to evaluate where we are and we may have had the benefit in Q2 and we have to assess where we are on the competitive landscape. We get some of that data at the end of quarters as you may know from others and it provides us with the opportunity to price competitively. So, that\u2019s an assumption and let you go from there. Alex Blostein : Yes. That\u2019s what it sounded like. Alright, last one, promise. So you said that you guys made some pricing adjustments in C&IS on the investment management side, can you expand on that? I know it sounded like there was maybe a little bit of a drag on investment management fees and C&IS this quarter? And then just bigger picture, when you guys talking about 4% to 5% organic growth over time obviously not quarter-to-quarter, but kind of on an annual basis maybe you guys are thinking about in terms of organic fee growth correct, not organic asset growth was just sort of taken into account any sort of price degradation we might see? Biff Bowman : So yes, it\u2019s organic fee growth. It\u2019s exactly right. And the first part of the question was around, sorry repeat\u2026 Alex Blostein : The re-pricing within\u2026 Biff Bowman : Re-pricing with within asset management was I would say it was along the lines of we have a large passive franchise inside of our C&IS business in particular and as you know the competitive nature of that is very much in the press and we are not immune to that either and we have important clients and we have dialogs with them on a regular basis around the pricing and we have some of that in the period. It has a negative impact on our fees. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Biff Bowman : Hi, Geoff. Geoffrey Elliott : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. Maybe more on the custody fund administration side, could you talk there about what you are seeing in terms of competition and fee pressure? It feels like all of the industry you are serving is under pressure, so how is that translating into pressure on the fee rates you can generate there? Biff Bowman : Yes, it certainly continues to remain competitive in that space and it really has more nuance than just for me to just say that broad-brush. In certain markets, we could see very highly competitive pricing, parts of Asia or we could see it in other parts of the world. In other parts where we see what I would say is more measured and pragmatic pricing. So I\u2019m hesitant to give you anything other than it\u2019s a really competitive landscape for pricing. We feel pretty good about our ability to compete and still drive margins. We talked about the margins in our C&IS business continue to expand in the quarter, so they are able to win without margin erosion in that space. So we feel pretty good, but it is still a very competitive landscape in that space. I do think in the macro environment, we are able if you can bring value proposition, you can still get paid for it in this space, but you have to demonstrate the value you are creating for the marketplace in which we compete, particularly in the institutional side of the business, which is what I think you are referencing. I think on the wealth side we demonstrate that value proposition very effectively and we have seen really very strong growth on the fee side on the wealth management business. Geoffrey Elliott : Thank you. And just a quick one on the deposit side, what gives you confidence that those outflows you saw in DDAs and in the custody business are just kind of normal ebbs and flows, because I guess if we look across the banks that have been reporting has a pretty clear mixture of non-interest bearing deposits flowing out across the board. So what kind of gives you confidence that those might be back again in a quarter or two? Biff Bowman : So, let me break them apart, because I think you said on the wealth side, I don\u2019t know that\u2026. Geoffrey Elliott : On the casualty side and the commercial DDA\u2026 Biff Bowman : Yes, well, we track the trends client by client over time. We do that and we have seen these types of things before. I guess I can\u2019t guarantee that they come back, but we have seen these types of ebbs and flows in the past from those clients that we tracked at a client level that drove some of this in the quarter. I can\u2019t guarantee that they come back, they could have excess cash, but we are tracking it at a client level and we have seen these types of moves before from those in which clients we had. So we will continue to track that and you are absolutely right, it could be something that was more permanent in nature, but that\u2019s our current and most informed view. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Biff Bowman : Hi, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Couple of questions. One in the prepared remarks, Biff, I think you discussed a little bit about the risk and analytics services that we are adding to one of the fee rate lines and just wanted to dig in a little bit and understand some of the drivers there and opportunity set, I know also you put out press release recently about the integrated trading solutions product and wanted to see if that was at all driving the forward look on what risk and analytics services could do for you? Biff Bowman : Yes. So, the two separate services, so I will go first to risk and analytics services, we have for a long time provided what I will call the analytics and analysis of particularly fund performance of pension fund or whatever. So when a pension fund board or a public fund board is evaluating how their assets have performed and their managers have performed, we provide very detailed analytics and it\u2019s another way for us to use the data we have and work with them to provide what I call very high value-added services. They continue to do great work and have been able to grow that business and it\u2019s been a very value-added part of the relationship. I will let Mark give you an update on ITS. Mark Bette : Hi, Betsy. Yes. So, really, the ITS is kind of a bit of an offshoot from in 2016 when we acquired Aviate Global to kind of strengthen our global brokerage business. So, really those \u2013 it\u2019s a solutions for our asset owners and asset managers. It\u2019s really that I would say is more in the security commissions and trading space than it would be within the trust fee categories and we have seen good growth in that area. I would say that for this quarter, the security commissions and trading performance was impacted by transition management activity being lower and as well as interest rate swap activity being lower and those do tend to be more volatile on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but when we look at the underlying like core brokerage trends, including ITS, we see some good growth there. Betsy Graseck : And this ITS announcement looked like it was aimed at Europe, is that accurate or is there something here to for U.S. as well? Biff Bowman : Yes. I think it certainly is being primarily run through Europe right now, because that\u2019s where the predominance of the Aviate acquisition was. And I think we will look to see if there is availability in the U.S. or applicability in the U.S. or Asia. Betsy Graseck : Okay, thanks for that. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : Great. Thanks. Good morning. So, just a quick question on the comp expense, I want to make sure that the third quarter is a good jumping off point when we think about where we are going in the fourth quarter. I think you mentioned that there were some impacts on incentive comps in the quarter from previous quarters. Was there an accrual reversal in the quarter or was this the number that you posted a clean number to think about for fourth quarter? Mark Bette : Brian, hi, it\u2019s Mark. Yes, I would say that it\u2019s a fairly clean number. I mean the decline that we would have had for the equity incentive compensation really relates to when we issue the grants in the first quarter for retirement eligible expense that gets recognized over the first two quarters, most of it in the first and then $11 million of it was in the second quarter. So that would have rolled off in the third quarter. So what\u2019s left I would say is a pretty probably good solid starting point as far as compensation goes. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. And then on the outside services it looks like it was about a year ago you mentioned that there was some ability to maybe manage that number down, but it seems that just keep going up, how do you think about that going forward, I mean is there an opportunity to manage those expenses lower in \u201819 or \u201820? Biff Bowman : Yes. I would say when we look at the year-over-year growth in outside services we are looking at about 6% to 7%. There is probably about 3 points of that would have been from the acquisition. And then when you look at what\u2019s left about 3% of growth. There is the impact of the higher third-party advisor fees for revenue recognition and net to gross accounting slightly offset by lower sub-advisor costs, but we would say that you are probably looking at when you adjust for those things a pretty modest amount of growth, really driven by technical services, which includes market data, but offset by we are seeing lower consulting and legal expense on a year-over-year basis. So, that\u2019s outside services on a year-over-year basis. Mark Bette : Yes. And I will add one piece to that too there. There can be you have seen some improvement I think in the trajectory of the compensation line in some cases where we have chosen to outsource the outside service line picks up the expense, but the comp line should come down commensurately. So, we have some \u2013 we have talked about some of our managed services around their technology that we have done. That\u2019s another underlying driver of that as well. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Biff Bowman : Hi, Glenn. Glenn Schorr : Hello, there. Two quick summary questions. One on you gave us pieces of revenue and expense ex-UBS, ex-FX ex-charges. Can I just pull it together just to show and make sure what the change \u2013 what you think the clear growth of revenue expense and operating leverage was ex all those pieces? Biff Bowman : Sure, yes. That is the way we look at it. That\u2019s good. I would say if you pull ex-currency, ex-acquisition, ex-charges, we would say that trust fees were probably up 5.5% or so and we would look at our expense to be in the 5% to 5.5% range excluding all of those items too. That\u2019s not organic, that\u2019s just sort of at the core if we pull all those things out. So that\u2019s how we would look at fees and expenses and core revenue they would be about 8%. Core revenue ex all of the items that we talked about would be 8%. Glenn Schorr : Okay. And then that maybe the final one, just to title together on net interest income, I heard the whole thing about each of the pieces, but I am sure people looking at is balance sheet didn\u2019t grow much, NIM was down 1 basis point sequentially, then we have a mix shift issues and the deposit beta issues. When you pull it altogether it sounds like net interest income would never grow, no matter what rates do and what customer balances do, but that doesn\u2019t make sense meaning as your business grows as customers grows as you are \u2013 you win new business, the question I have is do you have a ballpark idea range of what you would think over a years period time, what if your organic growth is 4% or 5% what net interest income should accompany with it over time? Biff Bowman : Yes. I won\u2019t give that range, but I will say this. We absolutely think that the NIM can expand and the balance sheet can grow and the NIM can expand. As long as we continue to see the deposit betas move sort of at where we are seeing industry levels and again not just looking at one quarter, but looking at trends in the deposit betas we think it can expand and we think the balance sheet can get bigger with the organic growth trajectory that we have talked about before. This quarter had some movement in it. We had mix shift in the balance sheet. We had some runoff of the non-interest bearing deposits. But we absolutely think that it can expand particularly if you think rates are going to rise in that environment the value of the non-interest bearing deposits that exist on our balance sheet are even greater in terms of expansiveness of that NIM. So we do believe that it\u2019s just this quarter it kind of flattened out. I think you need to look at the trajectory of our NIM and its migration more than just one quarter. I know that\u2019s what you do, but we need to look at it over longer periods of times it may have some stair stepping to it over time. Glenn Schorr : And certainly the sequential LIBOR moves were muted this quarter versus what we saw in the first two quarters of the year, so on the asset side that would have translated with less upside sequentially for the assets\u2026? Biff Bowman : Yes. I mean we looked \u2013 we have a shorter duration balance sheet as you know I think the three months LIBOR averaged 2.34 for both the second and third quarters. So essentially no movement from what we saw in the second quarter. One month LIBOR did expand that was about 14 basis points, about half of what we saw in the previous quarter. One month LIBOR is our largest impactful and three months LIBOR is the second, so they both were muted relative to the rate move. I don\u2019t know how long that \u2013 I don\u2019t know what that trend will be in this quarter. Glenn Schorr : Got it. One last cleanup, on the other operating income line you gave us all the reasons on why it was lower, I guess my only question is what is the right jumping off point where we go forward, in other words it was 20 this quarter, is was 30 the quarter before, it was 40 a year ago, you had a bunch of things that impacted it, is 30 to 40 the right kind of hang out range? Biff Bowman : I think if you look at this quarter, certainly in the other operating income we hope we won\u2019t have any community investment breakdowns of 8 million. So I would certainly not consider that recurring investment. In our Visa derivative, Mark this quarter was $5 million higher than it was a year ago. So if you back those two out, let you then figure out a range and Mark I don\u2019t know if you have any color you want to add. But I think those are two. The rest of those items in that bucket moved in somewhere around a more consistent pattern, but those two were somewhat extraordinary on the\u2026 Mark Bette : And the one thing that does get volatile within that category sometimes is the hedge. The hedge \u2013 the true up of the hedging, the net revenue hedging that we are doing which is off of a slight drag on a year-over-year basis. But that the overall impact of currency is kind of netted across the income statement and that\u2019s where some of those impacts. Operator : Thank you. We will take the next question from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell : Hey good morning. Biff Bowman : Hi Jim. Jim Mitchell : Hi, most of my questions have been asked and answered, but maybe quickly on deposits again just what have you seen I guess so far in October, have you seen kind of the typical runoff from period end, are you seeing any stickiness or a lack thereof, I guess just how we are thinking about what you have seen so far? Biff Bowman : Yes. We will give you an update on that in December when we have had a chance to look at two months and give you some color on that. And as you see in our end of period balance sheet it can get quite large at the end of a period. And some of that can stick around for a week until it sort of gets displaced or put back into the market and so I would be uncomfortable giving you any view of that, because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a better average and moving average by mid-December when we are in the public forum, we will be able to give you a much cleaner look. Jim Mitchell : Right. But overall, you feel like most of the hot money has mostly gone and we can hopefully start to see some growth from here. Biff Bowman : Yes. Jim Mitchell : Okay. And then maybe on just the NIM, I have noticed LIBOR move too, I mean, if that is sustained, should be looking more at 1 month or 3 months for the balance sheet and all else equal, it seems like that should help into 4Q, right. Is there anything else if call out in terms of maybe in the securities portfolio you might have more turnover in the fourth quarter versus the third, how do we think about reinvestment yields there? Biff Bowman : So the 1-month LIBOR spread movement and be an important item for you to track. So with 3 months but 1 month would be the primary in that. And then, you are right, as we look at assets maturing and the chance to reinvest in that, we do have a reasonable book of that business in the fourth quarter, slightly larger than a normal average, but I would focus more on the 1 month and 3 month LIBOR spreads in that space. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Biff Bowman : Hi, Mike. Mike Mayo : Can you remind us on your financial targets, I will tell you what I think I have I am not sure it\u2019s right. One is the ROE target of 10% to 15%, did you ever update that, will you update that? Two would be you are looking for organic fee growth in the 4% to 5% range as you said? Three, you look for organic fee growth to outpace core expense growth and then four you have value for spend looking for $250 million of savings by 2020 and also how much of that have you achieved? Biff Bowman : So our one stated public external target, you are absolutely right is a 10% to 15% ROE. We have not updated that at this point. We have regular reviews to establish if that\u2019s the right range and we look at that. I think we have that range to be something that goes through cycles. Obviously, tax reform was a secular change that we have to think about contemplate what its impact should be particularly if it looks like tax reform is actually going to flow through the financials and not be priced away and that\u2019s why we have waited some period of time to assess just how the world would react to that. The other targets are items we talk about on the phone, they are not formal specifically given targets, but your thought process on all those is right, 250 for value for spend, trying to get to a positive organic tight view of fees to expenses and on organic growth rate over a longer period in the 4 to 5 range as we have talked about. Mike Mayo : And your answer to Glenn\u2019s question earlier, you said that ex all the noise charges, the deal currency you have had what 8% core revenue growth, 5.5% core trust fee growth and 5% to 5.5% core expense growth. Was that year-over-year third quarter? Biff Bowman : Yes, that\u2019s exactly right Mike Mayo : And what are those same numbers? Biff Bowman : I am sorry that was, that was the third quarter. Year-to-date, if you want it year-to-date, I would say our trust fees were 8%, our total revenue was 10% and our expense is 5% on a year-to-date. So a lot of leverage year-to-date. The quarter was a little bit tighter, but we are managing it more than just one quarter. So, that\u2019s the year-to-date performance. Mike Mayo : And what I think I hear you saying several times is judge Northern by the year is not by every quarter, is that what I should be hearing? Biff Bowman : I think what you are hearing is that in any given quarter and in particular in our C&IS business, which has very lumpy sized wins, you can see that move a little bit in any given quarter and you can see that net interest income with some nuances, some beta catch-ups and others have some slight pressures to it. I hope that we are judged on those metrics in longer periods than just 90 days, but that\u2019s where we are at. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Biff Bowman : Hi, Marty. Marty Mosby : Good morning. Well, if you will be patient with me. I have been putting a giant matrix together to look at all these different pieces and I think it\u2019s pretty interesting. If you look at year-over-year like you said, revenues are growing, NII is up double-digits, fee income is up higher single-digits. So, it\u2019s not the momentum you have had over the year, it\u2019s just the sequential quarter. If you look at the sequential quarter, expenses are up, but I imagine the golf tournament refracts most of that increased expenses from second quarter to third quarter. Am I about right on that? Biff Bowman : So, there certainly is a sequential impact from the Northern Trust Open. There is also an offset to that that partially offsets that is we have some equity incentives that run down, but we have I believe we called it out last quarter the impact of the Northern Trust Open sequentially in\u2026 Mark Bette : In business promo about $17 million sequential increase and you will see when the 10-Q is filed we are right in that range. Marty Mosby : So you can understand that that\u2019s more seasonal. If you look at the revenues and you get the NII going down in this particular quarter about $5 million, but am I hearing this correctly, $17 million impact from this FX swap income in NII. So, instead of a $5 million drop, do you take that $17 million and add it back that would be a $12 million increase in NII. Net-net, if you take out what\u2019s happening in fee income? Biff Bowman : Weather was also a drag in the prior quarter of $14 million, so there is a $3 million decline from the FX swap activity here, so you guys do apples-to-apples, Marty, I think it would have been down 1ish. Marty Mosby : Okay. So that\u2019s what I was trying to get out in the sense that you kept on about incremental really it\u2019s about know $3 millionish between quarters. So NII was relatively flat this particular quarter. If you look at the fee income, yes, so if you take that impact out, NII was relatively flat, you then flip over and look at your fee income and look at the actual components of the fee income between second quarter and third quarter. You actually had above $4 million of pricing impacts, you had $6 million of seasonality and you had then growth in the core. So, if you look at the actual core business, it\u2019s still up seasonality and then one pricing decision that you make is what basically brings your core down a couple of million dollars, but again that\u2019s two different things that are very understandable. FX is actually down 7%, but that\u2019s very noisy, it kind of comes in and out, so that\u2019s a very kind of quarter-to-quarter, you just got to see where that ends up. Biff Bowman : Also seasonal. The third quarter is seasonally slow. There is a lot of holiday in July and August in Europe, particularly where we drive a lot of that. Marty Mosby : And then if we look at the $8 million in other decline, you start looking at that number it\u2019s going to be the swap thing that\u2019s going on with the Visa Class B already taken out the $8 million related to the unusual item and then you got some basically security commissions and training this down $4 million. So, I mean that\u2019s driving that. So, in other words, we got an unusual sitting down here. We have got some noise and trading that\u2019s from quarter-to-quarter. So if I back through this instead of seeing a decline of something like $25 million to $27 million in revenue, you really have core revenues that are up and then you have got seasonality hitting a couple of spots, you have got a price one pricing decision and you have got some noise and other. So when you start looking at it that way and say well, year-over-year we are still growing revenues 10% and in this particular quarter, it\u2019s just got a litany of things once you start looking at it cause everything to kind of round to the for the negative, which is what I am hearing you in your conversation trying to say, but the noise really covers that up this particular quarter. So I just wanted to kind of make sure I was walking through all that correctly? Biff Bowman : Well, I think all of your \u2013 I was following all of your mental calculations there. I think they are all accurate, but that\u2019s what happens in a quarter, right, those are the kinds of moves that could happen, the sequential impacts that you talked about and others. I think you have accurately portrayed how they moved in the quarter and we continue to make decisions that are longer focused to that and we think are the right decisions and these things sort themselves out in more than 90 days sometimes. So we will continue to make those calls. And we believe that at a 15.1% ROE with all those things going your way, that\u2019s still a pretty attractive return in terms of an ROE and I would say it\u2019s also a pretty strong return when you consider that we are sitting on a 12.9% common equity Tier 1 ratio, so it\u2019s a well-capitalized franchise that can still generate pretty strong returns. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning. Biff Bowman : Thank you. How are you, Gerard? Gerard Cassidy : Good. Thank you. Biff, you just talked about that Visa differential in the quarter being $5 million greater this quarter, what was the total amount of the Visa mark in the other income this quarter? Biff Bowman : It was. If we add all of the components together it was a little over $8.8 million in the quarter, so it was a large number, but again a year ago that was closer to 3.5 to 4. And that Visa mark is driven by a series of factors we look at the equity price of Visa, we look at our expected duration of the litigation, we look at the conversion ratio of our B shares to A shares. And that\u2019s driven many cases by any contributions made to settlement funds. So, all of those kind of in any given quarter be valued and come out, the Visa stock price has moved. Our thinking around the duration of the litigation can change in any given period and all of those ended up being a quite significant move this quarter. You can calculate it. It\u2019s in our queue. It\u2019s in our Visa Class B shareholdings are somewhere in the $900 million to $1 billion range right now depending on the Visa stock price as we sit here today, I don\u2019t know where it is, but somewhere in that range. So, it\u2019s a substantial off balance sheet, it\u2019s not off balance sheet, it\u2019s on the balance sheet at zero. So, it\u2019s on, but it is zero valuation. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Thank you for the color. Can you also share with us, I think you said that 20% to 25% of [C&IS] custody administration fees come from transaction volumes, what transaction volume should we monitor from the outside to see what type of activity may show up in a quarter in this area? Mark Bette : Yes, Gerard, it\u2019s hard. I mean you could look at overall global market volumes of the driver. There is sometimes with through the sub-custodian network, there might be different timings of recoveries when those types of billings come through and then they come into the fees as well, but in general, I think looking at overall market volumes is a good way to probably try to judge that. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Hello, Vivek. Your line is live. Vivek Juneja : Can you hear me? Biff Bowman : Yes, yes. Vivek Juneja : I am sorry. So, my question, thank you for taking it, your CET1 ratio, it\u2019s grown pretty sharply in the quarter to 12.9%. Firstly, what drove that 50 basis point increase? And secondly what is your plan with that since you are \u2013 it\u2019s so far above your targets, what do you \u2013 if especially with balance sheet growth being slower, do you accelerate your buybacks even more significantly over time? Biff Bowman : Yes. So, the drivers of that in this quarter were really a decline in the risk weighted assets, because as we said earlier, our total payout ratio in the quarter was a little bit north of 100, so we didn\u2019t really add anything to the equity portion, but we did have lower risk weighted assets in the quarter. The drivers of that lower risk weighted assets were lower foreign exchange exposures, lower securities lending exposures, lower what I will call other and we can have things like client settlement securities, client overdrafts and others. All of those quite frankly kind of win in our favor at period end and they helped drive the risk weighted asset out down, which drove CET1 up about 50 basis points. So that was the driver in the quarter. Those can have some end-of-period volatility to them. The second part of your question was, was really more around the how do we think about that. Look, we increased our dividend 31% starting in the third quarter and we bought or we were approved, we were not objected to by the Federal Reserve to buy up to $1 billion worth of stock in the quarter, we executed on that in this quarter as you can see from the buyback and we continue to look at that. We will look at that on our evaluation with our board and others in coming quarters and in the spirit of the next year\u2019s CCAR and capital ask with the board to see what the right return levels of capital are, but it\u2019s a strong position and we take all the factors you mentioned into consideration as we look at that capital return. Vivek Juneja : And how are you thinking about dividend payout in this because your payout ratio has been below where it used to be several years ago. You are now depending on quarter-to-quarter anywhere with this increase this quarter you are still only at about 34%, 35%. So, do you think about where do you see that going longer term? Biff Bowman : Yes. We do think about that and we think about that how that dividend payout ratio would be able to sustain itself and stress, we take great consideration of and we want great deal of certainty around the ability to pay that dividend. And so when we do our stress testing, we want to make sure that we have a dividend payout ratio that can sustain itself in stress when the earnings and other things are in stress. We have I think publicly said that we think being in that 30% to 40% range from a dividend payout ratio is an area where we feel comfortable with that over time and we will continue to evaluate that, but I think that\u2019s the reasonable range with the rest of our total payout ratio obviously being in the form of stock buyback, but we think that gives us the right mix and the right comfort around the importance of that dividend to our board and others. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s questions. We thank you for joining today\u2019s call. You may now disconnect and have a great day.",

Let me turn the call over to Biff Bowman. Biff Bowman : Good morning, everyone. Let me join Mark in welcoming you to our fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Starting on Page 2 of our quarterly earnings review presentation, this morning, we reported fourth quarter net income of $409.9 million. Earnings per share were $1.80 and our return on common equity was 17%. As noted on the second page of our earnings release, this quarter\u2019s results included $5.7 million of severance related and restructuring charges within expenses and $30 million in benefits for income taxes, primarily attributable to the adjustments recorded associated with the Tax Cuts and Job Act. Before going through our results in detail, I would like to comment on some macro factors impacting our business during the quarter. Equity markets had a mixed impact on us during the quarter. End-of-period markets were unfavorable on a year-over-year basis with the S&P 500 and MSCI EAFE Indices declining 6.2% and 13.4% respectively. On a sequential basis, both indices also declined with the S&P 500 down 14% and the EAFE down 12.5%. Also on a sequential basis, the average daily market value of the S&P 500 was down 5.1%, while the EAFE declined 6.3%. However, as you will recall, some of our fees are based on lagged pricing and in the prior quarter, the S&P 500 was up 7.2%, while the EAFE was up 1.8%. Short-term interest rates continued to increase during the quarter, driven by a rate hike from the Federal Reserve. Currency rates influenced the translation of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar and therefore impact client assets and certain revenues and expenses. The British pound and euro versus the U.S. dollar ended the quarter down 6% and 5% respectively compared to the prior year. The British pound and euro also declined sequentially. The year-over-year and sequential declines for the pound and euro against the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact to revenue and a favorable impact to expense. Let\u2019s move to Page 3 and review the financial highlights of the fourth quarter. Year-over-year revenue increased 5% with non-interest income up 4% and net interest income up 9%. Expenses increased 2% from last year. The provision for credit losses was a credit of $4 million compared to a credit of $13 million one year ago. Net income was 15% higher year-over-year. In the sequential comparison, revenue increased 2% with non-interest income up 2% and net interest income up 3%. Expenses increased 2% compared to the prior quarter. Net income increased 9% sequentially. Return on average common equity was at 17% for the quarter, up from 15.1% in both the prior and prior year quarter. Assets under custody and administration up $10.1 trillion declined 6% compared to one year ago and were down 7% on a sequential basis. Assets under custody of $7.6 trillion also declined 6% compared to one year ago and were down 7% on a sequential basis. Both the year-over-year and sequential declines were primarily driven by lower equity markets and the impact of unfavorable moves in currency exchange rates, as well as the impact of one large domestic custody client transitioning out during the quarter. Assets under management were $1.1 trillion, down 8% year-over-year and down 9% on a sequential basis. Both the year-over-year and sequential declines were driven by unfavorable equity markets outflows, which include the impact of lower period end security lending collateral and the impact of unfavorable moves in currency exchange rates. Let's look at the results in greater detail, starting with revenue on Page 4. Fourth quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $1.5 billion, up 5% from last year and up 2% sequentially. Trust investment and other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue and were $934 million in the fourth quarter, up 3% year-over-year and down 1% from the prior quarter. Foreign exchange trading income was $78 million in the fourth quarter, up 24% year-over-year and up 9% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to increased foreign exchange swap activity in our treasury function, as well as increased client volumes and higher volatility. The sequential increase was primarily driven by higher volatility. Other non-interest income was $75 million in the fourth quarter, up 4% compared to one year ago and up 36% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to a net gain on the sale of non-strategic leases in the current quarter, partially offset by lower treasury management fees and securities commission and trading income. The sequential increase was also due to the net gain from the lease sale, combined with an impairment recorded in the prior quarter, as well as a lower Visa related swap expense. Net interest income, which I will discuss in more detail later, was $430 million in the fourth quarter increasing 9% year-over-year and up 3% sequentially. Let's look at the components of our Trust and investment fees on Page 5. For our corporate and institutional services business, fees totaled $536 million in the fourth quarter flat year-over-year and down 1% on a sequential basis. The translation impact of changes in currency rates reduced year-over-year C&IS fee growth by approximately 1.5% and the sequential growth by just under 1%. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fee, were $376 million, up 2% compared to the prior year and flat on a sequential basis. Both the year-over-year and sequential performances were driven by new business, partially offset by the unfavorable impacts of currency exchange rates and markets. Assets under custody and administration for C&IS fee clients were $9.5 trillion at quarter end, down 6% year-over-year and down 7% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential declines were primarily driven by lower equity markets and the impact of unfavorable moves in currency exchange rates, as well as the impact of one large domestic custody client transitioning out during the quarter. Recall that lagged market factors value into the quarters fees with both quarter lag and month lag markets impacting our C&IS fee custody and fund and administration fees. Investment management fees in C&IS fee was $105 million in the fourth quarter were down 1% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to net outflows, partially offset by favorable markets and a change to gross revenue presentation. The sequential decline was primarily due to outflows. Assets under management for C&IS clients were $791 billion, down 9% year-over-year and down 10% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential declines were driven by unfavorable equity markets outflows and unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates. Securities lending fees were $22 million in the fourth quarter, down 14% year-over-year and down 10% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential performances were impacted by lower volumes, as well as lower spreads. Securities lending collateral was $150 billion at quarter-end and averaged $158 billion across the quarter. Average collateral levels declined 9% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Moving to our Wealth Management business. Trust, investment and other servicing fees were $398 million in the fourth quarter, up 6% year-over-year and flat sequentially. Within wealth management, the Global Family Office business fees increased 7% year-over-year and were up 2% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was driven by new business and favorable markets. The sequential performance reflects favorable markets and new business. Recall that our Global Family Office fees are impacted by quarter lag market values. Within the regions, the year-over-year growth was driven by higher fees resulting from the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, new business and favorable markets. Sequential performance within the regions was relatively flat as the unfavorable impact of lower equity markets was offset by new business. Assets under management for wealth management clients were $279 billion at quarter end, down 4% year-over-year and down 6% sequentially. Moving to Page 6. Net interest income was $430 million in the fourth quarter, up 9% year-over-year. Earning assets averaged to $112 billion in the fourth quarter, down 1% from the prior year. Total deposits averaged $93 billion and were down 4% year-over-year. Interest-bearing deposits declined 2% from one year ago to $74 billion. Non-interest-bearing deposits, which averaged $19 billion during the fourth quarter, were down 10% from one year ago. Loan balances averaged $32 billion in the fourth quarter and were down 5% compared to one year ago. The net interest margin was 1.52% in the fourth quarter and was up 13 basis points from a year ago. The improvement in the net interest margin compared to the prior year primarily reflects the impact of higher short-term interest rates, partially offset by higher premium amortization and a balance sheet mix shift. On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income was up $12 million or 3%. Average earning assets declined only slightly on a sequential basis as deposit levels were only slightly lower than the prior quarter. On a sequential basis, the net interest margin increased 5 basis points due to the favorable impact of higher short-term rates and a favorable balance sheet mix. As we have discussed in our most recent quarters, we do continue to see the opportunity for foreign-exchange swap activity within our treasury function. This activity has the impact of reducing our interest income relating to Central Bank deposits as we swap out of U.S. dollars, but increase our level of foreign exchange trading income. For this quarter, we saw additional foreign-exchange trading income of $17 million, offset by $14 million less in net interest income. Looking at the currency mix of our balance sheet for the fourth quarter, U.S. dollar deposits represented 70% of our total deposits. This is equal to one year ago and up from 69% in the prior quarter. Turning to Page 7, expenses were $1 billion in the fourth quarter and were 2% higher than both the prior and prior year quarter. As previously mentioned, the current quarter included $5.7 million in expense associated with severance and other charges. For comparative purposes, note that one year ago our results included severance and other charges of $17.6 million, as well as $12.9 million expenses related to special one-time cash bonuses paid in connection with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The prior quarter included $2.7 million in severance and other related charges. Excluding the called out charges, expense for the quarter was up 5% from one year ago. With respect to the remaining increases in year-over-year expense growth, the following items were key drivers within the categories. Compensation was higher primarily driven by increased incentive compensation and this year's base pay adjustments, which were effective in April. The impact of staff growth on salaries was more than offset by staff actions and our ongoing location strategy efforts. Employee benefits were higher, primarily due to an increase in retirement plan expenses and higher payroll tax withholding, partially offset by lower medical expenses compared to the prior year. Outside service costs were higher, driven primarily by higher third-party advisor fees and increased technical service cost expense, partially offset by lower consulting expense. There was a corresponding increase to Trust investment and other servicing fees as a result of the higher third-party advisor fees due to the change to gross revenue presentation. Equipment and software expense was up year-over-year due to a software related charge, higher software amortization and higher equipment related costs. Occupancy-related costs were lower compared to the prior year, primarily relating to non-recurring lease adjustments recorded in the prior year. Other operating expenses were down from the prior year, primarily due to lower FDIC expense and staff-related costs, partially offset by higher costs associated with account servicing activities. Shifting to the sequential expense view. Excluding the expense charges in both the current and prior quarter, expenses were up 2% from the prior quarter. Compensation expense increased sequentially due to higher costs associated with performance-based incentives, salaries and other compensation costs. Employee benefits expense increased primarily due to medical costs. Outside services increased sequentially due to higher legal and consulting costs and higher technical services expense, partially offset by lower sub-custody and third party advisor fees. The sequential increase in equipment and software was primarily attributable to a software related charge. Other operating expense declined $8 million from the prior period, driven by lower business promotional spending due to the timing of the Northern Trust sponsored golf tournament during the prior quarter and lower FDIC costs, partially offset by various other miscellaneous expense categories, including costs associated with account servicing activity. Staff levels increased approximately 4% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. The staff growth was all attributable to staff increases in lower cost locations, which include India, Manila, Limerick, Ireland and Tempe, Arizona, partially offset by reductions within our higher cost locations. Turning to Page 8, as we have discussed on previous calls through our value per spend initiative, we are realigning our expense base with the goal of realizing $250 million in expense run rate savings by 2020. And currently, we are embedding a sustainable expense management approach. We expect these efforts to slow our expense growth to be more closely aligned with our organic fee growth. Our fourth quarter results reflect approximately $36 million in expense savings, reducing the year-over-year expense growth by approximately 3 point. This would equate to approximately $145 million on an annualized basis against the $250 million goal. We continue to cultivate a healthy pipeline of opportunities. Turning to the full-year, our results in 2018 are summarized on Page 9. Net income was $1.6 billion, up 30% compared with 2017 and earnings per share were $6.64, up 35% compared with the prior year. On the right margin of this page, we outlined a non-recurring impact that we called out for both years. We achieved a return on equity for the year of 16.2% compared to 12.6% in 2017. Full year revenue and expense trends are outlined on Page 10. Trust investment and other servicing fees grew 9% in 2018. The growth during the year was primarily driven by new business, favorable markets, the acquisition of UBS Fund Administration businesses in Luxembourg and Switzerland, and the impact of revenue recognition. Foreign exchange trading income increased 46%, driven by an increase in swap activity within our treasury team and also growth from the client driven trading. Net interest income increased 13%. The growth in net interest income was primarily driven by higher short-term interest rates coupled with earning asset growth. The net result was 11% growth in overall revenue on a reported basis in 2018. On a reported basis, expenses were up 7% from the prior year. Adjusting for the expense charges in both '16 and '17 that are on the prior page, expenses were up 8% from 2017, reflecting the UBS acquisition, the underlying growth within our business and the impact of revenue recognition. Turning to Page 11, a key focus has been on sustainably enhancing profitability and returns. This slide reflects the progress we have made in recent years to improve the expense to fee ratio, pretax margin and ultimately our return on equity. The ratio of expenses to fees is a particularly important measure of our progress as it addresses what we can most directly control. Reducing this measure from where it was previously as high as 131% in 2011 to the levels we see today is a key contributor to the improvement in our pretax margin and ultimately our return on equity. Turning to Page 12, our capital ratios remained strong with our common equity tier 1 ratio of 13.7% under the advanced approach and 12.9% under the standardized approach. The supplementary leverage ratio at the corporation was 7% and at the Bank was 6.4%, both of which exceeded the 3% requirement, became applicable to Northern Trust effective at the start of 2018. With respect to the liquidity coverage ratio, Northern Trust is above the applicable 100% minimum requirement. As Northern Trust progresses through fully phased in Basel III implementation, there could be additional enhancements to our model and further guidance from the regulators on the implementation with final rule, which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final Basel III ruling. Yesterday, we announced the $0.05 increase to our quarterly dividend from $0.55 to $0.60. This represents a 9% sequential increase and an increase of 43% on a year-over-year basis. During the fourth quarter, we also repurchased 2.5 million shares of common stock at a cost of $235 million. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mike for some closing comments. Michael O\u2019Grady: Thanks Biff. Good morning, everyone. Before we open up the call for questions, I want to offer some closing comments regarding 2018. The three primary objectives for our strategies are to continuously enhance client service, improve our productivity and grow profitably. In 2018, we executed multiple initiatives and made significant investments in order to make meaningful progress on all three objectives. For example, we executed on an important initiative to realign some of our operations and technology functions in order to enhance the client experience by better aligning ourselves and our activities with client needs and our business strategies. We can see early benefits of this realignment as we can effectively and efficiently serve clients end to end and be more nimble in this rapidly changing environment. As Biff highlighted, we've made considerable progress towards our value for spend goal of achieving expense run rate savings of $250 million by 2020. Throughout the company, we have made a commitment to making a value-oriented mindset on ongoing aspect of how we conduct our business. We are investing meaningfully in technology and our talent. In wealth management, we are expanding the capabilities of our goals driven wealth management platform and we continue to hire talent in focused growth areas. In asset management, we expanded our product offerings, including the development of new ETS and alternatives products. And in C&IS in conjunction with the integration of the UBS asset servicing acquisition in Europe, we are investing heavily in building a future state fund services platform and we strengthened our technology capabilities by acquiring or making investments in BECS, Lumin, Parallax and C Tech. Our shareholders benefited from the execution of our strategy through the company's financial performance and return on to capital in 2018. As we began 2019, we are excited about our competitive positioning within each of our businesses. We remain focused on providing clients with exceptional service, improving our productivity and driving profitable growth. Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust's fourth quarter earnings conference call today. Biff, Mark and I would be happy to answer your questions. April, you can open up the lines. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will first hear from Michael Carrier of Bank of America. Michael Carrie : Biff, maybe first one is just for you. You mentioned some of the lagging pricing on some of the assets and just given the period end just wanted to get maybe an update on how you are thinking about the expense outlook for 2019 and beyond? You gave the update on the value per spend. But just how maybe the lower revenue environment can you just dial areas back versus what you are going to remain in investment mode for longer term growth? Biff Bowman : Mike, maybe it would be helpful on the call if I walked through the lag and the lag impacts first and then we will talk about the expense reactions to that, because I think there is some important information here. First if you look at our fees as a firm if I look at our C&IS business first I'll start there, approximately 60% of the fees are equity market sensitive or sensitive to the asset -- they are asset sensitive, they move with markets, and so 40%. If you look at our custody and fund administration line and for those that are sensitive, about 70% to 75% of our fees are on a month lag basis. That means 25% to 30% are on a quarter lag basis. In the past, I know we have talked more about 50%-50% in that lag but our mix has shifted between our global fund service business that are traditional and IIG businesses as we call institutional investor businesses. And so that is more of a 75% -- 70% to 75% is on a month lag and 25% or so percent is on a quarter lag in our custody and fund administration fees. In C&IS investment management fees, which about 40% of the fees are sensitive to equity markets, about 50% is daily but the vast majority of that is in cash funds. About 40% is quarter lagged but more heavily exposed to equity and than 10% or so is on a month lag basis. If you go to our wealth management business, it's more aligned with where we traditionally talked it has not moved as much, but roughly, if you look at our Global Family Office about 65% to 70% of the fees are quarter lagged, 25% of those percent are daily -- 25% is daily and 5% to 10% is in a month lag. And then if you look at our wealth management regions, about 70% are on a month lag basis, 20% are on a daily basis and 10% are on a quarter lag basis. I hope that's important for everyone so they can understand the lag nature of our business for fees to give you some color. I think the rest of your question was really been around with that backdrop, what can we do from an expense standpoint. And I'll take a quick stat and Mike might have a few comments that he wants to add as well. From an expense standpoint, the first thing I'd say is we continue to focus as a firm on the organic trajectory of our businesses. So that's important to us what we think we can grow organically and what we can grow our expenses organically. But we're not immune from considering the macro factors in our expense run rate as well. The way we look at it is this, we have certain inflationary pressures on our expense base, but we think about generating productivity through things like value per spend or other forms of productivity that has to at least offset that inflation in our model. That leaves us with expenses in our view that are there to support the organic growth rates that I talked about and/or to invest in our businesses. And we calibrate those so that we generate organic leverage from what we think we will get on the organic growth rate. So that's the framework we think about expenses and we do think that if we get that right, we drive the productivity and drive the productivity as hard as we can that we can still create that leverage even in an environment where we do see some volatility on the fee line or volatility in the markets. Michael O\u2019Grady: Yes, I would just add to what Biff said that overtime we have the financial model that Biff described there, and so it's important that we continue to execute on that overtime. Having said that, you also have to navigate the environment that you are in at that particular point in time. And clearly, the environment right now is more volatile than it was say a year ago, and so that does means being very careful in thinking about how we manage the expense base for the business as we go through this market environment. So being relatively tight if you will as we go through that and focusing on these longer term productivity initiatives that we've had in place. Importantly, as Biff talked about a year ago or before that, the environment was relatively strong and that\u2019s when we launched into value per spend. And the point is that we didn\u2019t want to wait for a more challenging environment to say okay now we need to come up with ways to reduce the expense base. So it's both through cycles if you will, but then also trying to be mindful of the environment that you are in. Michael Carrie : And then maybe just a quick follow up. Just on your organic growth outlook, I think you guys have been in that call it 4% to 5% range over time. Given what you're seeing in terms of the investment opportunities and maybe some of the competitive dynamics in the industry. Are you still comfortable with that type of outlook just given some of the dynamics in the industry? Has anything I guess changed from that perspective? Michael O\u2019Grady: So from an organic growth perspective, we still are targeting the range that you talked about there and I would say right now in the past year, we were towards the low end of that range. And there's a number of dynamics around that and maybe just to break it down a little bit by our businesses. Starting with asset management, I don\u2019t need to go through all the dynamics facing that business, but that's a business that has seen its organic growth rate come down. And in the past year, basically we were flat as far as organic growth in the business. So a little bit negative on flows and picked up a little bit on fee realization through mix. But essentially at flat that's going to dilute the overall organic growth rate for us. If you look at the asset servicing part of the business, which has been growing at a higher organic growth rate, it continues to grow at the same level that it's been at. In 2018, it was again towards the lower end of that range. But if you think about that as being roughly half of the fees and the range for them being 5% to 6% over time and towards the lower end, still a healthy rate for that business. And I would be glad to break that down further as to what we saw in 2018. And then the wealth management business again different set of dynamics, which I won't go through but has been at a lower organic growth rate. And so even separating out the impact of asset management products in that business, the organic fee growth rate has been more in 2% to 3% range for that and we were roughly in that range for the year. So when you do the weighted average of that that's where you come out to again towards the lower end of what you're talking about. But if you say strategically what are we trying to do, well, we are trying to execute on strategies and target markets where we think that we have an opportunity to maintain that growth rate. Operator : Next we will hear from Brennan Hawken of UBS. Brennan Hawken : You spoke to the lag effect, which is helpful to get a refresher on in great depth, thanks for that Biff. Just curious if you could comment on the fee rate. So we saw it rebound from the third quarter where you had some transactional headwinds. Thinking about that looking forward how should we consider fee rate in each of your businesses. Might the lag effect that you walk through not only have an impact on the calculation of the AUC dynamics and AUM dynamics but also the fee rate, and how should we calibrate that as we move into 2019? Both considering the drop in 4Q and then the rebound here quarter to-date that we've seen in March. Mark Bette : Brennan, its Mark. I'll take a first shot at that. Part of it would be the -- when you're doing the true averages of September 30th to December 31st AUCA or even AUM and wealth management, you are picking-up end of period number that\u2019s going to be lower for the assets, even though the fees haven't fully reflected that yet. We did see in the fund administration -- the custody and fund administration, we did see a little bit of a pick-up from transactions that would help there as well. Moving forward and as we've talked about that it's a really is that the custody and fund admin is a tough one to look at fee rates just because of the mix of businesses that you bring on and that every asset is not equal. So it's really about bringing on services, doing as much as you can for every dollar of asset. On the wealth side, I would say as we have talked about before if you look at the regions within wealth management split let's say roughly evenly between product asset management and the advisory fees, the advisory component has actually held-up pretty well and we look to stay competitive in that area. And then on the product side, we haven't can quite seen the declines that we've been seen if you went back 18 months ago or so. But overall I think part of the fee realization might be the fact that the assets are fully reflecting the fourth quarter markets whereas the fees don't quite maybe has that yet. Brennan Hawken : So maybe we're going to be looking at some fee rate pressure that's subject to a lag, seems like that's what you're saying there, Mark thanks for that. And then I wanted to circle back on the expense question. Mike, it seemed as though you had said that and it seems like this is bit of a different approach than what we've heard from northern in years past. Is that while you guys came up with your values for spend program, making hey when the sun was shining, so to speak. As you enter into a period where you have a potentially more volatile equity market environment, maybe less helpful, better tailwinds. You are going to be diligent in investments and the expense line so as to adjust for potential headwinds that might come through. Is that a fair conclusion there or am I reading too much into what you said? Michael O'Grady: Well, I'm not suggesting that you read more into it than what I'm saying. Having said that, I do think that's a fair characterization. So we recognize the importance as I said of just continually improving our productivity. So it's not a good market bad market thing. And that's why we wanted to put more, I would say structure and focus around value per spend going back a year plus ago. In addition to that though when we enter an environment like this, just as you said and I think it's a good point. There are other expenses that are discretionary, if you will, so the level of \"investment spending\" that you're making. Theoretically, you can say, well, we're just going to flat-out invest through the cycle. We're not pulling anything back. And on the other side, you can say we're going to completely pull back on our investment in order to just get the expense growth rate down. And I think you hit on it when you said, yes, we can look at those categories and say not just whether we're going to do them but what is the pacing for that? Do we need to see a little bit more into 2019 before we continue on certain investments? And there is -- sorry for the express, but there is no such thing as the free lunch. If you delay on something, you are delaying on something. And if you don't make that investment, well, then you are taking the risk for future revenue. So those are the type of decisions that we have to make but it is acknowledging that we do have discretion around those. So let's try to manage those for the environment that we are in as well. Operator : Next we will hear from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : Question for you guys around pricing trends in the servicing business, obviously, I'm sure as you heard from last week, it sounds like the pressure has accelerated on a bunch of parts of the ecosystem here. So curious what you guys are seeing in terms of pricing and institutional servicing? There has always been -- obviously the mix is different and also there has always been some element of pricing pressure. But really just trying to get a sense of whether or not you are seeing any acceleration and pricing degradation here? And then separately, can you help us get a flavor for the makeup of your customer base within C&IS between U.S. non-U.S. asset managers, hedge funds, et cetera? Michael O'Grady: Alex, its Mike, I'll start off. So the way I would characterize the environment that we have been in and I think we are still in is an environment where there is more activity. And what I mean by that is whether it's asset owners or asset managers for different reasons are definitely looking at what they're doing and how they're doing it and there are implications from that. So what does that mean? On the asset owner side of the equation, you have very large asset owners that have managed their capital or their investments in a certain way. In other words, have they completely outsourced it to external managers or have they done some internally. And frankly, we are seeing those types of organizations look at going both directions, and we've seen the impact of that. So some of the larger ones saying we are going to do more in-house, because we think that that\u2019s a better way for us as a scale manager of investments. When they do that, they have different data needs and different capability need. So a lot of time spent around the technology and what we can provide to them, APIs, think database things like that. And again, depending on what you can offer versus competitors, et cetera, it can change the dynamics but there is more activity around that. Second, I would say with other asset owners, they have actually looked at at the opposite way. And we saw some of the impact of that in 2018, where as an asset owner that has done more in house they've said, frankly, that's not our business, if you will. In other words, large corporate pension plans saying we're not going to continue to operate a large in house investment team instead we're going to go more external, we are going to go more passive that's lower cost. And our objective is to get to the right answer for the client. And so in doing that these are still clients but what we do for them is less and we will see some fee impact from that. As you shift to asset managers, there has been a lot of discussion on obviously the pressure on asset managers and therefore their primary objective of looking at the cost of these types of services. They have also when they're asset based they have seen the cost go up in an absolute dollar perspective. So they do look to see if they can reduce cost. There are different ways to get there, whether it's just negotiation with the provider or do they go out and do just an RFI or do they go to RFP, and what are the results of that. So as a result of all that, I would say more activity. Now if you looked at 2018 for us as a result of more activity, I would say our gross business one, if you will, was towards the high end of the rates that we have been at, so in essence good number. The next as I mentioned before towards the lower end of the range. And then if you say okay how do you break out the negative or the \"loss business\" in that. The largest portion of it, so say you are in the neighborhood of 3% from a rate perspectives was more towards if lost or repositioned. And I should add into that certainly you see flows change and the impact of flow. So if we're the custodian for a very large sovereign wealth fund that we do it for equities and they switch out of equities then we're going to see impact of that. So you did see more funds flow and more activity there. When you say loss business, so did you lose a lot and why did you lose it. Again, I would say every situation a little bit different. In certain cases, do we lose through the process because the competitor does a better job it certainly is going be the case. We'd like to win them all but we don't win them all and obviously, we're up against the best in this business. And at times could it be because of pricing, and let's say either to retain the business they've gotten aggressive on pricing or in this case to win it away. That's certainly part of it. But I would not tell you that we've seen overly aggressive pricing by competitors in order to win business on. I would say it's consistent with where we've been. We've tried to be very disciplined around our own pricing. And again, I would say that we've seen some impact but not dramatic. So when you take the repricing component, it's going to be more in the neighborhood of 1.5% to 2% of what we saw this year from a rate perspective. So you're going to have that, as you mentioned, all the time in the marketplace whether it's a little bit higher or lower. But for us I wouldn't say that part of it has been dramatically different. And then I'm going to let Mark to address the second part of your question. Mark Bette : As far as the mix when we look at C&IS, and you're right we don\u2019t published the actual segments within the C&IS. But when we look at it, roughly about half of C&IS is the fund services business, which is where our asset managers would be, and that's we don't breakout that between traditional. But within that, you have traditional asset managers, you have hedge funds, private equity funds. I would say that our GFS business is larger in EMEA than in the United States. So that hopefully gives you some flavor for the makeup of the fund services. Alex Blostein : And then my second question is just around expenses and maybe I'll frame it a little bit differently. But I guess if I look at your core expense base in 2018 net of the severance charges and a couple of other things you highlighted, looks like we are running a little bit below $4 million. And assuming that you continue to aspire to grow the business organically in the 4% to 5% range. Is that a fair way to think about the growth and expenses off of that sub $4 billion number for 2019? Michael O'Grady: At the highest level, Alex, I'd say, yes. So in other words that's -- we're responsible for all the expenses. So we do break them down and cut them every way you could possibly think of. But at the end of the day, we're responsible for all of them. We aspire to do a little bit better than that number in the year from an internal target perspective, mystify a little bit for various reasons, not from a value per spend or productivity perspective but from some of the other things that Biff mentioned in his commentary there but that\u2019s kind of the base, if you will. And then going forward, again, it should be aligned with the organic growth rate in the fees. And so to the extent we can stay in the range that we talked about from a fee growth perspective then yes, then that's what you would expect from an expense perspective. To the extent that that goes down for whatever reason, then we have to look at how do we bring that organic growth rate on the expense down with it. Operator : And next we will hear from Glenn Schorr of Evercore. Glenn Schorr : Just want to little follow up on the pricing discussion. Has anything dramatically changed in terms of client contracts, in other words, like the public money coming up every year or two and the rest of the world having five to seven year role. So maybe something like 15% to 20% of clients come up each year. Am I in the ballpark on that? Michael O'Grady: Glenn, I would say for certain clients, you do have I'll call it more locked-in term that generally where there is more of an investment upfront for the on-boarding. But in most of these contracts, there is generally a notice period six months notice or something like that. So we're not counting on just the contractual term and the fact that they would be locked in. And I would say this is particularly with some of your more just traditional asset management business, they have the ability to accelerate it. So has that sped up a little bit? Again, I haven\u2019t looked at anything analytically. But as I mentioned before, I think we've just seen more activity as they have looked at their situation, I'll call it. Glenn Schorr : And maybe you could talk to the good part of growth. In response to, I think it was Mike's first question, you talked about that 4% to 5% certain growth and you dangled a little bit of if you want more, I'll give you more on what clients are driving. Could we talk a little bit about what are driving it? Michael O'Grady: Well, if I understand the question just peeling it back a level as to where we are targeting in order to have a higher organic growth rate, maybe starting with the asset servicing business. We have benefited from our focus on alternative managers. So for us particularly hedge funds and our hedge fund services business has grown at a higher rate. And again, we will continue to focus there. And we think there's opportunity in the other parts of the alternative space for us, both to the market itself but then for our position there. We also believe on the asset owner side with what we would call the more complex asset owners. So this is to my previous comments about asset owners that are doing more asset management if you will on their own. They tend to be asset owners that have high allocations to private. To some extent, hedge funds but also significantly in private equity infrastructure, et cetera. They have a different set of needs and therefore, we've been focused on how can we meet those needs with technology and a service model. And you saw the investment we made in a technology company that was part of it that was really to join up with what we've been developing on our own but we see greater growths in that segment. Thinking about Luxembourg, obviously, we did the acquisition there but the fund services markets in both Ireland and in Luxembourg are both healthy. But I would say for us, in particular, Luxembourg has been and we think will grow at a higher rate for us just given our position there, which is lower position and now moving-up in the ranks there and we did see that. And then just shifting over to wealth management, on the wealth management side, again, we think that our value proposition resonates particularly well as the level of complexity goes up for the client or to the prospects, so ultrahigh net worth. When I talk about goal driven wealth management, the platform that's behind that the technology that is geared more towards the ultrahigh net worth. And so we have seen a higher level of growth in that area and will continue to do it and then Michael as you see the numbers in Global Family Office. And I'll say that's beyond just keep doing a good job. There's been some very specific strategic initiatives in that business that are working very effectively. So, in particular, we looked at the technology there and we upgraded our technology offering, both the ability to do partnership accounting, just being a little bit technical but then also what we can offer as far as analytics. So we have something called anchor analytics that again is resonating very well with existing clients but also prospects. And then I would just also say in wealth management. From a market perspective, we've talked many times about certain markets where we have lower market presence like in New York, like in Texas where we see higher growth rates for us. And that's not to diminish the growth from some of our more mature markets like Florida or here in the Midwest. And then just to close out in asset management, a significant focus around the area is again where we think we can grow faster, like ETFs and Quant active, which are not the larger parts of our assets under management base but where we see greater growth potential for us. So hopefully that gives you some of the areas that we're focused on. Operator : Next we will hear from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : So I wanted to start-off with a question on the securities portfolio. You manage the duration of the securities book very conservatively, I believe the duration now in assets is just a little above one year. And with the conversation now shifting from fed tightening to a likely fed pause and dare I say even fed easing cycle. I was wondering whether you might consider of locking in some duration and maybe mitigate some of those NII pressures in anticipation of possible fed easing in the future. Biff Bowman : So the answer to that is we have our asset liability committee meets regularly and frequently. And what you just described is the key input to our decision-making and certainly an item that we're considering, given the balance of risks now between future rate increases and either no rate increases or even a reversal of the trends we've had. We do that on a regular basis. We have that conversation at all times. And we've benefitted as you see from the growth in our net interest income overtime from that short duration, but internal debates and views on what may happen in the future is something we consider. As a general rule, overtime, we've always had reasonably short but there is the ability to look at how we want to position that. And I can assure you that that is actively discussed and regularly discussed internally, and will continue to be. And as we look at what is I think now a more balanced picture in terms of what may happen in terms of future fed increases and/or at some point maybe even a reversal of that trend. But we are certainly looking at it and you can see those things in some of our disclosures in the Qs and Ks where we look at sensitivity of net interest income to those factors. Steven Chubak : And just one follow-up for me on capital management. One of your peers recently increased their capital return with the mid-cycle ask. You guys have incredibly robust capital ratios. I'm just wondering if that\u2019s something that you would consider pursuing. Maybe any insight into how you're thinking around long term capital targets have evolved. I know you try to stay at least in the ballpark with some of your peers that you compete with for RFPs. From the looks of things, you are actually above many of those peers today. I'm just curious how you are thinking about managing to explicit long-term capital target or what you think is a reasonable expectation from here? Biff Bowman : So with regard to, first of all, we did a dividend increase yesterday, which was something that we had in our capital plan ask from last year, not public here until yesterday but we did do that. But the way we think about capital and the way the firm thinks about capital is; first, do we have enough to support our growth; second, do we have enough to support ourselves through times of high stress; do we have enough to maintain very high ratios and ratings; and then do we have enough to support a competitive position in the marketplace so that we can compete against others to win that business. I think the answer to all of those is, yes that we are strongly and well-capitalized at this position. And so as we think about entering the capital planning cycle and the submissions are due first part of April, we enter those from a position of strength. That gives us a great deal of flexibility in our thinking and we do look at the competitive environment in terms of where we are, that's one of the four items I just highlighted for you. We think about our position vis-\u00e0-vis the others. But we think we are very well-capitalized right now and are focused on thinking that through in our capital ask and the regulators. In terms of would we ask in the mid period at this point, we think we have got a plan at this point in time that we are going to continue to execute on in the remainder of this quarter and the remainder of the second quarter and we will submit in April. But it's a strong position that we enter the capital planning cycle and submission from, and it allows us to think about our returns with great flexibility. Operator : Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Maybe just to circle back to wealth management, Mike, I think you said that right now that organic growth range is low single-digit in the 2% to 3% area. Maybe if you can just talk about whether you think that\u2019s more of a regional focus in terms of improving that or rather more of the capabilities that you are talking about? And then also just what the client behavior is trending like in wealth management given we're seeing more volatile markets, are there anything more of cash? And then can you accelerate your own investment products within the open architecture platform across that business? Michael O'Grady: Brain, a couple embedded ones in there, so make sure I hit on all of them. As far as the growth, I would say I'm going to call it across the business, so both within the regions but also in Global Family Office. I did highlight some of the things we're doing in Global Family Office, but that's not to say that that's the only area where we see opportunity increase that organic growth rate. And in fact, when I talk about goals driven wealth management ultrahigh net worth that's in the regions, if you will, so good opportunities across the markets when we look at trying to increase that. And I would also just say part of that is I am going to call it addition through subtraction just meaning we have a higher gross in new business rate, it's just that you also have to deal with the flows and people pay their taxes and things like that, that nets you down to that two or three. So we're trying to just get to the best net number that we have that we can get. I think the second part was just about client behavior and I would say, you are absolutely right. When we talk about volatile markets, etcetera, the first thing that we think about is how do we make sure we're very close to the client and managing the situation with them. And I would say so far that we haven't seen a lot of dramatic behavior or changes. And I would say that that's particularly because that's the driving objective behind goals driven wealth management is keeping them focused on what are their goals, what are their objectives and we put together a portfolio that support those goals. And it gives you the ability to go through volatile situations like this without being over reactive and quickly moving out of equities only to then miss the opportunity when it goes back up again. I will say in addition to that we do provide our strategic and tactical allocation portfolios from asset management to our wealth management client and they do tactically move. And last year I think appropriately it moved to more of a neutral position earlier in the year and then more recently in the beginning of this year, moved back to a more balanced position by increasing the allocation to risk assets. So once again, trying to see through cycles for our clients but then also being mindful of what's happening on a tactical basis as well. Brian Bedell : And are you able to get more of the Northern Trust investment in managed product within that asset allocation platform, or are you seeing or just you are using more of an open architecture approach? Michael O'Grady: So I would say everything I talked about there is agnostic to the product. Asset management itself, Northern Trust, is certainly trying to develop products that meet the needs of clients, but that's the only time that those two would come together. So I talked about ETFs and being focused on ETF as part of the success there, they've designed product that we think meet with the goals and objectives of our clients. But it's that direction, if you will, I'll call it top-down, not something the other way. Operator : Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : So just a couple of follow-up questions here. I heard earlier about the conversation around price pressure, 1.5% to 2% in line with what you have been seeing for a while now. I guess I'm wondering if you could give us a sense, Mike. What that range of pressure is on just a couple of key either client types or product sets that you offer? I guess, I'm thinking maybe it\u2019s a little bit heavier on some of the more equity mutual funds and might be it'd be lighter if it all on alternatives but maybe that\u2019s wrong. And just like to get your sense on that? Michael O'Grady: So I'm not going to be in a position to give you a product by product breakdown of where they're more or less. I mean, I think in general as I said, it's more about activity than it is about everybody just driving to lower cost per se. And as much as we know that there's a lot of pressure on asset managers and maybe you would say particularly certain categories of traditional asset managers that doesn't mean that a hedge fund is not focused on their expense base as well. It's probably more acute in the traditional asset management space, I would say that. But I know that that doesn't mean that we are immune in other categories as well. And as I mentioned on the asset owner space as well, they certainly do look at the fees that they pay in order to custody and administer the assets. And so it's not again just a asset manager phenomena, it's something that you have to anticipate, which once again goes back to if you know that that's going to be to the case overtime what you do strategically. And I think importantly the first thing we do is we want to make sure we are providing value right, because the value is going to support the fees that you are paying, it's also going to lock you more into that client relationship. Then we are also going to look at productivity. Both in general as I talked about but within the client how can we be as productive as possible. And sometimes it goes the other way, which is to look at the value we are providing, look at the fees we are getting. And frankly if it's the other direction then we have to have that conversation with the client about the fee that they are paying relative to the service that we are providing to them. So I know that doesn\u2019t necessarily give you the specificity that you are probably looking for, but that would be my perspective. Betsy Graseck : I know you can't give. I was just looking for whether or not there was a range we could talk about. But I get your point. I guess the other question I had Mike was just on in the conversations you are having with both existing and perspective clients. What do you see as some of the biggest pain points that clients have frictions to solve that you are focused on addressing, say over the next year or so? Michael O'Grady: So if it's institutional clients, I would say that on the asset owner side, the primary pain point is around data. So they are primarily trying to assess and determine for themselves what is the appropriate data model for them to have data operating model, and you say what does that mean? Well, it would be easy to say I want perfect data that\u2019s real time. We can provide that essentially. But in providing that that is a higher cost model to be able to provide that to them as opposed to a model that is either on a daily basis or some other basis, okay. And the point on that is it's worthwhile for the client if they are actively managing their investments. So higher cost but they would view it as more than make-up for it, because we are actively managing the assets, and that could be either directly in the market investing, it could be active with managers and it could be also what we would consider overlay strategies where they want to be able to quickly shift their asset allocation. But to do that, they need essentially real-time information in order to be able to do that. Now, as I hopefully laid out, there is a spectrum there of both what the needs are and what we can offer, and so it's not a one-size-fits-all for all of those clients. And that's the dialogue. So with each client, you really have to assess where they are and what they're trying to achieve. And then as a result do they have the right offerings for them. And then I would say on the asset manager side, this is where we're investing significantly in our fund services platform, meaning both fund accounting and transfer agency to really make that much more of a digital experience for the client. And if you think about what we're doing there, we are helping our clients, meaning the asset manager service their clients. And so they are trying to provide a digital experience to their clients, while they can't do it unless we can provide it to them as well. So that's where the investment has been and trying to solve that pin point if you well for dealing with their client. So hopefully that's helpful. Operator : Ken Usdin of Jefferies has our next question. Ken Usdin : Just if I might just clean up a couple of questions. So Biff, you mentioned in your prepared remarks when you're talking about the AUC that the quarter you had a transition out of a large custody client. And I was just wondering can you help us try to understand of the 7% decline roughly just how much that was? And if in fact, the revenue from that client was also already out of the quarter's run rate? Biff Bowman : Yes, so we refer to one large client transition out during the quarter, you're right. And it was a U.S. large corporate client. It was primarily a U.S. corporate cash custody relationship. When you look at it in our trend report, I think Glenn you'll be able to see that the drop of about $91 billion that you'll see in AUC in fixed income within C&IS, that's a reasonable indicator of the magnitude, that's a pretty good explanation of that. And then in terms of the fees, it was partially transitioned. So it was partially it was -- that's where Mark has talked about not all AUC is created equal and there's different fee structures associated with some of that. But it was -- it makes enough movement in the fixed income space that we called it out here. Ken Usdin : And then just a couple of little ones, there are couple of good plusses and minuses throughout the fees and expenses. And I'm wondering can you help us to the extent that you can clarify what leasing gains, software charge and the magnitude of what it sounded like a little higher servicing errors perhaps on the other expenses? Seem like there was some lumpy stuff and a bunch items. Any help you can help us in trying to get some starting points? Biff Bowman : On the leasing side in the quarter, there was approximately $5 million worth of the gain. And we didn\u2019t call that out explicitly, because over the course of the year, there are gains and losses of that in the quarter. And interestingly enough over the course of the year, they wash through. So we at that magnitude haven\u2019t necessarily called them out given their size. On the expense side, the items that I would call out on the software charge that we talked about. If you look at the sequential increase for us, which I believe was just under $7 million in equipment and software, I think it's fair to say that that was essentially all attributable to the software charge. So that gives you some idea of the magnitude of the charge, but it was largely that was driven there. And then in terms of the costs associated with client servicing, we tend to look at that line item, which as you know it sits in other expense over the course of the year. It is fair to say that in this quarter that was higher than our normal run rate and meaningfully higher than that. But if you look at that line over the course of the year, it reverted closer to where we see it. It was a little higher we called it out. And the fourth quarter was indeed higher. But hopefully that gives you some color on what those were. Inside of other expense, which is a copulation of a lot of different moving parts, we had FDIC expense move in our favor by let's say $5 million to $5.5 million in the quarter, but we have these larger expenses associated with servicing clients meaningfully above the normal run rate and they are more than offsetting that. And then we have a lot of other items like value-added tax that all moved that item around. I think it's probably better to look at other expense over the course of the year and look at the average of those run rates. Operator : Next we will hear from Jim Mitchell of Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell : Maybe just a question on the balance sheet and deposit flows. Seems like noninterest bearing and interest bearing both stable quarter-over-quarter. Do you think the flows, the outflows particularly non-interest bearing are starting to come to an end? Should we start to think about deposit growth yet or do you still think given where rates are, the deposits continue to trend down? Just wanted to get a sense of how you are thinking about it? Biff Bowman : So we did see the stabilization, particularly in the non-interest-bearing line item in the quarter. I think it was down about $200 million, so essentially flat non-interest-bearing movement. And as we discussed last quarter when we look at that bucket and the nature of the makeup of that bucket, we think that a lot of the most rate sensitive money had already sought other return seeking products, whether those were within Northern Trust or somewhere else. So we feel reasonably confident that that bucket has reached at least the current level where rates are right now. And in particular, if we don't have any future rate hikes, we think that there could be some stability in that. In the interest-bearing portion of the deposits, while it was flattish from what you can see here, there was some movement down in interest-bearing that can bolster with wholesale funding or others, not a lot, a little over between $1 billion and $2 billion. We view that more as normal operational movements but we would see amongst our clients as they reposition their portfolios, reposition their cash. That is much more a function of the interest-bearing to us, is much more a function of the growth of our business where we're growing our asset servicing relationships and we just generally see our balance sheet growth. Can we see deposit growth? I think we can see deposit growth if we see our asset servicing businesses continue to grow and our wealth businesses continue to grow we should be able to see that. Counterbalancing that is any actions that maybe going on amongst the fed in terms of its own balance sheet management activities, which can put some pressures on it. But generally, we've seen now a couple of quarters of some balance sheet stabilization in terms of balances. Jim Mitchell : And as we think about continuing organic growth in that mid single-digit range is that where you like as you think that\u2019s a intermediate term goal in terms of deposit growth? Biff Bowman : It's not always one-for-one on that in terms of the balance sheet growth, because it depends on the nature of the organic fee growth we're getting. For instance, we could win fund administration and other type businesses where we don\u2019t necessarily have the custody, and we may not actually get balance as they come but we get fees. So it isn\u2019t necessarily one to one with that but it is growth where we get traditional AUC. There's generally some balance sheet growth that could come with that. So I don\u2019t know that I would quite put it at the -- peg it at the levels you talked about, but it could grow from there. Operator : Brian Kleinhanzl of KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : Quick question if the fed does pause given where we're at with the deposit pricing and still seeing some upward pressure there, I mean if Fed doesn\u2019t move next year. Do you still think that you can see some margin movement I mean just assuming that the balance sheet stays flat? Or at this point in the time, we're almost liability sensitive? Biff Bowman : If all things being equal here, if everything else is equal, we do think that there could still be some NIM expansions with no fed rate hikes. But the pace of that growth and the pace of that will be subject to the asset re-pricing that we have. We still have some assets that will roll some that need to reprised, so we do think there could still be some NIM expansion, but probably at a more measured pace. In terms of liability pricing with no future fed rate hikes, we don't see at this point a meaningful need to continue to have see upward pressure on deposit pricing. There might be some modest amount somewhere in the portfolio on the margins, but not broadly across the portfolio. We think we're at or near market competitive levels. Brian Kleinhanzl : And then just a separate one on tax, looks like you ended the year at the low point for the tax rate and that's excluding some of the onetime items you called out already in the presentation. How are we thinking about the tax rate then as you go through 2019? Are you able to adjust your go forward tax rate down, because of the guidance that you put out? Biff Bowman : Yes, I still think at this point in time to 23% to 24% range that we've given you, is where we would suggest you think about for 2019. Operator : Next we will hear from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Can you guys share with us -- you have talked about this transitioning some folks into lower cost markets from your higher cost labor markets. How much more can you do there? I mean are you 50% there 90% there where there is not much more you can do in transitioning people into these lower cost markets? Michael O'Grady: I'm glad to start on that one, Gerard. So I think it's a appropriate observation and one that we have had for some time, because it has provided a significant benefit to us over the last several years meaning going back 12, 13 years ago when we first started what I would consider location strategy to actually move functions into different geographies. And that has matured over time how we think about that. So Biff in his commentary had mentioned some of the different locations, those locations are not all the same. So what we do in Bangalore, for example, is different than what we may do in Manila or what we do in Limerick or Tempe. And so we've evolved it in that way. The third thing I would say is that we've been growing as we've talked about. We have a higher growth rate in our businesses and particularly in asset servicing, which requires more people for it. And so really what it's enabled us to do as opposed to moving positions over, it's that we essentially absorb the growth in those locations. And then to wrap up with the answer to your question, there is still opportunity, both because of the growth and where it happened but also certain functions that still have not fully matured into where their appropriate location is. But acknowledging that and saying well then what does that mean if you are closer to the end I'll call it of location strategy and then in the beginning. And that's why we talked about automation and robotics and what we can do from that perspective. And we have a number of initiatives underway that are part of value per spend where we are looking to automate the functions as opposed to necessarily moving them to a different location. And the view is that that creates even more scalability than in our model. Gerard Cassidy : And then as a follow-up, Mike, you guys obviously are very well-capitalized. You have had a successful acquisition strategy over multiple years of buying different businesses and integrating them into your organization. As the markets remained maybe more volatile pressures on revenues or across the board. Does it make sense to look at acquisition opportunities may be in a more heightened fashion or maybe that hasn't changed and you have been looking, and you just haven\u2019t really found anything? Michael O'Grady: So, as we've talked about on the call, we're all very cognizant. There are a lot of negative aspects of volatile or down markets. And having said that as Biff articulated well with regard to capital. Now is a particularly good time to have a strong capital base and is part of the strategy with regard to capital because it does provide us the flexibility in these types of conditions to both be more opportunistic to your point on acquisitions, if they are attractive for us and to be able to have the flexibility around our capital returns. So, the answer is that we -- yes, we are always looking at acquisitions that can accelerate our strategies. And often, we're not able to execute on those because of the market, i.e., high valuations. And then you are presented with the opportunity because of the environment that either strategically, competitively, certain companies may have issues that then present themselves as opportunities for us or from a pricing valuation perspective, it just becomes more attractive. Operator : Next we'll hear from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Whether you intended to or not, I think you're coming across a little cautious on this call. So I just wanted to ask you, was that your intention going into the call. And specifically, when you add it all up, do you guys expect to show revenue growth faster than expense growth in 2019? And your ROE target, I'm not sure if you updated that are not, but it was 10% to 15% and you reported 16% in 2018. So is there caution? Is that the reason why you're not raising your ROE target or am I just missing something here? Thanks. Michael O'Grady: Sure. It's Mike. I'll address both of those. So first of all, as far as the tone, we didn't come in with an objective for a particular tone. This is just the way that we're looking at the business and the environment et cetera. But needless to say, I mean, I would say, we're certainly optimistic about our position from a competitive perspective and our ability to serve clients and to continue to grow and produce attractive returns for our shareholders. More specifically to your questions with regard to organic growth, fees and expenses, I would say in 2018, the objective was to have those in line, as we've talked about and we came up a little bit shy of that. So we did not meet our target. Now, almost were there and there were certain aspects of as to why that happened. And again we own all the expenses, so it's more reasons as opposed to excuses. And then coming into this year, absolutely the objective is the same on an organic basis. Now, there's a lot of things we can't control. We talked about the markets, how it effects our fees things like that. But the view is, if we can produce it on an organic basis and you have a year like 2018 that produces, I think 1.6 points of fee operating leverage. So that remains the same and that's our objective. And then as far as ROE, we haven't changed the range per se, but I would definitely say that has not limited us in our aspirations or targeting. So we had 16% this year and certainly are not afraid to target for ourselves doing better, absent knowing what is going to happen in the environment. And I would say, now it's a particularly difficult time to say, all right, should you recast the range when part of the reason why we're above the range frankly is because of tax reform a year ago, which boosted the ROE. Hopefully that stays in place, but again there is nothing certain on that front. And then also the markets and everything we've talked about here, we tried to have a range that was through the markets. Hopefully we're not at the top end of that for it, but we don't find the range itself to be constraining on our activities or aspirations. And finally, I would say for shareholders, we're trying to produce the most attractive combination of growth and returns. So as I've said many times, if it was just about the returns there is probably some things we could do to pull back on spending and investing and things like that. And in the short-term get it up, but over the long-term not create as much value for shareholders. And so, how do we make sure we're balancing growth with returns, particularly when we're at a relatively attractive levels. Biff Bowman : Whether if I could add here, I would say, Mike, tonally there was no preview of let's have this be cautious, what it was is us just talking about the environment we're operating in right now. But I think, as Mike said he is optimistic about the positioning of our businesses and the opportunities to grow organically. And I would say -- he and I are both and the Board and everyone is equally optimistic about the financial strength, with which we entered this period of uncertainty and volatility. We have a strong balance sheet, we have good liquidity and we're well positioned to take advantages of the opportunity that type of volatility can put in front of us. So whether you call that caution or optimism, I think that gives us a great array of opportunities. But we are entering a period of time that looks different, then say previous five, six, seven, eight year positive equity run and at least the last three or four with upward sloping rate likelihood. So I -- there was no intention to be tonally cautious, just factually the environment we're operating in, but business positioning, I think, Mike and I would both agree financial strength and strategic product and execution strength are pretty high. Michael O'Grady: Our objective is to deliver on the results. Operator : And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation, you may now disconnect.",

Let me turn the call over to Biff Bowman. Biff Bowman : Good morning, everyone. Let me join Mark in welcoming you to our first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Starting on page two of our quarterly earnings review presentation. This morning, we reported first quarter net income of $347.1 million, earnings per share were $1.48, and our return on common equity was 14%. As noted on the second page of our earnings release, this quarter\u2019s results included $12.3 million of severance-related and restructuring charges within expenses. Before going through our results in detail, I would like to comment on some macro factors impacting our business during the quarter. Equity markets rebounded during the quarter, following a challenging fourth quarter. Compared to the prior year, the S&P 500 ended the quarter, up 7.3%, while the MSCI EAFE was unchanged. On a sequential basis, end-of-period markets were favorable, with the S&P 500 and the EAFE indices increasing 13.1% and 9.6%, respectively. Recall that some of our fees are based on lagged pricing, and those comparisons are challenging, both versus one year ago as well, sequentially. On a month lag basis, the S&P 500 and EAFE were down 2.6% and 9% on a year-over-year basis, and down 4.7% and 4.1% sequentially. On a quarter lag basis, the S&P 500 and EAFE were down 6.2% and 13.4% on a year-over-year basis, and down 14% and 12.5% sequentially. U.S. short-term interest rates were modestly higher in the quarter on average, driven by the full quarter impact of the Federal Reserve\u2019s December rate hike. On a sequential basis, average one-month and three-month LIBOR increased 15 basis points and 7 basis points respectively. Currency rates influenced the translation of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar and therefore impact client assets and certain revenues and expenses. The British pound and euro versus the U.S. dollar ended the quarter down 7% and 9%, respectively, compared to the prior year. The year-over-year declines favorably impacted expense, but had an unfavorable impact on revenue. On a sequential basis, the British pound ended the quarter up 2%, while the euro declined 2%. Let\u2019s move to page three and review the financial highlights of the first quarter. Year-over-year, revenue was flat with non-interest income down 3% and net interest income up 9%. Expenses increased 3% from last year. The provision for credit losses was zero in the current quarter compared to a credit of $3 million one year ago. Net income was 9% lower year-over-year. In the sequential comparison, revenue declined 2% with non-interest income down 3% and net interest income flat. Expenses increased 1% compared to the prior year. Net income declined 15% sequentially. Return on average common equity was 14% for the quarter, down from 16% one year ago and 17% in the prior quarter. Assets under custody and administration of $10.9 trillion, increased 1% compared to one year ago and were up 8% on a sequential basis. Assets under custody of $8.2 trillion were also up 1% compared to one year ago and up 8% sequentially. The year-over-year performance was primarily driven by favorable markets partially offset by the impact of unfavorable moves in currency exchange rates. The sequential performance was primarily driven by favorable markets and new business. Assets under management were $1.2 trillion, flat on a year-over-year basis and up 9% on a sequential basis. The year-over-year performance reflected higher markets and new business, offset by lower period-ending and securities lending collateral. The sequential increase was driven by higher markets and new business. Let's look at the results in greater detail starting with revenue on page four. First quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $1.5 billion, flat compared to last year and down 2% sequentially. Trust investment and other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue and were $929 million in the first quarter, down 1% from both last year and the prior quarter. Foreign exchange trading income was $66 million in the first quarter, down 16% year-over-year and down 15% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential declines were driven by lower volatility, as well as lower foreign-exchange swap activity in our treasury function. The sequential decline was also impacted by lower client volumes. Other non-interest income was $64 million in the first quarter, down 16% compared to one year ago and down 15% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to lower security commissions and trading income, higher Visa-related swap expense and lower miscellaneous income. The sequential decline was due to a leasing gain recognized in the prior quarter, as well as higher Visa-related swap expense. Net interest income, which I will discuss in more detail later, was $430 million in the first quarter, increasing 9% year-over-year, and flat sequentially. Let's look at the components of our trust and investment fees on page five. For our corporate and institutional services business, fees totaled $535 million in the first quarter and were down 2% year-over-year and flat on a sequential basis. The translation impact of changes in currency rates reduced year-over-year C&IS fee growth by approximately 2%. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fee, were $375 million, and essentially flat on both the year-over-year and sequential basis. The year-over-year performance was driven by new business, partially offset by both unfavorable markets and unfavorable currency translation. On a sequential basis, the impact of lower markets was mostly offset by new and favorable currency translation. Assets under custody and administration for C&IS clients were $10.2 trillion at quarter end, up 1% year-over-year and up 8% sequentially. The year-over-year performance was primarily driven by favorable markets, partially offset by the impact of unfavorable moves in currency exchange rates. The sequential performance was primarily driven by favorable markets and new business. Recall that lagged market values factor into the quarter\u2019s fees with both quarter lag and month lag markets impacting our C&IS custody and fund administration fees. Investment management fees in C&IS of $104 million in the first quarter were down 5% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to the impacts of unfavorable markets. On a sequential basis, the impact of lower markets was partially offset by new business. Assets under management for C&IS clients were $868 billion, down 1% year-over-year, and up 10% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was driven by lower period-end securities lending collateral, mostly offset by favorable markets and new business. The sequential growth was driven by favorable markets, higher period-end securities lending collateral and new business. Securities lending fees were $23 million in the first quarter, down 13% year-over-year, but up 5% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was primarily driven by lower volumes, while the sequential performance reflected slightly higher spreads. Securities lending collateral was $165 billion at quarter-end and averaged $158 billion across the quarter. Average collateral levels declined 14% year-over-year and were flat sequentially. Moving to our wealth management business. Trust, investment and other servicing fees were $394 million in the first quarter and were flat compared to the prior year and down 1% sequentially. The year-over-year performance reflected the impact of new business, offset by the impact of lower markets. On a sequential basis, the impact of lower markets was mostly offset by new business. Assets under management for wealth management clients were $294 billion at quarter end, up 2% year-over-year and up 6% sequentially. Moving to page six. Net interest income was $430 million in the first quarter, up 9% year-over-year. Earning assets averaged $111 billion in the first quarter, down 4% from the prior year. Total deposits averaged $91 billion and were down 7% year-over-year. Interest-bearing deposits declined 3% from one year ago to $74 billion. Non-interest-bearing deposits, which averaged $18 billion during the quarter, were down 19% from year ago. Loan balances averaged $31 billion in the first quarter and were down 4% compared to one year ago. The net interest margin was 1.58% in the first quarter and was up 20 basis points from year ago. The improvement in the net interest margin compared to the prior year primarily reflects the impact of higher short-term interest rates and a balance sheet mixed shift. On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income was flat. Average earning assets declined 1% on a sequential basis as deposit levels declined 2% from the prior quarter. On a sequential basis, the net interest margin increased 6 basis points due to the favorable impact of higher short-term rates. As we have discussed in our most recent quarters, we did continue to see the opportunity for foreign-exchange swap activity within our treasury function. This activity has the impact of reducing our interest income relating to Central Bank deposits, as we swap out of U.S. dollars, but increase our level of foreign exchange trading income. For this quarter, we saw additional foreign exchange trading income of $13 million, offset by $10 million less in net interest income. Looking at the currency mix of our balance sheet. For the first quarter, U.S. dollar deposits represented 69% of our total deposit. This is equal to one year ago and down from 70% in the current quarter. Turning to page seven. Expenses were $1 billion in the first quarter and were 3% higher than the prior year and up 1% sequentially. As previously mentioned, the current quarter included $12.3 million in expense associated with severance and other charges. For comparison purposes, note that the prior year and prior quarter included 8.6 and $5.7 million in severance and other related charges, respectively. Excluding the called out charges, expense for the current quarter was up 3% from one year ago. With respect to the remaining increase in year-over-year expense growth, the following items were key drivers within the categories. Compensation was higher, primarily driven by base pay adjustments within salaries, which were effective in April of 2018. The impact of staff growth on salaries was more than offset by staff actions and our ongoing location strategy efforts. Employee benefits were lower compared to last year, primarily due to lower medical expense as well as lower retirement plan costs. Outside service costs were higher, driven by increased technical services and higher levels of legal and consulting costs, partially offset by lower third-party advisor fees and lower sub custodian expense. Equipment and software expense was up year-over-year, mainly due to higher software-related spend. Other operating expenses were up for the prior year due to higher staff-related business promotion and other miscellaneous expenses, partially offset by lower FDIC expense. Shifting to the sequential expense view, including the expense charges in both the current and prior quarter, expenses were flat compared to the prior quarter. Compensation expense increased, primarily reflecting the higher expenses related to long-term performance-based incentive comp -- compensation due to the vesting provisions associated with grants to retirement eligible employees in the current quarter. This quarter's compensation included $30 million in expense associated with retirement eligible staff. It is worth noting, due to changes in service requirements associated with performance share compensation, there will no longer be an additional component of the retirement eligible expense impacting the second quarter, as we have seen occur over the previous two years. Employee benefits declined sequentially, primarily due to lower medical and retirement plan costs, partially offset by higher payroll tax withholding. Outside services declined sequentially due to lower third-party advisor fees and consulting costs. The sequential decline in equipment and software costs was primarily due to a prior quarter software related charge. Other operating expense declined $16 million from the prior period, driven by lower business promotional expense, as well as lower sequential costs associated with account servicing activities, and other miscellaneous expenses. Staff levels increased approximately 5% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. With staff growth was all attributable to staffing increases in lower cost locations, which include India, Manila, Limerick, Ireland and Tempe, Arizona, partially offset by reductions within our higher cost locations. Turning to page eight. As we have discussed on previous calls through our value for spend initiative, we are realigning our expense base with the goal of realizing $250 million in expense run rate savings by 2020. We continue to embed a sustainable expense management approach. We expect these efforts to slow our expense growth to be more closely aligned with our organic fee growth. Our first quarter results reflect approximately $45 million in expense savings, reducing the year-over-year expense growth rate by approximately 3 points. This would equate to just under $180 million on an annualized basis, against the $250 million goal. We continue to cultivate a healthy pipeline of opportunities. Turning to page nine, a key focus has been on sustainably enhancing profitability and returns. This slide reflects the progress we have made in recent years to improve the expense to fee ratio, pretax margin and ultimately our return on equity. The ratio of expense to fees is particularly important measure of our progress as it addresses what we can most directly control. While this quarter's ratio of 111 does demonstrate the impact that macro environment, particularly lower equity markets can have, we remain focused on continuing to drive organic growth in our business and managing our expense to improve our efficiency and productivity. When we look at our results for this quarter, absent the market impacts, we would say that our expense to fee ratio was comparable to where we were tracking in the most recent quarters. Turning to page 10. Our capital ratios remained strong with our common equity tier 1 ratio of 13.5% under the advanced approach and 13% under the standardized approach. The supplementary leverage ratio of the corporation was 7.2% and at the bank was 6.6%, both of which exceeded the 3% requirement that became applicable in Northern Trust effective at the start of 2018. With respect to the liquidity coverage ratio, Northern Trust is above the applicable 100% minimum requirement. As Northern Trust progresses through fully phased in Basel III implementation, there could be additional enhancements to our models and further guidance from the regulators on the implementation of the final rule, which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final Basel III rules. During the quarter, we increased our quarterly dividend from $0.55 to $0.60, representing a 9% sequential increase and a 43% increase on a year-over-year basis. During the quarter, we also purchased -- repurchased more than 2.8 million shares of common stock at a cost of $257 million. In closing, despite the challenging backdrop from the impact of lagged equity markets and flatter interest rates, our performance during the quarter was resilient, generating return on average common equity of 14%. Our balanced business model continued to generate organic growth with each of our client-facing reporting segments of C&IS and wealth management contributing approximately 50% of our earnings. We are confident in our competitive positioning within attractive markets and our ability to continue to generate organic growth. Our focus remains on providing our clients with exceptional services, improving our productivity and driving profitable growth. Before I conclude, as is customary for our first quarter earnings call, we will need to end today's call a bit earlier than in other quarters to allow sufficient time for all of us to get to our annual meeting, which begins at 10.30 am Central Time this morning. Please accept our apologies in the event that we have to close off the question-and-answer period earlier than our normal practice. Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust\u2019s first quarter earnings conference call today. Mark and I would be happy to answer your questions. Kerry, please open the line. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Good morning. Thanks so much for the updates. I just wanted to understand, as you are thinking through the operating leverage that you delivered on this quarter, was there anything unusual in the expense line? I know you called out a couple of items, but then, the follow-on is, as you're thinking through 2Q and 3Q, can we expect the same kind of run rate that you delivered in 1Q? Mark Bette : So, other than the charges that we called out in the expense lines, I would say, it was pretty much expenses as normal. So, pretty much core run rate in our expenses. We did have a higher retirement eligible impact in compensation of $30 million in the first quarter, but some of the other spend, like business promo is sometimes a little bit lower in the first quarter too, but pretty clean. Biff Bowman : Yes. And we have the compensation expense in every first quarter, which you can see a flow through, but the rest of the other line items, I think, were pretty much as reported. Betsy Graseck : I know you don\u2019t give guidance specifically, I'm not asking for that. I\u2019m just wondering the run rate that you're exceeding in 1Q, do you think that that kind of pace is something you can continue with or is there any kind of investment spend that you\u2019d be ramping up on the back of a slower 1Q? Biff Bowman : We continue to focus on our value for spend initiatives and to try to drive our expense base as hard as we can, but we also are growing, as you could see and when you strip out the impacts of markets, it was pretty good underlying growth again in the quarter. So, there is some expense that comes with supporting that growth. But I would say, in general, we think that the trajectory you saw here is something that we're going to -- is a decent run rate and that we're going to continue to try to improve it with our value for spend initiatives, but I think it\u2019s a pretty good run rate. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will be from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : I know you guys don't give guidance obviously, but I was hoping we can talk through some of the NIR dynamics as a jumping off point from here. So, I guess, one, non-interest bearing deposits down a little bit over $1 billion. I think that you talked about in the past, you thought that kind of the excess number was sort of in that $1 billion range. So, should we be thinking of that being sort of down or do you guys think there's more to go. And broadly speaking, is there anything you guys can do from a firm-specific, idiosyncratic perspective to protect the level of NIR from here or is this pretty much peak NIR for you guys. Biff Bowman : So, let me walk through without providing guidance, the way we're thinking about it. The first, Alex, is the volume of the balance sheet. And the thing we feel we can control most on the volume is through the continued organic growth in our custody business primarily, our AUC, which produces that growth in the balance sheet. And we\u2019ve had pretty good results there, and we think we can continue to do that that the balance sheet should continue to grow with that inherent growth that we talk about in our custody business. As it relates to non-interest-bearing deposits that you talked about in this quarter, and we talked in the past about that pool of couple billion, I think we\u2019ve used, is that of that runoff in non-interest-bearing deposits this quarter, half of it was from one client. So, we still do have some sizable, lumpy type deposits that could be yield-seeking. But, we think it's inside the bucket that we\u2019ve told you in the past, the 1 billion to 2 billion in the noninterest bearing. So, we can control the volume. The second part of the forward look, if you will, without guidance is the mix. What we\u2019ve seen in the mix of the balance sheet is, we have seen interest-bearing deposits move from about 78% of the balance sheet to 80%. So, that\u2019s a trend. I think that's a trend that we see in our industry amongst our competitors. And I think that\u2019s a market dynamic. So, I'm not sure how much is controllable there, but we continue to look at that. And then, the last piece that we still focus on is the spread or the yield that we can get from that. And I will break that a little bit apart on the asset side. Look, we\u2019re still asset sensitive as a firm. And so, if rates sort of flatten out from here, there is still the ability to have assets reprice higher for us. So, that is a positive based on where we are. But then, the liability side, the deposit beta and the pricing in the market is something we have to watch from a competitive dynamic. And I think, we've been disciplined and we have a good process to watch that. And if we think it flattens out from here with no rate movements on the horizon, then there might still be the ability to grind up a little bit on the NIM over time. That's where we are. There's a lot of ifs in there but we\u2019re -- if the pricing and the competitive landscape holds stead, we still think we could see a grind up on the NIM. Alex Blostein : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And then my second question around is just the core fees. I mean, it looks like custody and admin fees in particular came in quite strong relative to a challenging exit as of the end of last year. I know you guys highlighted new business, so maybe expand on that a little bit, was this a quarter of outsized new business wins that sort of drove fees where we ended up obviously being for the quarter, without obviously naming clients but maybe you can just help us kind of characterize where some of that business is coming from? Biff Bowman : Yes. We continue to see a strong pipeline across both of our businesses, both C&IS and wealth, and both produced, particularly versus first quarter of the previous year, strong performances. In fact, our C&IS business produced a much -- a really strong year-over-year comparison to the first quarter of last year on the new business front. And we continue to see a broad range of wins, both geographically, product line client types in both sides. In fact, on the wealth side, our organic growth rate was at the higher end of the range as we talked about as well in the first quarter. So, pretty strong new business momentum and then obviously the markets and others in the first quarter came back and we have obviously some lagged impacts, but we also have some month lagged impacts and so we saw the benefit of rising markets. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will be from Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Michael Carrier : Biff, maybe just on the expenses. Given that you are already at the 180, the 250, how should we be thinking about timing? I think, you guys said through 2020, but are there any initiatives in place that we should see some steps along the way as we get into 2020? Biff Bowman : Yes. So, we've said the 250, we\u2019re continuing to push forward on that and making good progress, as you can see. What I would say is, is that we're trying to build in the DNA and the culture here is, is that ongoing expense savings has to be a part of our regular routine. So, while we've got a program defined its $250 million, we also know that we have to embed culturally the ability to go in there and create economic savings from an expense standpoint on a longer term basis than just 2020. We've got a program, we\u2019ll define it by 2020. But that discipline of taking some of the inflationary pressures out of our business through strong expense initiatives is embedding and we can see it and it's becoming part of the culture. So, we will continue to attract to the 250 that we've told you about, but I think more importantly is embedding that discipline for forward-looking years beyond 2020. Michael Carrier : Okay. And then, just on the follow-up on the last question in terms of the organic growth and even the fees, you tend to hold up or continue to hold up better than some of the peers out there. And maybe if you can just provide some color on -- some of the wins that you're seeing, maybe whether it's like asset mix, the client mix, just trying to get some color particularly on the C&IS, and how much from like a competitive fee standpoint are you seeing versus maybe the mix, the product that continues to maybe hold up better than the industry? Biff Bowman : Yes. So, let me pull it apart a little bit on the C&IS side. I would say, first, let's take some regional. We've seen strong growth in our Australia market where we\u2019ve moved up near the top portion of the league tables. I was just talking with Pete Cherecwich before I came in. So, we're near the top of the league charge there in our growth from a graphical perspective there. Luxembourg is another area with the UBS acquisition and other new business. Where we\u2019ve seen outside geographic growth that\u2019s organic, that's strong in the client type, I would say, let me highlight two. We continue to do very well with hedge funds. Our acquisition and hedge fund services has allowed us to grow. I think last year, we cited and continue to see wins in the hedge fund space. I think we had the largest hedge fund launch that was launched last year, is a Northern Trust client, we had a press release on that. But we\u2019ve also been very well in the foundation and endowment space as another example. And we\u2019ve got what I would say is a product and a capability there, front office solution for what I will say a large in-house pools of money, which is commonly or typically done in a foundation endowment. So, that\u2019s two examples of a client type and a geography where I think we\u2019re seeing outsized growth. We\u2019ve got more than those, we can highlight, but we just have a strong performance right now in the growth. In terms of the second part of your question and the competitive nature of the pricing, look, this is a competitive business. I\u2019ve been at the bank 34 years, it\u2019s been a competitive business for 34 years. I would say that we haven't seen it at least in our client mix, the outsized versus normal, which we would typically see somewhere 1.5% to 2% type of fee pressures, which we assume in our organic growth rate, we have to overcome that. We\u2019ve still seen that. And I think that in our client mix, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen. I don't know that it's been higher than that right now but it\u2019s also not lower and it\u2019s pretty constant. Operator : Your next question will be from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : I just wanted to unpack some of the remarks around the NII commentary and recognizing it's not guidance. But I was hoping you could speak to your appetite to the extended duration of the balance sheet, given some concern as the next move could be a Fed easing cycle, and how we should think about against that backdrop, maybe what the deposit trajectory could look like over the coming quarters, if we're in a flat rate environment? Biff Bowman : What we say typically here is, is that we have a process where we go through and look at our own internal projections for interest rates and then we make decisions on how to position the balance sheet. I think, it's fair to say that in the previous quarters, we\u2019ve had some of the interest rate projections that I think are now being held more widely, and we have extended the duration in particularly the long-term portion of our securities portfolio. So, we have that thought process and we do take actions when we see that. So, that provides some protection against that down rate scenario. What I would also say is that if it behaves as normal, the deposit betas on a down rate cycle are typically pretty fast and pretty high, and we would anticipate that being the case here too. So, depending on just how that rate curve move happens and shifts, we could protect some of that spread in margin in a down rate scenario, plus with some of the actions we've taken on our asset sensitivity by adding the duration. So, we have contemplated that. I think we've got a lot of news from our investment management firm and our own Chief Economist that have used on the rate trajectories. And we take those all in and then make decisions on the overall Alco asset liability policy. Steven Chubak : And just switching gears to the capital side, you guys continue to run with best-in-class capital ratios. I know you try to avoid deviating from some of your peers and try to manage the similar capital targets through the cycle. Just given some commentary from some of your trust bank peers about increased confidence given some upcoming changes to our leverage ratio, as well as what appears to be maybe more a benign test in the coming exam, how you're thinking about your capital ask, and whether you have increased confidence in your ability to maybe raise your payout target a bit? Biff Bowman : Yes. So, we\u2019re pleased to enter this cycle that we just submitted here in April from a position of real strength, as you could see from our ratio, and the flexibility that that gives us entering that period of time. The SLR was not a binding constrain for us. So, that change in definition, while we will take regulatory definitions that end up easing the ratio for us in that case, it wasn\u2019t a binding constraint. So, I pull back on that. What I would say is, in the quarter, I think we had a payout ratio of a 119% in the quarter that we cited. So, I think, in the environment we\u2019re in, we don't feel constrained with what we want to ask other than our own constraints, which are, do we have enough capital to support the growth we foresee in the business, do we have enough capital to withstand our own idiosyncratic stresses, do we have enough capital to support our clients\u2019 needs and wants? And I think the answer to that with where we are currently positioned is a pretty strong yes with the 13% CET1. So, again, we like the flexibility that gives us going into positive the review by our regulators. Operator : Our next question will be from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : So, the C&IS fee rate was -- saw a bit of a bounce here this quarter, and I know this is an imperfect way to model your servicing revenues, but it's the best we've got. So, could you maybe help us -- I know that you've flagged new business wins this quarter. And so, I'm guessing that contributed to some of that servicing fee rate improvement. Is that right? And then, were there other factors? Can you just helps us sort of level set, given that this is the way most of us model your servicing revs and how to think about that line from here? Mark Bette : Hi, Brennan. It\u2019s Mark. I would say, as we look at the asset servicing fees on a sequential basis, there was certainly the market drag mainly from both month lag and quarter lag. We\u2019re probably looking at about 2 to 2.5% drag from markets. And then currencies were actually modestly better, but very little. So, really the new business that we saw on the fees side, would have been offsetting that because the fees were basically flat during the quarter. So, pretty strong on the new business side. I mean, it does become a function of business that we're adding. And I would say that we're going to look at the mix of business that we\u2019re adding these days. We probably are from a fee bid rate perspective, that new business is probably coming on at a higher level than what a traditional custody would be, for instance. And some of the moves that we\u2019ve seen, large moves on a year-over-year basis where there has been -- we talked about one transition last quarter would have been at a lower bid rate than what we're hitting segment, we\u2019re bringing on new global fund servicing business. So, it kind of comes back to the mix of what\u2019s coming on and then how the point in time assets look versus the fees that you kind of earned, kind of as you go through the quarter. Brennan Hawken : Okay. That makes a lot of sense, Mark. Thank you. And then the next one is on NII and some of the comments that you\u2019ve made here so far. And this is sort of a cleanup, so I\u2019m kind of dumping a couple of cleanups in here into one. When we think about -- I think you said that there was one large outflow with the noninterest bearing that you still think non-operating is one to two. So, was some of the outflow from the non-operating? And just so we can kind of think about that or was this more competitive pressure? And then, given the fact that you still think and NIM can grind higher and your deposit can grow, that seems to suggest that you guys feel pretty good about NII growth from 1Q as a starting point. Is that fair? Do we need to be concerned upward pressure on deposit costs? Biff Bowman : Let me take the second question first on the upward pressure. That is a competitive dynamic. I think, we feel that we have stayed abreast of the market and that we have competitive pricing in the institutional space today. But, we have to observe the market, and I mean that -- as you know there is sort of very public -- our clients probably are aware of the market pricing from a relatively small number of competitors, and so that pricing is pretty transparent, particularly on the institutional side. So, we\u2019ll remain competitive is all I can say. And there is not upward pressure from others than I think on the deposit pricing there. And the first question was on the... Mark Bette : On the decline in noninterest bearing. And on that it -- I mean, this was a situation where our client was seeking other yield enhancements on that money. But, I would also add that of the decline, so call that half the decline, there was also decline that we saw about a third of the decline was not in U.S dollar currencies, it was actually in non-major currency around the world. So, those were probably just more transactional frictions that those clients have moving through the system, not necessarily an indicator of future trend because that wasn\u2019t part of some of what U.S. dollar looking for higher yield. Operator : Next question will be from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Maybe just go back to the -- to your organic growth trend, so just especially in the custody and fund admin business, it looks like we should have a decent tailwind coming into the second quarter, both on a markets basis, but also if you could just comment on the cadence of organic growth. It looks, like you said, very strong, if that came in during the quarter. So, we also have a little bit of a fee tailwind from that. And then, to add on to that, maybe if you can talk about your front to back office integration, the open architecture approach. I know it\u2019s counter to State Street. I think you have the partnership with Bloomberg. I guess, how new is that effort and should be expect that to be something that can enhance your organic growth of return? Mark Bette : Sure. Let me do the organic growth part first. I\u2019m going to split the businesses apart here if I could real quick. Yes, we saw -- we've talked as a firm of the range that we\u2019re comfortable with from an organic growth perspective. In any given quarter we could be in that range, slightly lower or slightly higher. But then, our businesses themselves could have different trajectories as well. Our wealth business, as I said, actually I think saw organic trajectory at a higher end of its historical range, but that's lower than what we talked to you about target, it's a slightly lower organic growth business. And our C&IS business, if you exclude securities lending, which is heavily capital markets influenced, also was in the range that we talked about for that business from an organic growth standpoint. It's hard to ignore the security lending and asset management businesses. But, when -- if you peel those out, we were in the organic kind of growth rate from a pure asset servicing business that we\u2019ve seen. So, that was a strength there. In terms of the value chain or the -- our positioning, what I would say is we don't believe we have to own every piece of the value chain. An example is an OMS, an Order Management System. I think it\u2019s our goal is to allow our clients to access our technology and allow them to communicate and process their trades in an efficient manner. It's a competitive landscape in the OMS space and there are some very good providers out there. So, we think being able to partner and to integrate with those vendors is very important. We do have a relationship, as we highlighted in our press release at the end of March, with Bloomberg where we\u2019re doing just that. But, that's an example of a very important vendor in the space that we've struck-up a strategic partnership with and can bring that to bear. So, I would say at the end of the day we believe very much that we don't have to bring every piece of that component of the value chain and own it all the way through that we can partner with some best-in-class providers in different spaces and they can work. Brian Bedell : And then, just maybe just one on expense growth, looking at year-over-year basis. If I'm measuring this right, it looks like about 3% to 3.5%, which would be tracking below your organic -- I believe and correct me if I am wrong but maybe slightly below your organic growth rate on a year-over-year basis. So, is that mostly due to the value for spend program coming through, so you try to match that expense growth? I know it can't be every quarter, but generally sounds like you're tracking very well against that goal. Biff Bowman : So, what I would say is, in all transparency and candor, that growth rate is a little higher than that on an organic basis because we had some currency benefits of, call it 4.5 type of a growth rate, which is in the range of where we talked about our organic fee growth rate. So, I think they\u2019re reasonably well-aligned. We\u2019d like to get that organic growth rate and the expenses down a little lower. So, we created leverage to what we talked about. But in fully transparency, the reported number has some currency benefit in it. Obviously, fees have some currency drag equal and offsetting to that. But we would have probably pinned it somewhere in the 4.5 type range from the quarter on an organic expense growth rate. Operator : Next question will come from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell : Maybe just a follow-up on wealth management. You noted that the high end of the organic growth range, I know you\u2019ve been investing there to try to accelerate organic growth. Is that sort of early evidence that you\u2019re getting access and maybe just talk a little bit more broadly about what you're doing to drive that organic growth there and what you think the traction is so far? Biff Bowman : So, I would take a couple of components to that one. I think, the technology that, the Goals Powered Solutions and the approach to the holistic advice and the goals-driven wealth management has really resonated with our clients. We\u2019ve really seen that we have differentiated in the market and we\u2019ve been told that consistently by our clients and other centers of influence that influence the wealthy individuals that we have a differentiated technology to bring to bear for people. So, I think that's been really successful. And the other thing I would say is -- we\u2019ve done a good job of attracting clients in what I will call our virtual markets. As you know, we've got physical offices in about 60 locations in most of the wealth centers around the country. But, there are other cities where we don't have necessarily physical presence. And we\u2019ve been able to create our call to virtual team type environment and really penetrate some, I don\u2019t want to say secondary cities but cities that mark in the major metropolitan wealth centers but still have significant wealth, without having to put physical footprint in. It\u2019s been a really successful strategy. That\u2019s two examples of really strong growth that are I think pushing us up towards a pretty significant organic growth rate relative to the industry and wealth management. Jim Mitchell : That\u2019s help and maybe one another question on deposit betas. It seems like this quarter, at least on aggregate level, your deposit beta was -- has actually slowed versus the last three or four quarters. I think some of your peers are mentioning accelerating deposit betas and high competitions. So just trying to get a sense of maybe the difference that you are seeing, are you seeing that competitive pressure on deposit rates? It doesn\u2019t look like it. Just maybe talk to the deposit beta this quarter and where you think if anything should change going into 2Q. Biff Bowman : Yes. I caution you to look at one quarter\u2019s beta. We could be catching up, slowing down from previous moves that we\u2019ve made. I think if you go back and look at our beta across the cycle, you can start with the rate cycles as the hikes and go back to 2016, if you want to go back, our beta will look much more like you would expect across a longer horizon. So, I think it's a little bit dangerous to only look at it for one quarter because like I said, we\u2019re going to slow because we were comfortable with our positioning in a quarter or [technical difficulty] about 75ish probably percent beta and then lower than that obviously on the retail. Jim Mitchell : Thanks. I think my phone got cut out for half of your response. I\u2019ll follow up later. Thanks. Operator : Our next question will be from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Just a couple of quick follow-ups or clean-ups I guess. Biff, you mentioned earlier that the second quarter won't have the same stock-based compensation that the year ago quarter had. Can you just tell us then again what was the magnitude of that a year-ago, and so what -- how much will be absent this year relative to what was in last year? Mark Bette : I guess, Mark, we are having some audio difficulty on our end. And hopefully what we\u2019re saying is coming through. But yes, you are right, the last couple of years, I remember there was extra expense that came through in the second quarter from a retirement eligible [technical difficulty]. Last year it was $11 million in the second quarter, so we had 32 in the first, 11 in the second just a year ago. This year, we had 30 in the first, but there will not be further retirement eligible stock expense that would impact the second quarter because of the changes in the service requirements were around the performance shares. So, $11 million was in the second quarter of last year but this year, we would not have that. Ken Usdin : Got it. That's a nice year-over-year starting point helper. And then second one on the deposits. Biff, you mentioned that the customer-related deposits should be growing with the growth of the business but obviously the balance sheet has been net shrinking because again of that removal of liquidity. But, has the core deposits been growing underneath the surface and how can you help us like to understand the inflows versus outflows in terms of, trying to guess an estimate when that total earning asset base starts to bottom and turn the corner upwards? Biff Bowman : So, the answer is, that\u2019s a core and it's hard to see in any of the financials we put out there. But, I would say, as a general statement, at the core, we have seen that core operating balances sort of flat now. It's hard to see, like you said, all of the liquidity moving on and off the balance sheet. So, it can be difficult to see. The other things I would say too is when we say that the new business that we win comes with balances, some of the new business wins we\u2019ve been having are administration in nature, and they don\u2019t always come with balance. So, mix of business we win matters too. Over time we tend to win a broad-based mix of business, some which comes with custody balances, some which comes with administration. I would say, we had more wins in the -- large wins in the administrative side that may or may not come with balances. It\u2019s one of the reasons you may see our AUC and AUCA a little bit flatter but revenue still going up and fees going up because the mix of that business is different that\u2019ll probably help the balances. So, you got the dynamic of the win mix matters and then you got the dynamic of the underlying balance sheet that has some, what I will call, the liquid flows or the excess balances moving around, if you\u2019ve seen that in [technical difficulty] core operating deposits continue to be pretty stable. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will be from Brian Kleinhanzl and he is from [technical difficulty]. Brian Kleinhanzl : Couple of questions here. On the -- you mentioned you\u2019re taking a while bit more duration on securities portfolio. Can you actually give what the security duration is now and still how much is tied direct repricing on 30-day basis? Biff Bowman : So, the duration of the portfolio has historically been closer to 1, and it\u2019s moved up by 30% or something like that. On the long end of the securities portfolio is longer than that, but the total portfolio has moved up by that 30 or so percent. And the second part of your question broke up. I apologize. Can you repeat that? Mark Bette : I think [technical difficulty] the exposure of the 30 days within [technical difficulty]. Brian Kleinhanzl : Yes, how much reprices in the next 30? Mark Bette : Yes. On the securities side, the short end of the -- I should say, [technical difficulty] little bit more than half of the shorter portfolio, and there we would say a lot of that would be driven by the one month, three months type of LIBOR moves with a little bit more weight toward the month side. So, it does -- that part of the security does reprice pretty quickly. When you get to the longer portfolio, obviously not all that is going roll over in one quarter or even one year. That\u2019s kind of over the course of -- if for instance if you\u2019re seeing on average two years security [technical difficulty] roll over every quarter. That\u2019s not to think where we\u2019re at. But, that\u2019s just an example of what you would have and you\u2019re sitting with a two-year book when you look at the longer portfolio. Does that help [technical difficulty]. Brian Kleinhanzl : It does. And then, just a second quick follow-up on the deposit runoff. I think, in the past you said that you\u2019ve been able to captured as much as two-thirds of those deposits. Is that still -- is it now -- that\u2019s still true or is it, a lot of that deposit run-off just running away from you in total? Mark Bette : I think we said we captured, about half of it could move into a money fund and then a half would go either to some other vehicle at Northern and investment vehicle somewhere else or would lead. I don\u2019t know that I know if that\u2019s changed dramatically from what we\u2019ve seen. So, I think it is still -- we\u2019ve seen growth in our cash funds as you can see, particularly on the institutional side but we saw growth in our cash funds. So, there is clearly some with this move in the cash funds from the [technical difficulty] and we will typically look on [technical difficulty] options for clients. And so, sometimes the balance sheet is a right fit, sometimes the cash. But, we\u2019ve been able to capture [technical difficulty] within the Company. Operator : I would now like to turn the call back to our presenters for closing remarks. Mark Bette : Thank you for joining us for the first quarter call. And we\u2019ll look forward to talking to you again in July. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this conclude today's teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

Let me turn the call over to Biff Bowman. Biff Bowman : Good morning, everyone. Let me join Mark and welcoming you to our second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Starting on Page 2 of our quarterly earnings review presentation. This morning, we reported second quarter net income of $389.4 million. Earnings per share were $1.75, and our return on common equity was 15.9%. This quarter's results included $4.9 million of severance related and restructuring charges within expenses. This compares to $12.3 million in the prior quarter and $6.6 million one year ago. Before going through our results in detail, I would like to comment on some of macro factors impacting our business during the quarter. Equity markets performed well during the quarter, but were mixed on a year-over-year basis. Compared to the prior year, the S&P 500 ended the quarter up 8.2%, while the MSCI EAFE was down 0.10%. On a sequential basis, end of period markets were favorable with the S&P 500 and EAFE indices increasing 3.8% and 1.6% respectively. Recall that some of our fees are based on lag pricing, and those comparisons were favorable on a sequential basis, but mixed versus one year ago. On a month wide basis, the S&P 500 and EAFE were up sequentially 6.7% and 4.9% respectively. On a year-over-year basis, the S&P 500 was up 6.7% while EAFE was down 2.1%. On a quarter lag basis, the S&P 500 and EAFE were up sequentially 13.1% and 9.6% respectively. On a year-over-year basis, the quarter lag S&P 500 was up 7.3%, while EAFE was flat. U.S. short-term interest rates were lower during the quarter on average as seen by the sequential declines in average one-month and three-month LIBOR, up 6 and 18 basis points respectively. Currency rates influenced the translation of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar and therefore impact client assets and certain revenues and expenses. The British pound and euro versus the U.S. dollar ended the quarter, down 4% and 3% respectively compared to the prior year. The year-over-year declines favorably impacted expense, but had an unfavorable impact on revenue. On a sequential basis, the British pound ended the quarter down 2%, while the euro increased 1%. Let's move to Page 3 and review the financial highlights of the second quarter. Year-over-year, revenue was flat with noninterest income down slightly from one year ago and net interest income up 1%. Expenses increased 1% from last year. The provision for credit losses was a credit of $6.5 million in the current quarter compared to a provision of $1.5 million one year ago. Net income was flat year-over-year. In the sequential comparison, revenue increased 2% with noninterest income up 3% and net interest income down 1%. Expenses declined 2% compared to the prior quarter. Net income increased 12% sequentially. Return on average common equity was 15.9% for the quarter, down from 16.5% one year ago and up from 14% in the prior quarter. Assets under custody and administration of $11.3 trillion increased 6% compared to one year ago, and were up 4% on a sequential basis. Assets under custody of $8.5 trillion were up 5% compared to one year ago, and up 4% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and the sequential performance was driven by favorable markets and new business, partially offset by the impact of unfavorable moves in currency exchange rates. Assets under management were $1.2 trillion, up 3% on a year-over-year basis and up 2% on a sequential basis. The year-over-year performance reflected higher markets and new business, partially offset by lower period end securities lending collateral. The sequential increase was driven by higher markets, partially offset by outflows. Let's look at the results in greater detail starting with revenue on Page 4. Second quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $1.5 billion, flat compared to last year and up 2% sequentially. Trust, investment and other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue and were $955 million in the second quarter, up 1% from last year and up 3% sequentially. Foreign exchange trading income was $60 million in the second quarter, down 23% year-over-year and down 9% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential declines were driven by lower volatility, as well as lower foreign-exchange swap activity in our treasury function. Volumes were also down on both a year-over-year and sequential basis, but the mix of trades had a favorable sequential impact. Other noninterest income was $73 million in the second quarter, up 3% compared to one year ago and up 15% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to a valuation adjustment to visa-related swaps in the prior year quarter and income relating to a bank-owned life insurance program implemented in the current quarter, partially offset by lower brokerage and treasury management fees. The sequential performance was driven by the bank-owned life insurance program and lower visa-related swap expense. Net interest income, which I will discuss in more detail later, was $425 million in the second quarter, increasing 1% year-over-year but down 1% sequentially. Let's look at the components of our trust and investment fees on Page 5. For our corporate and institutional services business, fees totaled $549 million in the second quarter and were down 1% year-over-year, but up 3% on a sequential basis. The translation impact of changes in currency rates reduced year-over-year C&IS fees growth by almost 1%. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees, were $385 million and were up 2% year-over-year and up 3% on a sequential basis. The year-over-year performance was driven by new business, partially offset by both unfavorable currency translation and unfavorable markets. On a sequential basis, the impact of favorable markets and new business, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation. Assets under custody and administration for C&IS clients were $10.6 trillion at quarter, up 6% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential performance was primarily driven by favorable markets and new business, partially offset by the impact of unfavorable moves in currency exchange rates. Recall that lagged market values factor into the quarter's fees with both quarter lag and month lag markets impacting our C&IS custody and fund administration fees. Investment management fees in C&IS of $111 million in the second quarter were down 2% year-over-year but up 6% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to adjustments in the prior year due to a change to gross revenue presentation, partially offset by favorable markets. The sequential performance was primarily driven by favorable markets. Assets under management for C&IS clients were $887 billion, up 3% year-over-year and up 2% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was driven by favorable markets and new businesses, partially offset by lower securities lending collateral levels. The sequential growth is primarily driven by favorable markets. Securities lending fees were $22 million in the second quarter, down 28% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was primarily driven by lower volumes, as well as lower spreads. The sequential decline was driven by lower spreads, partially offset by higher volumes. Securities lending collateral was $163 billion at quarter end and averaged $164 billion across the quarter. Average collateral levels declined 11% year-over-year and were up 4% sequentially. Moving to our wealth management business. Trust, investment and other servicing fees were $406 million in the second quarter, and were up 4% compared to the prior year quarter and up 3% sequentially. The year-over-year performance was primarily due to new business in favorable markets. The sequential increase was mainly attributable to favorable markets. Assets under management for wealth management clients were $293 billion at quarter end, up 2% year-over-year and flat sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by favorable markets, partially offset by outflows. On a sequential basis, favorable markets were offset by outflows. The outflows were mainly within cash products, and in part were relating to change in our product offering where we discontinued the suite of client deposits into off balance sheet money market funds. Moving to Page 6. Net interest income was $425 million in the second quarter, up 1% year-over-year. Earnings assets averaged $106 billion in the second quarter, down 8% from the prior year. Total deposits averaged $89 billion and were down 7% versus the prior year. Interest bearing deposits declined 4% from one year ago to $72 billion. Noninterest varying deposits, which averaged $18 billion during the quarter, were down 17% from one year ago. Loan balances averaged $31 billion in the quarter and were down 4% compared to one year ago. The net interest margin was 1.61% in the second quarter, and was up 13 basis points from a year ago. The improvement in the net interest margin compared to the prior year primarily reflects balance sheet mix shift and the impact of higher short-term interest ratess. On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income was down 1%, average earnings asset declined 4% on the sequential basis as deposit levels declined 2% in the prior quarter. It is worth noting that more than 85% of the sequential decline in deposits was related to lower wholesale deposits, which we use for leveraging purposes within our treasury group. These accounted for approximately 3% of our non-U.S. office deposit balances in the second quarter. Client deposit levels were down less than one-half of the percent on a sequential basis. On a sequential basis, the net interest margin increased 3 basis points, primarily reflecting a balance sheet mix shift, partially offset by lower short-term interest earnings. We did not see the opportunity for foreign exchange swap activity within our treasury function to the extent we have seen in the last several quarters. The activity this quarter resulted in approximately $2 million of foreign exchange trading profit with a slightly less amount that what we gave up in net interest income. This quarter's results were more in line with business as usual results. For comparison, in the prior quarter, we saw additional foreign exchange trading income of $13 million, offset by $10 million less in net interest income. Looking at the currency mix of our balance sheet, for the second quarter, U.S. dollar deposits represented 67% of our total deposits. This is down from 69% in both the prior year and prior quarter periods. I wanted to highlight two items for you to know as we look at our sequential trends. First, during the quarter, we implemented a bank-owned life insurance program that had the effect of moving $1 billion from earning to non-earning assets. The program was in place for approximately one-half of the quarter, and resulted in an approximate $3.5 million decline in net interest income and $4.2 million increase within other operating income, as well as the tax benefit. On an annualized basis, we would expect the program to benefit net income by approximately $14 million with $36 million increase within other operating income, offset by a decline of an estimated $29 million in net interest income and a tax benefit of an estimated $7 million. Second, as I referred to when we discussed wealth management assets under management. During the quarter, we had a change in our deposit products, whereby we discontinued the sweep of client deposits into off balance sheet money market funds. This change resulted in an increase of approximately $4 billion in period end deposits that you should see on our savings, money market and other line within our balance sheet. Turning to Page 7. Expenses were $1 billion in the second quarter and were 1% higher than the prior year and down 2% sequentially. As previously mentioned, the current quarter included $4.9 million in expense associated with severance and other charges. For comparison purposes, note that the prior year and prior quarter included $6.6 million and $12.3 million in charges respectively. Excluding the called out charges, expenses for the current quarter was up 1% from one year ago. The impact of favorable currency translation benefit expenses are just under 1 percentage point on a year-over-year basis. Excluding charges in both the current and prior year quarters, the following items were key drivers within the expense categories. Compensation was higher, primarily driven by higher salaries due to base pay adjustments and staff growth, partially offset by lower expenses related to long-term performance-based equity incentives. Employee benefits expense was slightly higher due to higher payroll withholding tax, partially offset by lower medical cost and retirement expenses. Outside service costs were up slightly due to higher technical services expense, partially offset by lower third-party adviser and sub-custody expense. Equipment and software expense was up year-over-year mainly due to higher software related spends. Other operating expenses were up from the prior year due to higher miscellaneous expense, partially offset by lower FDIC premiums and lower staff related spends. Shifting to the sequential expense view, including the expense charges in both the current and prior quarters, expenses were down 1% sequentially. Compensation expense declined, primarily reflecting lower expenses related to long-term performance based equity incentives, partially offset by higher salaries due to base pay adjustments and higher cash based incentives accruals. The prior quarter's equity incentive expense included $30 million in expense associated with retirement eligible staff. Employee benefits increased sequentially, primarily due to higher medical costs. Outside services declined sequentially due to lower technical services and legal related costs, partially offset by higher third party adviser fees and sub-custody expenses. The lower level of technical services did benefit from approximately $6 million in onetime vendor expense credit during the quarter. Other operating expense increased from the prior period, primarily driven by higher business promotion expense. Staff levels increased approximately 6% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. The staff growth was all attributable to staff increases in lower cost locations, which include India, Manila, Limerick, Ireland and Tempe and Arizona, partially offset by reductions within our higher cost locations. As we have discussed on previous calls through our value for spend initiative, which we started in 2017. We have been realigning our expense with the goal of realizing $250 million in expense run rate savings by 2020. We continue to embed a sustainable expense management approach. We expect these efforts to slower our expense growth to be more closely align with our organic fee growth. Our second quarter results reflect approximately $47 million in expense savings, reducing the year-over-year expense growth rate by approximately 2.5 points. This would equate to just under $190 million on an annualized basis against the $250 million goal. Turning to Page 8, a key focus has been on sustainably enhancing profitability and returns. This slide reflects the progress we have made in recent years to improve the expense of the fee ratio, pre-tax margin and ultimately, our return on equity. The ratio of expenses to fees is particularly important measure of our progress as it addresses what we can most directly control. We remain focused on continuing to drive organic growth in our business, and managing our expenses to improve our efficiency and productivity. Turning to Page 9, our capital ratios remain strong with our common equity Tier 1 ratio of 13.6% under the advanced approach, and 13.2% under the standardized approach. The supplementary leverage ratio at the corporation was 7.6% and at the bank was 6.9%, both of which exceed the 3% requirement that became applicable in Northern Trust effective at the start of 2018. With respect to the liquidity coverage ratio, Northern Trust is above the applicable 100% minimum requirement. As Northern Trust progresses through fully phased-in Basal III implementation, there could be additional enhancements to our models and further guidance from the regulators from the implementation of final rule, which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final Basel III rules. During the quarter, we repurchased more than 2.9 million shares of common stock at a cost of $271 million. As we announced in June, our 2019 capital plan received no objection from the Federal Reverse. In it, we requested authority to increase our quarterly common dividends of $0.70 per share. Yesterday, our Board of Directors formally approved the planned dividend increase, which represents a year-over-year increase of 27% and a sequential increase of 17%. The capital plan also provides the flexibility to repurchase up to $1.4 billion of common stock. The timing and amount of shares repurchased will depend on various factors, including but not limited to, Northern Trust business plans, financial performance, other investment opportunities and general market conditions, including share price. In closing, despite the impact of the mixed global macroeconomic environment, we performed well during the quarter, increasing our pretax margin to 34% and generating return on average common equity of 15.9%. Our balanced business model continue to generate organic growth with each of our client facing reporting segments of Wealth Management and C&IS contributing approximately 50% of our earnings. We are excited about our competitive positioning within each of our businesses. In Wealth Management, our holistic advice approach continues to resonate with prospects and existing clients. We continue to deepen our talent and expertise with key hirings across our business. In C&IS, we continue to have success in growing our asset servicing business as evidenced by wins announced during the quarter, such as Magnetar Capital, Anchorage Capital and the World Bank. Our technology, operational expertise, client focus and flexible operating model continue to support our strategy very well. We remain focused on providing our clients with exceptional services, improving our productivity and driving profitable growth. Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust second quarter earnings conference call. Mark and I would be happy to answer your questions. Paula, please open the line. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : So curious about the thinking about interest-bearing cost for the non-U.S. office line. You had called out the reduction in wholesale deposits, which I'm sure was helpful. But just wanted to confirm whether or not there was any of the noise flowing through that line that we should think about? And then thinking about deposits broadly, how should we think about the deposit costs for those $4 billion in interest-bearing that you flagged in your end of period, resulting from the termination of the money market fund program? Biff Bowman : On the additional color on the deposits in the foreign office deposits, in addition to the lower leveraging amount that we highlighted, we've really had two individual clients that accumulated large deposits in the first quarter and they deployed them in the second quarter. We would consider that normal operating flow that we see from time-to-time and between quarters. So we can really identify that movement in the foreign office deposits, excluding those that were impacted by the lower leveraging in a handful of clients, in the case I just highlighted two clients really made that move. So not uncommon for us to see builds in certain periods, and then the deployment of that in other periods, so I'd say normal flow there. In terms of how should we think about the pricing of the deposits in the retail space or in our wealth -- from the closure, if you will, of our anchor-sweep product, we did offer our rates for those individuals at attractive rates for that, that allows us to maintain. That has a finite period, and when that rolls off then they will be at market rates on the competitive front. Mark Bette : And Brennan, I would just add. If you look at the savings money market and other line, you did see increase sequentially in the cost, which is partly reflective of what this indicated but then also the set increase in December, there was a lag pricing impact in the retail deposits. So that wasn't quite fully reflected in the first quarter yet. So that's another part of the sequential impact. Q - Brennan Hawken : And then, Biff, do you still expect -- I want to say that you had flagged during a presentation intra quarter that you expected deposit betas to be quite high in the event of a fed rate cut near 100%, as I recall. Is your expectation still that they would be that high? And why do you think that betas are going to be so much higher on the way down than we have seen in prior historical periods of that rate cuts? Thanks. Biff Bowman : It's still our view that the betas will be -- let me separate first retail and institutional deposits. It's our view certainly on institutional deposits, which make up the majority of our balance sheet that the betas will be pretty high. And almost like, say, almost symmetrical as they were on the way up is, it's the most recent betas were pretty high. We think that that same beta favourability would happen all the way down. So, perhaps not at a 100%, that depends on the competitive landscape but high on the way down. So that's what we see institutionally. On the retail space, I think it's really a function of the competitive landscape there. So they were -- they moved up fairly slowly. So we benefited from the early days of the rate hikes, and then that beta moved up overtime. I think you could probably also see some of the same symmetrical path down in betas on the retail space. But there is a much more transparent market to understand the pricing there, and we need to remain competitive in that landscape. So I guess, I'd summarize in end by saying I think we still believe that the overall betas would be pretty high on the way down and pretty fast. If you get closer and closer to a zero down for U.S. dollars that could create some compression as we get closer to that, but there's still a few hikes before we get there. Operator : And moving on, we'll go to Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr : A quick one related to fee caps. Mark, it's obviously very strong year-to-date. I'm just curious how -- particularly in the U.S. -- curious how breakpoints, fee caps play a role and make it hard for us to look at any custody fee rate trends? And maybe you can throw in there comment about what kind of fee rate on the new assets coming in the door? A - Mark Bette : There is a lot that goes into that. So we don't specifically look at fee rates internally, because of really the mix of business can be quite different. So you could have a very large custody mandate with that that's where the fees might be small compared to a small assets under administration mandate, where the fees are larger. So as far as the trends go there, it's hard to pin down something there. I would say though that as we've highlighted before when we look at that line, about 40% of the fees are not asset value related. So, in general you would get the fees moving less than what you would get the assets, assuming that asset mix is coming out at the same rate, which it's not. I would say that some of the places where we're winning are in places that we do have and we talk about hedge fund services and areas like that that does usually generically would have higher beta or a higher fee rate than what say domestic custody would have for instance. Biff Bowman : Glenn, I would just add second part of your question was the new assets coming on board, the fee rates. I think Mark's point is important there is the types of wins we're having where its growth in -- I think we mentioned Magnetar and Anchorage hedge funds. They're still good value added in fee base there and then there is other large, just pure asset servicing custody wins where the competitive landscape, the basis point yield might be a bit lower. So you've got to really look at the mix coming in. And we've got a pretty nice mix, both globally and product set mix. So we get a nice blend of rates coming in on the new business, it's not all just in lower margin company rates. Glenn Schorr : Maybe a one quick follow up to Brennan's question, I hear you loud and clear on the high betas on the way down on the institutional side. I'm curious, is there difference in client segments, by client segment in the retail side? I'm surprised to see such rate sensitivity. It's not what I think of when I think of Northern Trust Wealth Management. A - Biff Bowman : I think what you have to look at there is you've got to look at the beta over a much longer period than just one quarter, because we could have been behind the market, slower to the market over periods of time. And you can see beta moves in certain period that larger than a data than you would expect, because we're catching up from some competitive landscape. And I will still say it is still competitive for even high network deposits. You've got sophisticated investors who are looking when yields get to some differential with the market that are seeking at least for the cash portion of their business balances, they're looking for market rates. And so we need to remain competitive. It may not be quite as competitive as those that are relying on retail deposits, but it remains credited. Operator : And next we'll go to Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Michael Carrier : Maybe first one just on the expense growth, so that's been coming in better this quarter and year-to-date versus the targeted in line with the organic growth rate. Just curious, should we be expecting maybe any new spend in the second half of this year, or could that be coming in lower? Just given the revenue backdrop and some of the uncertainty, whether it's -- you mentioned some of the FX, but also the rate backdrop? Biff Bowman : So here, I would say the environment we're operating in its not lost on us. So a net interest income environment that looks like it'll become more difficult in terms of where the rates are moving. So we really want to continue to drive our organic revenue in our franchise. But we have to be mindful of the macro headwinds that we're facing. We can't just singularly focus on that. So that means I think the disciplines that you've seen in the first six months of this year and I think even longer term than that, they are vital to our profitability. They have to remain. So we are focused on certain disciplined capital deployment for projects, return seeking project, disciplined expense management around occupancy, procurement, business promotion, location strategies, automation driving it, organizational design, all things we talked about. Those are even more in focus. They have been in focus. You've seen the benefits of our focus of them. But they are even more in focus as we are recognizing the environment that we're entering. And I can tell you that I think some of the cultural behaviors that we've embedded as a part of value for spend, are now part of the disciplines that will help us we think continue to execute on that in the second half of this year and in the future. So, there is not a planned ramp in those expenses, because we are certainly cognizant of the environment we're operating in. And there is a strong focus on maintaining those. What I will say though and want to be clear is we think our organic growth rate is still a very important governor, if I could say that, on what is allowable for that expense growth rate. So we still want to grow our franchise organically. And there is some expense needed to fuel that organic growth. But as long as that's proportional and appropriate with enough spread in it, we think we can move it forward and move the profitability of the firm forward. Michael Carrier : And then just as a follow up on NII. So you mentioned your expectations on deposit betas. And then just, if we go down the path of getting a fed cuts. Just anything from a positioning or duration, the balance sheet, anything change or do you expect anything? And just so I'm clear on deposits, you mentioned on the institutional side some of the activity that you saw on the non-U.S. You mentioned some of the things that you guys do on the leveraging. And then it sounds like on the retail side, you're seeing some money move on. When we just think about the start to jump off on, is that roughly unchanged, because you had the depression like of the institutional but you're having the retail come on board? Biff Bowman : Let me break that into two parts. One, you're talking about the balance sheet jump off point from a size. And then the first is sort of I think more of an outlook on net interest income, and I think we will give a little color there. I would imagine people want to hear that. If you looked at our net interest income from the Q1 to Q2, when and we stripped out. There was some favorable impact from the lower FX swap activity, but we implemented BOLI, which we took our earning assets down. If you netted those out, our sequential decline was probably just under 3%. I know we reported 1% but those factors moved it around. If we look at the current implied curve and reassume two rate cuts in July and September, we would think in the third quarter that we would see about 2% to 3% decline in net interest income from this quarter's reported net interest income. And that includes the impact of BOLI and other things in there. So we would see somewhere around 2% to 3%. In the fourth quarter of this year, we would say flat to slightly down from there. And again that's relying on a whole series of factors, how do the betas play out, how does our balance sheet play out over that time in terms of volume and mix. There's a lot of factors. So based on our best modeling and our best forecast, at this point, relatively modest decline in the net interest income in Q3 and flat to slightly down in Q4 based on our current thinking in there. In terms of the balance sheet size, Mark, if you want to? Mark Bette : I guess if you look at the average balance sheet, and you're thinking about that as your starting point, which is probably the best thing to do, because we do have period end deposits flows that spike up. The one thing I would point to is this change in the sweep product in wealth management where that was really only a partially quarter, it happened at different points throughout the quarter. So for that line, the savings money market and other looking at the end of period for that might be a little bit closer to where it might run during the quarter, but that remains to be determined. But that's how I would position as far as balance sheet jump off plan. Operator : And next we'll go to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Good morning. A couple of follow ups to that, one, if your rate cuts were all in July, if you got your rate cuts in July. Is there a material change to the numbers you just described, or not really? Biff Bowman : Not really. In fact, it might be very, very modestly better to get 50 basis points than 225s, 50 and a 25 we would probably have to get back to you what that is. But we know what it is but it might be a little bit more impactful. But a 50 is very modestly better. So I could say roughly for your projections probably about equal over two quarters. Betsy Graseck : And then can you just give us some color as to what the decisioning was behind the BOLI? What was the reason for that? And should we expect more, either BOLI like type of transactions going forward, or other securities asset repositioning that you might be doing in a changing rate environment? Biff Bowman : As you know, we've embarked and what I will call a balance sheet optimization type program. And we've look at certain asset classes or certain yield opportunities on our balance sheet. We had no BOLI investments, which made us relatively unique in the marketplace. And in the current yield environment and particularly with the declining rate environment, the benefits of that actually were pretty powerful. As we sited, its $14 million of benefit in net income for franchise, it does take down NII -- on an annualized basis, it does take down our NII budget, it will flow through the other income line. And you saw some of the benefit of that in just one half of one quarter. We're always looking at optimization efforts. I can't say whether we would add more or less BOLI, for instance, in this transaction but this was our first pass at it. Betsy Graseck : I guess, I was just wondering like how you decided to size it the way you did. Was it -- as you kind of indicated, you were the only one who didn't have it. So was there a relative positioning vis-\u00e0-vis peers, or I'm just trying to wonder why $1 billion\u2026 Biff Bowman : There is several factors to that, A, limit a size. There is regulations as to how much is a percentage of capital that you can have. But remember, we have counterparty credit exposure then that we have to go out to with very high credit quality carriers that we know have this credit exposure to. And so our credit group also is providing input as to the sizing of the portfolio. And when we put all that together, it added up to a $1 billion for now. Betsy Graseck : So you would say -- I should take from that that you're optimized on the BOLI positioning? Biff Bowman : As we hit here today, that's -- we have $1 billion in there. We're always looking at those opportunities. I can't say whether we'd go higher or lower in the future. But I think we're here for some period of time. Operator : And next we'll go to Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : Thanks for the NIR guidance, and I know you guys typically don't get into explicit guidance. But given where we're in the cycle, I think it was definitely appreciated. So thanks for that. Question for you guys around expenses, again. So given the fact that historically you've been sort of aiming to align expense growth with organic, fee growth, so call it, 4-ish, 5-ish percent, or something like that. In light of a tougher backdrop from NIR, and obviously it tends to be much higher margin type of business for you guys. Is there an emphasis to potentially bring that down below the organic fee growth levels? In other words, could we still anticipate some of the positive operating leverage or dynamic even with your current NIR outlook? Biff Bowman : I think we are looking at that hard, Alex. Like you said, we can't ignore the backdrop we're in. And pressure on one of our important revenue lines, net interest income, may put additional pressure that we have to look at on our expense line to widen out that leverage that you're talking about. Some things will naturally happen there. I think it's important, for instance, I'll tell you. Certain cash based incentive plans. If net interest income goes down, they're going down. So that will give us some natural reduction in our expense lines, if that's the backdrop. But then the discretionary items I described, we may have to continue to push harder and harder on some of those levers to widen out, if you will, the organic leverage in our business to overcome, if you will, some of the pressures we see on net interest income, for instance. Alex Blostein : Second question around foreign exchange trading, so last quarter I believe there was $13 million swap benefit in that line. So kind of I think apples-to-apples, you've seeing an improvement sequentially in a fairly difficult environment. So curious again kind of what -- and I know this has been a focus for you guys to drive some of the organic initiatives in foreign exchange trading and gain some market share. So maybe a little bit on kind of what's going on underneath the surface within that part of the business? And any better way for us to think about kind of the go forward? Biff Bowman : So you're right. At the core, the core FX actually did pretty well, if you'd strip the swap impact out of that. I think there's a couple of factors in there. One, as we saw our share of FX transactions, so we got more client based increase from quarter-over-quarter. So we're communicating, marketing better products and capabilities to capture the higher percentage of share of trade even in a lower volatility environment we captured more share of trade. And we also saw a little bit higher volume in some of the emerging market currencies in the quarter from our client base, I don't know if that's true for everyone. But from our client base, back in and itself, also has a little wider spread. So the combination of those two, I think, actually drove a relatively good core FX performance quarter-over-quarter. Operator : And next from Wolfe Research, we'll go to Steven Chubak. Steven Chubak : So I just wanted to ask a follow-up on the securities book. I appreciate all the detailed NII guidance. And as we model the securities yield and layer in the forward curve. Can you just remind us what percentage of the book reprices each quarter? And where does the overall duration of the books at today, given some of the extensions you've been doing? Biff Bowman : So the overall duration of the book, let me answer the second part is at 1.3 years. And we have been adding some duration, you're right. But duration that we've added has been somewhat muted as the longer rates have come down and obviously, creates a view of faster prepayments. And so that has the impact of shortening the duration. So we're lengthening it with our purchases but the actual come down of the rates in the long end of the curve mutes it. But we're still longer at 1.3 than we've been traditionally where we've run probably closer to 1, or 1.1 in terms of the duration. As far as the repricing goes, we've talked about before how our securities portfolio can be divided between a shorter or longer. The shorter book is probably a little bit less than half of the total securities book, and that's where you would get mostly when you think about one month LIBOR and three month LIBOR, that repricing would happen fairly quick, obviously, within a quarter. And then the other part of the book, the longer book, that's as you get securities rolling over, you put something on two years ago it rolls over and then you reinvest that. So that would happen on more of a staggered basis across a period of time. Steven Chubak : And just one follow-up for me on some of the deposit growth commentary, and I think there is a big debate about how much of the rate headwinds can be offset with volume growth. And you noted that deposit betas should be elevated on the way down, but just given overall and more sophisticated client base. How are you guys thinking about the pace of organic deposit growth that you can generate within both retail and institutional? And just looking out to the forward curve, you gave some very helpful detail on '19. Just as we look out to 2020. Do you believe there is a path to generating sufficient NII or volume growth to offset some of those rate headwinds? Biff Bowman : If we look out to 2020, I would say, we're going to start to become more reliant on an organic growth rate that we've talked to you before in our asset servicing business primarily to drive the custody growth and the deposit growth that you're talking about. We could be more aggressive in our pricing to try to attract deposits. But given the construct of our balance sheet, that type of funding need has to make good economic sense for us to want to do it, and we don't have a big loan portfolio on for instance. So I think the growth rate in our deposit is going to come from, at least most of that will come from just the organic growth we've seen in our fees. So if we've talked about 4 to 5, some portion of that would come with deposits, not all of it, because we do fund administration and other work, which may not come with custody deposits on the balance sheet. But much of it comes with custody deposits. So, I think that becomes more of the benchmark for the balance sheet growth. And to your point, depending on how rates move, it'd probably be difficult to make it up with volume, to your points. What I would say is, if we get more than two insurance type cuts that the fed may -- that we would project, but you put your own projection on it. If we get more than two and we start to get into something that looks like quantitative of easing. Historically, I think the custody banks have been the recipients of the liquidity that's pumped into the system. And so we could see deposit growth and balance sheet growth move at a much faster rate if this becomes more than a one or two rate cut cycle. Operator : Moving on, we'll go to Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell : Hi, just two questions. First, maybe one last one on the deposits, and noninterest bearing actually was flat on a sequential basis. A lot of your peers were down and have been highlighting declines, going forward. I guess is that, that organic growth you're talking about. What's keeping your noninterest bearing flat and how do you think about that over the next, I guess, looking over the next couple of quarters? Biff Bowman : Let me walk you through that again. So we had about $18 billion in average noninterest bearing deposits, I think, in the quarter. And if you look at those, about 85% of those are in dollar. So of the dollar deposits noninterest bearing, 25% are wealth management deposits. Those have been historically very sticky and they have remained sticky for a long time. Another 25% are our treasury cash management business. They are there for balances, to pay fees, et cetera. Those two have been fairly sticky. So I think you've got kind of the half of the dollar base noninterest bearing that have been and remain pretty sticky. That leaves the other 50% there, which are part of core institutional asset servicing. Many of those we think are just part of operational needs and been there. We talked about $3 billion to $4 billion being what I would say was perhaps yield seeking that was sitting there in non-interest bearing. And we've seen -- we have regular dialogues with those clients. We believe those are also there for the liquidity purposes. We certainly have seen run-off in noninterest bearing over the year, but more frequently we think most of that is sought -- the yield seeking piece had sought yield already. So we've seen a little bit more stability in noninterest bearing in the last two quarters. Q - Jim Mitchell : And maybe just bigger picture, I know you guys have been talking about efforts to boost organic growth and wealth. Maybe you just can update us on what you've been doing there. Any evidence you had of that on accelerating that would be helpful. Thanks. Biff Bowman : So you could see with our wealth management reported figures, they had a strong quarter, very strong quarter, very healthy margins and good fee growth rate year-over-year, some of that driven by markets but some of that driven by organic. And again, they continue to look at geographies where we have -- want to increase our market share. We don't always have to have a physical presence. As we've talked about in the past, there are certain cities and markets where we've got grown our market share without having to have a physical presence. And those are generally very attractive pieces of business with low physical overhead needed to get there. We can serve it out of Chicago, or Florida or New York, or wherever. And then I would say our product suite, particularly our holistic advice, our Goals Powered solutioning, has resonated and particularly resonated with people in an environment where we've seen a little bit more volatile. Certainly, interest rate uncertainty, markets are favorable. But you've got a lot of people looking at the landscape, the geopolitical landscape, and there some certainties on the horizon. And so we think our technology tools led to pretty increased strong organic growth in that business as well. Q - Jim Mitchell : So is there any hard number you can point to in terms of new account openings, or flows picking up to help us? Biff Bowman : We don't disclose that. I mean you could look at the fee growth rates in the business and make your own assessment on the market impacts of that and you can probably get to an underlying core growth rate. Operator : Moving on, we'll go to Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Q - Marty Mosby : I wanted to ask you about the leverage -- the deleverage this particular quarter, looked like there were deposits that were outside of the United States. And where you're using that as a source of being able to take some wholesale funding very low and then redeploy it in the United States at a higher rate. Is that some of the FX translation, is that why you wanted to get out of it? Or just what was the motivation for it? And what's the trigger to get out of the leveraging strategy you had out there? A - Biff Bowman : Well, I'll split this question with Mark. But the strategy for getting out of it is, Marty, the wholesale funding, the return on it, quite frankly, has gone to about zero. So from a return, even an incremental return, the cost of wholesale funding and the investment that we were putting it in was generating a very low to no return in this environment. So we took the decision to pull some of the leveraging off. And I think, Marty, the currency or where it sits on the balance sheet, these are euro-dollar deposits. So the wholesale deposits where we went to a money fund or something like that, it's a wholesale deposit. Mark I don't know -- a euro-dollar deposit\u2026 Mark Bette : So we're not crossing currencies with it. So we're keeping it in U.S. And it is -- you do see it certainly short term borrowings and other line where we do or we'll do of sprint bidding, some of our home loan bank borrowings. And then the wholesale deposits flow through the non-U.S. office line. So it's a combination of those two that we use for leveraging purposes. But it is on the liability side, U.S. dollars and then U.S. dollars on the asset side as well. Marty Mosby : And then we've talked extensively -- I've been an advocate for expanding the duration to protect NII as you end up having these declines. What is your perspective in the sense of doing, not doing that as you've gone through the cycle? And why wouldn't we have been more proactive and defensive to protect against a fairly valuable part of our income stream, which is this net interest income? Biff Bowman : So Marty, over a year ago, we started talking about, here about the duration extension of the portfolio and have been executing on that. I know at 1.3 that still seems perhaps short in duration to be average. But for our portfolio, that's a fairly meaningful increase. And again, we take that duration. We don't do it for any credit additions. It's generally done through duration of treasuries and added. So we have been doing some of that over the periods. And there, obviously, are other hedges and swaps and other things that we can do into the portfolio to help look at that. So we've been -- I would say, we've been contemplating a rate move for at least a year from our outcome ALCO, and have been executing on some of that behind the scenes. So I think it's one of the reasons actually our net interest income and others has held up reasonably well. Obviously, we continue to look at that. And some of those decisions now, with the way the shape of the yield curve is right now, there is some NII give up in protecting against a long-term move down in rates as you might imagine based on where the very short end of the curve is now versus the long end. But we have taken some of those decisions. So, thanks. Operator : Moving on, we will go to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Biff, just one more thing on the NII first. So if I take the 3.5 impact from the BOLI and then the 29 for the year. Effectively are you saying that the decline in 3Q is really just from the BOLI, and that core NII dollars are basically going to be flattish? Is that the right way to think about it? A - Mark Bette : Well, this is Mark. We also had a benefit from the FX swap. But in a way, you're right. I mean, if you added back BOLI, you would be flat but that was because of the fact that we had a benefit from the FX swap, which was basically offset by what we saw play out with the interest rate environment. Ken Usdin : And then my second question just on the cost side. So value for spend is expected to run rate by the end of this year. And it's been a 3 percentage point helper to the cost growth rate. So as we look out into past 2019 -- it's run rate by the next year. But you've gotten a good chunk of it already, so the magnitude of help. Does it stay the same as you go forward? Like are we going to expect 3 percentage points of help on an ongoing basis, or do you have to think about re-upping the plan at some point to maintain this right balance, any thoughts there? Thanks. Biff Bowman : So your thinking is right. The 2% to 3% per annum benefit that you've talked about is what we're seeing. In terms of will we re-up value for spend. Let me frame it this way. The answer to that is, to meet the financial model that we've talked about, which is set an organic fee growth rate, we've talked 4% to 5%. Then we look at our expense base beneath that and we say we've got certain inflationary price expenses coming at us. We've got certain investments that we want to make and we've got certain expenses that we need to fuel that 4% to 5% growth rate. If we want to get leverage in that equation, I guarantee you, you need a productivity offset to make that math work. So if you've got 4% to 5% growth rate, you add in inflationary expenses, you add in investment needs, you add in the expenses needed to grow that 4% to 5%. You probably produce something higher than the 4% to 5% expense growth rate. What we're saying is that needs to be the productivity we need to get on an annual basis in our franchise to drive leverage into that business. And your magnitude is in the area code that we're thinking about, the 2% to 3% range every year. A good way we think about it is it's got to be at least as much to offset inflation. So if our expense improvements have to be at least enough to offset inflation, then you have your cost to drive the new business. And you've got some available for investment. And that's the way we think about, the more we driving productivity the more we share and profitability and investment opportunities for the firm. Operator : And next we'll go to Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Biff, can you -- I know the modelling is challenging and nobody can really predict the future on interest rates with 100% accuracy. But I recognize we're all focused on the short end of the curve. What happens in you guys' outlook if the long end of the curve actually rises due to maybe trade -- I mean with China, stronger economy and we're looking at two and three quarters 10 year in the first, going into the first of next year. How does that affect what you guys have been talking about on net interest income? Biff Bowman : I think, Gerard, the answer to that is, it's probably depends on how the steepness of the curve moves between the short and in the long end. So if the long end moves up and the short end moves up in parallel, it's a different impact than if the short ends stay where it is and the long end moves up when we get steepness in the curve. From a loan book perspective, we don't have nearly as much mortgage based credit that's going to be impacted by the type of move you're talking about in the long end of the curve. So I would say less impactful to us in that space. But the investment opportunities along with the curve and the spread they offer from the short end of the curve does matter to us. So I guess I would have to say it depends on how the rest of the curve shifts with that move in the long end. Q - Jim Mitchell : Okay, because I was assuming your end drops with the long end steep, so you have so called bold steeper in the curve is what I was thinking, but thank you. And then second question, when you guys step back and you look at the challenges that companies always face and opportunities that you guys have. What are some of the -- aside from interest rates since we've talked about that. What are some of the challenges that you guys foresee that you have to overcome maybe in the next 12 or 18 months when you look out at the businesses? A - Biff Bowman : I would say, if we look, there is always a significant demand for technological investment for our business. And we compete, particularly on the asset servicing side, in a highly technologically driven field. And so making sure we make the right investments in that technology to remain competitive. Along with the word competitive, I would say, we are in a competitive marketplace. And while I would say we have seen pretty similar type fee pressures that we've talked about in the past, compression of 1.5% to 2% in the marketplace, we're in a competitive environment with good competitors. And so we want to monitor the competitive nature there. So we got to remain vigilant to the competitive landscape on the horizon. And on the wealth space, I think it's one of opportunity. So what -- you asked what the challenges are. I think for that, it's what are the right pockets to grow in, where do we want new -- where do we have less market share than we would like and where we can get to, to that client base, because where we are established we do very well in those markets. And I think there is opportunity for us in certain markets where we're maybe under-represented. Operator : Moving on, we'll go to Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : Quick question on the expenses, the trust and investment fees came down again this quarter, it's been trending lower over the past couple of years. But given your pull back on expenses, are you still expecting that to trend lower from here, or is it just that it's more challenged environment and we should expect it to flatten out for a while? Biff Bowman : So that question, I would say, we do hope that over long periods to evaluate that that we want to continue to drive more productivity in. So we've not achieved nirvana in terms of that rate. What I think we have to be cautious of is we have seasonality in our business. For instance, next quarter we have the Northern Trust open, which puts pressure on expenses in a quarter. And obviously, markets can do volatile and drive the fee line. And our expenses can't necessarily react in 90 day to a market that can move. But if you look over longer periods of time, the answer is there is continued focus on driving that down. And I would give you an example. If you do these calculations between our two businesses, they're quite different. And the mature wealth management business does drive that expense to fee ratio lower than the low of 500, for instance. And so I would say the answer is over long measurement periods, they're still absolutely focused inside the firm on continuing to improve that. You may see quarterly moves that go up or down just based on seasonality and/or market volatility. Q - Brian Kleinhanzl : And a separate question on the agency MBS portfolio are they going to see a drop off in yields like the other banks are seeing from premium amortization. What was the impact on premium amortization this quarter, or is there something of a lag effect for you? A - Biff Bowman : So I think we've talked to you about premium amortization being somewhere around the $10 million to $12 million in a quarter, and it was inside of that range in this quarter. So the nature of our portfolio and the way we've modeled that and everything, it produced premium amortization that was much in the range we've guided to. Operator : And that does conclude today's conference. We'd like to thank everyone for their participation. You may now disconnect.",

Let me turn the call over to Biff Bowman. Biff Bowman : Good morning everyone. Let me join Mark in welcoming you to our third quarter 2019 earnings conference call.  Starting on page two of our quarterly earnings review presentation, this morning we reported third quarter net income of $384.6 million, earnings per share were $1.69 and our return on common equity was 14.9%.  For the quarter our effective tax rate of 24.4% was higher than prior periods, primarily reflecting higher U.S. taxes payable on the income of the corporation's non-U.S. branches. Our current expectation is that this quarter's tax rate is indicative of our ongoing core rate for future quarters. Although it is possible that clarifying guidance from the IRS could favorably impact the corporation\u2019s effective tax rate if and when issued.  Before going through our results in detail, I would like to comment on some macros factors impacting our business during the quarter. Equity markets performed well during the quarter, but were mixed on a year-over-year basis.  Compared to the prior year, the S&P 500 ended the quarter up 2.2%, while the MSCI EAFE was down 1.5%. On a sequential basis, end of period markets were favorable with the S&P 500 and EAFE indices increasing 1.2% and 1.1% respectively. Recall that some of our fees are based on lag pricing, and those comparisons were favorable on a sequential basis, the mix versus one year ago. On a month lag basis, the S&P 500 and EAFE were up sequentially 3.7% and 0.9% respectively. On a year-over-year basis, the S&P 500 was up 4.9%, while EAFE was down 2.3%. On a quarter lag basis, the S&P and EAFE were up sequentially 3.8% and 1.6% respectively. On a year-over-year basis, the quarter lag S&P 500 was up 8.2%, while EAFE was down eight-tenths of a percent.  U.S. short-term interest rates were lower during the quarter on average as reflected in the sequential declines in average one-month and three-month LIBOR, up 26 and 31 basis points respectively. Currency rates influence the translation of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar and therefore impact client assets and certain revenues and expenses. The British pound and euro versus the U.S. dollar, both ended the quarter down 6% compared to the period year. The year-over-year declines favorably impacted expense, but as an unfavorable impact on revenue. On a sequential basis, the British pound and euro ended the quarter down 3% and 4% respectively.  Let's move to page three and review the financial highlights of the third quarter. Year-over-year revenue increased 4% with non-interest income up 5% from one year ago and net interest income of 2%. Expenses increased 3% from last year. The provision for credit losses was a credit of $7 million in the current quarter compared to a credit of $9 million one year ago. Net income was up 3% year-over-year.  In the sequential comparison, revenue increased 2% with non-interest income up 3% and net interest income flat. Expenses increased 3% compared to the prior quarter. Net income declined 1% sequentially. Return on average common equity was 14.9% for the quarter, down from 15.1% one year ago and 15.9% in the prior quarter. Assets under custody and administration of $11.6 trillion increased 7% compared to one year ago, and were up 2% on a sequential basis. Assets under custody of $8.8 trillion were up 7% compared to one year ago, and up 3% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential performance was driven by new business and favorable markets, partially offset by the impact of unfavorable moves in currency exchange rates.  Assets under management were $1.2 trillion, up 3% on a year-over-year basis and up 2% on a sequential basis. The year-over-year performance reflected higher markets and new business, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation.  Let's look at the results in greater detail starting with revenue on page four. Third quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $1.5 billion, up 4% compared to last year and up 2% sequentially. Trust, investment and other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue and were $976 million in the third quarter, up 4% from last year and up 2% sequentially. Foreign exchange trading income was $60 million in the third quarter, down 17% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was primarily related to lower foreign exchange swap activity in our Treasury function.  Other non-interest income was $85 million in the third quarter, up 54% compared to one year ago and up 16% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was driven by income relating to a bank-owned life insurance program implemented in the prior year, higher brokerage related revenue and an $8.1 million investment impairment recorded in the prior year.  The sequential performance was driven by the full quarter\u2019s impact bank-owned life insurance program, as well as strong brokerage related revenue. Net interest income which I will discuss in more detail later was $425 million in the third quarter, increasing 2% year-over-year and it was flat sequentially. Let's look at the components of our trust and investment fees on page five. For our corporate and institutional services business, fees totaled $560 million in the third quarter and were up 3% year-over-year, and up 2% on a sequential basis.  The translation impact of changes in currency rates reduced year-over-year C&IS fees growth by just over 1.5%. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees were $392 million and up 5% year-over-year and up 2% on a sequential basis. The year-over-year performance was primarily driven by new business, partially offset by the impact of unfavorable currency translation. On a sequential basis the impacts of new business and favorable markets were partially offset by unfavorable currency translation.  Assets under custody and administration for C&IS clients were $10.9 trillion at quarter end, up 7% year-over-year and up 2% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential performance was primarily driven by new business and favorable markets, partially offset by the impact of unfavorable moves in currency and exchange rates. Recall that lagged market values factor into the quarter's fees with both quarter lag and month lag markets impacting our C&IS custody and fund administration fees. Investment management fees in C&IS of $115 million in the second quarter were up 6% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential performances were driven by new business and favorable markets .  Assets under management for C&IS clients were $901 billion, up 3% year-over-year and up 2% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was driven by favorable markets and new business, and an increase in securities lending collateral levels, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation. The sequential increase was primarily driven by sequential growth in securities lending collateral levels and favorable markets, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation. Securities lending fees were $20 million in the third quarter, down 17% year-over-year and down 8% sequentially. The year-over-year and sequential declines were primarily driven by lower spreads. Securities lending collateral was $170 billion at quarter end and averaged $176 billion across the quarter. Average collateral levels increased 4% year-over-year and were up 7% sequentially. Moving to our wealth management business, trust, investment and other servicing fees were $460 million in the third quarter, and were up 4% compared to the prior year quarter and up 2% sequentially. Assets under management were $300 billion at quarter end, up 2% both on a year-over-year and sequential basis. The year-over-year and sequential performances for both fees and AUM were drive by a combination of new business and favorable markets.  Moving to page six, net interest income was $425 million in the third quarter, up 2% year-over-year. Earning assets averaged $105 billion in the quarter, down 7% from the prior year. Total deposits averaged $89 billion and were down 5% versus the prior year. Interest bearing deposits declined 2% from one year ago to $72 billion. Non-interest bearing deposits which averaged $17 billion during the quarter were down 14% from one year ago. Loan balances averaged $31 billion in the quarter and were down 3% compared to one year ago. The net interest margin was 1.61% in the third quarter, and was up 14 basis points from a year ago.  The improvement in the net interest margin compared to the prior year primarily reflects a balance sheet mix shift, the impact of lower foreign exchange swap volume and the impact of higher short-term interest rates versus one year ago. On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income was flat. Average earning assets declined 1% on a sequential basis and deposit levels were down slightly from the prior quarter. On a sequential basis, the net interest margin remained flat.  Looking at the currency mix of our balance sheet, for the third quarter U.S. dollar deposits represented 69% of our total deposits. This is flat versus one year ago and up from 67% in the prior quarter. Turning to page seven, expenses were $1 billion in the third quarter and were 3% higher than both the prior year and sequentially. The impact of favorable moves and currency translation benefited expense by almost 1 percentage point on a year-over-year basis.  Compensation expense totaled $458 million and was up 5% compared to one year ago. The year-over-year growth was primarily relating to higher salaries driven by staff growth and base pay adjustments, partially offset by the impact of favorable currency translation. On a sequential basis compensation was up 1%. Staff levels increased 5% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. The majority of staff growth continues to be attributable to staff increases and lower cost attrition, which include India, Manila, Limerick, Ireland and Tempe, Arizona.  Employee benefit expense of $88 million was up 2% from one year ago and was down 2% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was driven primarily by higher payroll withholding in medical costs, while the sequential decline was primarily due to lower withholding costs, partially offset by higher medical costs.  Outside services costs of $194 million were up 4%, both on a year-over-year and sequential basis. The year-over-year growth was driven by higher technical services consulting and legal expense, partially offset by lower sub-custody expense. The sequential increase was primarily due to higher technical services, which had included a $6 million vendor credit in the prior quarter, as well as higher third party adviser, consulting legal expense, partially offset by lower sub-custody expense.  Equipment and software expense of $152 million was up 4% from one year ago and was up 3% sequentially, both the year-over-year and sequential growth was driven by higher maintenance and support costs and higher depreciation and amortization costs. The year-over-year growth was partially offset by higher software disposition costs in the prior year.  Other operating expense of $92 million was down 5% from one year ago and up 20% sequentially. The decline from a year ago was primarily relating to lower FDIC premiums. The sequential increase was driven by higher business promotional spend, primarily associated with the Northern Trust Golf Tournament which was held during the quarter. As we have discussed on previous calls, through our value for spend initiative which we started 2017, we have been realigning our expense base with the goal of realizing $250 million in expense run rate savings by 2020. We continue to embed a sustainable expense management approach.  Our third quarter results reflect approximately $56 million in expense savings, reducing the year-over-year expense growth rate by approximately 2.5 points. This will equate to approximately $225 million on an annualized basis against the $250 million.  Turning the page eight, our key focus has been on sustainably enhancing profitability and returns. This slide reflects the progress we have made in recent years to improve the expense to fee ratio, pre-tax margin and ultimately our return on equity. The ratio of expense to fees is a particularly important measure of our progress as it addresses what we can most directly control. We remain focused on continuing to drive organic growth in our business and managing our expenses to improve our efficiency and productivity. Turning to page nine, our capital ratios remain strong with our common equity Tier 1 ratio of 12.9% under the standardized approach and 13.7% under the advanced approach. The supplementary leverage ratio at the corporation was 7.6% and at the bank was 7.0%, both of which exceeded the 3% minimum requirement.  As Northern Trust progresses through fully phased-in Basal III implementation, there could be additional enhancements to our models and further guidance from the regulators on the implementation of final rule, which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final Basel III rules. During the third quarter we repurchased 3.4 million shares of common stock at a cost of $307 million. We also increased our quarterly dividend to $0.70 per share. These two actions combined represented a payout ratio of approximately 125% for the quarter.  In closing, Northern Trust performed well in the third quarter. Our 4% year-over-year growth rate for both Trust investment and other servicing fees and total revenue compared to our 3% growth and expense generated positive fee and total operating leverage. Our results produced a pre-tax margin of 33.4% and a return on average common equity of 14.9%.  Our balanced business model continues to generate organic growth and we remain focused on providing our clients with exceptional services, improving our productivity and driving profitable growth. On a personal note, I just want to offer a quick thank you. As recently announced, I will be stepping down from my role as CFO effective January 1, and retire from the Northern Trust on February 28. I've enjoyed my five-plus years as CFO and working with each one of you.  Jason Tyler who is currently the CFO of our Wealth Management Business will become CFO as of the first of the year. I wish Jason the very best as he takes on this new role and I am confident he will be very successful in that role. Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust third quarter earnings conference call today. Mark and I would be happy to answer your questions. Hanna, please open the line. Operator : Yes sir, thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll now take a question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr : Hey, thanks very much. A question on net interest margin. This comes up in conversation and I don't know if this is even a good way to look at it, so I want to throw it to you. If you look at you versus your peers, you NIM is highest relative to prior cycle lows when rates were near zero versus peers. Now I don't think we're even going towards zero rates, to zero rates, but whatever. Do you think that is an okay way to even evaluate things and (b) if so, what do you think explains that? It's just that your durations are a little longer than it used to. I\u2019m just curious on what you think has changed in the mix to \u2013 that you would have been able to sustain that better? Biff Bowman : That our NIM is higher than other peers, that's your question? Glenn Schorr : Versus prior cycle lows. In other words, where everybody bottomed out when rates were zero, you\u2019re in the range of like 37, 40 basis points above that. Others are like a lot closer to it now. Biff Bowman : I believe that's probably the mix of our clients and the mix of our balance sheet is probably the difference there. (A) Our retail deposits and our wealth business make up a greater proportion of our balance sheet. You've got to look at a mix between our on \u2013 foreign office deposits and U.S. deposits and then the loan portfolio relative to the size and I know it's been flat for us, but all of those combined, I think produce a slightly different net interest margin versus peers, because we are not absolutely the same and look and feel as all of those. So I would say that it\u2019s probably a difference in the mix of the balance sheet that lends itself to that. Because on the institutional side, the pricing is competitive, so we would likely have deposit costs of a similar nature, but we have a little bit bigger piece of what I would call the wealth side of the business and I think that may help mute the lows. Glenn Schorr : And maybe just a follow-up. As you look forward, there's a lot of puts and takes on deposit betas as not being as close to 100% as everybody hoped they would be on the way down. But you know knowing what we know today with forwards and what's expected in terms of rates, just how do you help us think about next year and beyond given all those puts and takes around the NIM. Biff Bowman : Yeah, I think you have to probably pull our balance sheet apart a little bit to understand the beta. So if you look at for instance on the retail side of our deposit beta, the beta would look low-ish. But we had some, the discontinuation of our anchor suite and we had promotional pricing so the beta would be quite low on that.  If you look at the foreign office deposits and remember, about half of the foreign office deposits are in dollars, but if you look at the move down and then extrapolate well, how much of that was dollars, the beta was actually quite high.  I would say the beta was relatively symmetrical with what we saw on the way, where we were as we have rates rising. So it's coming down I think in general along that rate. It\u2019s a little cloudier to see this quarter because of some of the promotional things we had in the wealth space and others that work themselves through at the end of the third quarter and we would anticipate a more symmetrical beta for that in the fourth quarter, but I think if you look at that, the beta was actually fairly high on what I would call institutional dollar based deposit. Glenn Schorr : Awesome! Thanks so much Biff. Biff Bowman : Thanks. Operator : We\u2019ll now take a question from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Biff Bowman : Hi Brian. Brian Bedell : Hey Biff, and congrats and best of luck. The question is on the net interest income. Obviously the NIM was better than we thought. Can you talk about the drivers on the short term side of the balance sheet? So the asset yields on the short side seem to be down less than we would have thought maybe and talk about the resiliency of that and sort of how should we think about that you know going into the fourth quarter? Biff Bowman : I hope that was your phone breaking up there, I couldn't tell if that was you or us. Can you hear us okay, your phone broke up. Brian Bedell : Yeah. [Cross Talk] Can you hear me better now? Biff Bowman : I can, yes, sorry about that. Brian Bedell : Did you hear my question? Biff Bowman : You wanted to know about, I think it was around the short term. Can you repeat it for everybody? Brian Bedell : Yeah sure, the yields on a short term side of the balance sheet, on the asset side seem to go down less than we had thought, so I just wondered if you could talk about some resiliency in that relative to short term rates basically. And then is there a catch up coming in the fourth quarter, you know assuming we have obviously an October Fed cut? Biff Bowman : Yeah, so if you think about that on the rates and the resiliency, one you still have to remember that our rates are lapping a period where in general a year ago they are higher today than they were a year ago, so that's part of it. And then if you look at the sequential resiliency or how that would hold up, I think there's probably a series of factors in there in the asset yield. One is, we've extended some of the duration in our portfolio, which I think has helped mitigate some of that across those yields. Currency mix and other things can help mitigate some of the currency yield impact that you see across the portfolio and then just a variety of investment strategies that we have and the instruments we have and held up pretty well cross the short term end of the portfolio.  We got more in securities than we do sort of shorter duration, money market type bank rates at this point, so all of those have held up. And then lastly I\u2019d add is, from our own projections, from where we thought we would have in the quarter, the spread between LIBOR and Fed funds was actually a little bit better, even though it compressed our own projections, it didn't compress as much as perhaps we had forecasted. In terms of the fourth quarter, I think you had asked, you know are we just storing this up for the fourth quarter. I think perhaps it might be beneficial if we give you a quick thought on the fourth quarter as we move in. Right now we would suggest that \u2013 and there is obviously a lot of puts and takes in the fourth quarter yet to come, but if we assume one cut from the Federal Reserve this month, we would think that our net interest income would be down approximately 1% to 3% sequentially.  So while there is still pressure on the asset yields and sensitivity to that, we still think it\u2019s relatively modest in terms of its impact sequentially. There is obviously a lot of underlying assumptions in the forecast and we're going to give you an update on that in December as we see the size of the balance sheet and other factors being much more clear two months into the quarter and in fact whether we get a hike or not, we\u2019ll obviously be in there, but that 1% to 3% is off of the $425 million we had this quarter and it assumes one cut in October. Mark Bette : And Brian, this is Mark. Just to add one comment. When you are really looking at the real short end on the balance sheet for the short term, let\u2019s call it interest bearing deposits, so that would be the interest bearing deposits with banks, the Central Bank Deposits, the mix of U.S. currency within that, let\u2019s call it money market kind of category is actually more like a third of the total. So the lower U.S. rates will not have as much of a drag when you're looking at the very short end of the balance sheet for those line items. Brian Bedell : Right, right, so the geographic diversification definitely helps you. Great and then just on expenses, your most of the way through the program, another $25 million. I know you\u2019ve said in the past this is going to be an ongoing effort. So just on the third quarter, I think expenses were up 3% sequentially versus the 2% revenue, but was that all due to the Northern Trust open and related expense and then going forward are we still in that position where you are trying to achieve expense growth, you know at a pace that is higher than your organic revenue growth, and maybe if you want to just comment on organic revenue growth in the quarter. Biff Bowman : Yeah, so the last part of your question is our thinking. We still are having our organic growth rate provide if you will as the governor over the organic expense growth rate that the firm should, and tends to stay in to produce that. The Northern Trust on a sequential basis drives about half of the growth rate of expenses, maybe a little less than that, but in the vicinity of about half of that, so you can take about half of the growth rate out, because of sort of the one-time seasonal event.  But probably more important to your question was around the organic expense growth rates that we're seeing. Again, in line I think with generally in line with our organic expense growth rate we've done a good job of getting the organic growth rate in the firm and the organic expense growth rate in the firm better aligned and that continues to be an internal target and goal that we strive to get those very much in line.  If we see organic growth slow, then we try to do as quick as we can to increase the pace of saves in our expense base to achieve that organic leverage or at least organic neutrality and we are trying to get organic leverage. Lastly I think you asked about our organic trends in the quarter. Again, on the fee side we saw good new business, good growth and generally in the ranges we\u2019ve talked about or at the near the ranges we talked about and so you know I think you kind of see that from our numbers and the growth rate is outstripping markets and it's pretty strong versus the competitors and a lot of that is organically driven. Brian Bedell : And that's about mid-single digit pace in terms of organic growth is that correct? Biff Bowman : I think we\u2019ve talked about four to five range. Brian Bedell : Yeah exactly. Biff Bowman : Over time, I think we've explained to you in the past we have years that it's three, we have years that\u2019s its five and we\u2019ve tried to circle that range. It's in that, what you want to call that, low to mid-single digit ranges, that\u2019s where we are tracking. I think you could back market out and currency out and probably get there in your own analytics. Brian Bedell : Yes, perfect! Thank you very much. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Biff Bowman : Hi Ken. Ken Usdin : Hey, thanks a lot and best of luck Biff. Can I ask a couple of just clean up ones? Can you help us understand the amount that the BOLI increase in both NII and fees, what the visa expense was, and if there was any change in premium memorization sequentially? Thanks. Biff Bowman : Yeah, I got to write those down to make sure we get all those. The BOLI impact in the third quarter probably reduced net interest income by about $7 million, but it produced $9 million or so in other income, and then it has a tax benefit too. It helps the tax rate by approximately two-tenths of a percent. A - Mark Bette : And that was about half reflected in the prior quarter Ken, so if you are looking at it sequentially, we picked up another about $4.5 million on other operating income and we had a drag of call it $3.5 million on the NII side sequentially. A - Biff Bowman : So you wanted BOLI, Ken? Ken Usdin : Yeah, the visa and if there was any change in premium Am. Biff Bowman : Yes, on visa, on a year-over-year basis the mark for visa was pretty comparable. It was actually I think slightly lower this year. On a sequential basis the mark on visa was up just a little under $7 million sequentially and that was driven by \u2013 you know the factors that we evaluate are the visa stock price, the time to maturity of the litigation and then our ownership interest in that or the conversion factors. Those can move from time to time and so it was a\u2026 Mark Bette : It was a $7 million this quarter, but $3 million last quarter. $7 million was the number, but yeah, so for us its $4 million. Sequential was a $4 million increase. It was $7 million in total in the quarter and a $4 million increase sequentially and year-over-year roughly flat. Ken Usdin : Understood! Thank you, and then just last\u2026 [Cross Talk] yeah, good ahead, just go ahead. Biff Bowman : Yeah, so with the premium amortization for us, we've given you guys a range of 10 to 12. Our portfolio, it has a series of exposures to Jenny Mae, Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae exposures that by and large have a larger concentration of security to have structural attributes for the loan balances that help minimize prepay variability. So we don't see maybe as much as you might see across other portfolios where you've seen maybe greater movement. It's just the nature of the instruments we hold in our securities portfolio.  So that range is still \u2013 we can see it maybe widen a little bit. We might see it move closer to between 8 and 12 then back, but generally we trade continually in that range and it hasn't been I think a market impact in terms of this impact on our NII. So hopefully that explains it.  I know intuitively you may have thought that you would see some pick up in that, but the nature of the portfolio we have and some of the features of that portfolio still tended to be keeping the amortization in a band that is generally in line with what we've guided you guys to. Ken Usdin : Got it, alright. Thanks for all that Biff. Biff Bowman : Yeah. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Biff Bowman : Hi Alex. Alex Blostein : Hey Biff, hey Mark! Congrats on the retirement as well. A real quick on NIR, thanks for the update there. I guess if I look at the size of the balance sheet and your guidance, what do you guys sort of contemplate there for Q4? So in others words, like the balance sheet kind of stays flattish. Is that the idea?  And then if the bulk of the decline is really driven by the NIM contraction sequentially, if we sort of look at LIBOR effect on spread in the quarter so far and you kind of look at the forecast, it actually looks to widen. It was flattish for the last couple of quarters. Now it looks like sort of a positive spread of about 20 basis points. Is it crazy to think that the NIM could actually be a little bit better than what you guys are contemplating because of this wider dynamic between LIBOR and capped [ph] on spread? Thanks. Biff Bowman : Yeah, so Alex what I would say is we've made an assumption about that spread that you just talked about. The indicators would be that it could widen out wider than our forecast. So if that holds true, your comment about our assessment of the balance sheet is generally right about the size of it and if that spread turns out to be closer to what you described, which is what the markets are indicating, we'll compare that to what we forecast and to your point, that would probably lead to a little higher NIM.  So could there be upside variability? There could, but there are an awful lot of variables, that's why we\u2018ll give you guidance at the Goldman Sachs conference in December where we\u2019ll have a lot greater line of sight into the quarter. Alex Blostein : Totally, that all makes sense. And then my follow-up around expenses a little bit again and sort of you know bigger picture, maybe beyond this year, but as you guys are kind of coming close to the end of the 250 program, are there additional areas of savings that you can help us sort of ring fence as we think about sort of the levers you can pull on to make sure that beyond 2019 the expense growth remains kind of in this, I guess low to mid-single digit range as you try to align that with organic fee growth. Biff Bowman : Yeah, there certainly are and there\u2019s programs underway and I think it's important as we\u2019ve talked. We really are embedding a discipline here of when we look at our expenses of looking at it and I\u2019ll call it four categories :  One is, we need a certain amount of expense growth to support the type of organic revenue growth we\u2019ve talked about, so some of that is just needed. So we got that factored in. We've got inflations in our business that comes about. You can put your own inflation factor on that. We add that to that amount needed to grow our business and then we've got investment, and when you add all of that up, I will tell you that generally adds up to greater than the organic growth rate that we see for fees.  So we are driving \u2013 there has to be productivity baked into any expense planning that will drive us back to that organic leverage on that and so there has to be productivity of some level, probably at least equal to inflation, to make our business model work. So whether we call it value for spend or 714 where there\u2019s that level of expense driver in our business.  To tie that into your question, are there still buckets or opportunities in the expense base and the answer is absolutely, and I would say there's still lots of areas of procurement that are \u2013 and we cited lower sub-custody expenses in the quarter, we've done some good work around our sub custody expense for instance in the quarter that's meaningfully changed some of the trajectory there from a procurement perspective. We still have many projects and capital investments that help drive automation and robotics into our business and we're doing one in our finance group as we speak right now, modest in size, but it's the type of thing that we think are still available to help drive those expenses down. So I think there's the opportunity to drive that productivity that's necessary in the model I outlined for you. Alex Blostein : Got it, great! Thanks again. Operator : We\u2019ll now take a question from Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Michael Carrier : Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. For the last year or so, deposit in interest earning asset growth has been you know a bit weaker versus organic growth trends. I realize partly you know the rate backdrop, but any other factors you know that are driving that and then what do you think could potentially you know shift you know maybe the demand by client? A - Biff Bowman : Well, I think the deposit growth has flattened out, your absolutely right or maybe even gone in a slight decline, but I think again you probably have to pull apart our businesses here a little bit. On the wealth side, some of the initiatives or the initiative we did around the discontinuation of our anchor sweep product has actually brought \u2013 if you look, go back to the first quarter, somewhere a little over $3 billion, $3.5 billion of deposits. It\u2019s actually probably slightly higher than that, but the part that's most visible that is seen on the balance sheet is probably a little over $3 billion, so we have grown that side.  On the institutional side, I think we can see the type of variability you'll see there, particularly in foreign office deposits as a normal course of business. We've seen these cycles before as people maybe shift currency, they shift investment strategies, particularly in the reasonably volatile market. So we have seen some of that playing itself out in particularly the foreign office deposits, in the institution deposits where we\u2019ve seen that.  We don't have feedback that it's a pricing related issue where our pricing is even not at market. We get that feedback pretty fast and pretty clearly from our clients, so it's not a pricing related item and it generally over time will grow with our organic growth rate. So I would say there's not any other, because what I will say is what you've seen is \u2013 I think you've seen the rundown of some of the \u2013 what were excess deposits or those things that were sitting here for rate related reasons. The second part of your question is what could change that trajectory? I would suggest it's early, but some of the actions the fed\u2019s taking now and if rates continue to be aggressively lower, as a general rule, the lower they get, the more likely we are to see balance sheet growth. That's what's happened historically. I don't know if that will play out the same way this time through, that would be speculation, but historically as quantitative easing or further easing moves, trust banks tend to be the recipients of balances. So that could drive growth at an outsized rate versus say organic growth. Biff Bowman : And then Mike and Mark, if I could add one other thing. When you're looking at the deposit trends, one thing that isn't clear looking at it externally, if you were to look at the non U.S. office, deposits say on average as of the fourth quarter of last year compared to where we are now, three quarters later, a little bit more than half of that decline has actually been from some of the leveraging activity we do in our treasury group, so that\u2019s doing some short term borrowings.  That will show up on the short term borrowing line, but it also shows up in the mix of when we go out and get wholesale deposits and the trade there has not been you know the spread that you can get on that his narrowed quite a bit, so we've actually kind of pulled back on some of that activity. So like I said, over the last three quarters when you look at average non U.S. office deposits, a little more than half of that decline has been lower leveraging activity. Q - Michael Carrier : Okay, it makes sense. And then just a small follow-up; the security commission revenues that came in stronger, I realize there's more volatility in the quarter, but I think you've also been investing in some of the areas of that offering. So just any color on what drove you know the increase this quarter? A - Mark Bette : Yeah, that's a good question. So it is \u2013 we\u2019ve talked here about for instance in our Oak Ridge business, the integrated trade solution where effectively we can take on the trading functionality of some of our clients who we may also have relationships with as a fund administrator or others and we've seen that grow meaningfully. The number of clients has grown meaningfully and it was a prime driver of that growth, so that line as you know is really made up of what I would say brokerage activity; it's made up of fees that we get around certain credit relationships that we have and it's made up of\u2026 Biff Bowman : So yeah, interest rate swaps. Mark Bette : Interest rate swaps, excuse me. Biff Bowman : Which also saw all three of those. Mark Bette : Thank you, I had to think of the third one there for a second. Interest rate swaps, all three of those saw growth in the quarter, but the two of those are more episodic in nature. Interest rate swaps are probably triggered by rate movements and I would say generally the brokerage business that we saw, some of that is client growth, not just activity in the market. Biff Bowman : Yeah, when we look at it sequentially and we noted in the release that for brokerage activity, interest rate swaps and referral fees, it's probably one-third, one-third, one-third and certainly the last two of those are more episodic. Sometimes we have transition revenue that comes through that\u2019s a little bit more episodic too, although that was fairly comparable this quarter versus prior. Michael Carrier : Okay, thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Biff Bowman : Hi Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Biff, I'm going to miss you. I really enjoyed our conversations over the years. Biff Bowman : I\u2019ll sit in the conference. Betsy Graseck : That will be great. Okay, well thanks so much for all the time and insights over the years. So a couple of other questions, a little bit of clean up and a little bit of strategy questions. So on the cleanup questions, you know the long term debt cost of funds coming down nicely, I'm assuming that's all swapped. Is that where we\u2019re seeing you know almost a lockstep with the rate cuts here and so as a result we should expect that to continue to move down. Is that an accurate statement? Biff Bowman : It is swapped, yes. Betsy Graseck : Okay, and then on the fed growing the balance sheet, I mean it's obviously been doing some temporary open market operations just recently going to the promos. You know I heard you said about the QE. Have you seen any benefit from this? I mean it's been about a month or so. A - Biff Bowman : I would say not; we have not seen any extraordinary size flows from that at this point. So I\u2019d say that\u2019s still pretty early would be my intuition. It's pretty early to see and hopefully in a couple of months we will have a better line of sight to that, but right now I would say no, we\u2019ve not seen any impact. Betsy Graseck : Okay, and then just lastly, a little bit more strategic question, but you know we talked a little bit about how you're investing in a variety of different technologies to improve your own processes, as well as in some areas of \u2013 because they were growing more rapidly. I wanted to understand the rationale for transferring the private equity block chain technology platform to broad-ridge. You know how is that enhancing your strategic, you know focus and drive. Biff Bowman : Yeah, at that point in time I think we felt that the distribution opportunities and the growth opportunities with Broadridge were just, better moved through their pipe if I can say that, than they were through ours. But we know we have a client base that helped us deliver that product and capability it\u2019s one that we think we can and have commercialized inside our own group, but the ability to grow that I think more assertively through Broadridge was really beneficial for everything. Mark do you have anything else? I think that's the best color, it was the best commercial decision for us and that's what we decided on. Betsy Graseck : But your focus on using block chain technology or you either utilizing it or enabling if for your clients is still intact, is that accurate even though you transferred this? Biff Bowman : Yeah, for sure. Betsy Graseck : Because you\u2019re a user of their platform, right. Biff Bowman : Yeah sure, and I want to be clear that was just one application as it related sort of to all fit the private equity field for using it and much broader applications in just that field. But that was one where we thought there would be perhaps a commercialization that would be better enhanced through that vehicle, in ownership structure than directly owned by us, but we are using it in a variety of other type of clearing and product capabilities for clients. Betsy Graseck : Thank you. Biff Bowman : Thanks. Operator : We\u2019ll now take a question from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Biff Bowman : Hi Brennan. Brennan Hawken : Good morning, and Biff congrats on your retirement, wish you the best. I\u2019m sure the golf game will improve and you'll get tickets to the Northern Open in the future. Biff Bowman : Yeah, it's got a lot of room to improve Brennan. Brennan Hawken : Tell me about it. So on NII, just circling back there, thanks for all the color on that, I really appreciate it. Curious about a couple of different components. Number one, when we look at the forward curve, it looks like the forward curve suggests also a cut in December and so I know that will be late in the quarter, so probably wouldn\u2019t have a big impact on 4Q.  But should we count on an impact, a comparable impact going forward or are your assumptions around beta such that further cuts beyond the next one will have an increasing impact, because you would be getting a little bit lower on the deposit cost side and therefore less room on that front. Just any additional color you could give there would be great. Biff Bowman : Okay, so I'll try to peel that apart a little bit. So December cut would have nominal fourth quarter impact, you're right on that, but it wouldn't have zero impact. I want to be clear and that's why we gave a range earlier, because it depends on the pricing start to anticipate that earlier than the actual cut itself and you know how that works.  In terms of the impacts in the 2020, we're not going to give guidance out to 2020 at this point, there are just so many variables to that. But that being said, I think we talked about the beta as we think being relatively symmetrical, and I think we think that's how it is, and they are as is you will pull apart. If you look again at the institutional dollar betas, they were pretty high and that's where they were on the way up, they were pretty high now. I think they would have some symmetry on the way down, so they would probably start to pull back a little bit. I don't know if that's with one or two or three hikes. I know it would be speculation. I don't know where that point of symmetry sort of hits, but I think we would just sort of model something that looks relatively symmetrical from what we saw all the way up. Brennan Hawken : Okay so and just to clarify, like on the way up we saw the ramp in betas steadily increase and so therefore you guys are starting high and then would you see in the mirror of that, so betas would decrease. Biff Bowman : Yeah, so I think Brennan if we go back, if you remember the betas were quite low for several hikes, and then the curve starts to steepen, right, through all the symmetry around that. So perhaps the betas are quite high for some period and then start to come down.  I just don't know is that one hike away, is that two hikes away or excuse me, one cut, two cut or three cuts away, I don't \u2013 that would be speculating, I don\u2019t want to do that, but I think it\u2019s a symmetrical look to way they float on the way up, and then the flow down. Brennan Hawken : Okay, got it. That\u2019s clear and totally logical. My next question is on the excess reserves commentary. Just curious, it seemed like Northern didn't really get hurt, especially versus some of the larger Trust Bank competitors when reserves were getting drained from the system. So I'm kind of curious as to why you would think the inverse would happen, you know why would your benefit with an expansion of reservists, especially relative to some of the larger competitors? Thanks. Biff Bowman : I think as a general rule, as the rates gets closer \u2013 I think this is your question as the rates you know pull back down closer and closer to zero, because we are an asset servicing provider to $11 trillion of assets under custody and administration, we because somewhat of a natural home for what I will say our cash balances that may be in different but want a very financially strong liquid provider.  So there's just some natural benefit of that. The tide floating all boats kid of things, like that and coming with it, and so you\u2019ve got large hedge fund clients or others who say I'm in different now through a series of investment options.  I will say this time Brennan what I think is different is money market reform has happened and government funds and things like gates and another things that were in place, some of those things have been addressed in money market reforms. So the ability to have those bounces not sit on any bank balance sheet that go through a fund, so they can get paid roughly zero and a financial institution or get paid roughly zero on a fund. They may consider that more than they have in past, cycles were rates have gone well.  So we\u2019ll have to see how that plays out and depends on how low areas get. I think the rates have to get lower than one or two more cuts before we would see that kind of impact. It would have to be something that gets back close to where we were, right after the crisis. Brennan Hawken : Thanks for the color Biff and good luck on the golf course. Biff Bowman : Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll now take a question from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Biff Bowman : Hi Brian. Brian Kleinhanzl : Hi, good afternoon or good morning still. A quick question on the comp expense. So you said it was up and staffing was up 1% quarter-on-quarter. If you look back the past couple of years, you will see an uptick 4Q to 3Q as well in comp expense. Is there any reason to think that would be the same case this year? Biff Bowman : So, I\u2019d have to look to see. I mean there may have been \u2013 there is some incentive compensation that\u2019s verbal. A some point in the fourth quarter that might be driven by how pretax income goes.  As far as the comp sequentially this quarter, one thing that\u2019s definitely is different than prior years is that we and the prior years have had \u2013 we\u2019ve had I think last year I about $10 million of equity retirement eligible expense that was in the second quarter that fell off in the third quarter. We did not have that this year, all that was in the first quarter. So second to third this year is a different picture than what it would have been in 2017 and 2018.  The other thing I would say about compensation as well, you know last quarter we did mention that we had charges of $5 million of charges, only $2 million of that was in compensation, about $3 million of it was in outside services. We did have charges this quarter as well. Now we've gotten away from calling those out, because we think we're more in a business as usual environment with those charges, but I would say when you look at compensation, the charges this quarter, we are actually pretty comparable to what we had in the prior quarter and so that's another part.  So if you were expecting a decline because of charge is going off, we did have some charges in the quarter. But like I said, until they \u2013 if they were to rise up again to a higher level certainly we\u2019ll call them out, but at this point we feel like it's more just business as usual activity. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay and then just a separate question. In C&IS is there any way to kind of give any color on what new business wins were the quarter, uninstalled pipeline, I know you kind of gravitated away from doing that in the past, but any type of color would be greatly appreciated? Thanks. Biff Bowman : Yeah, you're right. We gravitated away from that and we don't provide that. I would say, we continue to see strong new business wins installed in the quarter. We continue to see a very solid and strong pipeline really across the globe, but particularly we\u2019ve seen real strong interest in the Asian market, in Australia in particular and a substantial win. I think we\u2019ve published \u2013 we did press release World Bank as a win, so that was a very high profile win that was issued in a press release in the quarter.  So, we continue to have strong growth, and as we said, we really look at it more as an organic growth story for us across the fee line and we were pleased with where we were from a trajectory standpoint in the quarter. Brian Kleinhanzl : Alright. Thanks and best of luck Biff! Operator : Your next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Biff Bowman : Hi Jim Jim Mitchell : Good morning. Hey, maybe just one last kind of follow-up on NII and just thinking through, it seems to me that there's been pretty high betas in Europe. So just get kind of your view on if there are further cuts there, is that \u2013 you are actually liability sensitive in Europe or is it neutral?  And then when I think about looking further out, do you haven\u2019t even talked about extending duration and offsets and things like that. Do you have any further kind of ability in the asset yield side to kind of offset some lower rates, given how sort of your balance sheet has been? Biff Bowman : Yeah, so in Europe you're right. On the euro in particular the beta was high and that can be both a factor as we moved obviously relatively high betas or very high beta with the euro move, and some of that could have been that our rate was actually attractive in that market and that we were catching up from the rate being slightly ahead of the market if you will or slightly better than the competitive landscape which could move that beta a little bit higher than perhaps even the move that you there.  So that\u2019s a driver there, and then I think it's important to understand our client base. We have clients that are some are on standard rates and some that are on, I\u2019d call it more specialized rates, custom rates.  Some of them moved immediately with sort of Central Bank rates, IOER, ECB. So they will move rally with almost a 100% beta right with those. In terms of the duration of the balance sheet, we moved the duration of the portfolio out to about 1.6 years from an index duration perspective, which as you know we typically have run a very short duration portfolio closer to one, 1.1, but we have done some things in light of what we think could be you know a continued decline in rates. And so we have moved that duration out in the portfolio to help soften some of that and help deal with asset yield issues that you talked about. Jim Mitchell : And is there room for that to do anything else to \u2013 whether you see duration out more or flip some of your cash into U.S. rates. That is from Europe how do you think about what you can do in your mix to help offset that pressure? Biff Bowman : So the answer to the first part of that is yes. That is a decision that our ALCO committee makes every month, but there is I think still room to take that duration out and for the benefit of the call, we're really not taking any credit risk in that duration. We typically extend the duration of our balance sheet through the use of longer dated treasuries, so that's the way we get there and we do. But we evaluate that through our co-committee regularly, but there is still capacity to take that duration out.  In terms of swapping currencies you know into dollars or whatever to get the yield enhancement, you know the swap rates on that have made and the cost of doing that quite frankly have make that in many cases an unattractive trade, and we always have \u2013 excuse me, we have generally tried to invest largely in the currency, in currency in support of our clients and the balance sheet. So they've invested in euros, they'd laid the balance off in euros, the balances being euros or sterling, etcetera. But there are occasionally opportunities that can do that swap, but right now the swap rates could make a neutral [inaudible] action group. Yeah. Jim Mitchell : Great, thanks! Operator : We\u2019ll now move to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Hi. So I think I heard that value per spend is 90% done and that you're spending initiatives for revenues, inflation technology should outpace organic growth, therefore you need to find productivity savings, so got that. So under the category of productivity savings, what do you have in a way of potential technology dates? For example, how many data centers do you have? Where were they at peak? Where could that go or maybe want to measure that in terms of you know number of servers.  You know moving to the cloud, what percent are you in, you're have to enable together a cloud, where are you know, where you would like to go? But just more generally what are the technology driven productivity savings that you could see going ahead, especially now that value for spend in the late stages. Biff Bowman : There's a lot to that question Mike. So you're right, so we have absolutely have an ongoing process to look at all the things you described in there. For instance number of data centers. We outsource the manage services for instance that we talked about here, where we have looked at things like our main frame maintenance and another that we\u2019ve used. There\u2019s opportunities to do that technologically with someone else at a lower cost.  We are looking at very strategically with our board and our technology group is the cloud strategy for the firm. Not going to comment on this call, but that's something that is actively engaged with the board and others. So it's going to be the primary driver of our productivity. It has to be in the space of technology, because it's the largest part of our spend.  So I know that's obvious to you Mike, but I mean if we don't get the kind of savings you talked about, the consolidating datacenters, cloud based solutions, etcetera. I will say we\u2019ve done a pretty good job of Mike is not running as many duplicative systems. I think we\u2019ve looked and consolidated across our organization and where we were running multiple applications to do similar services.  I think we've done a pretty good job of consolidating that, although I know that we're still looking at the number of apps that we have if you will inside the firm and trying to maximize and reduce that. So probably the single largest effort we have right now is around understanding that technology spend and how we can drive that through productivity. Mike Mayo : Well, that helps you get useful contacts around that. Just one more time on specific numbers. I\u2019m not saying many do, but the number of apps that you have and the number of data centers that you have or at least what you mean when you mainframe maintenance move to like a third party, a data provider, a datacenter provider, are you thinking of using one of those? Biff Bowman : So the \u2013 for instance if we used a provider of that main frame, we had our own staff that did the upgrades and maintenance on that. There are firms who provide the hardware and other items for that mainframe who also have staff that can provide that maintenance. We\u2019ve done that instead of having our own staff, but that's a productivity pick up for us, because we had our own staff to do that and there's others who can do it for better cost advantages. So that's how I would describe that, is what that means. Mike Mayo : Okay. Alright, thanks a lot. Operator : We\u2019ll now take a question from Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research. Biff Bowman : Hey Rob. Rob Wildhack : Good morning guys. One more on organic growth and appreciate the commentary on the alignment of expenses and revenue growth there, but can you remind us on the level of organic growth where those two can start to decouple a little more and positive operating leverage would really start to show up? Biff Bowman : Could you ask that one more time, I want to make sure I follow that? Rob Wildhack : Yeah, I think you're talking about aligning expense growth and organic revenue growth and so I'm wondering if there's a given level of revenue growth where, the expense growth might not need to stay as closely in line and you can really see some operating leverage. Biff Bowman : Yeah okay. I don't know exactly where that point would be, but in general in our two businesses it could be a little bit different. So in our asset servicing business for instance, there is a required level of expense to generate probably every point of organic growth. Right now for most of that it depends on which business line. If it's traditional custody that's highly leverage, there\u2019s less expense needed; if it's fund administration, fund accounting, it needs more expense, it has a little bit more, I\u2019d say a larger expense base that needs to go with it.  In the wealth space, pretty highly leveraged there. So the expense required to grow that point of organic growth there could be different. So I think that's what you're asking, is if we could get continued growth?  I don't know that there's ever a point where the expense growth stops and the organic revenue continues. I think there's always a piece of that that's needed to get that through that, but there is certain lines of businesses that are more leverage able than others that widen that gap out and we\u2019ve had great success in some of those lines. Particularly wealth has had a strong growth rate that you can see in their line versus their industry and their competitors. Rob Wildhack : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Biff Bowman : Thanks Operator : And it appears there are no further questions. So we would like to thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect. Biff Bowman : Thanks everyone.",

Let me turn the call over to Mike O'Grady. Mike O'Grady: Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. As you know, Jason Tyler became our CFO as of January 1st as Biff Bowman will be retiring after 35 years at Northern Trust. We're grateful to Biff for his many contributions as a trusted colleague and thoughtful leader throughout his time and especially for his significant contributions as CFO for the previous five years. I welcome Jason to the CFO role. He brings deep financial expertise and leadership experience and I am confident he will be very successful in the role. Before Jason goes through our results in detail, I'd like to comment on some of the trends we're seeing in our businesses. Our performance for 2019 continued to exhibit foundational strength, as we executed on a number of growth strategies while continuing to advance our digital efforts and improve our productivity. Our results for the year generated a return on average common equity of 14.9%. We also returned a record $1.7 billion to our common shareholders through dividends and the repurchase of 11.8 million shares. In our Wealth Management business, our capabilities and positioning continue to resonate in the marketplace. On a year-over-year basis, assets under management grew 13% to $314 billion and assets under custody grew 18% to $736 billion. On the capability front, spurring some of this growth, we continue to invest in our data, digital, and analytics capabilities as well as in innovation around the delivery of goals-driven holistic advice. We also closed out the year with the opening of a new office in Philadelphia, and we were named the Best Private Bank by the Financial Times Group for the 9th time out of the last 11 years. In sum, for Wealth Management, it was a very solid year performance and momentum. Our Corporate & Institutional Services business remains focused on executing its growth strategies, digitalizing the business and innovating for the future to enable scalable growth. Assets under custody and administration ended the year at $11.3 trillion, up 19% from the prior year. We continued to achieve healthy organic growth in our core asset servicing fees within both the asset manager and asset owner segments, driven by our strong positioning. We are also making targeted investments that are expected to continue to fuel growth in areas like front and middle-office outsourcing and capital markets. For example, we launched new capabilities in front-office solutions, integrated trading solutions, and currency management in 2019. Finally, C&IS is executing a multi-year strategy to digitize the business to drive more profitable, scalable, and sustainable growth into the future. In Asset Management, we ended the year with $1.2 trillion in assets under management, an increase of 15% from the prior year. As the industry transitions through key secular shifts, we are delivering long-term value to stakeholders through, first, strengthening our areas of competitive advantage such as portfolio construction, quantitative research, and liquidity management. Second, prioritizing investment in growth markets and growth segments such as financial intermediaries and family offices, and third, shifting our business mix to higher value-add products such as quant active, ETF, ESG and multi-asset. As we enter 2020, we are excited about the competitive positioning within each of our businesses. We remain focused on providing our clients with exceptional service and expertise, driving efficiencies into our business and driving profitable growth. Let me turn the call over to Jason to walk you through the details of our performance. Jason Tyler : Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone. Let me join Mike and Mark in welcoming you to our fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Starting on Page 2 of our quarterly earnings review presentation this morning, we reported fourth quarter net income of $371.1 million. Earnings per share were $1.70 and our return on common equity was 14.8%. The current quarter's results included a $20.8 million charge recorded in other operating income related to the decision to sell substantially all of the lease portfolio and a $6.8 million software disposition charge recorded within equipment and software expense. As you can see on the bottom of Page 2, the macroeconomic environment was mixed. While equity markets were strong, short-term interest rates in the US declined both on a sequential as well as a year-over-year basis. So through to Page 3 and a review the financial highlights of the fourth quarter. Year-over-year, revenue increased 3% with non-interest income up 4% from one year ago and net interest income flat. Expenses increased 5% from last year. The provision for credit losses was a credit of $1 million in the current quarter compared to a credit of $4 million one year ago. Net income was down 9% year-over-year. In the sequential comparison, revenue increased 1% with both non-interest income and net interest income up 1%. Expenses increased 3% compared to the prior quarter. Net income declined 3% sequentially. Return on average common equity was 14.8% for the quarter, down from 17% one year ago and 14.9% in the prior quarter. Assets under custody/administration of $12.1 trillion increased 19% compared to one year ago and were up 4% on a sequential basis. Assets under custody of $9.2 trillion were up 22% compared to one year ago and up 5% sequentially. Assets under management were $1.2 trillion, up 15% on a year-over-year basis and up 2% on a sequential basis. Let's look at the results in greater detail starting with revenue on Page 4. Fourth quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $1.6 billion, up 3% compared to last year and up 1% sequentially. Trust, investment and other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue and were $992 million in the fourth quarter, up 6% from last year and up 2% sequentially. Foreign exchange trading income was $65 million in the fourth quarter, down 17% year-over-year and up 8% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was primarily related to lower foreign exchange swap activity in our treasury function. Other non-interest income was $70 million in the fourth quarter, down 6% compared to one year ago and down 17% sequentially. Other operating income included the aforementioned $20.8 million loss relating to the lease portfolio. Excluding the lease related loss, the year-over-year growth was driven by implementation of a bank-owned life insurance program during 2019 and strong security commissions and trading income. The sequential growth excluding the lease portfolio loss was primarily driven by favorability in the Visa related swap. Net interest income, which I'll discuss in more detail later, was $430 million in the fourth quarter, flat with the other period - flat with the prior period, and up 1% sequentially. Now let's look at the components of our trust and investment fees on Page 5. For our Corporate & Institutional Services business, fees totaled $567 million in the fourth quarter and were up 6% year-over-year and up 1% on a sequential basis. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees, were $397 million and up 6% year-over-year and up 1% on a sequential basis. The year-over-year performance was primarily driven by new business and favorable equity markets. Performance on a sequential basis was primarily driven by favorable currency translation and favorable markets. Assets under custody/administration for C&IS clients were $11.3 trillion at quarter-end, up 19% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential performance was primarily driven by higher markets, new business, and favorable currency translation. Recall that lagged market values factor into the quarter's fees with both quarter lag and month lag markets impacting our C&IS custody and fund administration fees. Investment management fees in C&IS of $116 million in the fourth quarter were up 10% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. The year-over-year performance was driven by new business and favorable markets. The sequential performance was primarily due to favorable markets. Assets under management for C&IS were $917 billion, up 16% year-over-year and up 2% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was driven by favorable markets and new business as well as an increase in end-of-period securities lending collateral levels. We've had strong success within our liquidity products with significant growth in our institutional cash funds. The sequential increase was primarily driven by markets, partially offset by a decline in period-end securities lending collateral levels. Securities lending fees were $23 million in the fourth quarter, up 4% year-over-year and up 12% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher volumes, while the sequential increase was primarily driven by higher spreads. Securities lending collateral was $153 billion at quarter-end and averaged $164 billion across the quarter. Average collateral levels increased 4% year-over-year and were down 7% sequentially. Moving to our Wealth Management business, trust, investment and other servicing fees were $425 million in the fourth quarter, were up 7% compared to the prior quarter and up 2% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential increases were driven by favorable markets and new business. Assets under management were $314 billion at quarter-end, up 13% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. The increases were primarily driven by favorable markets. Moving on to Page 6, net interest income was $430 million in the fourth quarter and flat compared to the prior year. Earning assets averaged $107 billion in the quarter, down 4% from the prior year. Total deposits averaged $89 billion and were down 4% versus the prior year. The net interest margin was 1.59% in the fourth quarter and was up 7 basis points from a year ago. The improvement in the net interest margin compared to the prior year primarily reflects a balance sheet mix shift and the impact of lower foreign exchange swap volume, particularly - partially offset by lower short-term interest rates versus one year ago. On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income was up 1%. Average earning assets increased 2% on a sequential basis, while the net interest margin declined 2 basis points. It's worth noting that net interest income result for the quarter did include approximately $6 million in various one-time non-repeating items. During the quarter, we also added to our bank-owned life insurance program that was first put in place during the second quarter. Compared to the prior quarter, this quarter's net interest income declined by approximately $900,000 as a result of the additional BOLI, while other operating income benefited by $1.5 million. The full quarterly run rate will be reached in the first quarter of 2020 with an additional net interest income decline of approximately $2.3 million and other operating income increase of $2.7 million on a sequential basis. Looking at the currency mix of our balance sheet for the fourth quarter, US dollar deposits represented 68% of our total deposits. This is down from 70% one year ago and 69% in the prior quarter. Turning to Page 7, expenses were $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter and were 5% higher than the prior year and 3% higher versus the prior quarter. Compensation expense totaled $463 million and was up 4% compared to one year ago. The year-over-year growth was primarily related to higher salaries driven by base pay adjustments and staff growth, partially offset by lower incentive expense. On a sequential basis, compensation was up 1%. The sequential increase was partially due to higher salary expense, driven by staff growth and unfavorable currency translation, partially offset by lower cash-based incentive pools. Employee benefit expense of $93 million was up 2% from one year ago and was up 6% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by higher payroll taxes, while the sequential growth was primarily due to increased medical costs. As it pertains to our benefits expense in 2020, due to changes in underlying assumptions, we expect to see an increase in full-year pension expense of just over $30 million, which represents a 0.7% increase in our overall total 2019 expense base. Outside services cost of $206 million were up 5% on a year-over-year basis and up 6% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by higher technical services, consulting, and legal expense. The sequential increase was primarily due to higher legal and consulting services as well as costs related to increased business volumes, including brokerage clearing, market data, sub-custody and third-party adviser fees. Equipment and software expense of $165 million was up 8% from one year ago and up 9% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential growth were impacted by the previously mentioned software disposition charge of $6.8 million. The year-over-year growth also reflects higher depreciation and amortization, while higher software amortization costs contributed to the sequential increase. Occupancy expense of $57 million was up 15% from one year ago and up 8% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential increases were driven by higher rents and building operation costs related to our workplace real estate strategies. Other operating expense of $88 million was down 1% from one year ago and down 4% sequentially. The sequential decrease was driven primarily by the Northern Trust sponsored golf tournament in the prior quarter, partially offset by increases in advertising, staff-related, and other operating expense categories. As we've discussed on previous calls, through our Value for Spend initiative, which - that we started in 2017, we've been realigning our expense base with the goal of realizing $250 million in expense, run rate savings by 2020. Our current quarter results reflect approximately $60 million in expense savings or $240 million in annualized run rate savings. Our efforts around Value for Spend and productivity more broadly will not cease as we further embed a culture of sustainable expense management across the company. Expense management is a core emphasis and we continue to focus on striking the right balance between productivity growth and investing in the business. Now turning to full year, our results in 2019 are summarized on Page 8. Net income was $1.5 billion, down 4% compared with 2018, and earnings per share were $6.63, flat with the prior year. On the right margin of this page, we outline the non-recurring impact that were called out for both years. We achieved a return on equity for the year of 14.9% compared to 16.2% in 2018. The full year revenue and expense trends are outlined on Page 9. Trust, investment and other servicing fees grew 3% in 2019. The growth during the year was primarily driven by new business and favorable markets, partially offset by the impact of unfavorable currency translation. Foreign exchange trading income declined 18%, driven by a decrease in foreign exchange swap activity within our treasury function as well as decreases in market volatility and lower client volumes. Net interest income increased 3%. Average earning assets during the year declined by 6% while net interest margin increased 14 basis points. The net result was 2% growth in overall revenue on a reported basis in 2019. On a reported basis, expenses were up 3% from the prior year. Adjusting for the expense charges in both 2018 and 2019 that are on the prior page, expenses were also up 3% from 2018. Now turning to Page 10, our capital ratios remain strong with our common equity Tier 1 ratio of 12.7% under the standardized approach and 13.3% under the advanced approach. The supplementary leverage ratio at the corporation was 7.6% and at the bank was 6.4%, both of which achieved 3% minimum requirement. During the fourth quarter, we declared cash dividends totaling $150 million to common stockholders and repurchased 2.6 million shares of common stock at a cost of $264 million. These two factors combined represent a payout ratio of approximately 113% for the quarter. Also during the fourth quarter, Northern Trust issued $400 million in perpetual preferred stock at a fixed for life dividend rate of 4.7%, callable in five years. Fixed rate dividends through this new issuance are expected to be paid on a quarterly basis with the first dividend declared at our Board of Directors meeting earlier this week and to be paid April 1st of 2020. Given the November issuance, the initial preferred dividend payment will cover approximately five months and therefore is expected to equal $7.6 million in the first quarter of 2020. Going forward, these fixed rate dividends are expected to be $4.7 million a quarter. The proceeds of this issuance were used to redeem all outstanding shares of Series C preferred stock in January - on January 2nd of 2020. First quarter 2020 results will include $11.5 million in accelerated Series C related costs. Now let me turn the call back over to Mike for closing comments. Mike O'Grady: Before we open up the call for Q&A, I wanted to close by talking about our key financial objectives and our performance against these in 2019. Our primary financial target is to achieve a return on average common equity of between 10% to 15%. For 2019, our ROE of 14.9% was at the high end of that range. This was the sixth consecutive year we have achieved our targeted ROE. We are also focused on driving profitable growth and have objectives to achieve both fee operating leverage and positive operating leverage. Although we have achieved positive fee operating leverage in eight of the last 10 years and positive operating leverage in seven of the last 10 years, we did not achieve those for 2019. As we enter 2020, we are continuing to rapidly evolve the company by providing differentiated services and experiences to our clients and investing in innovative capabilities to do more for our existing clients and gain new clients. We combine this with our intense focus on improving our productivity to profitably grow the company and create value for our stakeholders. This concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust's fourth quarter earnings conference call today. Jason, Mark and I would be happy to answer your questions. David, could you please open the line? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : Mike, picking up on the last point, I guess when you talk about operating leverage, I guess over the last few quarters, you guys talked about getting organic expense growth to be in line with organic fee growth, not just total fee growth. I guess, question number one there, is the organic fee growth still in the 3% to 4% kind of range as you look out into 2020? And then secondly, should we expect you to achieve this level of expense growth for the full year sort of despite the fact that markets are starting off on a very strong point and that should naturally create more kind of pressure or more tailwinds rather to fees? And I'm just wondering whether or not the sort of level of expense growth could be sustainable into 2020. Mike O'Grady: So Alex, I think you're thinking about the framework the right way, which is, as I mentioned earlier, we are focused on the objective of generating positive fee operating leverage, and underneath that is the goal to achieve that on an organic basis as well, knowing that that is a higher bar, if you well. But the reason why we focus on an organic basis is because, just as you indicated, when markets are stronger, we expect that we'll get more positive fee operating leverage from that. It's more challenging to achieve that in, I'll call it, lower growth environments than when we do have the tailwinds, but that's why it's important to have that primary objective around organic. In 2019, we did not achieve the organic fee operating leverage. And that's something that, certainly as far as what we're shooting for, we're trying to get that so that if we would have achieved it, we would had positive fee operating leverage here for the year. And going into 2020, it's the same objective. Now, as Jason talked about and can go into more detail, there are certain aspects of the expense base that roll in. In this case, pension, as he mentioned for example, $30 million increase for the year. We still look to cover that, if you will, and try to just focus on the productivity objectives to try to overcome things like that as well. So the goals haven't changed from year to year. We can have different challenges to achieve it, but as far as what we're trying to achieve, it's the same objective. Alex Blostein : And then Jason, one cleanup for you for an IR. It sounded like there were $6 million of one-time. I believe it was a benefit in Q4. Can you flesh that out a little bit to what are those benefits and maybe help us bridge the kind of the right jumping-off point for Q1 '20 in IR as we zone anything out on the quarter here. Thanks. Jason Tyler : Yes. You've got the headline number right. It's about $6 million. It's a combination of a couple of different items. There is some premium am and then one thing we didn't headline much, but we did have a pay-off of a non - the loan that was on non-accrual, we picked up another $2 million in interest on that. And then the FTE adjustment was a little - was a couple of million dollars higher. So you add those factors together and you get to the $6 million. Operator : Our next question will come from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. James Mitchell : Can we just talk a little bit about the period-end balance sheet? It really kind of spiked. Is that - should we take that as a sort of transitory because if you look at average balances, they weren't up that much, or is there something that's continuing into 1Q that we should maybe up our assumptions around deposit growth given Fed actions et cetera? Jason Tyler : Yes, you're right. It was high. I actually looked back to see if this is a record high. It wasn't, but it was close, but more importantly, it did come - it has come back down there. Obviously, as you know, the balance sheet tends to spike at the end of the quarters and particularly the end of the years. This was higher than normal, not a record, but already we've seen more normalization as some of the large clients have put money back to work into the market in different ways. James Mitchell : And then maybe just a follow-up on the comp line and expenses going forward. Just on the - you had a headcount growth of 5%. So how do you - how do we think about that kind of upward pressure from headcount growth versus your desire to kind of - the scalable digitization, trying to keep core expense growth below organic growth, but we're kind of starting off with much higher employee base. How do we think about the comp line specifically? Jason Tyler : Well, a couple of things. There may be - you might be looking at Page 7 of the press release and you get the comp line there, and I look at it more on Q4 '18 versus Q4 '19 and you've got a 4% growth rate there. So the first thing from my lens is to say, what was the revenue growth, what was really trust fee growth over that time frame. And it was about 6.25%. So first of all, on that comp line, even though it's a tiny bit higher than we'd like to see, we did get leverage in that, which is good. And we're - in a year where we've got revenue up, a lot of our expenses are going to bring - a lot of our revenue growth is going to bring with it expense growth and it's going to hit in just about every one of the key expense line items including comp. The second thing to - for us to think about is that, in general, we've got the technology investment that we're making. And so that - part of the reason that number may be a little higher is that some of the tech investments that we're making in the business are coming through in that comp line. And third, just so you guys are thinking about it the right way coming into the next year, we're always going to have effectively, call it, $30 million to $40 million base pay adjustments for the comp line. And so you think about that on the base of business that we have here, that's going to lead to almost a point in and of itself in the growth. So those are just a couple of ways different lenses to think about that line item. Operator : Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : I just wanted to follow up a little bit on that regarding just technology in general. I know in the past you've given some insight on what your tech budget is. Maybe you could give us a little sense as to how you see that trajecting over time. I know you don't give guidance, but just understand, do you think that trajectory is accelerating, decelerating, and then how you see that shifting over time comp versus non-comp as it relates to tech? Thanks. Jason Tyler : Yes. So it's obviously, we've got a high sense of urgency as we think about expenses in general and tech is where it is outsized relative to the other areas, and so you're right to horn in on it. A couple of data points as you think about next year. One is, as I take a step back, we thought about what we wanted to convey that we know about. We don't want to give guidance on expenses, but we do want to tell you what we know at this point. And there are some things that we have high degree of certainty of, as we said, at this point coming into 2020. So I'm going to deal with those in three buckets, just to put those out. One, I hinted to a couple of minutes ago and that comes down to the compensation line. We know that we're going to see, in general, about - somewhere between $35 million, $40 million just in base pay adjustments based on the business that we have. Secondly, we talked about pension being a little over $30 million higher, and then third is we have a sense right now of what IT depreciation is going to look like, and that's about $40 million higher for the year in 2020 than it was - than it will be as we look back on 2019. Now, some of that is reflected in the fourth quarter and so we can - it's hard for us to develop much of it, but we do know that on a year-over [Technical Difficulty] higher. So those are three key items that I think everybody - we want to make sure everybody is aware of, that we've got clear line of sight on at this point. Now, second, more broadly as we think about how do we depict the IT budget and the IT increase, it is actually hitting in a lot of different line items. So just we were talking about Page 7 on the press release a minute ago, stay there for a second. And if you look at these different line items, I actually went back and pulled out IT from each of the different components that you can see externally to get a sense of how much they're impacting those growth areas because I do look at, not just comp, which we were talking about a second ago, but all of those line items to try and get a sense of whether we're getting leverage there. And obviously the biggest - it hits very heavily in equipment and software, which is why you'll see that line item be pretty elevated, but there is also smaller, but still meaningful impacts that will hit in - obviously compensation, employee benefits and outside services. Betsy Graseck : And is it still around $1 billion that you're thinking the tech budget was in 2019? I recall that was the estimate that was given most recently. Mark Bette : Yes. Betsy, this is Mark. Yeah, about a - we look at it kind of in a three-year rolling average, so 2019, 2020, 2021; a little bit over $1 billion per year and that includes both operating expense as well as capital investments. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Maybe just a question on NII. Is there any impact on future net interest income from the sale of the leasing portfolio? And if so, if you can quantify that, and then also if you can talk about what you're seeing for deposit trends into 1Q so far. Jason Tyler : So on - I just want to write down deposit trends. On the impact of Norlease on NIM, very de minimis increase, nothing to really think about, that pretty clean accounting perspective on how that was hit. And then secondly, on deposit trends coming in more broadly, I know that it's - first of all it's a strategic focus for us across the business in both - on both the Wealth side and on the C&IS side. And we've talked about, on the Wealth side in particular, we've told you about some strategic initiatives we had there to bring - that brought some money out of the 2a7 funds on to the balance sheet. That's held in pretty well. And then I'd say on the institutional side of the business, it's more volatile and there is no - the initiatives that we have there aren't as aggressive as what we've been thinking about on the Wealth side, but we're still doing everything we can to make sure we're getting a good share of our deposits - of the deposits coming in from clients as the custody book grows and as we're talking to clients across the globe. Brian Bedell : Just doing an averaging basis, is that - you're expecting growth in 1Q based on those initiatives? I know the end-of-period was elevated, of course, but if we think about average to average. Jason Tyler : No, I think there was - if you think about the asset side and then the funding side, if you think about NIM, the only other item there of note, there was a little bit, a couple of billion dollars higher on that, but that didn't really come more from the deposit side. It came more from trading related activity. And so there's nothing I'd call out at this point that would lead you to say that deposits would be moderately or significantly different. Brian Bedell : And then on organic growth, I think you commented on Wealth Management AUM being up mostly from the markets. Just wanted to get a sense, that's been a strong driver of organic growth for you guys for a while. I just wanted to get a sense of the cadence of the organic growth trends in Wealth Management versus the asset servicing business. And as you think about expenses, are we still thinking about a comparable growth rate in expense growth? Even with those headwinds that you've mentioned on the comp pension and the IT side, is that still reasonable to think of the rate of growth that would be similar to the organic growth, if that's still like trending towards the mid-single digits? Jason Tyler : Let me hit the top side first on the growth side and the trends within the Wealth business. The business is continuing to do well, and Mike touched on it earlier this year and some really nice differentiated approaches that that business has or with the market was goals driven, Wealth Management resonates very well, and the trend there that continues to be seen and come through on the financials and you guys are able to see this actually is that, that we're doing well at the very top end of the market. So the family office business is growing faster. We can see that the numbers we report on both a sequential basis and a year-over-year basis. That trend has been going on for a while and it's attractive. And then the second component there is how we'll see the expenses align differently between the business. I am going to separate it in a couple of ways. One is that the tech-related expenses apply a little bit more towards the C&IS side of the business. As we think about things like metrics in our strategic operating model, those things are going to be allocated a little bit more for the C&IS side of the business. That said, the Wealth side of the business is also investing in different ways. And they are working hard on digitizing the business. Mike talked about that earlier that we're probably a little ahead in our investments there on the C&IS side. Wealth is starting to think more about how to reflect the digital transformations that we've seen across the marketplace and how we can take our position with things like goals-driven Wealth Management, make it even more accessible to clients, have even better interactions and have better foundational technology. Brian Bedell : And we're still thinking about organic growth in that sort of mid-single digit area on a go-forward basis level of single digit? Mike O'Grady: Brian, just to confirm, are you talking about Wealth or the corporation as a whole? Brian Bedell : The company as a whole. Mike O'Grady: Yes. So maybe just to address that, Brian, kind of across the businesses, so Jason talked about Wealth Management. We continue to see, as you mentioned, healthy solid growth in that business. That's the nature of it. And again, our strategic imperative in that business is to increase or accelerate that growth even more. We're still seeing a higher growth rate in our asset servicing business. And so that continues. It's at the lower end of its range, but it continues to grow at a healthy rate. And the strategic imperative for that business is, yes, to continue that growth, but we want to see that growth be more scalable. And then I would just also add, with our asset management business, we're all well aware of the secular trends in the industry there. And I would say that's certainly impacted our asset management business, although comparatively the business is performing well. And so it's experiencing positive organic growth, just meaning they are able to increase the flows, but also then change the mix in such a way that is offsetting the fee compression that you're seeing across the industry. So it's positive. Having said that, it is at a lower rate than the other two businesses. So you put that all together, to your point, we've talked about the organic growth rate for our fees at the company level kind of being mid-single digits. That's still the case. We're at the lower end of that right now. So what does that mean? Well, that's why we're focused on our growth strategies and executing on those, but that's why one of our other key priorities for the company is on continually improving our productivity. And when we are at the lower end of the growth side, we have to work just that much harder on the expense side to get more savings, if you will, on the expense side. So that's the strategy, if you will, and again, focused on trying to execute that so that we can deliver the positive fee operating leverage. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Jason, could you expand a little bit more on - underneath the fact that you said that some of the balances might have gone off the balance sheet, can you help us understand either how much you saw as like over-growth in the earning assets this quarter? And then secondarily, if rates stay stable from here, can you talk us through the dynamics of NIM in terms of how much asset repricing has to come through and how much deposit repricing you could still see happen now that we've gone to a more stable level? Thanks. Jason Tyler : Sure. So on the first, I think it's - as these spikes happen late in the quarter, it's frankly a relatively short period of time that these spikes are on the balance sheet. And so it comes in late and it leaves pretty early. And so - and we're not doing anything fancy when those dollars come in, and so it frankly just doesn't impact the overall NIM very much. It does spike - we're obviously looking through the balance sheet on a daily basis. It spikes it and - but it doesn't - I don't think it really drives NIM that much at the end of the day. And then as we look out into next quarter, I don't think that spike should necessarily be reflected in your thought process as you think about. So that's more from a volume perspective. As you think about - although I did hint earlier that, kind of that $2 billion increase in the securities portfolio, I do think that's likely to come down. And that had more to do with, I think more idiosyncratic trading that was happening at the time, nothing abnormal. We just were trading some more longer-dated securities and the security settlement process led to higher securities being on. That's really what led to that little bit of an average increase, and I think that will abate. As we think about the rates going forward into first quarter, the thing that we can all see that will have maybe more of an impact than what people realize is that fed funds to LIBOR spread. And that did have an impact in fourth quarter. And when we talked to everyone at the conference we attended and then on the last call, we were looking at a spread there that is more probably 13 or 14 basis points, and we thought that was going to go away. It actually held in. It even expanded a little bit, but now that compression that we anticipated has actually come to fruition. And if you look at that delta right now, it's more on the 9, 10 basis point land, and so that is the factor that, if that holds in, that would have an impact on what we would think about for NIM for next quarter. Ken Usdin : And then do you have the ability to reprice much on the right side of the balance sheet? You could just talk us about customer dynamics outside of just your market index type of deposits. Like, how is the discussion going with clients and what opportunities do you still have to reduce rate? Jason Tyler : Yes. It's just so incredibly different between the businesses. And so on the institutional side, first of all, the deposits there are driven a lot more by our EMEA clients. And then in that book, those clients are shopping in real time. And so we're making very tight decisions on those and we can only - we're going to get what the market gives us frankly. And so - and we're not in a position to be a price leader there. And on the other side of the business, the wealth business, very different dynamics, and there we talk again about the fact that we sunsetted in anchor suit product and we brought assets from the 2a7 funds out of the balance sheet. We're looking much more there and can think about what we want to be strategically in the marketplace. And to give you some headlines on how we talk about it, we do want to - we want to be very attractive for large depositors. And so that's where we're going to be much more competitive. And for more of the retail client base, we're going to be less competitive and - but at the top end of the market there, we're always trying to figure out how to attract and be extremely aggressive about retaining our top depositors. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : So just wanted to start off with a question on capital. I know that in the past, you've discussed the business need to manage to higher ratios to ensure you don't deviate meaningfully at least from some of your G-SIB peers are running closer to 12% plus, given that you're competing with some of these firms for RFPs. And could you - I was hoping you can maybe just unpack or speak to some of the competitive considerations such as RFPs versus regulatory constraints. It looks like the regulatory changes are swinging in the right way in terms of SLR relief, potential for the elimination of leverage constraints and CCAR. I'm just wondering if some of those changes come through, how that informs your willingness or appetite to manage to a lower target over time. Mike O'Grady: It's Mike. Why don't I start off? So first of all, as you would expect, we feel very good about our capital levels and our flexibility with regards to capital. As you've highlighted, we are always cognizant and focused on what the implications would be on the business for our capital levels and that can play into formalized RFP processes where, yes, we want to compare favorably to some of our competitors, but also just more broadly, and I'll say even subjectively, with our Wealth Management business, dealing with large family offices, they are looking for safety and security, conservative strong balance sheet. And so it's a part of the business strategy for us. Having said that, like any resource, it needs to be balanced. And so we're comfortable with where we are. To your point, we're cognizant of where our competitor capital levels are, and to the extent that those move, that gives us more flexibility on that front. And then the last thing I would add is from a regulatory lens. As you've talked about, there are changes on the regulatory front. Having said that, they've also recently re-categorized banks. We are a Category 2 bank. We happen to be the only Category 2 bank, which we take as a compliment, reflecting the unique nature of our business model. But it also does mean, once again, we have to work our way through whatever changes that may mean as far as capital management for us. We're not concerned about anything per se, but there just is some uncertainty until they fully roll out the implications of Category 2 on capital management expectations. Steven Chubak : No, very helpful color. And just one follow-up from me. Just a cleanup question on the other income line. Even when we adjust for the one-timers in the quarter, it looks like that was a source of revenue strength, and I was hoping to gauge the sustainability of some of that strength versus the $50 million core level in 4Q. And just given some of the guidance on BOLI related impacts, how we should think about what could be a reasonable or appropriate run rate for that line in 2020 recognizing there's always mark-to-market and other noise. Mark Bette : Steven, hi, it's Mark. As you said, if you adjust for the lease, we would have been at closer to the $50 million mark. There was - the BOLI benefit came into that line that will continue to have a little bit of a bump up in the first quarter, like Jason said. I would say that the mark-to-market adjustment on the Visa was favorable this quarter, about a $5 million sequential benefit, which - there was more of a negative drag on that last quarter for some of the adjustments that we made there. This quarter, when you take that into account as well as the BOLI, we did have a little bit higher miscellaneous income and credit and bank related fees, probably higher than normal. One way that I would say that you can look at that line because it does move around is if you do strip out some of the non-recurring items that we've had in that line, you're probably looking at an average of about $35 million over the last several quarters. And then in theory you could layer BOLI on top of that. That would be one way to look at it. Operator : Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : I just had a follow-up from a few of the questions that have been asked so far, and just wanted to try and frame it in the best way to think about 1Q NII. And Jason, I know - welcome to the circus, our quarterly circus here with your conference call. I know your predecessor had started to help us think about one quarter out NII. I know that was a departure from Northern's normal course of business. I don't know what your plan is going forward, but it does seem like there is a lot of noise. So if you could help us frame how to think about 1Q, you guys sold some of the lease portfolio, so I'm guessing we need to shrink that average earning asset bucket a bit. We've got an over-earning of about $6 million. You've got the tighter fed fund to LIBOR. How should we think about how all this will weigh on NII as we go into 1Q based on what you've seen so far? Jason Tyler : Well, I think you - Brennan, I think you got all the pieces. The way I think about leading into it, another couple of items. One, you talked about the one-timers, those - it's really $5 million, $6 million. Secondly, I mentioned the LIBOR-fed fund spread. I think that's a very important one, as you think about how to this out. And then you mentioned BOLI, which, having that in place now for a full quarter, because remember, we didn't have it in place last year. The benefit of that, even if you just assume the same type of economics that we experienced this time, should be a positive $5 million. And then lastly, we haven't talked about day count. It is going to work against us, if you're thinking about it on a sequential basis. We'll go from 92, not to 90, but to 91 with leap year, and so those are the - in my mind, those are the big four buckets to use as a starting point. Brennan Hawken : And then when we think about the average balance sheet, it looked like there was a big - a bit of a jump in the other liabilities this quarter and it's at the highest level that it's been in a couple of years by about $1 billion. Should we - is that temporary? Obviously it was enough to skew the average balance for the fourth quarter. So is there something unusual happening that will prove sustainable or should we just expect that to wind down in 1Q? Jason Tyler : No, I was hinting at earlier that had to do with more of the nature of the securities that were trading that had more time and were in settlement mode for longer. And so that's what I think will drive, bring that - the securities portfolio down to a more normalized level. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Like TBAs or something? Jason Tyler : Mortgage - yeah, TBA mortgages, just some - nothing that we don't normally do. Just a little higher mix of those items that led to higher level of security sitting. And obviously we're not getting the yield on those as they're sitting and settle up. The other thing I just mentioned, I think it's - you're right, there is kind of a lot of question about where NIM is going, and we had gotten in a mode of talking about what we expect in effectively providing guidance. And I'll say at this point, we do think NIM will be down 2% to 4% - NII will be down 2% to 4%. And so it's not to say that every quarter we're going to give that, but I do think - we gave you guys a handful of different items that you had to square off to get a good launch point. And so I think putting it out there this quarter is fair. Brennan Hawken : And that's off the reported number in 4Q, right? The 107, what we should base that minus 2% to 4%? Jason Tyler : The - off of the reported net interest income of $430 million. Brennan Hawken : Sorry. Yes. Thank you. Jason Tyler : And so that's not indicating - just to be super-fair, it's not indicating the 159 is going to be down 2% to 4%. Just that the 430 million in dollars, we'd expect to be down about 2% to 4% based on the items I walked through. Brennan Hawken : Got it. NII, not NIM. Jason Tyler : Right. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Michael Carrier : I don't want to focus too much on one year, but when you look at the - like not hitting the op leverage target, was that more of a function of higher necessary investments that came up during the year or was it lighter organic growth than maybe expected? And since you mentioned some of the expense items heading into 2020 on comp, pension and tech, are there any areas like maybe real estate that you could see some savings, given some of the repositioning that you guys have been working on? Jason Tyler : Yes. I'll start with the second, which we have mentioned that we expect occupancy to be higher in the short run as we've got some double - double rent payments that we have effectively. So those have been close to it where we're going through a transition of a very large number of sheets from a building we've been in for a long time in Chicago to a new building. We're starting to move people in this month, a lot of the move is going to take place next month. And so we're right in the midst of that. And so you can imagine we're still obviously paying rent in the old facility and also we've started the new facility. There is a lot of work that goes around, making sure that move is taking place. And there are other areas around the footprint overall from a real estate perspective that's going to lead to a higher level of rent in the first half of this year. Now, in the second half of the year, we should get some benefit from that. And so that's something that we'll actually see come down. We'll eventually grow into that run rate, but we are expecting to actually see that line items come down second half of the year. Mike, anything you want to add to that? Mike O'Grady: Yes, just to the first part of your question there about the year, and again, it is a year, but part of the trend there and so what came out of that. One, much broader perspective pulling back from it is if you look at our expense base overall, the - I'm going to comment technology expenses, so this is the expenses for our technology group and the IT depreciation and amortization, represents about 20% of our cost base and that grew at 8%. If you look at the other 80% of our cost base, it grew at about 2%. And so I would say across that 80%, for the most part, we hit on the costs related to the business, to bringing on new clients, and importantly, hitting on our Value for Spend initiatives and the objectives there. So it's not that we didn't achieve those. And then you say, well, on the technology side, what happened there, and there if you think about technology or as I think about technology, there's three primary things that we're trying to achieve there. One is security; two is stability, and three is scalability within our technology. And if you look at the costs that were related to that in the year, there were costs that we had on the safety and stability part, which ended up being higher than we would have expected going into the year, but I think that you absolutely do in order to make sure that you are being able to provide the value proposition, if you will, for your clients. And then likewise on the scalability, there are certain aspects of that where the greater demand for, I'll call it, just computing power, if you will, on the part of our large asset manager clients on some of the asset owner clients, we're just in an environment where there is greater activity and we didn't achieve the level of, I would say, scalability on our platform that we need to be able to achieve. So with each of those three, not only are we trying to ensure we have a strong, safe, stable, secure platform, but we want to increase the scalability on that. So a lot of the focus of our technology strategy beyond kind of digitizing the business and providing new capabilities for our clients is also saying, how do we also get greater productivity out of that platform. Michael Carrier : And just a quick follow-up. Tax rate was a little bit lower. You guys mentioned some of the drivers. Jason, I just - any, like, change in terms of the range that you guys typically expect when we think about going forward? Jason Tyler : I'll start. This quarter had some impact even from Norlease, some other small items, none of which in and of themselves worth calling out, but I don't think you should expect us to be at the 22% level. And we talked - I think Biff mentioned last time on the call, going to something in the 24. I do think 24% is a better longer term assumption at this point. Operator : Our next question comes from Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research. Robert Wildhack : On the C&IS business, can you give us an update on what you're seeing in the competitive landscape and on the pricing front? And then maybe more broadly, when you think about the conversations you're having with clients, have those discussions changed in tone or content at all recently? And how would you expect them to evolve going forward? Mike O'Grady: Sure, I'd be glad to talk about it. So there is a tremendous amount of activity in C&IS broadly, and specifically, I would say, asset servicing. And I would say a lot of these changes, well, certainly they create challenges. We're very optimistic about the growth opportunities that are out there. So if you just give me a minute to run across, I think I can address some of these trends that you're looking for. So if we think about asset owners, even in the parts of the asset owner space that you might think about as being more stable in just their operating models, they have greater needs and greater needs certainly lead to more opportunities for us. So if you think about the not-for-profit sector, healthcare is an area that continues to grow and presents opportunities for us to manage the assets of large healthcare organizations. Universities, where you have endowments and also the foundation space, they've increased the mix on the investment side to greater use of alternatives. And as a result, they have greater needs for how they manage those portfolios and those managers. And that's why we've invested in and are rolling out what we call front-office solutions because that gives them the capability to do that. If you look in Australia, for example, some of the large superannuation funds, not only has that been a great growth opportunity for us over the last decade, but likewise, you're seeing consolidation within the superannuation complex, which again presents changes in the marketplace and opportunities for us. And the last thing I would say in the asset owner space is, more of the very large sophisticated clients, so if you think about the sovereign wealth funds, are actually in-sourcing some of the asset management as opposed to allocating a lot to asset managers. What that requires is then they need to have the capabilities to operate as asset managers. So they have greater data needs and the nature and timing of what they need is greater. And so that provides opportunities for us. That drives a lot of the investments that you hear about because it's now putting them in a different position. And then if I shift to the asset management space, we talk a lot about the pressure of the secular trends and we feel that in our asset management business as well, but it does create opportunities for us on the asset servicing side because it causes these asset managers to look at every aspect of their business, including the operations side. And so that presents opportunities for us where they're looking to outsource more activities. Now, historically, as you know, that's meant mostly middle-office and what we do in IOO. We are seeing more of those types of opportunities in the marketplace, but there are also some new activities that previously were just largely done in-house by everybody that they are now saying, why should they do those and should it be a part of their outsourcing solutions. So if you think about the trading side where we have integrated trading solutions, that's really an outsource trading service that we would provide to them that enables them to essentially move something that's not core to them and that we can do it better and more efficiently for them, and there are other opportunities like that. I would also just continue with the asset managers to the alternative space where, for years, the hedge fund space has presented growth opportunities for us. Our hedge fund services business continues to grow nicely, win large mandates, as you saw this last year. But then also, for us, in the other parts of the alternative space, so thinking private equity, infrastructure, real estate, those are areas where we've had less of a market share or market position there, but it presents larger growth opportunities for us going forward. So overall, a high level of activity and that's why when we talk about the growth, we are optimistic about the growth and we just want to make sure that we're able to bring that on in a scalable way so that we get very profitable growth in the business. Operator : Our next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Vivek Juneja : A couple of questions. Mike, just following up on that last question, so you talk comprehensively about a lot of the volume related opportunities. How about pricing? What are you seeing as you continue to expand into all of these new areas? Mike O'Grady: Sure. Good point. And there is no doubt clients want more for less, and that cuts across all parts of that sector there. So we look at the fee pressure in the asset servicing business as just ongoing. So we don't necessarily see, I would say, a repricing cycle per se that starts and then ends and then we don't do anything. It's ongoing for us, and that's part of the organic growth equation. So we're always netting out the - not only if we lose a client or they drop of service, but also if there is repricing that happens in order to maintain the client. Now, the other aspect of that, which is just a dynamic with that business is, because large portions of it are based on the asset levels, the pricing is based on the asset levels. And so as you see greater appreciation in the markets, then that does mean, yes, we get the benefit where the fees go up, but that's then when you see greater fee pressure. So it's terrific for us that the markets are going up. It does then create more focus on the parts of the client base to look at their fees. And that's why overall what we're trying to do is balance that, but also broaden these relationships, do more for them so that they're still very profitable relationships overall. Vivek Juneja : And as you're trying to build all of these areas, and as you said, you need the tech capabilities for that, is there room to bend the growth rate of that tech spend a little bit or not quite yet? Mike O'Grady: We believe that there is. Mark talked earlier about, when we think about our tech spends, you have the expense side of it, which we focus a lot on here, we talk a lot, and Jason has mentioned the increased amortization cost that comes through. Well, the other piece of that is that CapEx piece that Mark mentioned, which is the capitalization of those costs happen now, they manifest themselves in expenses later, and that's an area where, not only we've been focused, but I think there is much more opportunity when you think about how technology has developed these days, to be able to do it in a more cost-efficient way. I think they're all familiar with agile and other methodologies. Well, we're deploying those, but it's still in the earlier stages. That, in my mind, will produce savings that first hit through more efficient capital spend, and then later over time, it results in lower amortization. Vivek Juneja : One more if I may on the funding side. Your non-interest bearing deposits did pretty well. They actually turned around and grew again in the fourth quarter. And conversely, your short-term borrowings have been shrinking over the course of 2019. So can you comment on both those? Is - have non-interest bearing deposits basically turned and should be growing or what's your outlook of that and what do you plan to do with short-term borrowings? Jason Tyler : You want to start, Mark? Mark Bette : Yes. On the demand deposits, we did see an increase sequentially, Vivek. I don't think that we're calling this an inflection point. We've talked before over the last several quarters, we do have, especially I would say on the institutional side, fluctuations that occur quarter-to-quarter with clients either positioning their assets on or off balance sheet depending on what they might be doing with their own capital investing. So I don't know that we would call out a specific new trend on demand deposits here, starting with what we just saw in the fourth quarter. We'll have to see how that plays out over several quarters. And on the short-term borrowing side, I would say there that is a - if you look back a year ago, three, four, five quarters ago, I would say that some of the discretionary leveraging that we are doing within the treasury area was running at a higher level. And now, at this point, over the last couple of quarters, we've kind of had that down to a lower level. And that manifests itself both in wholesale deposits on the non-US office line, but also on those short-term borrowings. So that - it's really just a function of the leveraging opportunity to kind of gross up the balance sheet. The trade there isn't at the tripping point where we would actually go through with that. So we've kind of reduced some of that discretionary leveraging that we do. Jason Tyler : It's not to say we wouldn't do it again. Just the rate environment today just isn't providing that trade for us. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Harte with Piper Sandler. Mr. Harte... Jeffery Harte : Sorry about that. Can you hear me now? Operator : Yes. Jeffery Harte : So let's talk about expenses, but kind of with the growth you guys can deliver on the top line, I tend to think a little more of kind of margins. In 2019, ex-items saw kind of our first pre-tax margin compression in what's been a number of years. Looking to 2020 and given that you need to keep investing and the current rate environment and with kind of organic fee growth that's near the bottom end of the kind of range, should we expect a return to margin expansion in 2020 even with those kind of things facing us? Mike O'Grady: Yes. I'll start. Before we get to pre-tax margin, we're looking at our expenses relative to our fees. And the reason why we do that is just the nature of the expenses and how they are lined up against the different revenue streams. And so there is no question we're focused on positive fee operating leverage. That's because we're saying we want to bring down that ratio first. And on that front, again, it's affected by markets and other things, but that's why we focus on the organic part because we want to be able to drive that down. Then if you go to the pre-tax margin, yes, some of that flows through, but as you know then, it gets much more impacted by what's happening with the other revenues; to some extent, things like FX and the other income lines, but mostly net interest income. And we're trying to provide what we see in the marketplace as far as deposits and deposits pricing and things like that in - quarter-by-quarter, but that gives you some indication of, as we know, from not only last year, but every year, it's really hard to project interest rate and that's a big factor that drives in it and it's also tough at times to predict client deposit activity and that drives in it. So that's just saying, it's not that we aren't focused on positive fee - positive operating leverage as well. It's just there are more factors that frankly are out of our control and it is difficult to forecast, to be able to answer your question of, like, well, then, are your - is your pre-tax margin going to go up or down. We certainly are aiming for it to go up, but there are things that are out of our control. Jeffery Harte : So when you think of kind of the interest rate environment holding stable and some of that market stuff like FX trading, that really declining, this pre-tax margin kind of expansion should - is potentially attainable. Mike O'Grady: Yes, it - depending on the environment, you're right, it can make it more difficult or it can give us a tailwind. Jeffery Harte : And secondly, with the preferred issuance and redemption, can you just review what kind of we should be thinking about the net impact on preferred dividends next year? I know there's some weird stuff in the first quarter, but then even after that, what kind of run rate we should be looking at? Mark Bette : Jeff, it's Mark. Yeah. So when you look at - if you look back at what our prepared remarks were, the new Series E will have essentially, call it, a five-month dividend in the first quarter, which would be $7.6 million. There is also some costs from Series C that we would also need to recognize upon redeeming it in the first quarter. So that's $11.5 million. And then we have the Series D, which you see, in the first and third quarter of each year. So if you take all that into consideration, at this point, our expectation is, you're probably looking at a preferred dividend right around $30 million, $30.5 million in the first quarter, and then in the second quarter, you come down to the normal new dividend for Series E, which is $4.7 million. And that would be the new run rate in the quarter where we don't have the Series C. Hopefully that helps. We could talk through it if - offline, if you'd like. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : Just a quick question on all these expenses. I mean, you have a normal expense investment that you're doing. Was the three items that you laid out, the pension expense, the base pay adjustment, the IT depreciation included in that growth rate already? Are you saying that you're investing and then you have to still consider these three additional items that are going to be on top of it? Jason Tyler : Portion of it. So the base pay adjustments are always - that's always factored into how we think about our expectations for expense growth. The pension is obviously anomalous, and that's one that - it's not forecast, and Mike mentioned earlier, we're not ignoring it. We're still - we still want to do everything we can to get leverage in that. And then the depreciation increase, we've known that we're going to be leaning into more IT spend in the short run at least, and so I'd say, the base pay adjustments fully factored into our long-term assumptions. The pension not, but we're still working hard to try to even cover that. And then the third element of IT depreciation, part of that's already in the run rate. And so that's the key element there, but the increase itself is one we have to own it. And we've got it - there is a high sense of urgency about making sure we get leverage across each of the key expense items including equipment and software. At some point that's going to be difficult to do in the near term, given we're trying to do it strategically, but certainly the BTA and a portion of the depreciation reflected in our long-term expectations. Brian Kleinhanzl : And then separately, in the asset management, I hear again that the organic growth not kind of where you want it to be. I mean, at what point do you need to do something bigger with regards to restructuring the unit or taking more strategic actions there? Thanks. Mike O'Grady: I think within the asset management sector that our asset management business is performing very well. We talk about the environment a lot just because it is going through a secular change, but if you just looked at the competitive positioning, if you looked at the growth relative to others and then you look at the profitability, it's performing well. And I would say strategically, we feel very good about how the business is repositioning itself. And what I mean by that is, we've been strong and had scale in certain areas like liquidity, like index for a long time, and what we've been doing though over the last few years is repositioning towards some of the higher growth, but also more value-added areas, which I talked about. So quant, ESG, things like that. And so - those areas, although they represent a smaller portion of the pie, if you will, they are growing, they are resonating, but like any longer-term strategy, it takes time before you see the impact of that from a financial perspective. But as far as thinking bigger, if you will, I would say we are - and I just talked about, I'll call it, the product side of that. We're also looking - not looking at, but have been executing on our strategy on the distribution side as well, and it's going well, I would say, on the institutional side. You saw that not only in the fourth quarter, but the second half of the year where that's gone well. But then you also saw last year that we acquired a business that is very small, but - Emotomy, which is essentially a technology platform, which we are utilizing in the intermediary space. And we think, again, that's the type of capability that will enable us to accelerate the growth rate that we already have within there. So, yes, secular change, but we feel very good about our strategic positioning there. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we have no further questions. So I would like to thank you for attending the Northern Trust Corporation's fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect, and thank you for joining us this morning.",

Let me turn the call over to Mike O'Grady. Michael G. O'Grady: Thank you Mark. Let me join Mark in welcoming you to our first quarter 2020 earnings call. Amidst this crisis I hope you and your families are healthy and well. I also want to acknowledge and thank all the healthcare workers, other first responders, and the entire community of essential workers for their heroic efforts during this pandemic. Inside Northern Trust we often speak of our four key stakeholders, clients, employees, community, and shareholders. I know we will devote a lot of this call to discussing the impact of the crisis on shareholders but I would like to take a moment to describe our actions and how they relate to the other stakeholders.We have been engaging with our clients more than ever. Despite the pandemic markets have remained open and our clients have needed to make investment decisions and complete important transactions. Turbulent times such as these show the importance of a strong capital base and liquidity profile as well as robust technology and resiliency plans. We've been able to provide support to our clients and the exceptional service they have come to expect from us. We saw global transaction volumes increase 70% in March compared to February and 60% compared to one year ago. We were able to utilize our global operating model to transfer work around the globe to manage peak volumes.During the first quarter in support of our clients we saw deposit growth of over 22 billion and funded loan balances increase by over 6 billion. In a short amount of time our team also created a solution to provide access to the paycheck protection program and we began processing applications. Whether it's through video conferencing or phone calls and into board rooms or living rooms our clients want the advice and counsel of Northern Trust. The vast majority of our employees who we call partners made a significant shift to working away from our offices with over 90% regularly working remotely. For the critical functions that require a small number of our staff to be in our offices we're taking extra measures to ensure their safety throughout the duration of the crisis. For certain eligible partners we are providing supplemental compensation to support them and their families during this difficult time. We're also offering increased flexibility for alternative work options due to mandated school closures and other impacts of the pandemic. The commitment, expertise, and professionalism of our staff has been extraordinary. So I'm pleased we've been able to provide this support.Northern Trust businesses and therefore the communities we reach are truly global with over 20,000 partners across North America, EMEA, and APAC. We announced philanthropic support to several nonprofit organizations around the world and created a COVID-19 matching gift program to support the efforts of our partners. Our guiding principles of service expertise and integrity have guided our actions over the last several weeks and we will continue to focus our efforts as we navigate the difficult environment we all face. Northern Trust has endured crises before and we are extremely confident in the resiliency of our business and our staff. My sincere appreciation to everyone working so hard throughout this crisis and our sympathies to everyone impacted by this disease.Our annual meeting is taking place later this morning so I have another opportunity to speak to our performance and strategy but for now I'll turn the call to Jason to review our results for the quarter and discuss the financial implications of this pandemic. Jason J. Tyler: Well thank you Mike. Before I start I want to take a brief moment to recognize all those affected by this crisis especially those working on the front lines. Our thoughts are with you and we hope you and your loved ones remain safe and healthy. I'd also like to express my sincere gratitude to all Northern Trust partners for their continuing hard work, resiliency, and flexibility in these uncertain times. I am extremely proud to be part of this team that achieves greater for all of our stakeholders no matter the adversity. Now let's delve into the financial results for the quarter starting on Page 3.This morning we reported first quarter net income of $360.6 million. Earnings per share were a $1.55 and our return on common equity was 13.4%. You can see on the bottom of Page 3 the macroeconomic environment became more challenging during the first quarter. However recall that a significant portion of our trust fees are based on quarter lag or month lag asset levels and thus the current quarter's fees do not fully reflect the impact of the decline in equity markets during the quarter.Let's move to Page 4 and review the financial highlights of the first quarter. Year-over-year revenue on a FTE basis increased 7% with noninterest income up 11% and net interest income down 3%. Expenses increased 4%. The provision for credit losses was 61 million in the quarter while net income was up 4%. In a sequential comparison revenue increased 2% with non-interest income up 5% and net interest income down 3%. Expenses decreased 1% while net income declined 3%.The provision for credit losses of $61 million during the quarter was primarily due to an increase in the reserves driven by current and projected economic conditions resulting from the ongoing pandemic and the related market and economic impact, the largest increase in the commercial and institutional and commercial real estate portfolio. Return on average common equity was 13.4% for the quarter down from 14% a year ago and 14.8% in the prior quarter. Assets under custody/administration of 10.9 trillion were flat compared to a year ago and were down 10% on a sequential basis. Assets under custody of 8.3 trillion were up 1% compared to a year ago and down 11% sequentially. Assets under management were 1.1 trillion down 4% on a year-over-year basis and down 9% on a sequential basis.Let's look at the results in greater detail starting with revenue on Page 5. First quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $1.6 billion up 7% compared to last year and up 2% sequentially. Trust, investment, and other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue reaching a record $1 billion in the first quarter, up 8% from last year and up 1% sequentially. Foreign exchange trading income was $89 million in the first quarter up 34% year-over-year and up 38% sequentially. The increase is primarily due to higher client volumes and increased market volatility during the month of March. The remaining components of other noninterest income were $87 million in the first quarter up 37% compared to a year ago and up 24% sequentially. Securities commissions and trading income increased 79% compared to a year ago and 50% sequentially driven by higher interest rate swap and core brokerage related revenue.Prior quarter other operating income included a $20.8 million loss relating to the sale of leases. Excluding this prior period loss the sequential decline was primarily due to lower income associated with supplemental compensation plans and a market value adjustment for seed capital investment partially offset by lower Visa related swap expense and the impact of a full quarter run rate of the bank owned life insurance program. On a year-over-year basis these categories increased primarily due to the bank owned life insurance program implemented during 2019 and lower Visa swap related expense partially offset by the market value adjustment for a seed capital investment and lower income relating to supplemental compensation plans. The year-over-year and sequential declines relating to the supplemental compensation plan resulted in a related decrease in staff related expense within the other operating expense line. Net interest income which I'll discuss in more detail later was $416 million in the first quarter down 3% growth year-over-year and sequentially.Let's look at the components of our trust investment fees on page 6. For our corporate and institutional services business fees totaled $574 million in the first quarter and were up 7% year-over-year and up 1% on a sequential basis. Custody and administration fees the largest component of C&IS fees were $395 million and up 5% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. The year-over-year performance was driven by favorable markets and new business partially offset by unfavorable currency translation. The sequential decline was primarily driven by unfavorable currency translation partially offset by favorable markets and new business.Assets under custody/administration for C&IS clients were $10.2 trillion at quarter end flat year-over-year and down 10% sequentially. The year-over-year performance reflect a new business offset by lower market levels and unfavorable currency translation. The sequential performance was driven by lower market levels and unfavorable currency translation partially offset by new business. Recall that lag market values factor into the quarter's fees with both quarter lag and month lag markets impacting our C&IS custody and fund administration fees.Investment management fees in C&IS of $121 million in the first quarter were up 16% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential performance was driven by favorable markets and new business. Assets under administration for C&IS clients were $843 billion down 3% year-over-year and down 8% sequentially. Both the year -- both the prior year and sequential comparisons were impacted by lower markets and favorable currency translation partially offset by new business flows. The sequential decline was primarily driven by markets partially offset by new business with an increase in prior -- in period end securities lending -- in period end securities lending collateral levels. Similar to custody and fund administration fees note that lag market values factor into C&IS investor management fees.Securities lending fees were $23 million in the first quarter up 3% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher volumes while sequential increase was primarily driven by higher spreads and volumes. Securities lending collateral was a $167 billion at quarter end and averaged $171 billion across the quarter. Average collateral levels increased 9% year-over-year and 4% sequentially.Moving to our wealth management business; trust, investment, and other servicing fees were $429 million in the first quarter or up 9% compared to the prior quarter and up 1% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was driven by favorable markets and new business while favorable markets were also the driver of the sequential growth. Both month lag and quarter lag asset levels impact wealth management fees. Assets under management were $277 billion quarter end, down 6% year-over-year and down 12% sequentially. The decreases were primarily driven by unfavorable markets partially offset by new business flows.Moving to Page 7, net interest income was $416 million in the first quarter and down 3% from the prior year. Earning assets averaged $111 billion in the quarter flat versus the prior year. Average deposits were $95 billion and we are up 4% versus the prior year. The net interest margin was 1.51% in the first quarter and was down 7 basis points from a year ago. The net interest margin decreased primarily due to lower short term interest rates primarily offset by a balance sheet mix shift. On a sequential quarter basis net interest income was also down 3%. Average earning assets increased 3% on a sequential basis while the net interest margin declined 8% -- 8 basis points. Looking at the currency mix of our balance sheet for the first quarter U.S. dollar deposits represented 69% of our total average deposits. This was flat to a year ago and up slightly from 68% in the prior quarter.Turning to Page 8 expenses were $1.1 billion in the first quarter and were 4% higher than the prior year and 1% lower than the prior quarter. Compensation expense totaled $500 million and was up 4% compared to one year ago and up 8% sequentially. Last year's compensation expense included $10 million relating to severance related charges. Excluding these charges the year-over-year growth was mainly driven by higher salary expense driven by staff growth and base pay adjustments as well as an accrual for supplemental payment to certain employees in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The sequential increase was primarily due to higher expenses related to long-term performance based incentive compensation due to the vesting provisions associated with grants to retirement eligible employees and the current quarter as well as the previously mentioned supplemental payment, partially offset by lower cash based incentive cost. The quarter's compensation included $34 million in expense associated with the retirement eligible staff compared to $30 million in the prior year.Employee benefit expense of $98 million was up 14% from one year ago and 6% sequentially. Both increases were driven by higher retirement plan expenses and payroll taxes. The sequential growth was partially offset by lower medical costs. Outside services of 193 million were up 2% on a year-over-year basis and down 6% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by increased third party advisory fees and technical service costs. The sequential decrease was due to lower consulting, legal, and technical services.Equipment and software expense of $162 million was up 9% from a year ago and down 2% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was reflected by higher -- reflected higher depreciation and amortization and software support costs. Sequentially the decrease was driven by lower software disposition charges partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization. Occupancy expense of $51 million decreasing 1% from a year ago and was down 11% sequentially. The sequential decline was primarily due to the renegotiation of the lease resulting in a $7 million reduction of a related asset retirement obligations.Other operating expense of $62 million was down 15% from a year ago and down 30% sequentially. The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by lower staff related expense partially offset by increased contributions to the Northern Trust charitable foundation. Sequentially the decrease was primarily driven by lower staff related and business promotion expenses partially offset by increased contributions to the charitable foundation. The lower staff related costs were related to a decline in supplemental compensation plan expenses and resulted in a related decline in other operating income.As we've discussed on previous calls to our value for spend initiative which we started in 2017, we've been realigning our expense base with the goal of realizing $250 million in annualized expense run rate savings. With our results this quarter we surpassed that goal. While we have exceeded our goal of $250 million, our efforts around our value for spend and overall productivity were broadly not fees and we further embed a culture of sustainable expense management across the company.Now turning to Page 9 our capital ratios remain strong with our common equity tier one ratio of 11.7% under the standardized approach and 12.9% under the advanced approach. Our tier one leverage ratio was 8.1% under both the standardized and advanced approaches. In the first quarter as previously announced the proceeds from the issuance of Series E preferred stock were used to redeem all outstanding shares of Series C preferred stock. Deferred issuance cost of $11.5 million were recognized upon redemption which were included in our first quarter results on their preferred dividend line and arriving at net income allocated to common shareholders. During the first quarter of 2020 the Series E preferred stock dividend was approximately $7.6 million covering the period from November 5, 2019 through March 31, 2020. The ongoing Series E dividend will be approximately $4.7 million per quarter with the Series E dividend still occurring semiannually in the first and third quarters of each year.Also during the first quarter we declared cash dividends totaling $149 million to common stockholders. On March 16th we announced temporary suspension of repurchases of common stock under our share repurchase program consistent with broader industry efforts to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic by maintaining strong capital levels and liquidity in the U.S. financial system. Prior to the suspension we repurchased 3.2 million shares of common stock at a cost of $297 million.Let me take a -- make a few comments to summarize the quarter as well as comment on some of the headwinds that we're facing as we move through the remainder of 2020. Despite the impact of a mixed global macroeconomic environment we performed well during the quarter generating a pretax margin of 29.4% and a return on average common equity of 13.4%. Our performance reflects the momentum we carried into 2020 and we were able to generate positive key operating leverage and positive total operating leverage on a year-over-year basis. Our balanced business model continued to generate organic growth with each of our client facing reporting segments in wealth management and C&IS contributing approximately 50% of our earnings.Looking ahead to the remainder of the year the macroeconomic environment is going to certainly create headwinds for certain revenue lines. First is as it relates to lower expenses. We will of course see pressure on our net interest margin and net interest income as we move forward through the year. We're currently anticipating that second quarter net interest income will decline 7% to 10% on a sequential basis.Next as I've mentioned in my comments throughout the presentation it's important to remember that lagged markets impact the calculation of our trust fees. While month lag and quarter lag equity markets were mainly favorable for first quarter, we'll see an impact on our fees going forward. One indication of this is our period end assets under custody/administration and assets under management declining sequentially by 10% and 9% respectively. And as a reminder approximately three quarters of our fees are sensitive to asset level.Finally the newly adopted accounting standards for credit losses makes our reserves for credit losses sensitive to changes in the macroeconomic environment. If economic conditions continue to worsen over the course of the year we can expect to recognize additional provisions. We cannot ignore the macro headwinds pressuring our revenues as we move forward into 2020. We remain laser focused on managing our expense base and driving further productivity improvement. It's times like these that show the importance of a strong capital base and liquidity profile to support our clients' activities and we continue to provide our clients with the exceptional service and solution expertise they've come to expect. Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust's first quarter earnings conference call today. Mike, Mark, Lauren and I are happy to answer any of your questions. Katie, will you please open the line. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : Hey, good morning everybody. Thanks for taking the question. So I wanted to start with you guys thoughts around the organic fee growth in the current environment, so I think in the past you talked about low to mid single-digit growth across institutional and wealth businesses so I am wondering how the current sales cycle likely being extended, how's that impacting the fee growth outlook from an organic basis? And as a kind of follow up to that obviously importantly want to get your thoughts on expenses while again similarly you talked about aligning expense growth with organic fee growth again sort of call it 3% to 5% range, how low can you guys take that given the current environment and any thoughts around 2020 expense growth would be helpful? Thanks. Jason J. Tyler: Sure, good morning Alex. Let me start on the first dynamic of organic growth. It was a strong organic growth period and I think both year-over-year and then sequentially it was nice to see we had organic growth both in the C&IS business and used it at a high level. It was a little over 1% of pure net new business that contributed to the growth and C&IS and then we also had overall positive growth from an organic perspective in the wealth management side of the business. And you don't see it but the asset management business on its own also provided some positive organic growth which is nice to see. A lot of it was driven by very strong movement into cash. I was looking every weekend, I think there was over $30 billion in flows overall into that category and our in our NIF treasury fund is number one in its peer group and investment performance. And just that that set of funds alone has AUM of over $60 billion right now.So in a lot of ways things are going well. I think it's also important, just take a second to think about some of the interactions we've had with our business and this I think feeds into your question about how we should think about this in the longer term. And you just take wealth management for example, I was talking to some of the leaders there and just some interesting notes. One, their call report volume, just activity with clients has really skyrocketed. Over 100% increase in call reports just from our central region just gives a sense of the activity there. We do these webinars to teach clients about and talk more from our experts about what's going on. We typically get about 800 or 900 people show up for those virtually and they're at record levels now. There is over 3000 people consistently coming in to that.And then even the marketing material we track things as granularly as the page views that we get from the marketing material we send out. That averages about 1200 page views and over the last several weeks we've been averaging 6000 to 10000. And so I think in the short run it was interesting to see that we were able to actually close good pieces of new business that was already in the pipeline. I think the very long term bodes very well for us given some of the statistics I just threw out, the engagement we've had with clients. I think if there's an area of caution it's going to be in that midterm pipeline. I think there's just not as few clients that are going to be spinning up new opportunities whether it's on the C&IS side, they feel the same way or the wealth side. So I think we're going to close all the business that we can that was already in kind of the one not funded late in the pipeline. And I think the long-term looks very good and we can talk about the more countercyclical dynamics of outsourcing that lead into help on the new business side for C&IS. But the long term feels good. I think the short term we obviously have to be cautious about.And then on expenses I will start but maybe Mike or Mark will join in and as we speak about that we want to bucket it in a few different categories and probably the best way to think about it might even be just to look through if you go to Page 7 of the earnings release that outlines expenses pretty well and in more detail. And first of all we had a long list of different paths we could take on this from just saying let expenses play through to let's go ahead and do a full replan of expenses. And we took the latter approach, we took a very aggressive detailed approach to unwrapping our expenses based on what we knew the environment was going to look like in the short run at least. And so we unbucketed things the way we traditionally do inflation, productivity, business growth, and investments. And we've been very aggressive at outlining where we can address expenses.Now, if you look at Page 7, the areas that are more related to client activity or markets have to do with outside services and equipment and software. And super high level roughly you get kind of 30% to 40% of those have that type -- they have some correlation to markets and new business. Those are the areas we've been laser focused on. But even on an IT investment, we're just re-rationalizing everything that we've committed to do. Michael G. O'Grady: Yeah, this is Mike. I would just add to what Jason said that there are near-term actions that we've already taken and can continue to take, which definitely looks to bring down the expense run rate from where we were in the fourth quarter and then where we are now. And then just given that the world has changed and will change there are new opportunities for productivity over the long term. I mean if you think about real estate costs and other costs that come with having everybody in facilities versus now as I mentioned earlier, we're roughly 90% people working from home. It's not going to stay at that level but I also don't think the operating model will be the same once we get through this. Alex Blostein : Great, great, that's helpful. And I don't want to put words in you guys mouth so maybe just to clarify, I guess in the past you talked about expense growth aligning with organic fee growth and in the near term organic fee growth sounds like it's obviously going to moderate pretty considerably. So should we think about the total expense, business expense, maybe flattish year-over-year or is there a way to bring that down, just hoping to get some more granularity? Michael G. O'Grady: Yes. So you are correct in characterizing the way that we have talked about the organic expense growth rate for expenses, aligning with the fee growth. And so, yes, as that comes down, the fee growth comes down, the organic expense growth rate comes down as well. And then beyond that, as you're saying, Alex, yes we're also saying outside of the organic part, just looking at total expenses, we're trying to bring those down. And I wouldn't put a specific stake in the ground as to whether that's flat or up or down, because again some of those expenses are affected by the environment. But that's what we're trying to drive to. So it is as Jason said, it's a replan. There's no part of this that says, we're just plowing through with the same plan that we had at the beginning of the year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr : Hi. Thanks very much. Wonder if I could ask a question, I could use some both on this on the provision and the loan book. So if you could talk generically what type of economic backdrop you wrote that provision to, because the world was changing a lot right around quarter end? And then if we could talk about the loan book that produced most of that, I'm assuming it's almost all in C&I and CRE so maybe you could talk about what in say office retail and construction, where that is derived from, how much of it is clients that are across the firm versus some things that are syndicated, I really appreciate, we normally don't have much discussion about your loan book? Thanks. Jason J. Tyler: Sure Glenn. Well, let me just start with some of the assumptions that went into the forecast. I think like a lot of firms the SEC is very specific in saying you've got to pick and use your end of period date, use your forecast at that point to drive your increase or decrease in reserves. And so we obviously followed that. If you look right at the end of the period we were looking at unemployment of 10%. We had a peak to trough change in GDP of just over 6% and then as you likely know, that's not it. It's not like we have those assumptions and then it spits out the $61 million provision number. We have a variety, dozens of factors that go from there. And from the number of forecasts that we use, the weights and the priorities of those forecasts, the downgrade assumptions of the underlying credits which drive the expected loss assumptions. And so you go through a very rigorous governance process to take the output of the forecasts and the models to drive to a final number for provision.Now after we did that like all other financial firms, we went through a new forecasting period. The economic inputs in the market were changing dramatically. We're watching that closely. So within the next couple of weeks, we went through a forecast that went to an unemployment peak of 14.5% and peak to trough GDP change of 7.5%. And so that gives an indication that directionally the provision number, if we were to go through that same governance process, would have yielded a higher provision number at that point.Now, that said, we didn't go through that same finalization of the governance process after that second forecast was wrong. We could do that every day. It's a very rigorous process but we followed the letter of what the SEC and what the accounting guidelines provide us to do. And so we will continue to do those updates as we always do with our forecasting process and we'll have that rigorous process added to it as we get into the next reporting period.And then if we want to touch on the logbook itself why don't we go through some headlines and I'll start and then maybe Mark can jump in. I think the key is, there's no dramatic difference between what we've told you before about the loan portfolio and what it is today. There's a lot of other even qualitative assumptions that go into the number that drives the CECIL accounting provision number but why don't we provide a little bit more information, so Mark, I'll turn it over to you for that. Mark Bette : Yeah. Looking at the entire loan portfolio, over 20% of the loans are given to private clients secured by marketable securities primarily. And those are primarily custody of Northern Trust. You do have about 20% of the portfolio which is residential real estate. Again, the nature of those abattoirs is somewhat unique. I mean, for example, over 75% of those would have FICO scores of 740 or higher. When you start to look at the commercial and the commercial real estate, the commercial is predominantly investment grade. And on the commercial real estate side, the lending is to investors as opposed to developers. And over 95% of those commercial real estate loans have personal guarantees as well. So a pretty high quality when we look at the C&I portfolio as far as where the high impact or low impacts might be from the current situation that we find ourselves in. We would say we're very much predominantly in what we would hope is in the lower impact when we look at the kind of industry segmentation there. Glenn Schorr : There's just one tiny clarification, the GDP numbers that you mentioned is that full year 2020 or second quarter? Michael G. O'Grady: Oh, no, that's for the full year. That's the -- that would be the peak to trough change for the full year. So at a high level, the assumption that we used had very sharp second quarter decline and then a relatively strong recovery, but not to the current levels of GDP. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Michael Carrier : Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. First, can you provide a bit more color on the net interest income outlook, particular given the rise in deposits and explications in the backdrop with a lot of liquidity out there, coming in into the NIM, how you're thinking about the portfolio and reinvestment rate? Michael G. O'Grady: Sure. Thanks, Mike. I will start. Well, first of all, the more time we spend around NII I think what jumps out to me is that the key is actually less the size of the balance sheet, which is driven so much by the deposit growth. It has much more to do with what's happening with loan volume. And if you think about it, the size of the balance sheet and the size of average earning assets is going to be dominated by client deposits coming on. And in a different interest rate environment that's going to have an impact on NII. But in the short run, you think about it and on an incremental basis we're not investing those deposits long and we're not investing them with credit risk either. And so the dynamic there is that effectively you're bringing the size is driven by deposits that are going to be reinvested a lot in IOER 10 basis points and maybe something a little somewhat different than that, but not dramatically.The things that are going to drive in, IOER will be really two things; one, the volume of loans and then secondly, we've talked about this before, but the spread of one month LIBOR to the bottom end of Fed funds or IOER very important. It really gives you a sense of the NII impact of a lot of the earning assets and how those are going to behave and contribute to NII. And so those are really the big factors and so I mentioned that because I think it's just important to decouple and not try and predict NII based on where that 151 in NIM is going to go. I think you have to have more of a bottoms up approach of thinking about particularly loans and then what is LIBOR going to do. LIBOR has been coming down a couple basis points a day effectively and where you think that the trajectory there is going to go is a very important factor. Michael Carrier : Okay, that's helpful. And then just as a quick follow up, can you help us just in how we should be thinking about fee waivers ahead and [indiscernible]? Michael G. O'Grady: Yeah, we a lot of the information out there will help track that a little bit, but as we sit today none of the large funds are in a position where their yields are below their fee rates. And if we look out on that a little bit we -- you guys can see as much as we can without a real contrarian approach, you don't see that changing at least in the next several weeks or so. Now, that said, I mentioned early in the opening that our NIF treasury fund is at $60 billion to $70 billion. You get if that 15 to 20 basis points in fees, if we fall below those rates by even 5 basis points, you're talking about annual run rate just from a math perspective of potentially $30 million. And now we're not there yet but if we were to try and point you to something to track in between the time that we're able to talk publicly, those would be the line items to look at. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks very much for taking my questions. Maybe just staying with the balance sheet for a minute on that LIBOR to IOER spread. I guess, down to 7% to 10% down is that considering current LIBOR, one month LIBOR rates were that or are you factoring in LIBOR to compress further with that and if you could just remind us again on the loan repricing mechanism, I think it's three quarters of balloons repriced quarterly to one month LIBOR with the rest lagged for one year, if you could just remind us on that? Jason J. Tyler: Sure. So let's just start with the end. It's actually a little higher than that, it is about 80% of the loan book is actually floating at this point. And that's tied very mostly to LIBOR. And then to what our assumptions are, the down 7% to 10% number we provided is reflective of a tightening of the spread between LIBOR and IOER. And so we've looked at that and continue to think that that's going to compress a decent amount. On a spot basis, I haven't looked at it this morning, but last week it was kind of -- that LIBOR is kind of 70 to 72 basis points against an IOER 10. And then we think that could continue to narrow a fair amount. And if you think about where LIBOR was just a couple of weeks ago it is significantly higher than that and so we certainly feel like that's got to be part of any projection. Brian Bedell : Okay, and deposit levels April versus the period end in the 7% to 10% guidance? Jason J. Tyler: Down. So you will see at the last page of the press release even just where the balance sheet ended at $160 billion or so. And again that's all -- that's the size of the balance sheet is completely driven by the size of client deposits. And there was significant increase throughout the quarter. And frankly, there were increases, significant increases, and we ended not at where it peaked. And so the balance sheet has had very strong growth and clients. It is all about client activity, as clients derisked and came out of larger equity positions or other fixed income positions. They wanted balance sheets that they were comfortable with and they were comfortable with ours and we wanted to be there for them. And since then, we've had deposit levels come down significantly from those peaks and it had been more in kind of the 140 to 145 range. And, in that type of area over the beginning of the second quarter but that's still elevated relative to where we experienced historically and at peaks or at the end of the first quarter. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Hi, thanks, good morning. On the balance sheet, Jason, can you talk through where the floating six mixes of the balance sheet right now, what the duration of the portfolio is and just how do you decide, based on your prior response about the ins and outs of deposits where you're going with reinvestment yield so much lower in terms of the asset side of earning assets distribution? Thanks. Jason J. Tyler: Yes, thank you Ken. Yeah, we are reinvesting sure is the quick answer to the question. And we want to -- we don't feel that this potential that -- that the potential need from clients to have very spiky aggressive needs and desires to be on the balance sheet is necessarily over. And so we want to make sure we've got plenty of dry powder and plenty of capacity for them on both the loans and deposits side. And so we're taking a short term approach of being there for our clients. Now, our duration, I think it is the beginning of last year of 2019 probably it was around 1.1. We had stepped that out. We told the investment community we were going to step it out. We'd gotten all the way out to about 2. And since then, very recently, as we're reinvesting maturing securities that'll come in a little bit as we position the portfolio to maintain maximum capacity. But that is not reflective of a long-term strategy, but it is reflective of our desire to be there for clients in the short run. Ken Usdin : And the fixed floating mix you have that available? Michael G. O'Grady: Yeah. Mark. Mark Bette : Yeah, the split between the shorter securities book and the longer it has been running closer to 50/50 historically. I think more recently the longer book was a little larger. And then, as Jason said, as we reinvest, depending on where those reinvestments go, that can shift a little bit. But in balance a little bit tilted toward the longer side of where it was on average during the quarter. And the funding side we think of is more 50/50 and we try and stay matched on that reflectively on the reinvestment side. I think as we as we continue to go shorter in the near term, that's going to lean a little bit more short. But in the long run, it's about kind of maintaining the hedge. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Mike Mayo : Hi, just my question was answered, but just one follow up. You said 90% of people were working from home, can you elaborate more on what sort of more permanent business model change that might lead to? Michael G. O'Grady: Yeah. Mike, this is this is Mike. I've -- in the way that we've thought about the operating model over time it's never been one that we thought in a stabilized way that we would be at 90% working outside of facilities. You know, frankly, what we've learned through this crisis is that we can meet client needs and be able to operate the business, execute the business even at that high level of remote working. Having said that, this is not the level that we want to sustain. We'll have to be careful as we have people return to the office. That will happen in a phased approach. But frankly, longer term as I mentioned, I think that there are opportunities, because if you even went beyond just the ability to serve our clients and think about efficiency we may have lost some efficiency during this time period.But frankly, it's also I would say demonstrated that there are inefficiencies in having everybody come in and out of the facilities around the globe. And that there is certain work that is easier to have our partners, our employees do remotely. Or even if it's not completely remotely, do they come into a facility for a portion of the week, things like that. And, that also aligns with some of the things we've been doing over time about our workspaces. It's as you would expect, it's not all about everybody having an office or even a cubicle. It's more about open spaces and flexible work spaces and things like that. And that fits in with not having everybody reporting into the office at the same time. So we don't have the complete long-term operating model at this point. But again, I don't believe it'll go back to the way it was. And I think, frankly, it'll present opportunities for both greater efficiency and I think for our employees, additional satisfaction on their overall work-life. Mike Mayo : And as it relates to customers, I mean, you see schools going online, you're seeing Zoom meetings, you're seeing telemedicine. On the other hand, your customers are very high-end, they probably want face to face service. But what's your flexibility there? Michael G. O'Grady: You know, without a doubt and as you point out, we have a high engagement model in wealth management. And yet if you -- if someone thought it was all about the facilities, then we would have been going the opposite direction for the last several years, right. In the sense of we actually have fewer offices now for wealth management than we did five years ago, 10 years ago. And that's because that engagement at the higher level often happens at the client's office, at the client's home. And also through technology, you know, through using video conferencing and just the ability for clients to interact directly with their account online, on their phone, etcetera. So it's a multi-faceted engagement model and one that, again, we think we can differentiate ourselves in this. Jason talked about some of the calling statistics. If you talk to our partners in wealth management, as we said, they've been more engaged over this time period than the three months, let's say prior to it. A lot of that because of all the activity, but also they've used different ways to do it. So we look forward to when we can meet more with clients, but that doesn't necessarily mean it has to happen in an office. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : Hi, good morning. So noted earlier in a question relating to credit that you have lower exposure to the higher risk industry categories. Given some of the stress in energy markets, I was hoping you could speak to any direct exposure to the energy sector, maybe what specific energy categories in particular, such as EMP, Midstream, etc.? Michael G. O'Grady: Yeah. So at a high level, the exposure to energy is very, very low. And a lot of our -- we've got a lot of clients that have garnered their wealth from the industry, but our lending exposure specifically to oil and gas is very, very low. Steven Chubak : Okay, and just one follow-up for me Jason. You gave lots of detail on deposits, just given the significant growth of the bulk of that's being deployed into IOER, if I look at the balance sheet during the prior 3Q cycles now you had a lot of QE driven deposit growth. A lot of those deposits actually stayed on the balance sheet. And your approach was pretty balanced in terms of how much was deployed into securities versus IOER. I'm just wondering why would things play out differently this time and maybe just how you're thinking about the mix where for every incremental deposit how much of that should we assume goes into IOER or versus securities, admittedly are going to be short dated to ensure that you have greater flexibility from a liquidity standpoint? Jason J. Tyler: Well, frankly this is about trying to ensure we're there for clients in the long run. And we could make a short-term call of saying, let's extend a little bit. And even if we miss the yield curve a little we don't have stories from our clients where we weren't there for them. We've been able to do a lot. We've got ample room from a tier one leverage perspective, from liquidity perspectives. But we talk all the time about our balance sheet being there for clients. And so we want to live up to that and not 12 to 10 -- trying to use the deposit to go and go very long. Now, you're absolutely right that there is an element of these deposits. It's going to stick around awhile and that will enable us, particularly the wealth deposits are very valuable. Once those season and are here, it enables us to -- enables us to extend more and invest those more, whether it's in loans or non-high quality liquid assets. And that creates a lot of value for us. We just want to be patient and make sure that we don't do that too early. But, some of the growth that we've had on the deposit side over the last year even not just the last month and a half, but over the last year, there reflects a higher base level of deposits and a lot of it on the wealth side, which is very, very valuable. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. First question is a follow-up on the expenses. So, you talked about some of the actions taken, you helped us understand the pieces that were subject to volumes, and when I take a look at the midpoint of that I think you said it was outside services and equipment itself where 30% to 40%. So if you take the midpoint, that's about 10% your annual expenses. Does that mean that things outside of that bucket of expenses that you're going to be able to calibrate and that 10% we should grow maybe at an elevated rate given some of the things that are going on? Can you help us think about what at least logically might come into play when we try to calibrate how to forecast your expense growth for the year? Jason J. Tyler: Yeah, sure. So if we come back to that framework, that page, I'll give you a little bit more of how I think about the subcategories in there. So the outside services and some of the headlines, some of the things are going to be mixed. Some will be able to moderate lower and some are going to have more activity as we've invested to make sure that we've got good operational resiliency. And so within outside services, for example, a lot of that is consulting and legal costs. Well, on the consulting side there are going to be projects that we had planned to do. We went through our original planning process that don't necessarily change the bar at this point or that we're just going to delay for a period of time or that we're going do with a reduced scope. And so those are the types of conversations we have there.On legal we actually hinted very quickly, I think in the script that we've had some benefits, some things go our way on some on some legal matters. And so that's part of the benefit that we've had in there. If you think about equipment software. That's an interesting line item because even within there, there are items that will go both ways. We've also invested more heavily in infrastructure there. But at the same time, that's where there are some capital IT projects that we might not do. And then there's also an overlay on both of these where we have to think about what's related to the core business either from an assets perspective or just client activity. Things like market data, third party advisory fees, sub custody, brokerage clearing, those are some of those line items that will add up to that kind of roughly 30% to 40% number that we are thinking about.And then in occupancy, just to refresh your memory on some of the things we've talked about, we had already been in late stages of some larger transitions and investments, and we talked about the fact that in the short run we might have some overlap in rent and investment. And we think that's going to peak around second quarter and then we should get the benefit of that more in the second half of the year. Brennan Hawken : Okay, that helps. Thank you. And when you think about I think you mentioned, the legal benefits that you've been receiving in some of these lines. Could you help us maybe calibrate how much that helped 1Q if we should think about any of that, I would think legal benefits are somewhat episodic, but is that the right way to think about it or is there some sustainability to those benefits, I mean any noise calibration would also be helpful? Thanks. Mark Bette : Yeah Brenan, this is Mark. I mean I would start with the outside services category. You do get consulting and legal as two expenses that I would say will fluctuate based on engagements. So, when you look at in general how much they make up of the category, it's actually a fairly small percentage. It's just that they can be volatile from quarter to quarter or so. They might make up, 15% to 20% of the expenses even that of the category. But they do based on timing of engagements, they'll go will go favorable or they might pop up in a given quarter. I would say this quarter was one where the engagements were lower and there was some benefit in the expense that we realized. But I don't know that I would necessarily portray it as a trend, but, contractor expenses and things like that that go into things like consulting certainly that's something that can be an area that we can focus on managing. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay, thanks for taking my questions. I am hearing what you are saying about the NII being down in the second quarter, but how do you think about it then after the second quarter, is there a period time that the liabilities will catch up on the re-pricing side and kind of how we think about deposit betas moving forward? Michael G. O'Grady: Well, I think that there's two competing factors there. One is our desire in the short run to make sure that we're maximizing loan capacity effectively for our clients. I think to put in the longer run this base of business, this base of deposits that's more core we'll be able to invest in a better way. The counter to that is that the duration that we built in the portfolio will start to dissipate. And so the more we're reinvesting of the portfolio that we had coming into this year, the more we're going to experience the impact of lower nominal rates. And even so -- even if we're taking longer duration and even if we're extending the portfolio from a reinvestment perspective, we'll be doing so with a lower interest rate environment. And so those competing factors will operate. I think it's up to everybody to have their own determinations of what they think the interest rate environment is going to look like in the intermediate term. Brian Kleinhanzl : And then just a second question on the custody and fund admin fees. Is there any way to tease out what the pickup in activity meant for fees in the quarter, like comparing fourth quarter to first quarter, I know some clients are priced based on activity levels? Thanks. Mark Bette : Brian, its Mark. So I would say that when you look at the sequential performance for custody and fund services, there was a -- there was some market benefit. Again, there's month lag and quarter lag fees. There are more month lag than quarter lag and actually the EAFE local was slightly negative on a month lag sequential basis. So there was a little bit of market pick up but there was also, to Jason's point earlier about the 1% sequential kind of organic 1%ish organic growth. We usually look at organic on year-over-year but sequentially that's probably in the right range, a little more than that. There was a drag from currency. So that's kind of -- those are the largest factors. There's also some other non asset level fees that were a little bit down sequentially on things like account level fees and things like that. But, so overall kind of balanced out to flattish, I would say. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Great, thanks for taking my follow-up. Just wanted to just go over that pricing on the custody business and the wealth management business. I know the mix has changed over time because you've been servicing more people on the administrative basis, particularly an alternative, and that's created a little bit more of an averaging mix than it used to be historically. But if you could just review within the C&IS asset servicing business what portion of that book is priced on a quarter end lag versus more of an averaging basis? And then just staying within wealth management, a portion of that is priced on that one month lag, I think the custody part of that you don't manage in wealth management I think that's a prior quarter lag I'm thinking, so I mean if you're able to just review that price? Mark Bette : Yeah. Brian, this is Mark. So, yeah, it's pretty similar to what we've said before. So with custody and fund administration first and this is in C&IS there's about 35% to 40% of fees that are not asset value sensitive. So that's the first part. Well the fees that are asset value sensitive so the remaining 60%, about three quarters of those are month lag and a quarter of them are quarter lag, which is similar to what we would have updated a year ago. I think last time we had a change in markets when we gave that update. Then remember as far as the asset sensitive, it's not all equity exposure because we have an allocation across multiple asset classes. When you get to the wealth management side, I would probably divide it between the regions and the global family office. The global family office business you're right there is a -- that is probably more leaning toward the quarter lag. It's similar to the asset servicing business in C&IS. And there's also about a quarter of those fees that aren't asset sensitive, more like what you see on the asset servicing side of C&IS. And the regions, and I would combine the regions together, then you're looking at about three quarters or more of those fees being month lag. So hopefully that gives you an idea. Not a significant change, though, from what we've said before there. Brian Bedell : Okay, yeah, that's perfect. And just -- I just missed the comment on the GDP assumption that you had for the credit provision if you could just reiterate that? Mark Bette : Sure. So the baseline that we went with for the March 31st for the reporting cycle had peak to trough down a little over 6%, 6.1%. And then the update subsequent to that is it is down 7.5%. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Michael G. O'Grady: Good morning Betsy. Betsy Graseck : I had two questions, one, just on the comments that you made earlier in the call around the medium term caution in the pipeline. Could you just give us a sense as to the drivers of that and how long you think that -- what your view of medium term is? And then maybe you could give us a sense as to this is really just a push out, not an evaporation so maybe you could speak to how that comes back into your run rate as things open up? Michael G. O'Grady: Sure Betsy, it's Mike. I'll add on to what Jason said earlier. So if you think about the flow of new business, there's business that we've won and it's a matter of transitioning that business on. And one of the things that again, I want to give credit to our team on is the fact that even in the month of March with everything that happened we were able to transition the majority of the business that was scheduled to be transitioned. So in that sense, that's why we say, right now that will look good. Having said that, there are new mandates that were to transition in April, for example, or May or June, that it's not only that we're in, I'll call it the work from home mode, but that the clients are as well. And so they've said, let's move our transition back further. So they're deferred transitions.So when Jason talked about in the medium term, that would be new business that would come on for example, in the second or the third quarter, that now has been moved back. And then if you then also think about what's happening with the client base certainly winning new clients is new business for us but it's also the flow activity that they have, whether that's an institutional client and what they're doing with their funds, are they more in a spending mode, if you will, utilizing mode if they're a sovereign wealth fund that's being impacted by the environment. Or if they're an asset manager, or are they part of the market that is a net gainer of flows or a net outflow. And that, of course, then will impact us as well.And then the last piece is just, well, what about new business activity where you're in the process of winning? Yes, there's some slowdown in I would say mandate type decisions, but also with a lot of activity like this we do see plenty of our clients that are saying we've been talking about outsourcing for some time period, whether that's the whole middle office or that's trading. You know what, now that we've gone through this time period, we can see that you're in a better position to do that for us than for us to do it on our own. So let's continue that dialogue and then we can figure out when we'll decide to do it. And hopefully do it with us as well. And so that happens. That's why we say longer term we see a lot of opportunities, but that's not going to impact the third to fourth quarter of this year. Betsy Graseck : Right, so the medium term and the push out of the pipeline install is really a function of when you can get back into clients offices, which is a little bit TBD, but it's a push out, not an evaporation? Michael G. O'Grady: Correct. Betsy Graseck : And then could you speak a little bit to how you're thinking about the buyback, I know that you stopped them, but you obviously have a significant amount of capital. I'm just wondering how you're thinking about what the triggers will be for you to restart that? Michael G. O'Grady: Betsy, it's Mike again. So with regard to capital management and specifically share repurchases, as you know, there's been a tremendous amount of attention and rigor around capital management going back to the financial crisis. So in that sense, I would say, we feel very good about the process around capital management and how we think about capital actions and the stress testing that we do, etcetera. And the reality is that, now we're in an actual stress. And so it is an opportunity to be able to demonstrate that we can execute then on our capital actions the way that we thought of when we were going through various stress scenarios.So being able to pull the lever on share repurchase like we did and say tremendous amount of uncertainty, we can stop that very easily. That's the benefit of share repurchases. And we said for the foreseeable future and that's just because the environment can change and there are many factors that go into it, as you know. But looking at our capital levels, looking at the profitability levels, the stress test, the results with the Fed, all of that plays into the Board's decision on how they think about capital action. So just as it was easy, I would say, to pull the lever to stop share repurchases, technically, it's very easy to push the lever the other direction. It's more just being able to assess the environment and the outlook at the time to be able to determine when that's appropriate. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning. I'd like to probably work on the credit comments. Northern Trust is obviously very well regarded when it comes to credit. You guys have done a phenomenal job in the last 20 years. It was interesting in 2001 there was exposure to Enron, which surprised everybody that Norman would have that kind of credit. And what we discovered was this part of the employment benefits, processing that he did for Enron, you were asked to join the revolving line, that they did at the time. Are there any of those outside situations today that we just wouldn't expect Northern to have a credit exposure to? I'm not asking for specific names, but just X, Y, Z, companies like, wow, how did that happen. Is there any event on the books today versus what it was no one. Michael G. O'Grady: Well, I appreciate the historical perspective on that. Going back to 2001 and I would say as far as the nature of how we think about credit, it's still very similar. I mean, it's aligned with our overall business and with holistic relationships. So that has not changed. And specifically to clients where we are the custodian for their pension plan, we often then are participating in their credit facilities. Now, when you look at that portfolio companies, it still goes through a very rigorous credit process. And so it's a very high quality set of companies as well and high quality set of credits. There's no way that we can necessarily predict which sectors are going to be impacted by a particular stress scenario. And so we wouldn't make that type of statement to say and we have no exposures to any sectors that are troubled right now. Certainly we do. But all of that we tried to manage the size of the exposures for that. And that's just -- you've just identified one area which is on the corporate side. Certainly we work with asset managers, so we're providing credit to the different types of asset managers. And then on the wealth side, the nature of where wealth is developed and so that can either be the companies that are owned by families, but also the individual credit needs. As Mark mentioned, about 20% of our portfolio overall is basically margin lending. It's collateralized by their investment portfolio. And so that would reflect the nature of that credit needs for that part of the client base. Gerard Cassidy : Mike, thank you very much. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Hey, thanks for taking my follow-ups. Just quickly on fee waivers, could you give us a breakdown of your money fund AUM mix in between prime, govi, and muni? Michael G. O'Grady: Not sure if I have it as handy. Why don't we\u2026 Jason J. Tyler: We can follow-up later Brennan because it's [Multiple Speakers] Northern Funds, Northern Institutional Funds website. But we could follow up with that Brennan. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : Thanks for accommodating the follow up. I just want to make sure it's a quick modeling question. The other income line, there was a lot of noise this quarter as we think about the right jumping off point for 2Q given with some of the BOLI tailwinds, how should we be thinking about the appropriate run rate beginning in the second quarter? Michael G. O'Grady: Sure. Even I can try to take that. So it is a hard one because there is a lot that moves around within that category. I guess one way that I've kind of talked about, I think even on the last call we kind of talked about it. Certainly you have BOLI that has come in incrementally in each of the last four quarters with this quarter being about 13 million. So if you took BOLI out, as well as some of the things that we've had, like last quarter, we had a lease loss of 20.8 million if you adjust taking BOLI out the last four quarters and adjust for the things we've called out and you kind of did the math, you're probably looking at an average run rate of call it 33 million to 34 million. And then in theory, you could then say, okay, well let me add the full run rate of BOLI in and add 13 million to that. So maybe that gets you to the 45-47 range. I would just caution though, it is a very -- there is volatility in that line. So it's a hard one. There's things like currency hedging that flows through that that line. We've talked about some of the things that this quarter, some of the marks might flow through that line. The Visa related income expense type of swap marks flow through that line as well. So it certainly does move around. But if you looked at it over a longer period, you could use that potentially as kind of an average run rate. Operator : Thank you. Jason J. Tyler: Right, and really quick, I might save Mark a follow up call because I do have the AUM breakout. So cash AUM at about $235 billion at period end. Fixed income about $150 billion and I am going to lump index and active equity at about 425 and then call the rest other and leave it there. Operator : Thank you ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's Q&A and teleconference. Thank you for joining us. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Mark Bette, for opening remarks and introductions. Please go ahead. Mark Bette : Thank you, Jennifer. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Northern Trust Corporation\u2019s second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Joining me on our call this morning are Michael O\u2019Grady, our Chairman and CEO; Jason Tyler, our Chief Financial Officer; Lauren Allnutt, our Controller; and Kelly Lernihan from our Investor Relations team. Our second quarter earnings press release and financial trends report are both available on our website at northerntrust.com. Also on our website, you will find our quarterly earnings review presentation, which we will use to guide today\u2019s conference call. This July 22 call is being webcast live on northerntrust.com. The only authorized rebroadcast of this call is a replay that will be available on our website through August 19. Northern Trust disclaims any continuing accuracy of the information provided in this call after today. Now for our safe harbor statement. What we say during today\u2019s conference call may include forward-looking statements, which are Northern Trust\u2019s current estimates and expectations of future events or future results. Actual results, of course, could differ materially from those expressed or implied by these statements because the realization of those results is subject to many risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. I urge you to read our 2019 annual report on Form 10-K and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for detailed information about factors that could affect actual results. [Operator Instructions] Thank you again for joining us today. Let me turn the call over to Michael O\u2019Grady. Michael O\u2019Grady: Thank you, Mark. Let me join Mark in welcoming you to our second quarter 2020 earnings call. As the current public health crisis continues, I hope you and your families are healthy and well. And I offer my condolences to all who have suffered a personal loss. At Northern Trust, we remained focused on safeguarding our employees, serving our clients and supporting our communities during these unprecedented times. We continue to operate in what we call, resiliency mode, which means we are focused on providing continuity of service for our clients, while over 90% of our employees are working remotely. Although we have developed plans to position ourselves to return to our offices when conditions permit, we will only do so in a particular geography when we are comfortable and confident in our ability to ensure a safe environment for all of our employees and clients. As a result, we expect to remain in resiliency mode for some time to come. In this operating environment, we have adapted how we serve and communicate with our clients, as well as how we prospect for new clients. In each of our businesses, this has resulted in engaging with clients and prospects more than ever and provides an opportunity for us to deepen our relationships. In the second quarter, our Asset Management business won several new mandates across different products and strategies, including receiving significant new inflows into our global money market fund complex, which we\u2019ve strategically positioned over time. In wealth management, we launched a new Navigate the Now digital marketing campaign, which is showing early promise and introduced the Northern Trust Institute, a research center with 175 faculty, covering 34 specialty areas designed to harness our expertise and experience and elevate our advice by bringing predictive insights to our clients. In asset servicing, we experienced a modest deferral implementations and new fund launches in the quarter. However, new business continues to be healthy, as prospects become more comfortable conducting searches and due diligence virtually in the current environment. As Jason will discuss, the low interest rate environment will continue to create meaningful headwinds and pressure our financial performance. Through this environment, we will stay focused on our mission of being our clients\u2019 most trusted financial partner and on generating organic growth and gains in productivity. I feel it\u2019s also important to note that at Northern Trust, we have always been mindful that we have a duty to serve our communities as well. Recent attention to the civil, social and economic inequities Black Americans face every day has provided us with an opportunity to reflect further on the service and the role we play to address inequity in our communities. Toward this end, we have committed $20 million over the next five years to reduce the economic opportunity gap. This opportunity gap encompasses all the obstacles created by race, ethnicity, gender, environmental and socioeconomic status that too often keep people from achieving their full potential. Our goal is to help shrink this gap by providing increased access to essential human needs, food, housing, healthcare and education, so that each person may grow and thrive personally, professionally and financially. Finally, I want to express my sincere appreciation for our staff whose commitment, excellence and professionalism throughout these extraordinary times has been exceptional. Now let me turn the call to Jason to review our financial results for the quarter. Jason Tyler : Thank you, Mike. Before I start, I\u2019d also like to take a brief moment to recognize all those affected by this ongoing crisis, especially those working on the front lines. Our thoughts are with you and we hope you and your loved ones remain safe and healthy. The health crisis and cultural issues we\u2019re facing evoke both deep sadness, but also hope and optimism of what we can be. I\u2019d also like to express sincere gratitude to all the Northern Trust partners for their continuing hard work, resiliency and flexibility in these uncertain times. I\u2019m extremely proud to be part of this team that achieves greater for all of our stakeholders no matter the adversity. Now let\u2019s dive into the financial results for the quarter starting on Page 2. This morning, we reported second quarter net income of $313 million. Earnings per share were $1.46 per share and our return on average common equity was 12.2%. As you can see on the bottom of Page 2, the macroeconomic environment was mixed during the quarter. While equity markets performed well during the quarter, recall that a significant portion of our trust fees are based on quarter lag or month lag asset levels, and thus, the current quarter\u2019s fees were unfavorably impacted by the lagged market performance. Interest rates have, of course, declined significantly with one-month and three-month LIBOR rates down sequentially as well as versus the prior year. Let\u2019s move to Page 3 and review the financial highlights of the second quarter. Year-over-year, revenue on an FTE basis was flat with noninterest income up 4% and net interest income down 11%. Expenses increased 3%. The provision for credit losses was $66 million in the current quarter. Net income was down 20%. In a sequential comparison, revenue declined 5%, with noninterest income down 4% and net interest income down 9%. Expenses decreased 3%. Net income declined 13%. The provision for credit losses of $66 million during the quarter was primarily due to an increase in the reserve evaluated on a collective basis, driven by downgrades in the portfolio and more severe projected economic conditions. The largest increases are within the commercial and institutional and commercial real estate portfolios. Underlying credit metrics remained strong during the quarter with net recoveries of $2.6 million and a 6% decline in nonaccrual assets, which totaled $99.4 million at quarter end. Return on average common equity was 12.2% for the quarter, down from 15.9% a year ago, and 13.4% in the prior quarter. Assets under custody administration of $12.1 trillion, grew 7% from a year ago and increased 11% on a sequential basis. Assets under custody of $9.3 trillion, grew 9% from a year ago and increased 13% on a sequential basis. Assets under management were $1.3 trillion, up 7% from a year ago and up 12% on a sequential basis. Let\u2019s look at the results in greater detail, starting with revenue on Page 4. Second quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $1.5 billion flat compared to last year and down 5% sequentially. Trust, investment and other servicing fees representing the largest component of our revenue, totaled $961 million and were up 1% from last year and down 4% sequentially. Foreign exchange trading income was $71 million in the quarter, up 18% year-over-year and down 20% sequentially. The increase compared to a year ago was driven by higher volatility and increased volumes, while the sequential decline was mainly due to lower volumes. Remaining components of other noninterest income totaled $102 million in the quarter, up 38% compared to one year ago and up 16% sequentially. Securities commissions and trading income increased 41% compared to a year ago and was down 21% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was driven by success within our integrated trading solutions product, as well as higher referral fees and interest rate swap. The sequential decline was driven by lower interest rate swap activity in core brokerage. Other operating income increased 46% compared to the prior year and 64% sequentially. Both increases were impacted by higher income associated with supplemental compensation plans and a higher market value adjustment for seed capital investment, partially offset by higher visa swap expense. The year-over-year performance also benefited from income related to a bank owned life insurance program that was implemented during 2019. The higher income on the supplemental compensation plans resulted in a related increase in staff related expense within other operating expenses. Net interest income, which I\u2019ll discuss in more detail later, was $380 million in the second quarter down 11% from one year ago and down 9% sequentially. Let\u2019s look at components of our trust, investment fees on Page 5. For our corporate and institutional services business, fees totaled $566 million in the second quarter and were up 3% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees were $376 million, and down 2% year-over-year and down 5% on a sequential basis. The year-over-year performance was primarily driven by unfavorable lagged markets and currency translation, partially offset by new business and transaction fees. The sequential decline was primarily driven by unfavorable lagged markets, as well as the decline from currency translation, partially offset by new business and transaction fees. Assets under custody administration for C&IS clients were $11.3 trillion at quarter end, up 7% year-over-year and up 11% sequentially. The year-over-year performance reflected new business and favorable market impact, partially upset by unfavorable currency translation. The sequential performance was driven by higher market levels, new business and unfavorable currency translation. Recall that lagged market values factor into the quarter\u2019s fees. With both quarter lag and month lag markets impacting our C&IS custody and fund administration fees. Investment management fees in C&IS of $128 million in the second quarter were up 16% year-over-year and up 6% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential performance was driven by strong flows within our money market fund. Assets under management for C&IS clients were $954 billion, up 8% year-over-year and up 13% sequentially. Both the prior year and sequential comparisons were impacted by strong flows as well as higher markets during the quarter. Similar to custody and fund administration fees, note that lagged market values factor into C&IS investment management fees. Securities lending fees were $27 million during the quarter, up 25% year-over-year and up 17% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher spreads and slightly higher volumes. While the sequential increase was primarily driven by higher spreads, particularly in the beginning of the quarter. Securities lending collateral was $166 billion at quarter end and averaged $167 billion across the quarter. Average collateral levels increased 2% year-over-year and were down 2% sequentially. Moving to our Wealth Management business. Trust, investment and other servicing fees were $395 million in the second quarter and were down 3% compared to the prior year quarter and down 8% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential performance were impacted by unfavorable lagged market. For the year-over-year comparison, new business partially offset the market decline. Both market lag and quarter lag asset levels impact wealth management fees. Assets under management for our wealth management clients were $304 billion at quarter end, up 4% year-over-year and up 10% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was driven by net flows, while the sequential increase was driven by favorable markets and net flow. Moving to Page 6. Net interest income was $380 million in the second quarter and down 11% from the prior year. Earning assets averaged $125 billion in the quarter, up 18% versus the prior year. Average deposits were $111 billion and were up 24% versus the prior year. The net interest margin was 1.22% in the quarter and was down 39 basis points from a year ago. The net interest margin decreased primarily due to lower short-term interest rates as well as mix shift within the balance sheet. On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income was down 9%. Average earning assets increased 13% on a sequential basis. The growth in the balance sheet was driven by a 17% sequential increase in average deposits. The net interest margin declined 29 basis points driven by the impact of lower rates, as well as mix shift within the balance sheet. Looking at the currency mix of our balance sheet for the quarter, U.S. dollar deposits represented 71% of our total average deposits, this was up from 67% one year ago and up 69% in prior quarter. As we look at the third quarter, the impact of lower rates, particularly LIBOR, will be more fully reflected in our run rate. Both one month and three month LIBOR has come down significantly from their second quarter averages. Based on our current view of the balance sheet volume and LIBOR levels continuing at the current levels, we expect third quarter net interest income to be down 13% to 16% on a sequential basis. Turning to Page 7. Expenses were $1 billion in the second quarter, and were 3% higher than the prior year and 3% lower than the prior quarter. Compensation expense totaled $460 million and was up 1% compared to one year ago and down 8% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was driven by higher salary expense due to staff growth and base pay adjustments, partially offset by lower cash based incentive accruals and lower long-term performance based equity incentive. The sequential decline was primarily driven by lower costs associated with long-term performance based incentive compensation due to the divesting provisions associated with grants to retirement-eligible employees in the prior quarter, as well as lower cash-based incentive accruals partially offset by higher salaries, driven by base pay adjustment. Employee benefit expense of $90 million is up 1% from one year ago and down 8% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential comparisons were impacted by lower payroll taxes and lower medical costs. The year-over-year comparison was impacted by higher retirement costs relating to pension expense. Outside services costs of $176 million were down 5% on a year-over-year basis and down 9% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was driven by lower costs across a number of categories, including data processing, third-party advisor fees, consulting and sub custodian fees, partially offset by higher technical services. The sequential decline was primarily due to lower technical services costs and third-party advisor fees. Equipment and software expense of $164 million was up 12% from one year ago and up 1% sequentially. The year-over-year growth reflected higher depreciation and amortization and software support costs. The sequential increase was driven by modest increases in software and equipment rental, support and maintenance costs. Occupancy expense of $60 million increased 18% from a year ago and was up 17% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was driven by higher rent and the building operation costs related to our workplace real estate strategies. The sequential increase was primarily related to a $7 million reduction recorded in the prior quarter, resulting from a lease renegotiation. Other operating expense of $86 million was up 12% from one year ago and up 39% sequentially. Both of the increases were driven by higher staff related expenses and higher charges associated with account servicing activities, partially offset by lower business promotional expenses due to reduced business travel. The higher staff related costs were related to an increase in supplemental compensation plan expenses and resulted in a related increase in other operating income. Turning to Page 8. Our capital ratios remain strong with our common equity Tier 1 ratio of 13.4% under the standardized approach and 13.9% on the advanced approach. The second quarter increase in the common equity Tier 1 ratio was driven in large part by a decline in risk-weighted assets as financial market condition stabilized versus Q1. Additionally, the absence of share repurchases allowed further capital accretion from net income and other comprehensive income from the investment securities portfolio. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 7.6% under both standardized and advanced approaches. During the second quarter, we declared cash dividends of $0.70 per share, totaling $148 million to common stockholders. As announced yesterday, our Board of Directors approved our third quarter dividend of $0.70 per common share. As a result of the stress test published by the Federal Reserve at the end of June, our stress capital buffer requirement for the 2020 capital plan cycle was set at 2.5%. The 2020 stress capital buffer is effective October 1, 2020, and results in a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio minimum requirement of 7%. It\u2019s times like these that show the importance of a strong capital base and liquidity profile to support our clients\u2019 activities, and we continue to provide our clients with the exceptional service and solution expertise they come to expect. Our competitive positioning in wealth management, asset management and asset servicing continues to resonate well in the marketplace. Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust\u2019s second quarter earnings conference call today. Mike, Mark, Lauren and I would be happy to answer your questions. Jennifer, will you please open the line? Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go first to Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, my first question is related to money market funds. I\u2019m curious if you guys can give us your latest thoughts on outlook for money market fee waivers. It doesn\u2019t look like there\u2019s really anything in the quarter so far, but clearly, rates have come down quite meaningfully. So to frame it, maybe as we think about the current prevailing market rate and second quarter money market fund balances, if you were to kind of go through the repricing mechanism, can you give us a sense what the few areas could be as we look out over the next few quarters? Michael O\u2019Grady: Sure, Alex. So first of all, you\u2019re right, the quarter doesn\u2019t have a lot. And so let me give you a couple of facts, and then I\u2019ll get to what the outlook could look like. So first of all, in second quarter, waivers were less than $0.5 million. As we think about the current run rate as we sit today, we\u2019re about $2.5 million a quarter. That said, we\u2019re going to start to see this ramp a little bit as the portfolio gets repriced. And so as we look out to the end of fourth quarter and even into next year, assuming rates stay the way they are today, we could see waivers getting in the $20 million to $30 million a quarter range. Now those are the facts. I also want to just provide a little bit of kind of significant framework to your question about how people should think about it. We\u2019ve got a lot of growth in the money market fund business, obviously. We talked about that earlier. And even if you look at the treasury fund, that\u2019s among the top three in size and investment returns in the universe. It\u2019s grown from \u2013 it was at $55 billion at year-end, and it\u2019s about $90 billion today overall. Overall, the complex has about 30 funds, and they totaled $275 billion to $300 billion in aggregate. That whole complex is geared towards the very institutional and high net worth client base. That\u2019s very important to realize because it means the pricing on average is lower than a retail complex. That complex of funds has a fee rate ranging, in general, think about 15 to 20 basis points. There are exceptions on either side, but that\u2019s where the bulk of the assets are. If I take those 30 funds and boil it down to the ones that are most likely to have waivers, there\u2019s really a handful or half a dozen funds that have both large AUM but also have yields that are within 10 to 15 basis points of the fees. Those handful of funds total $125 billion, plus or minus. The gross yield on those funds is about 30 basis points, and the stated fee on them, probably 20 basis points. Now each one of those strategies is different in expected yields and fees. And so that\u2019s just a high level guide to give you a sense of how the overall complex might come into fee waiver mode as they reprice the portfolio. But that\u2019s all given two caveats : one, the existing yield curve stays the way it is; and secondly, there are times when we will do promotional pricing in some of those funds. The analysis I just went through with you excludes that. This is purely waivers based on yield curve coming down. Alex Blostein : Great. That\u2019s a super helpful remark. Thanks. And just I guess to clarify, the $20 million to $30 million that you mentioned, that\u2019s a gross revenue impact. Are there any expense offset that are kind of more directly related to that before you guys think in any action from an expense perspective that we should be mindful as well? Or the revenue impact is pretty much the pretax impact? Michael O\u2019Grady: Super minor. Super minor. You should really think about that, that gross impact is being pretty full. Alex Blostein : Great. Second question around NIR, and again, I appreciate the guidance for the third quarter. Given the short-term nature of Northern\u2019s balance sheet, I\u2019m just curious to think about how the trajectory could evolve from there. So if most of the repricing can be done sort of in Q3, so that should really be pretty close to trough NIR for the business? Or you guys think there is incremental pressure beyond that? Thanks. Jason Tyler : Sure. So on provision in general, actually, let me give a couple of numbers, and then I actually think it\u2019d be helpful to provide a sense of kind of the process because I think that\u2019s important. The good and bad of CECL is that it\u2019s a very forward-looking mechanism. And so let\u2019s try to separate the credit results from the most factual to the ones that are more forecast dependent. So let\u2019s start on the factual side. And on the extreme, you\u2019d just say, we\u2019re going to look at charge-offs. And we had $2.6 million in net recovery in the quarter, so charge-offs were actually benefited $2.6 million. If you come in from that spectrum, the next thing you\u2019d look at from a quantitative-only factor basis would be what a nonperformings look like. And even there, nonperformings were down $4 million in the quarter, and they currently are less than $100 million on a 35 \u2013 $30 billion, $35 billion loan portfolio, so it\u2019s just 30 basis points of loans. And then next, even look at delinquencies and delinquencies in the period were actually down. And so all of the factors that are most quantitative-only are all in very good shape. But then you start to look further down the spectrum, what are the qualitative-related factors? And what drove our increase in provision, in our overall provision for the quarter were really two big factors : one, downgrades in the portfolio, that added about $40 million to the reserve; and then secondly, the macro scenarios, which added $20 million to $25 million. And so all of the increase that we\u2019ve had is related to more of these qualitative factors. And even the downgrades, our instances where our credit team is looking and trying to be forward-looking about organizations, industries dynamics that they think are going to reflect credit quality. So those \u2013 that\u2019s a background on how the provision number wound up. But Lauren, you spend a lot of time with them, why don\u2019t you give 30 seconds on governance and process. Lauren Allnutt : Sure, Jason. Thanks. The provision methodology goes through a very robust governance process, which builds on the best practices that we\u2019ve developed and other internal forecasting exercises. Governance covers everything from the data that is used to the validation of models, to the forecast of functions, to the ultimate provision output. There are many levels of review and challenge throughout the quarterly process with participation from multiple disciplines around the company such as economic research, credit risk, treasury, foreign exchange controllers and expertise of our business units. So we\u2019ve fortunately had ample opportunity to pressure test this process over the last two quarters, and we feel confident that the governance is robust, and produces a reserve that is not only well supported but also responsive to the change in economic environment. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good morning, Jason. A question on net interest income. So understanding the reset of LIBOR into the third quarter and the guidance that you gave, can you give us a sense of whether or not third quarter gets it towards stabilization of NII? And how \u2013 if rates hold similar from here, do you have any thoughts on how third to fourth would look? Thanks. Jason Tyler : Sure. We have looked at that, frankly, closely. And the answer is it does get us very, very close to flattening out. And yes. So let me \u2013 I\u2019ll just provide a couple of thoughts to give you a little bit more color on that guide. If we take the $380 million that we announced and the 13% to 16% down, it gives you kind of a $50 million to $60 million down. I think it\u2019s important for people to realize how much LIBOR has come down. In first quarter, it averaged 1.39%; in April, it was 69 basis points; in May, it was 19 basis points; in June, it averaged 18 basis points, so really flattening out. And as of today, it\u2019s kind of at that 18 basis point level as we sit mid-July. And so it\u2019s very much flattened out at 18. But then you got to compare that to what the average was across second quarter. And the average across second quarter was 36 basis points. And so you just think about a loan portfolio of $33 billion, $35 billion, we\u2019re assuming some of that comes out. And we\u2019ve already seen \u2013 you can see from the average that\u2019s in the release and the period end. And I can tell you, today, we\u2019re sitting just under $34 billion in loans. And so if we come down a little bit more, we might see $2 billion, $2.5 billion, maybe $3 billion in loan decline. You take an 18 point \u2013 18 basis point differential between second quarter and third quarter on that, and that, in and of itself, is going to get you over $10 million in the $50 million decline. And then you start to look at just the impact of volume coming down 10% rates, in itself, again, 10%. And then \u2013 so just in the loan book, you\u2019d end up with $20 billion \u2013 $20 million in decline. And then you got to look at the securities book, and there, it\u2019s \u2013 you got $50 billion to $55 billion in securities that are repricing. And the dynamic here that you\u2019re getting at is that a lot of the repricing is actually starting to happen now. We\u2019re experiencing it now, and we expect it less going forward. And so we think third quarter is going to be the significant decline, and then we should start to see very, very much a level off, maybe not 100%, but very close to fully leveled off going forward from there. Ken Usdin : Okay. Thanks for that color. And on the expense side, with the decline in NII and then the fee waivers coming, that\u2019s a lot of kind of high-margin revenues that won\u2019t be around next year on a run rate basis. You guys have done a good job getting the cost growth rate down to 3%. But how do you think about the dynamic, not so much in operating leverage, but just about absolute cost levels and cost growth, and what levers are there to pull? How you\u2019re thinking about that as well? Thank you. Jason Tyler : Sure. So maybe looking at Page 7 of the release, to kind of \u2013 it\u2019s where I always go to just think about how things are kind of moving. And if you look at that, first of all, you get a sense into your point, things have, on an aggregate level, leveled off at 3%. I will say, in general, as you know, we went through a very full replan that stripped out, call it, around $50 million in expenses, just to be open about it. And some of that was predictable from the macro environment, but some of it wasn\u2019t. We then went through a full capital investment replan. And then finally, just this past week, we reviewed with our board a strategic replan, a strategic plan replan. And so we\u2019re taking this environment extremely seriously. And the value for spend, we hit it. The $250 million target was reached, but the foundations of that are far from over. We\u2019re talking about it all the time. It\u2019s very much embedded culturally. And if you were here, I think you\u2019d get a sense that the priorities here around first in this resiliency mode that Mike talked about, it\u2019s safety to resilience and preparation in support of clients. And then third, the expense discipline. So you look at Page 7 of the release and it details the NIE and you can see how a lot of these line items have flattened out. Even comp, which is down a lot, you take out the equity incentives from first quarter, offset by base pay adjustment, that line item flattening. And employee benefits, you see across the board, some leveling in these areas. And all I can say is, at this point, just laser focus on it. Value for spend has not stopped, and we understand that in this environment, organic revenue growth is going to be \u2013 it\u2019s going to be hard. It\u2019s \u2013 money in motion is less. There are less RFPs that are going to be tossed into the environment. And so we have to ensure we\u2019re focusing on a laser-like fashion on expenses. Ken Usdin : Got it. Thanks. Jason Tyler : Sure. Operator : We\u2019ll go to the next to Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Mike Carrier : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I mean just on the \u2013 given the COVID environment and the work from home, just trying to get some color on the impact that it\u2019s having on client activity. Obviously, transactional activity is strong. But more in terms of new business, you mean if you\u2019re seeing significant delays or the pipeline is still building and it\u2019s just like kind of prolonged implementations. Just trying to get a sense on how much of the drag the environment is creating on the new business? Jason Tyler : Sure. And maybe I\u2019ll start with a couple of headlines and then it\u2019d be really good to hear from Mike on this. So clearly, on \u2013 if I just split it on the wealth side, lost business is down. And I think that\u2019s really important to realize. Not that it was ever large, but it just gives a reflection that everything we\u2019ve done, engagement we\u2019ve had with clients has cemented relationships. They\u2019re doing weekly online client events that are called Insights. Goals-driven wealth management is a great technology to be able to engage with clients, very customized approach in live time, on video and it\u2019s going well. If I give just one anecdotal advice, I was talking to the head of our central region last night, and he was talking about this ultra-high net worth client that has a split relationship with us and one other institution. They had a session with him to explore how to take advantage of low market values and low interest rates. They worked a very complex but unique wealth transfer opportunity, with his kids and grandchildren. He executed it, he was thrilled. He\u2019s consolidated his whole relationship now at Northern because he feels like we\u2019re the trusted adviser and he wants us to have a better lens into this whole financial picture. And then on the C&IS side, we mentioned really early, even things like integrated trading solutions starting to come on board. Pete Cherecwich talked about 10 onboardings, 10 new wins just in that environment. And so some good news there, but also some caution about what the future holds in terms of RFPs. Mike? Michael O\u2019Grady: Sure. I would just add to it that if you start with a question of whether there\u2019s still a need for the service and what we do and the demand for it, frankly, that\u2019s not only there, but in many respects, has gone up in this environment. So there\u2019s pressure on every company and institution that\u2019s out there. And so just as we talked about, how can we become more efficient? How do we rethink our operating model? Well, our clients are doing the same thing and then often presents opportunities for us, primarily around things like outsourced services, whether it\u2019s on the trading front or it\u2019s in the middle office. So the demand is there for the services. And then second, I would say, a static analysis would tell you that the environment changes, but the way that we or our clients and prospects go about things don\u2019t change. But the fact of the matter is people adapt. And so in the same way that we at Northern went from doing things in person and then maybe conference calls, now as you know, everything\u2019s is on video. And in the same way with the search process, the RFP process, the due diligence process, these activities have moved online or in something like virtual so that they can continue. So as much as it\u2019s a different environment and it presents new challenges, I would say that we\u2019ve changed the prospect and client base has changed. And as a result, it\u2019s just a different set of opportunities. Mike Carrier : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just as a follow-up. Just given your strong capital position and then some clarity on the restructure with the SCB. Once the macro backdrop does get better and the industry has more flexibility and clarity, how are you guys thinking about capital management, including maybe CET1 internal or management minimum or buffer? Maybe investing in new growth areas and capital return? Jason Tyler : Sure. Well, we always take our capital levels, not just as a single topic, but we think about it in conjunction with the \u2013 with our overall engagement strategy, our approach to the market. And so we want to ensure that as we look across peers. That\u2019s one lens to make sure we look good on that basis. And then we also are talking \u2013 thinking about the regulatory environment and the optics of what to do there. And then we have very meaningful engagement with our Board of Directors and about what we should do from a capital perspective. And I think even this past several months just give an indication that coming into an environment like what we experienced with strong capital levels, it helps us not just in the short run, but it provides really good illustration for clients and prospects of what a strong balance sheet means for us as we compete in the market. Mike Carrier : Okay. Thank you all. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Jim Mitchell : Good morning. Maybe just a quick follow-up on your thoughts on deposit trends so far in the quarter. I hear your sort of NII guide overall, but maybe you can help us more specifically on the balance sheet. It seems like deposits have been sticking and how you think about the prospects for growth in a zero rate environment. Jason Tyler : Yes. So first of all, on that, you\u2019re right. Deposits are sticking. And I don\u2019t think I mentioned it earlier, but even post close of the period, deposits are sticking at the same level. So if you look at our balance sheet and add the interest-bearing deposits plus the DDA, still, you\u2019d see us somewhere in the $110 million range. And $110 million, $120 million, we\u2019re still actually at that level. Now that\u2019s, in some ways, a good news, and that drives the size of the balance sheet, for sure. That determines how we\u2019re going to end the quarter at $151 billion. It has much less of an impact on NII and NIM. On the margin, as we have that incremental dollar coming in, it\u2019s often going to go into IOER at the fed at 10 basis points or even if it\u2019s in another currency, it\u2019s going to go to a central bank deposit with not a lot on it. And that\u2019s why I keep coming back to trying to encourage people to look at and start to predict what\u2019s going to happen with loan volume and rate. And super importantly, the info, the mini walk forward I went through earlier, is super dependent on rates being the way they are today. Everything we\u2019re talking about is now. We were predicting, accurately, a decline in LIBOR, as we said 90 days ago. At this point, we\u2019re assuming that LIBOR is flat from here. And it has leveled out, hopefully, it doesn\u2019t compress relative to fed funds. If that happens, things have changed, but the deposits will absolutely impact the size of the balance sheet, much less of an impact on NIM and NII. Jim Mitchell : Okay. Makes sense. And then maybe just a question on wealth. I know that\u2019s an area that you guys have been targeting for accelerating organic growth. I think if you look at this quarter, the market impact, it was hard to kind of see a lot of organic growth there. I guess, maybe just give us an update on how that effort could kind of accelerate growth in wealth is working. Maybe it\u2019s being slowed by COVID. That\u2019s it, just curious. Jason Tyler : Well, to start, we tend to look at organic growth on a year-over-year basis and much less on a quarter-to-quarter basis just because it\u2019s such a tight time frame on close cycles that happen over a longer period of time. And secondly, to your point, within wealth, specifically, the theme I\u2019d want you to take away is with the GFO businesses continuing to be the driver of growth there and the regions are growing less quickly, and over short periods of time, might even show areas of decline, nothing that we\u2019re worried about from a strategic perspective. But within wealth, GFO is certainly the area that\u2019s continuing to grow more. Jim Mitchell : Okay. Thanks. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : All right, great. Thanks, good morning folks. Maybe just a lot of color on the net interest rates, so I appreciate that, Jason. Just one question on that for the loan yield repricing. I know they\u2019ve mostly, I believe, repriced to one-month LIBOR predominantly and most of them repriced, I think, within a quarter. But if I recall, some you repriced with a lag of, I think, it\u2019s three to four quarters. But if you could just talk about that and whether we could see some repricing down the road based on that, if that\u2019s true? Jason Tyler : Yes. In general, you think about that portfolio is about 70%, 75% floating and against either 30-day LIBOR, 90-day LIBOR or prime. And you mentioned yield at the beginning, which is something I, actually, I\u2019m not sure I mentioned earlier, but I think it might be helpful because I would imagine you guys are going to try and predict \u2013 to dissect the balance sheet. Think about a yield in that component of the balance sheet very roughly around 200 basis points. And so as we \u2013 as you think about the impact of converting, if we do have a decline in loans, and we see loan volume coming down. And you think on that, if that has to be reinvested in IOER, think about that type of difference in yield. Brian Bedell : Yes, that\u2019s helpful. This is great. Jason Tyler : That\u2019s why this dynamic of looking at loan volume is so important because the conversion of $1 of loans to the alternative investment is significant. Brian Bedell : Right, right. That makes total sense. And then maybe just walk through some of the \u2013 I don\u2019t want to call them one-off items, but things that influence both other operating income and other operating expenses? Just trying to get a sense of what a more normal run rate is for those two. Instead of comparing on a year-over-year quarter or sequential quarter growth basis, maybe just on sort of an absolute basis of what drove those two line items, the $56.5 million and the $85.8 million on the other expenses. Jason Tyler : Yes. Well, I\u2019ll do the \u2013 maybe I\u2019ll do the expense side. Mark, maybe you can do the revenue side. But on the other operating expense side, we\u2019ve got the supplemental comp there. And then we\u2019ve also got \u2013 when we have account servicing losses, that\u2019s where that line item shows up. And then business promotion, travel entertainment. Those are the big buckets I think about for other operating expense. Mark, do you want to do the other side? Mark Bette : Yes. Brian, this is Mark. One thing to keep in mind is in the first quarter, if we talk about other operating income, we had a negative drag from the seed investment\u2019s mark-to-market that kind of came back this quarter. Similarly with the supplemental compensation plans that impact both income and expense, a negative last quarter because of the mark, a pretty significant positive this quarter. So one way again, and I think we\u2019ve talked about this a little bit. And one way you can almost average, look at the first and second quarter on other operating income more as an average. But you do have other things like hedging and Visa-related things that happened there. But if you were to look at the average over time, and I think we \u2013 it kind of holds true, you\u2019re about in the mid-40s, now that the BOLI program that we put in place is at a full run rate as of the first quarter and continues that in the second quarter. If you stripped out the items we\u2019ve called out over time and looked at the average, you\u2019re probably more in the mid-40s, which is actually close to what the year-to-date average for the other operating income would be as well. Brian Bedell : And the seed capital positive, Mark, was how much in the quarter? Jason Tyler : $8 million. Mark Bette : Yes, $8 million. Brian Bedell : $8 million. And then just lastly on the outside services. I forgot to ask on that 1Q on that line item. Anything one-time in there? Or basically, from a run rate basis, I guess, given we had this drop from 1Q to 2Q? Michael O\u2019Grady: I wouldn\u2019t necessarily call out anything one-time. That line will move around. Certainly, I think some of the drag impacts we saw on the revenue side that are a little bit lagged, that benefit us on outside services to a certain extent this quarter. So I don\u2019t know that I would look at this quarter as a run rate. And Jason, I don\u2019t know if you would add anything to that. But nothing one-time necessarily to call out, but certainly, there were some things that went our way with the revenue-linked lines, data, third-party adviser fees. Jason Tyler : Yes, nothing to add. Operator : We go next to Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Good morning, thanks for taking the question. I actually just wanted to follow-up a little on that because the outside services expense line looked a little funky. It seems like what you\u2019re saying is that the run rate, this is not the right run rate. We should instead \u2013 does that mean we should instead look at like the average of the past four quarters? And can you give a little bit more color on some of the drivers of the downside to the quarter? It said like third-party advisory fees, is that what you meant, Mark, when you said the lag effect as in there was a lag to the rally there? Mark Bette : Right, right. I mean, there\u2019s a few things that we had \u2013 some of the market data costs that we had were down. Again, some of that ends up being timing, some of our data processing costs. We had \u2013 consulting expense was down during the quarter. So it\u2019s hard to \u2013 it was a pretty favorable quarter there. It\u2019s just hard to pin down that, that\u2019s the new run rate going forward because those will have some fluctuations to them, certainly consulting based on timing of engagements, et cetera. Brennan Hawken : Okay. And then, when we\u2019re thinking about investing services, investment services and the strength there, can you parse that out a little bit? Was that timing too? Or was there something more sustainable propping that? Mark Bette : You\u2019re asking about the increase in investment management revenue in C&IS? Brennan Hawken : Yes. Jason Tyler : Yes. So this is an important dynamic. I think it really has added, I think, to the base of business. And so first of all, I hinted earlier, the treasury funds, but in that business, it\u2019s not just that we\u2019ve had flows in. The asset management business has done a lot over the last five years to position the business for growth in the liquidity front. And first of all, invest most \u2013 everything starts and ends with investment performance. And their investment performance has been in top five over the last several months. Secondly, size. And clients there want to ensure that they\u2019re investing in a fund that\u2019s got large size to it. So they don\u2019t represent a high percentage, they feel better about the liquidity. Fund, the treasury fund size is $90 billion. They worked on cutoff times to ensure they are more competitive. They hired a dedicated distribution team. They launched a portal, and that\u2019s up to almost $10 billion in assets and a decent amount of that is with Northern product. And then they reapproached the third-party portals to ensure when treasurers are looking at opportunities to park cash, we look very appealing. And so if you think about the increase that we\u2019ve had there, the treasury and focusing a lot on the treasury fund because that\u2019s where a lot of the growth has happened. But based in the last quarter, it has been $39 billion, $40 billion in growth into those strategies, about $34 billion of it was on the institutional side. And those funds are 15 to 20 basis points, and so very, very meaningful. And now the flip side to it is, those are part of that watch list that I referenced earlier that could be part of fee waivers. And so we\u2019re trying to maintain humility about what that might look like. But the very good news is that the base of business there has increased significantly. Brennan Hawken : Okay. And thanks for predicting my follow-up about the fee waiver, so I appreciate that. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Good morning. Can you hear me? Okay. Thanks. I had two questions. First, on deposits. I think average deposits in the quarter was up somewhere in the teens, but end of the period was down. I know you just traditionally say, like typically say, don\u2019t look at end of period. But wanted to understand how we should think about deposit growth over the next quarter, at least? If not, we\u2019ll further out if we could talk about the drivers of what the deposit growth has been seem to be fading. So I would think it slows down, but would like to get your understanding of that. Jason Tyler : Yes. So you\u2019re right. We were kind of in the teens, in the one teens and it\u2019s held in there and we watch it on a daily basis, and we\u2019re still seeing deposits at around that level. And so often, we\u2019ll see a significant decline from quarter end. And certainly saw some come down, but have seen it level off around that level. We are still anticipating that over time, our clients will look to put some of that money to work in more risk on trades. And I\u2019ll come back to what I mentioned earlier that it is important to watch, to the extent you\u2019re trying to predict the size of the balance sheet, but those deposits, particularly that layer that we think is not necessarily as sticky. It doesn\u2019t have as much of an impact on NII or NIM. Betsy Graseck : And what percentage of the deposits, is that, in your opinion, that\u2019s not as sticky? Jason Tyler : That\u2019s really hard to tell. I mean it\u2019s \u2013 and you go back to maybe the beginning of the year, and we saw client deposits in the mid-$80-some billions. And so an absolute worst-case scenario, you could take the delta there, but a lot of our clients are clearly exhibiting more stability and stickiness at least thus far. Betsy Graseck : Yes. Because the stickier, the more operational, you can take duration with that. So I guess I\u2019m wondering how much of the deposit inflow that you\u2019ve gotten over the past quarter or so has been deemed operational and put into duration versus over the next quarter or two? Would there be incremental opportunity to extend duration with deposits if they stick around more than expected? Jason Tyler : Some of that determination of whether they\u2019re operational or not is actually a time test. And we talk about those deposits having to season. And so it\u2019s \u2013 we can\u2019t make a prediction or determination absent just time. But you\u2019re right in that at a point, we can start to lag out on those or go into non-HQLA and think about term and credit and achieve more at that point. We did talk on the last call about the fact that we wanted to be patient about doing that to ensure we weren\u2019t in a situation where we couldn\u2019t be there for clients, particularly if loan demand increased significantly. Betsy Graseck : And what kind of time test is it? Like is it three months? Six months? Is that something you can share with us? Jason Tyler : It depends on \u2013 it\u2019s different tests. And also, their test is different if it\u2019s a retail deposit versus if it\u2019s institutional. And so\u2026 Betsy Graseck : Yes. So there\u2019s a range depending on which type? Jason Tyler : And even within the institutional side, the type of depositor also influences the categorization of it. And then on the wealth side, the size. So there\u2019s a lot of different factors that go into it. It\u2019s not a single test just based on time. Betsy Graseck : But should my takeaway be there is opportunity to extend duration if deposits meet the time test as we go into 3Q and 4Q? Or not? Jason Tyler : Yes, there\u2019s opportunity there. I certainly wouldn\u2019t think about it as the $110 million minus $85 million, that volume level. But there would be some opportunity to identify situations where we would want to extend more. Betsy Graseck : And then just my other follow-up question is regarding just agency RMBS. When I think about the securities book and where spreads could compress further, agency RMBS kind of goes to the top of the list because we recently got to, I think historically it was in the mortgage rates. So I\u2019m wondering what \u2013 how much did agency RMBS yields compression impact your second quarter results? How much do you think it is \u2013 how much is it contributing to the outlook you have for third quarter NII decline? Just to get a sense of that would be helpful. Jason Tyler : I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ve done that level of detail about the exposure and yield in that book. So I wouldn\u2019t want to comment on it. Michael O\u2019Grady: Yes. Betsy Graseck : Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr : Thanks very much. Hello, there. Okay. So I obviously hear loud and clear on your comments all around net interest income, little loan demand and low yields in the public markets. But \u2013 and you\u2019re not alone there, but many investors, whether you be pension funds or wealth funds, insurance companies, they\u2019ve looked to the private credit markets for a source of yield. You might have to give up some liquidity, but not necessarily taking on worst credit. You\u2019re probably the most conservative management team I\u2019ve ever met, but curious if you\u2019d put thought into the private credit markets. Jason Tyler : Yes. We look at a very broad range of asset classes that we consider for investment. And at this point, there\u2019s such a focus on ensuring that we are there for clients. We\u2019re not just \u2013 we\u2019re not taking incremental risk because the yield curve has come down. And I think that\u2019s the prevailing theme, as we said and think from an investment strategy perspective. That said, we\u2019re constantly thinking about risk and return and also the categorization of the different asset classes and whether they\u2019re HQLA, non-HQLA, Level 1, 2 and trying to come up with a mosaic of thinking about and evaluating those opportunities on a risk and regulatory adjusted basis. But at this point, we want to make sure we\u2019re not looking to grab yield just because the yield curve has come down. Glenn Schorr : Okay. Just a quick follow-up. You mentioned the growth in tech lending, and we could see that still up year-on-year, quarter-on-quarter. You mentioned spread as being a big impact. Some of the spreads there have come in. Can you talk maybe about an exit rate or a forward thought on tech lending for both spreads and volumes as we look forward from second quarter? Jason Tyler : Yes. I mean it\u2019s interesting. You\u2019re right. I mean at the beginning of the quarter, the spreads were much wider. And frankly, volumes weren\u2019t great. And then as we got later in the quarter, the spread started to thin, but volume came back, I think, as clients felt more comfortable. And so it\u2019s a tricky dynamic to triangulate, and I think the volumes and the spreads are actually correlated. And so it\u2019s hard to give a sense right now of where that ends up landing. Mark, I don\u2019t know if you have other thoughts on it. Mark Bette : One thing you can look at is three month LIBOR versus overnight. And if you plotted that out, you would certainly see that, like we\u2019ve been saying earlier in the quarter, particularly early April was a significant benefit there. And then we\u2019re exiting the quarter in certainly at a much tighter spread there. So that would be one way to look at it, Glenn. Jason Tyler : And our view is LIBOR, really since May and June, both 30 and 90-day LIBOR has flattened out. Glenn Schorr : Okay. Thank you for all that. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research. Rob Wildhack : Good morning, guys. A little bit more of a big picture question. I think back to the fourth quarter earnings call when you talked about a demand for increased scalability from some of your larger clients. And I was hoping you could give us an update on your efforts there and what you\u2019ve done and are doing to kind of meet that demand. Michael O\u2019Grady: Sure. It\u2019s Mike. I\u2019ll take that. Absolutely, a critical objective for our business, I\u2019ll say, overall, but particularly within asset servicing. And so we are, I\u2019ll say, battling out every day to make sure we can provide continuity of service for our clients, as Jason and Mark have gone through here and trying to navigate the financial environment. But at the same time, we are looking forward two, three, four, five years ahead with the business model, trying to determine how can we not only take care of clients and what their needs are. But build in more productivity into the business model. And as you have highlighted, that\u2019s going to be through scalability, particularly in asset servicing. And on that front, we\u2019ve made investments that have begun to change the nature of the way that, that business will operate. And what I mean by that is primarily our investments have been in what we\u2019re calling Matrix, our Matrix platform, which essentially is a data-driven architecture that essentially takes all of the data in through one place, if you will, ensures that, that is clean, accurate data, if you will. And then from there, we\u2019re able to utilize it in multiple platform for multiple services. And it also shifts the service model to one that right now requires a fair number of employees to provide that service to a model where there\u2019s more either automation and how things happen and how they\u2019re processed. But also and self-service in a way that is a positive from a client satisfaction perspective, that they don\u2019t need to call in or fax in or e-mail in a transaction or order or anything like that, but rather they can put it in and it gets processed essentially straight through. So that improves both the efficiency of what we\u2019re doing, the scalability, because we can put more business on it, but also the accuracy and consistency and reliability of how we process. So we\u2019re pretty optimistic on that. We have rolled out two releases over the last several months here despite the environment, so that continues to progress. Rob Wildhack : Thanks, Mike. Just quickly, the integration you announced with BlackRock and Aladdin, would you bucket that as part of that scalability goal? And then I know it\u2019s early, but any sense for how clients are responding to the partnership so far? Michael O\u2019Grady: Yes. Broadly speaking, I absolutely would put that in the same \u2013 it\u2019s part of the same strategy because what we\u2019re doing with BlackRock in that case is essentially further integration with Aladdin provider. And in which case, by being more directly connected, it provides greater efficiency. So what\u2019s happening between our platforms, if you will, in Aladdin is directly linked, in which case, you get the same types of benefits that I just talked about there. Rob Wildhack : Great. Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Vivek Juneja : Thanks for taking my question. A quick one, which is just an update on the Northern Trust open. Given the environment, should we expect a similar kind of increase as you\u2019ve guided to in the past? Any color on that? And then I have a bigger picture question. Jason Tyler : Headlines won\u2019t see a significant decline relative to prior years. And we typically see $16 million, $17 million sequential increase in business promo as we look into the quarter, a few thoughts on it. One, the tournament is going to be players only, as you know. Secondly, we don\u2019t give any specific cost about the tournament, but people what should know most is the costs associated with the tournament are about television and the expenses related to tournament production, and those actually aren\u2019t going to come down significantly. And so \u2013 and then the reality is the television ratings for PGA have actually been very, very good. And so there will be modest savings as we think about reduction in travel and entertainment and some other things, but the reduction won\u2019t be meaningful. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Shifting gears to a bigger picture question. As I look at over the last year, your \u2013 and if you look forward, if you think about your mix of asset servicing clients, what does that look like by type of client? Pension fund versus long-only versus insurance versus hedge funds and what levels? What is that mix? And what is the change you\u2019ve seen over the past year or two? And what do you expect to see? Michael O\u2019Grady: So I\u2019ll take it. And I\u2019m going to do this, Vivek, without a specific breakdown with the numbers and percentages of our client base because I don\u2019t have it in front of me. But generally speaking, over the last several years, and that would continue through last year. The proportion of our business that is coming from asset managers as opposed to asset owners has gone up. That\u2019s been a combination of just the business strategy over time, but also because the demands of asset managers for our types of services have been growing at a higher rate, from a market perspective. And then also, as you know, we\u2019re taking share as we continue to expand that business, both geographically, but also within particular segments. So geographically, if you think about what we did in Luxembourg and Switzerland, that primarily is going to drive business with asset managers. And then Switzerland is a mix between asset managers and asset owners. So that\u2019s where our focus has been, and that\u2019s where the greater growth has come from. The thing I would say about the asset owner side and subsegments within that, it really does vary with what\u2019s happening across the globe, just broader macro factors because as you would expect, things like sovereign wealth funds, and governments, we\u2019re working with them. Their needs to deploy investments into the economy changes over time versus their ability to invest those. And it\u2019s when they\u2019re invested globally that we see higher asset levels from them. And it\u2019s when they deploy them into the economy that they\u2019ll reduce those levels. So it\u2019s just a higher level of variability. And I would just add, sorry Vivek, one other thing. And then in the U.S., where the asset owners are largely pension funds, that dynamic, it\u2019s more of a share game than it is a market growth game. And so there, again, we\u2019ve been able to pick up share, but you\u2019re doing it in a slower growing market. Vivek Juneja : Mike, any plans to break this kind of data out at least once a year in the 10-K or something to give us a sense of where you\u2019re growing, et cetera? And provide a little more granularity? Michael O\u2019Grady: Vivek, that\u2019s definitely something we can take on to consider because, obviously, it\u2019s something that we track closely, thus we can do it in a reliable way. It\u2019s something we\u2019ll consider. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We go next to Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Thanks for taking the follow-up. Just wanted to come back to expenses in the second half. Some of those were answered with the hope open. But typically, we do see that seasonal increase in the second half in outside services and certainly, equipment and software expense. I just wanted to check in and see if you still think that\u2019s the case? Obviously, with the COVID environment, that could be fluid this time around. But I just wanted to sort of check in on that, especially since we saw the downtick in outside services in the second quarter. Jason Tyler : A couple of things : one, you\u2019re right in that there are some \u2013 there\u2019s some bounciness. So on one hand, there\u2019s COVID-related expenses that are impacting things a lot. We\u2019ve got investments to make there. Some of that will come through in capital, but some of it will come through the income statement as we\u2019ve spent decently at this point and continuing to ensure that in a resiliency mode, we\u2019re doing everything we can to make sure we\u2019re there for clients. Secondly, we want to make sure that we\u2019re investing appropriately and in a disciplined way, particularly around things like technology and some of that will show up in outside services, some of it shows up in equipment and software, but some of it will show up in outside services. And so this is \u2013 we\u2019ve got a high bar for where we\u2019re investing, but the traditional view of what expense ramps look like in the third and fourth quarter, I think, are going to be less reliable. It\u2019s much more about what do we think is necessary to ensure resiliency and our strategy of being there for clients. Brian Bedell : Okay. That\u2019s good color. And then just lastly, just on the provisioning. And thanks for the all the color on that. You talked about some internal downgrades across the book. I guess, just as we go into the second half as well, if we do have a situation where there\u2019s a second wave of COVID-19, that\u2019s \u2013 hopefully not, but worse than people are expecting, is that a significant part of your credit assessment, even if you think the credit qualities are relatively good, but nevertheless could drive higher provisioning in the second half? Jason Tyler : We run multiple macro scenarios, and some of those scenarios will incorporate that type of worsening, a W type as opposed to a V. And so as things approach, we play with the weights of those factors, and that has heavy influence on what the output is, and so we monitor that closely. If things worsen significantly, just like what we experienced last quarter, frankly, things worsened from the end of March to the beginning of April. And this time, we haven\u2019t seen that type of dynamic shift between the end of the quarter and the time we\u2019re talking to you. But there\u2019s so much time between now and then. We\u2019re reliant on what those macro forecasts look like, and they\u2019ll always have influence, particularly in the CECL environment on what provision looks like. Brian Bedell : Okay, great. Thanks for the all color. I appreciate it. Operator : And at this time, there are no further questions. Mark Bette : Thanks, everyone. Stay safe, and we look forward to talking to you about the third quarter. Operator : This does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank you for your participation.",

A quick reminder that today's program is being recorded. And at this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to Mr. Mark Bette, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Mark Bette : Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone and welcome to Northern Trust Corporation's third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Joining me on our call this morning are Mike O\u2019Grady, our Chairman and CEO; Jason Tyler, our Chief Financial Officer; Lauren Allnutt, our Controller; and Kelly Lernihan, from our Investor Relations team. Our third quarter earnings press release and financial trends report are both available on our website at northerntrust.com. Also on our website, you will find our quarterly earnings review presentation, which we will use to guide today's conference call. This October 21 call is being webcast live on northerntrust.com. The only authorized rebroadcast of this call is the replay that will be made available on our website through November 18. Northern Trust disclaims any continuing accuracy of the information provided in this call after today. Now for our Safe Harbor statement. What we say during today's conference call may include forward-looking statements, which are Northern Trust's current estimates and expectations of future events or future results. Actual results, of course, could differ materially from those expressed or implied by these statements because the realization of those results is subject to many risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict.

During today's question-and-answer session please limit your initial query to one question and one related follow-up. This will allow us to move through the queue and enable as many people as possible the opportunity to ask questions as time permits. Thank you again for joining us today. Let me turn the call over to Mike O\u2019Grady. Mike O\u2019Grady: Thank you, Mark. Let me join and welcome you to our third quarter 2020 earnings call. Amid the ongoing public health crisis, I hope you and your families are healthy and well. In Northern Trust, we continue to operate in what we call resiliency mode, which means we're focused on providing our clients continuity of service, while over 90% of our employees worldwide are working remotely. In this environment, we have adapted to a new normal as to how we serve and communicate with our clients. Though challenging, the transition across each of our businesses has been effective. Within Wealth Management, earlier this year we introduced the Northern Trust Institute, the embodiment of the intellectual capital of our Wealth Management business drawn from our experience serving the most affluent individuals and families in the world. It combines and integrates the best thinking of our firm across 34 practices, including areas such as investments, fiduciary, banking, planning, family business, philanthropy and governance. We have also published a number of insights and research pieces covering timely topics in the current environment, including family governance, philanthropy, commercial real estate, investing and the upcoming U.S. election. Lastly, we've been very encouraged by the client and prospect participation in our digital Navigate the Now campaign, which is driving more engagement. Our asset management business is seeing considerable market share gains during 2020 within our liquidity products, which have strategically been positioned over time. We've also experienced recent success in our active and index fixed income and tax-advantaged equity products. We manage nearly $100 billion in assets globally under ESG mandates where our strong capabilities position us for future growth in this space. Within asset servicing, as we've mentioned previously, we did see a deferral in implementation activity from the end of the first quarter and into the most recent quarter. However, the pipeline is strong and opportunities have increased as clients and prospects have adapted and become more comfortable operating in the current virtual environment. Recent notable public wins, include Treehouse Capital management and Federated Mutual Insurance Company in the U.S. Marks & Spencer Pension Trust in the UK, Hannover Re, a European-based insurer and Azimut Limited for its funds in the Middle East. We continually developed our solution-based services to support the needs of our clients with two recent examples being enhancements to our ESG analytics capabilities to support our clients' oversight, risk and exposures and the launch of dynamic valuation and reporting tools for asset owners using our innovative front office solutions product. We also continue to build our positioning in the outsourcing space most notably in outsourced foreign exchange and trade execution. Finally, we just recently published our latest corporate social responsibility report detailing our progress towards reducing our greenhouse gas emissions, enhancing our diversity equity and inclusion strategy and launching client-focused ESG tools and investment vehicles, as I previously mentioned. As we move forward in the current and persistent low interest rate environment, we will accelerate our focus in two areas. First, we will continue to drive greater efficiencies with a focus on technology solutions to drive productivity gains. Second from a growth perspective, we're focused on doing more with our existing client base and also bringing on new clients to allow us to continue to grow organically in a scalable profitable manner. Finally, I want to express my sincere appreciation for our staff. Whose commitment, expertise and professionalism throughout these extraordinary times has been exceptional. Now, let me turn the call to Jason to review our financial results for the quarter. Jason Tyler : Thank you, Mike. Let me join Mark and Mike in welcoming you to our third quarter 2020 earnings call. Before I start I would also like to take a brief moment to recognize all those affected by this ongoing crisis especially those working on the front lines. Our thoughts are with you and we hope you and your loved ones remain safe and healthy. Now let's dive into the financial results for the quarter starting on Page 2. This morning we reported third quarter net income of $294.5 million. Earnings per share were $1.32 a share and our return on average common equity was 10.5%. The quarter included a $43.4 million pretax charge related to a corporate action processing error. The issue was identified internally by our corporate actions team and to put the impacted clients in the same position as they would have been if the error had not occurred. We executed open market transactions which resulted in the loss. You can see on the bottom of Page 2 equity markets particularly domestic U.S. markets performed well during the quarter. Recall that a significant portion of our trust fees are based on quarter lag or month lag asset levels. And both the S&P 500 and EFA local had strong sequential performance-based on those calculations. It's worth noting that on a year-over-year basis the EFA local index remains negative which creates an unfavorable impact to our fees compared to the prior year. As shown on this page average one-month and three-month LIBOR rates continued to decline during the quarter. Let's move on to Page 3 and review the financial highlights of the third quarter. Year-over-year revenue was down 3% with non-interest income up 3% and net interest income down 21%. Expenses increased 6%. The provision for credit losses was $500,000 in the current quarter net income was down 23%. In a sequential comparison revenue declined 1% with non-interest income up 2% and net interest income down 11.4%. Expenses increased 6% and net income declined 6%. Return on average common equity was 10.5% for the quarter down from 14.9% a year ago and 12.2% in the prior quarter. Assets under custody and administration $13.1 trillion grew 13% from a year ago and increased 8% on a sequential basis. Assets under custody of $10.1 trillion grew 16% from a year ago and increased 9% on a sequential basis. Assets under management were $1.3 trillion, up 9% from a year ago and up 4% on a sequential basis. Let's look at the results in greater detail starting with revenue on Page 4. Third quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $1.5 billion down 3% compared to last year and down 1% sequentially. Trust investment and other servicing fees representing the largest component of our revenue totaled $1 billion and were up 3% from last year and 4% sequentially. Foreign exchange trading income was $62 million in the quarter up 3% year-over-year and down 14% sequentially. The increase compared to a year ago was primarily driven by higher volatility while the sequential decline was impacted by lower volumes and lower volatility. The remaining components of non-interest income totaled $91 million in the quarter up 7% compared to one year ago and down 10% sequentially. Securities commissions and trading income decreased 10% compared to a year ago and was down 22% sequentially. Both year-over-year and sequential declines were primarily due to lower interest rate swap activity and with royalties. Other operating income increased 19% compared to the prior year and was down 5% sequentially. The increase compared to the prior year was driven by higher income related to a bank-owned life insurance program, as well as higher miscellaneous income primarily associated with the market value increase in the supplemental compensation plan. This higher income resulted in a related increase within the other operating expenses. The sequential performance was impacted by a lower market value adjustment for seed capital investment relative to the prior quarter partially offset by lower visa swap expense. Net interest income which I'll discuss in more detail later was $336 million in the third quarter down 21% from a year ago and down 11.4% sequentially. Let's look at components of our trust and investment fees on Page 5. For our corporate and institutional services business fees totaled $585 million in the third quarter and were up 4% year-over-year and up 3% sequentially. Custody and fund administration fees the largest component of C&IS fees were $395 million and up 1% year-over-year and up 5% on a sequential basis. The year-over-year performance was primarily driven by favorable currency translation and new business partially offset by unfavorable markets. The sequential increase was primarily driven by favorable currency translation as well as favorable markets. Assets under custody and administration for C&IS clients were $12.3 trillion at quarter end up 13% year-over-year and up 8% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential increases were attributable to new business favorable markets and favorable currency translation. Investment management fees in C&IS of $137 million in the third quarter were up 19% year-over-year and up 7% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by strong flows within our money market funds. The sequential increase is primarily driven by the impact of favorable markets. This quarter's results included $0.9 million in money market fund fee waivers within our C&IS investment management fees. Assets under management for C&IS were $993 billion, up 10% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. The growth from the prior year was driven by favorable markets, client flows and favorable currency translation. The sequential growth was driven by favorable markets and currency translation. Securities lending fees were $20 million in the quarter, down 2% year-over-year and down 28% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was primarily driven by lower spreads and lower volumes, while the sequential decline was primarily driven by lower spreads. Average collateral levels declined 5% year-over-year, but were up 1% sequentially. Moving to our Wealth Management business. Trust, investment and other servicing fees were $419 million in the third quarter and were up 1% compared to the prior year and up 6% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential performance were impacted by favorable markets, partially offset by money market fund fee waivers. Within our Wealth Management business fee waivers totaled $4.4 million in the quarter. Assets under management for our Wealth Management clients were $319 billion at quarter end, up 6% year-over-year and up 5% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was driven by favorable markets and net flows while the sequential increase was primarily driven by favorable markets. Moving to Page 6. Net interest income was $336 million in the third quarter, and was down 21% from the prior year. Earning assets averaged $129 billion in the quarter, up 23% versus the prior year. Average deposits were $113 billion, and were up 27% versus the prior year. The net interest margin was 1.03% in the quarter, and was down 58 basis points from a year ago. The net interest margin decreased primarily due to lower short-term interest rates as well as mix shift within the balance sheet. On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income was down 11.4%. Average earning assets increased 3% on a sequential basis while average deposits were up 2%. The net interest margin declined 19 basis points, primarily due to declining asset yields as securities and loans re-priced to lower interest rates. Turning to Page 7. Expenses were $1.1 billion in the third quarter, and were 6% higher than both the prior year and prior quarter. Expense during the quarter included the previously mentioned $43.4 million charge. Excluding the charge, expenses were up 1% on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. Compensation expense totaled $462 million and was up 1% compared to one year ago and flat sequentially. The year-over-year growth was driven by higher salary expense due to staff growth, base pay adjustments and unfavorable currency translation, partially offset by lower incentives. On a sequential basis, higher salaries driven by unfavorable currency translation and staff growth were mostly offset by lower incentives. Employee benefits of $97 million, was up 11% from one year ago and up 8% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily related to higher pension expense. The sequential increase was primarily driven by higher medical costs. Outside services expense of $186 million was down 4% on a year-over-year basis and up 5% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was driven by lower costs across a number of categories, including technical services, consulting third-party advisory fees and data processing, partially offset by higher sub custody expense and brokerage clearing costs. The sequential increase was due to higher technical services cost, third-party advisory fees, consulting and sub-custody related cost. Equipment and software expense of $171 million was up 13% from a year ago and up 4% sequentially. The year-over-year growth reflected higher depreciation and amortization as well as software support costs. The sequential increase was driven by increases in software support and equipment maintenance costs. Occupancy expense of $52 million decreased 2% from one year ago and was down 14% sequentially. Both declines were related to lower costs associated with executing workplace real estate strategies. Other operating expense of $127 million was up 38% from one year ago and up 48% sequentially. Results for the quarter included the previously mentioned $43.4 million charge. Excluding the charge the category declined 9% compared to one year ago and was down 3% sequentially. The year-over-year comparison was impacted by lower expense related to business travel, partially offset by higher mutual fund co-administration fees as well as higher costs associated with supplemental compensation plan expense within staff-related expense. The sequential comparison is impacted by higher costs associated with the Northern Trust sponsored golf tournament, offset by lower other miscellaneous expenses within the category. Turning to page 8. Our capital ratios remain strong with our common equity Tier 1 ratio of 13.4% under the standardized approach and 13.9% under the advanced approach. Both unchanged from the prior quarter. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 7.7% under both the standardized and advanced approaches. During the third quarter, we declared cash dividends of $0.70 per share, totaling $148 million to common stockholders. And its times like these that show the importance of the strong capital base and liquidity profile to support our clients' activities and we continue to provide our clients with the exceptional service and solution expertise they've come to expect. Our competitive positioning in wealth management, asset management and asset servicing continues to resonate well in the marketplace. Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust third quarter earnings conference call today. Mike, Mark, Lauren and I would be happy to answer your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And first from Jefferies, we have Ken Usdin. Mike O\u2019Grady: Hi, Ken. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Just want to follow-up on the whole side of rates. So good news that NII was down better than the original guide. And I was just wondering if you can update us on what your thoughts are as far as the outlook for NII? And at what point do you expect NII to get close to just flattening out? Is that sometime early in 2021? Or how can you help us think through that? Thank you. Mike O\u2019Grady: Yes. It's -- first of all I think it's important for people to realize that there's -- there are components of the securities portfolio that are longer dated. And there are securities we bought in 2017, 2018, 2019 that aren't going to mature for another two, three, four, five years. And so it's going to take a long-time to get this whole portfolio repriced. That said, at this point 75% of overall earning assets have been repriced on the new yield curve. And if you to break it down even a little bit farther from that, you can look and see that effectively all of the floating rate assets have been repriced, 80% of the loan book has been repriced and about 50% of the securities book has been repriced. And so I think the best way to think about it from what you can see is that from here about 1% to 2% of the overall earning asset base is going to reprice every quarter. And so we've gotten through most of it. And if you think about how aggressively we had to get through going from the first quarter where everything was on the prior book, to then in the second quarter, and now this third quarter movement we've got the vast majority of it done. That's why we think the flattening we're at that point now. It's just trickles from here, but it's not going to be 100% flat for a long-time as those longer-dated securities play through. Ken Usdin : Okay. And I guess just relative to your prior comments I just want to give you the opportunity to just level set us on what your expectation would be for 4Q NII versus third Q? Mike O\u2019Grady: Yes. I appreciate that. And I do think that -- well first of all and -- I'll answer the question. The way we look at it now and it comes back to that dynamic of about 2% repricing, you could say it's going to be down 2% give or take a point. And I think that's what you should expect from the math at this point. That said, now that we're at the point where so much of the book has been repriced. The movement in NII from here is going to be driven more by what happens in the business and more by what happens in loans and what happens in the deposit book and how that stays on. And frankly, our confidence level in reinvesting that into not just cash at central banks went into higher-yielding assets. And so from here, it's going to be much more business driven. Ken Usdin : Okay. Thanks, Jason. Jason Tyler : Thanks, Ken. Operator : We have Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Mike O\u2019Grady: Hi, Glenn. Glenn Schorr : Thanks. So definitely not the norm for you guys, but I think everyone has a little bit higher sensitivity to issues--. So I was going to ask just for a little more color on the corporate action item, was this a manual issue? What have you done to rectify? And have there been MRAs outstanding related to this? I think that some of the Q&A back and forth pre-call was about that such that you may just address it? Thanks. Mike O\u2019Grady: Sure. I appreciate one. So first of all I just want to provide a little bit of context on this group for people that don't know it well, and how an item like this occurs. I think it's important to understand with $13 trillion in assets under custody or administration, the security services group is processing literally millions of transactions a year. We've got errors in the group on a consistent basis and they total somewhere between $5 million, $10 million a quarter on average. That's typically what we experienced there. And they're accounted for consistently in the other operating expense line on the income statement that you see. And so, the event itself is not unusual, it's the dollar amount. And if we focus on that a little bit, we think over the last 10 years we've actually never had a loss cumulatively in a quarter to even get to $20 million. And if you look back even on the years we've never had a full year that amounts to this level of a loss. And interestingly, this quarter in and of itself from a volume perspective of losses, it was light. And even, the other items added up to a less than normal level, it was at the bottom end of that kind of $5 million to $10 million range. And so then if you ask, what have we done you can imagine the first thing we do is unpack the situation. Once we're confident that there's been a mistake. We did everything we needed to do in order to make our clients whole. We did that. And then at that point, we look at the processes, identify ways to improve even process we felt strongly about, but we identified ways to strengthen it. We put those in place. And at this point, we move on. From an MRA perspective, we wouldn't be able to talk about that at this point, if it were even -- if that had even been surfaced. But obviously, we took this very seriously. This is not -- I think it's important to note, this isn\u2019t -- this is not out of the normal course of servicing $13 trillion in assets in terms of the event. It was really the fact that, we had a very large exposure within it that was unusual. Glenn Schorr : Okay. Cool. Maybe, I do a follow-up on some related to the balance sheet. Tyler -- Jason the other securities line is up 30% year-on-year and it's almost the biggest part of earning assets now. The footnote talk about community development investments. But could you just expand a little bit more on that, because it's such a larger part and it's growing more? What benefit you get from that? What kind of yield pickup? And should we expect to see more of that? Thanks so much. Jason Tyler : Sure. Just before you go on mute Glenn, I want to make sure we answer your question really specifically. So you're talking about the increase in the securities portfolio that is kind of $56 billion, $58 billion is that where you're looking? Mike O\u2019Grady: I think most of that growth came on that other securities lines. So, if we address the growth in securities year-over-year I think that will -- Jason Tyler : Yeah. So in general if the group -- Glenn, were you going to add a clarification Glenn or -- Glenn Schorr : No. You got it the other line in the securities line on the balance sheet. Thanks. Jason Tyler : So the -- in general, the treasury group is always looking for opportunities to lean out a little bit from just cash and we feel confident. And there'll be types of investments that are short-term, where it's not cash, but it's -- but there are items where we pick up a little bit of yield. And so it could be short-term JGPs. It could be other short-term instruments where we pick up a little bit of cash, a little bit of yield, without taking too much incremental exposure. And so they've been looking at that in different ways. And part of it, I think we talked last time about the fact that part of this NII journey is going to be not just the size of the balance sheet, but when we felt confident that we could step out of central banks, and so as the treasury group is looking to do that, they're looking for not just these traditional -- what are we going to do with two-year, three-year, four-year securities or mortgage backs, but other items that can stay short, but still pick up a little bit in yield. And so that's not necessarily something you should see as a longer term trend. It's something that as we did this initial step out, we saw opportunity. Glenn Schorr : Great. Thanks so much. Appreciate it. Jason Tyler : Sure. Operator : Next question will come from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Mike O\u2019Grady: Hi, Alex. Alex Blostein : Hey, guys. Thanks. Good morning. So maybe just a quick clarification on NIR first. So, I hear you on the kind of 1% to 2% decline in NIR from here as the securities book re-price. Does that include any mitigation efforts to offset the roll-off roll-on dynamics? Or that's really kind of like a gross number? And then there are things you could do to help mitigate the remaining pressure albeit it's obviously some in small, which could get you to more of a kind of flattish NIR from here? Jason Tyler : Well, the answer is it's very much just looking organically at the amount of -- that's in the book. So that doesn't include any other strategic items. That's just the math of what's rolling off from here. That said, I do want to caution people even though net interest income is down significantly obviously, we're not going to be looking to have dramatic changes in our strategy, or our risk profile to think about \"offsetting\" the decline in rates. And so we're constantly thinking about optimizing the investment book, and we continue to do that. No change in our risk appetite at all. But the 1% to 2% a quarter is very much just the math of what exists in the book right now, absent any other things that we would be. So you shouldn't be thinking that's exactly what's going to happen over time. There are other things we're thinking about in terms of the securities portfolio, other things we can do with the balance sheet, but those were things we were contemplating before rates came down frankly. Alex Blostein : Got it. That's very clear. Thanks for that. My bigger picture question kind of revolves around fees. And this has obviously been a pretty volatile year with respect to both markets and new business and volumes et cetera. Maybe help us level set what has been the organic fee growth in the business, maybe kind of over the last 12 months, given your comments around strong pipeline and sort of the building momentum in C&IS, maybe help frame what that kind of organic fee growth could look like over the next 12 months? And then specifically, I was hoping you guys could also hit on the multi -- on the global family office business. That revenue has been kind of flattish for the last four quarters, despite a pretty significant growth in assets. I know there's a little bit of lag there, but still feels like the fees are lagging like in the asset base. So kind of bigger picture question, but if you guys could hit on all of that that will be awesome. Thanks. Jason Tyler : Sure. So if I start on C&IS, I think the, we separated into two different buckets there interestingly. One is that, there has been significant growth that's come in the investment management fee line. And that's come from very good collaboration, between the asset management business and C&IS. And a lot of work we did in the last couple of years, setting up the liquidity business to be able to take on assets. So I'm going to do this at the corporate level, but a lot of these assets apply to C&IS. But if you go back to last year to the beginning of this year, the liquidity business had $215 billion in AUM. And now we're close to $285 billion $290 billion, very significant growth bigger than what's happened in the industry. And so that's led to good organic growth in the business, as a result of good collaboration. Again not 100% of that is in the C&IS business, but the vast majority of it is. The other aspects of C&IS as you just get to the traditional custody and other asset servicing type activities that the -- interestingly the organic growth this quarter was not great. It was positive, but it wasn't great. They do feel stronger about the pipeline that they have the one non-funded business. And part of that is a result of the fact that there were a lot of prospects that we won that delayed implementation partially because of COVID, but still very high confidence level that's going to be on-boarded in fourth quarter or first quarter. And so we see good opportunity set to bring on that business in the next couple of quarters. That said, the growth in the money market mutual fund business, it's been great. But it has flattened out at this point. And so it's good diversification in the business to sometimes get growth coming from the investment management side and sometimes from the other. Mike O'Grady: This is Mike. I'm going to pick up for Jason while he gets a chance to get a sip of water Alex. So I think importantly longer term, I -- that, again, we continue to see the opportunity to grow at a higher organic growth rate. Having said that, as we've always said, it's critical but that's profitable growth for us. And so that we're doing it in a way that is coming with operating leverage and fee operating leverage. Now with the change in the rate environment that dramatically impacts your ability in the short-term, to get the operating leverage. And so as a result, it makes -- it focuses us on ensuring that that growth does not come with the requirement for significant resources. So, looking at the expense side of the equation and just making sure that we keep those in line in this type of environment. And that the growth is high quality scalable growth for us. So that's on the asset servicing side. And Jason mentioned asset management just to close off on wealth management. Again, as you mentioned, this has been an unusual year. And so we've had to shift our sales and new business strategy as a result. And I would say that I'm very optimistic on the long-term prospects for that. But it has in this interim period has caused some additional volatility in the normal sales pattern that we would have. So, long-term very positive, but to your point, there's some bumpiness that we've had this year that we haven't had in previous years. Mark Bette : Alex, this is Mark. And I could comment on the GFO asset growth. I think you're seeing the growth to step-up in the second quarter. Can't get into a lot of the specifics there but, that type of client that type of segment for us, both clients can move pretty large concentrated asset holdings onto our custody platform. And that's what the majority of the increase was in the second quarter. There's not necessarily a corresponding noticeable increase in fees with that, just because of the nature of the holding -- single holding that we might be having on our platform for those clients. Alex Blostein : Great. Thanks everybody for tackling and hold that. Thanks. Mark Bette : Thanks, Alex. Operator : Next up from Morgan Stanley, we have Betsy Graseck. Betsy Graseck : Hi\u2026 Mark Bette : Hi, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. I had a couple of questions. On the capital ratios, I know you typically sit with a pretty nice cushion above your regulatory minimums and above what your management buffers might add to it. Obviously in this period with no buybacks that some capital ratio is improving even further. Could you give us a sense as to how you're thinking about utilizing that excess capital in the event that the cessation on buybacks continues?  Is there anything that you might want to discuss about how you could be using that capital outside of buybacks? We've seen some acquisitions in the space recently on the asset management side. And wanted to get your sense on that if there's anything to do there? That's the first part of the question. Thanks. Jason Tyler : All right. I'm going to -- I'll try it and see if I got my voice back. The good news is that Mike and I talk about this a lot. So if I don't he's going to -- we'll definitely be on the same page on it. So it's -- I'm going to start with and you've heard me talk about it a little bit Betsy, but I think there's four components to how firms -- at least how we think about, how we deploy capital and how we -- what capital levels we maintain.  The first is we have very good genuine discussions with our Board about it. And that's not to say that there's any tension there. There's not at all. We're completely aligned, but we also want to make sure that we're not being presumptuous in saying where we want capital levels to be without having good conversations with them. So that it really does truthfully start with that discussion.  And then secondly, we think about capital on an absolute basis, we want to have good cushion relative to where we need to be from a regulatory perspective. The third is we look very closely frankly out the side view mirror and we look at things on a relative basis. When we talk to clients and prospects they care and we want to be able to reflect. It's part of our overall value proposition that we've got strong capital levels and we have to be able to evidence that on a relative basis. And the fourth, maybe most instructively given the fact that the stock price has come down is thinking about things on a returns basis. And so we think about that deployment of capital not just do we take capital up or down, but what types of returns are we getting for it? And there we have to compare what returns are we getting by investing in our own stock effectively. And that has to do a lot with where we think things are from a price-to-book perspective and how it's trading and what we think.  And secondly, what opportunities do we have to reinvest organically in the business. And then third we're looking at what examples there are where we can invest or non-organically outside. And so we've talked about the fact that we're very open. And I'd say particularly in the wealth management space where it is difficult to have organic growth. We feel very strong about the franchise and we feel like our ability to maintain a high-quality client base is very strong if we were to bring that in. Betsy Graseck : So when you're talking about wealth management you're talking about teams, firms, portfolios, is there any nuance to that? Jason Tyler : Yes. The teams I think is harder. I think those tend to be -- first of all, culturally, it's not super consistent for us to do something like that for various reasons. I'm happy to talk about it a little bit more. I think firms where you've got more of a sense of scale that's been there, but they're maybe not at the scale that we are and we can bring that in. And we think about our different groups almost as large teams. And we think about the offices we have, the $320 billion in assets you split that between the offices we have. And you have a team of $1 billion, $2 billion, $3 billion. So something of that size or $10 billion -- up to $8 billion is kind of a couple of teams from our lens. But extracting a team out of another firm is not something that we have intended to do. And so thinking about an organization, an established organization with a client base. But with a leadership that hasn't been able to develop a succession plan in place or they think it just might be better to go to the infrastructure of a larger organization. And you think about the scale we represent at that asset level, we can be a good solution for firms that don't have that succession planning in place. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And what I'm hearing in your answer is wealth management over asset management. Is that fair? Jason Tyler : There -- to the extent there are assets, there are opportunities in asset management. It's a little bit more nuanced. We've done some things there quietly more small that have been extremely consistent with our strategic desire to do more intermediary distribution. And so we look closely at those as well. I think the distinction might be probably a little bit of a higher bar right now to do something in size at the asset servicing side of the business. Betsy Graseck : Got it. And then what if the Fed does lift the restrictions on buybacks maybe you could give us a sense as to how you're thinking about -- how you would manage the capital in that scenario in terms of the pace that you might start buybacks back up at? And how quickly you want to get back down to the capital ratios that you think are most efficient for your business model? Jason Tyler : Mike, can you answer that? Mike O\u2019Grady: Yes. So Betsy, I think Jason laid out the framework. So, I won't go into that. But that is the framework that we would apply, should the Fed lift the restrictions and we'll see. But prior to the pandemic, we were repurchasing our shares. And so, it depends on that broader environment that we would lay over with the regulatory constraints. So, I would hope that to the extent that the Fed removes the restrictions that's also an indication that the environment is relatively favorable, which will put us back in a position similar to the beginning of the year where we were both able to and were repurchasing our stock. Betsy Graseck : Okay, got it. Thank you. Mike O\u2019Grady: Sure. Operator : Next question will come from Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Mike Carrier : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. First, you guys have been focused on both investing in the business, but also doing a good job on driving efficiencies and marketing leverage. The longer we're operating in this work from home backdrop. I'm just curious if you find additional areas of potential efficiencies whether it's in area out of real estate or other areas that could drive that longer term? Mike O\u2019Grady: We -- this environment has been very -- obviously made everybody take a step back and think about that. We have. Frankly, there are things that we're accelerating the business. I mentioned super quickly in the opening comments that we're on a real estate strategy journey right now. We looked deeply at that just a couple of months ago kind of in the midst of this to say how does the health care crisis influence that strategy. And there are elements of it that it accelerates. And there are consolidations we were thinking about that frankly we're saying we can do that faster. And then there are other things that we were not considering before that this endeavor makes us consider. And I tell people kind of jokingly. A year ago, I did not know how many square feet we had off the top of my head and now I do. And I know where they are. And I know how much we're paying per foot. And so, we're talking about that element a lot to try and think about, what does real estate look like in the future not just domestically but internationally. And there are a lot of creative things we can do to try and be more efficient and try and leverage the technology that we've invested in into our partners in order to decrease reliance on square footage frankly, and that also leads to areas of saying, how we become more resilient, and how do we think about resiliency with our workforce overall. And we've had to make them more technologically equipped in order to be resilient and that adds flexibility as well obviously in very creative other ways the way we think our resiliency centers and other things like that. Mike Carrier : Okay. Helpful. And then Jason, you mentioned in the past, the loan demand will be a key driver to NII going forward and we've seen fairly divergent trends across the industry. It's still fairly weak new loan demand, but pocket full of strength within the wealth area. So just wanted to get an update on your front in terms of the demand that you're seeing across the business? Jason Tyler : Yes. You can't -- it's interesting. You can't see it from the financial statements, but loans are actually to pick up within September even. And that surprised us. And when you go back 90 days ago, we -- I think everyone felt like we were going to see balance sheets come down. We thought liquidity -- we thought cash was going to come down. Deposits are going to come down. We thought loans are going to come down. But our balance sheet on average was up in the quarter. And even there it's not that just the clients are holding more deposits, but loans were held in. And so, I -- it does seem like there -- some of the loan demand we have is coming from clients that are saying, they want to be ready to do things if to be more active if they see opportunities come up. It's unclear whether or not that will actually happen, whether or not the opportunity to come or whether or not, they'll actually pull the trigger on it. But that's certainly been the case that they've held in terms of loan volume. And we've been talking recently about the fact that, liquidity in general is a big component of what we do with our clients, and so if you think about liquidity more broadly as clients wanting to find safe high-quality places to park their cash and short-term assets. They view our balance sheet is strong and we've talked about the fact that our money market mutual funds, very strong investment performance, they're at size. Our treasury funds were $80 billion to $90 billion. And so various appealing places even for very large institutional investors to invest. And then on the other side, clients know that as they've worked with us, we understand their asset composition well. And so, we can be a thoughtful lender in terms of how to structure things in the most efficient way for that. Mike Carrier : Thanks a lot. Jason Tyler : Sure. Operator : Moving on from Deutsche Bank, we have Brian Bedell. Brian Bedell : Great. Thank you very much. Just a couple of 4Q questions just to get this out of the way. Just if you could comment on the typical seasonality that we see an uptick in expenses that we typically see in the fourth quarter in conjunction with the Gulf Open, which added some expense in 3Q. And also the exit rate for money market fee waivers in September to get a sense of where we're running into for 4Q on that? Jason Tyler : Sure. Mike do you want to do this? Mike O\u2019Grady: Yeah. So the first was on the seasonality in the Northern Trust? Jason Tyler : No, just in general expenses. Mike O\u2019Grady: Oh, in expenses. Jason Tyler : Fourth quarter expenses. Mike O\u2019Grady: Yeah, sure. So there are components of expenses in fourth quarter that are -- that we should actually curb because I think third quarter in some ways is not an ideal run rate for some of them. And so maybe just walk through it a little bit. First of all take benefits for example. There you see the trend that took place, but part of it is the fact that medical has gone -- and it's not an enormous line but it's had an enormous jump from second quarter. So medical in second quarter was something like $17.5 million went up to $26 million in third quarter. That's closer to a typical run rate but could still see some tweak up from there. And so I think that's just something to keep in mind that as our partners exited effectively doing normal things in their own health care maintenance that's coming back online. And it's had a surprisingly large level of volatility from my perspective frankly. And then outside services is another one where we believe we could see a similar step-up in fourth quarter to what we saw in third quarter. There's a lot of business volume related costs within that category that are likely to increase. And we're still running at relatively low levels of cost when you think about things like consulting, legal, technical services that dial down and we're doing everything we can to tamp those down but that could come back up. And then equipment and software -- on a year-to-date basis equipment software costs are up 11%. That's likely close to where we're going to land for the full year 2020, the category where the expenses are expected to have higher levels of growth this year as -- in fact we've invested in the business, we've got higher depreciation and amortization costs we've called that out. D&A is something like two-thirds of that line in general. And so that's kind of in the soup. It's hard to tamp that down as aggressively. And then I'll talk about occupancy. I've mentioned it a little bit. There's going to be volatility there. We're going to make some investments frankly in occupancy to try and get our longer-term run rate down a little bit. And so you're going to see that line item bounce around a little bit. And so in general, I'd say it's less about seasonality of run rate in expenses and it's more about two things. One is what how do we get back to undoing the COVID related influences on expenses, and second what are the investments we're going to make to try and decrease our run rate in the long run. Brian Bedell : That's helpful. On the money market fee way per trajectory at the end of 3Q? Jason Tyler : Yeah. Thanks. So let me -- I'll do a couple of comments there. One is as we -- you could pick it up from the opening comments, we're right at $5 million only in the third quarter. Now the reality is there's -- the $300 billion in money market mutual fund assets we have that is relatively stable at this point but rates are moving around a lot. So you've got to assume that rates and volumes stay the same but third quarter was $5 million. As we sit today the run rate on a quarterly basis is about $11.5 million as we sit today. The team thinks we could have waivers in the fourth quarter, $20 million to $25 million and exiting the year so as a launch point coming into 2021 could be $25 million to $35 million. And just to give you a sense of what does that mean I think it's super important to remember the fact that if you go back to the beginning of this year when we were at $215 billion in assets, the overall revenue run rate was much lower than what it is right now. And so now you go up to $290 billion and the run rate is over $400 million in revenue. And so we're talking about the fact that we have a decent amount of waivers but from a much higher revenue base and so the story there is kind of mixed in some ways. Brian Bedell : Okay. That's very helpful. And then Mike maybe on just ESG. You mentioned that at the outset, the ESG analytic service that you have served. But maybe if you could just talk about where you are in the growth path of that and are you rolling that out to all of your asset servicing clients? And how is the take up? And then also on the wealth management side, are you seeing more demand from your wealth clients for investing in ESG product that you have and the organic growth outlook in the investment management side for your ESG products? Mike O\u2019Grady: Right. So, Brian the reason why I did mention it upfront is because ESG does run across the company and each of our businesses and you started to highlight it there, but let me go back through a little bit. First of all, just from an investing perspective to your point we are seeing more and more demand from our clients both institutional, but to your point, on the wealth side, including our GFO clients in ESG investment product and investment strategies. So, as a result, we've -- as you would expect with our business model, we've looked to fulfill those demands with ESG product from our asset management group. And as I mentioned over $100 billion at this point, but I would say still in the early days of that trend and of the growth opportunity for us there. And then more broadly in thinking about our institutional clients, particularly asset owner clients they're being held to a higher standard as well as to how they're investing and -- from an ESG perspective. And as a result they need the analytics around that. So, I talked about the capabilities that we rolled out. And to your point I would say early days on that because I think this is a very long-term trend. Brian Bedell : Great. That's super helpful. Thank you. Mike O\u2019Grady: Sure. Operator : And next we have of Vivek Juneja from JPMorgan. Mike O\u2019Grady: Hi Vivek. Vivek Juneja : Hi Mike, hi Jason and Mark. I just want to follow-up on the operating error. I know you've had those for years and I know -- I recognize that's one item, but large amounts do get a lot of attention. You I'm sure are aware of what's happened to another -- to adjacent when the amount got much larger similar to their business. They do have those kind of errors. And I know you've been -- what do you plan to do to automate more of these processes so that you have less of these errors. Simply how do you talk about trying to do stuff where you need less reconciliation less checking? So, Mike what do you need to do to step up to limit these and hope that something like this doesn't get even to be a larger amount in the future? Mike O\u2019Grady: Sure Vivek. So, as Jason mentioned this is the nature of our businesses and that part of the business is processing transactions for our clients broadly speaking. And there are certain aspects of that that have been automated and were automated years ago. And that's -- what you would expect is find the areas that lend themselves to automation you get the benefit of both efficiency, but also dramatic reduction in risk from incurring errors. And so that's the longer term path that we've been on for -- and I'd say the industry as well for some time period. And then you have other aspects of what we do that don't lend themselves as much to automation because of the idiosyncratic nature of the particular transactions. So, in this case corporate actions where certain aspects of corporate actions are very straightforward and so they've already been automated or portions of them have been automated, but other parts where it's still difficult because of the lack of homogeneity of the transactions themselves. With that said, we have -- this area even though it's primarily manual with some level of automation, it's an area that gets a lot of attention from a procedures and control perspective. And frankly as much as there have been errors in the past, it's been very well controlled. So, think about it as higher inherent risk as we see it but with procedures and controls that we've been able to manage and mitigate the risk that comes with that. That's not to say that we haven't been on a path of trying to add in additional workflow tools and automate additional things that we can. We've been investing broadly speaking in our security services area significantly for years to modernize the technology in there in that area. So, it's on a path and then you have a situation like this that occurs that certainly brings more attention to it. But it wasn't attention that we felt as though boy we've ignored this area, rather we've controlled it and we've tried to improve it, but it requires additional procedures and controls and as we go forward more modernization and automation as well. Vivek Juneja : Understood. Thanks. A quick one for Jason. I'll take a minor one Jason the CIS fees you mentioned year-on-year benefit from FX translation. Could you give us a number ex-FX translation? Jason Tyler : 2%. Vivek Juneja : 2% growth ex-FX translation? Mark Bette : Well, just to clarify this is Mark. The -- on the custody and fund services line, that's where most of the currency impact would be and that impact was about a 2% benefit on a year-over-year basis. Vivek Juneja : Okay. So, that means-- Mark Bette : And that line -- I should also add even though you didn't ask, that is the area that we saw the EFA local is down on a year-over-year basis. So that was actually a drag for that line markets were, because that line as we've talked about before is probably 2 :1 more based on EFA local than I would say what domestic indices are doing. Vivek Juneja : Okay, great. Yes, I did notice that you mentioned that markets were down and I wonder which ones, I'm glad you clarified that one. But is that -- and are you highlighting that because the fee rate is higher on that mark? Because I didn't think EFA was over 50% of your revenues. Jason Tyler : No. Just to try and give you a sense of the importance as you try and predict asset levels, you are trying to just to appreciate the influence of EFA local within the C&IS trust fee base, as opposed to wealth that's much more exclusively driven by just domestic indices. Vivek Juneja : Sorry. Okay. I would clarify that with Jason and Mark offline. Thanks. Thank you. Operator : Moving on we have Brennan Hawken with UBS. Jason Tyler : Hi, Brennan. Brennan Hawken : Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just actually sort of following up on that line of question from Vivek. When we look at the trends in AUC/A growth in C&IS versus revenue, it looks like at least the way all of us knuckleheads from the outside model, there was some fee rate pressure. I know that it doesn't always translate that way to how you run the business and how you strike the deals and the contracts and the way all the pricing works. But could you maybe provide some color in helping us understand what might have caused some of those dynamics? Are those sustainable? What was behind that, just to help us inform as we sit there and think about our modeling and where to go from here? Jason Tyler : Understood. I think more and more frankly, there's going to be less of connectivity between the asset level and revenue level. And a lot of the negotiations to take place, we're thinking about trying to include a more holistic approach to the relationship which might be what we're doing with the firm with investment management, what we're doing with integrated trading solutions, what we might be doing from an IOO perspective how we're handling cash and suite. And so, I know it's super frustrating to not be able to just use that role on a model to predict the revenue. But more and more, the reality is it's just -- it's disconnected in terms of the way the business actually prices these relationships. Mark spent a lot of time thinking about this too, Mark, add your thoughts. Mark Bette : Right. I mean, part of it, I would also say, is fee structure. And as we've talked about before, 35% to 40% of those asset servicing fees in C&IS are not directly linked to assets. So in an environment where assets are rising, that factor alone would probably put the fees at a lower growth rate. And then more importantly and it gets a little bit to what Jason was saying is, as mix of business. And even within the actual asset servicing fee category, a very large domestic U.S. custody mandate large assets maybe not a large fee, a fund administration mandate could come with much less assets and the fees are significantly higher. So, there is a mix that's at play too, besides the timing which we've talked about before, end-of-period versus earning over a quarter. But hopefully that helps. It's a tough one to unpack, we understand, to the point that Jason mentioned. Brennan Hawken : Okay. So just -- that's all fair and I totally appreciate that. But to the point of -- can you give some color to the point of the third quarter as a jumping off point then? Like, were trends that you saw in the quarter then reasonably sustainable? Was there some sort of noise that might have caused that divergence to look a little wider, just to help us kind of -- any help you can give on that front as we think about it? Jason Tyler : Yes. Well, a couple of thoughts. One is that in the spirit of -- the business does have some compression. Just to get to your specific point earlier, as you asked the question I want to make sure we come back to it and address it specifically. And those fee compressions are going to be honored, whether or not we're in a COVID environment or not. I actually think though that doesn't have as much of an influence on the dynamic that you're realizing, which is that there seems to be -- that there's a disconnect between the growth and asset levels and the growth trust fees. And in the short run, you can have flows into and out of the business that are going to be reported on -- the assets are going to be reported on where they are at the end of the period. And the revenue is going to be reported based on where they were a prior period, period before that, maybe average and so it's very misleading to try and do the math on short-term to try and get a sense of what the fee realization rates look like on the business on an incremental basis. And even the business that's being added if it's being -- if it's very large pieces of business, they could be at extremely low fee rates. And -- but if it's more middle market activity, it could be much higher. So the business mix itself will have an influence there, but much less on the ultimate profitability. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Thanks for your patience with that one. My second one -- second question is around just trying to get at the processing error again. And I think, Mike, you might have made some comment about this, but I just wanted to kind of explore it. I think you said that you all are continuing to review those processes, see opportunities for automation, control and process review which is, of course, is ongoing, but maybe an event or a loss like this might sharpen pencils, so to speak. Will this have some kind of impact do you think on investment in the near-term or some of the expense lines, as you guys look to maybe shift or invest in some automations, hire some additional staff for that effort or what have you? Or is it more operational focus rather than the potential for investment? Mike O\u2019Grady: So Brennan, I would say it's some of both. So certainly, there are the operational aspects, which I talked about. And just to be clear, we've done the full scrub on this incident already and have changed the procedures already and changed the controls already in that area. And from a resource perspective, it was not a question of insufficient resources in the area that resulted in the error all the same. We're trying to ensure that that isn't the case at any point going forward as well. So, whatever resources, but that's not something that would result in a change in our financials, if you will, or expense run rate. And then on investments to your point there, it will -- the incident in and of itself. It doesn't change our investment plan. But the broader environment, without a doubt, you're always -- we are always impacted by the situation that we're in, and as a result, prioritizing our investments. So there's -- the opportunities we have to invest far outstretch what we would deploy in a given year. And as a result, you have to determine, okay, how do you prioritize those? And do you focus on productivity, investments for productivity, investments for risk management, investments for innovation and growth. And so that's a process we go through every year and ongoing. And I would say in the environment that we're in now, we have to ensure that, yes we have the operational resiliency and levels of automation to ensure that going forward. And then second, I would say productivity. We have to make sure that we're investing the technology dollars in a way to get the productivity improvements we think we need in this environment to be able to drive scalable growth. Brennan Hawken : Great. Thank you. Mike O\u2019Grady: Sure. Operator : And next from Seaport Global, we have Jim Mitchell. Mark Bette : Hi, Jim. Jim, you might be on mute. Jim? Jim Mitchell : Can you hear me? Mark Bette : Yes. I can hear you now. Jim Mitchell : Can you hear me? Okay. Sorry about that. So maybe just a follow-up on deposits. It seems like non-interest-bearing deposits for you guys grew pretty nicely both on an average and period end basis where your peers saw declines. And it seems like that helped you, I guess, outperform on NII a little bit. So just -- is there anything unusual in the non-interest-bearing side? Is that something you're trying to grow? Or is that just the episodic puts and takes? Jason Tyler : I mean, maybe -- yeah, I'd put it a little bit in between. I mean first of all, I actually -- I think it's good for people to realize. The reason we did better than we anticipated with NII, frankly a little bit less around the size of deposits that certainly played a factor, but I come back to the fact that we were able to turn on non-cash and loans held in better. And -- but then to your specific question about the growth in that category, hard for us to comment on what the industry is experiencing, but we've -- back to the theme that we talk about liquidity a lot with our clients and they view -- they tend to comment to us that they view our balance sheet as very strong. We try to position it that way. And so, we're happy to be a liquidity partner for our clients there. And I do think that has an influence on where they tend to park their short-term assets. Jim Mitchell : Okay. That's fair. And maybe for Mike, you mentioned it upfront that you're trying to do more with current clients. What -- any examples you can give us in terms of what you see as the biggest opportunity set to do more with your current clients? Mike O\u2019Grady: So, first of all I'd say within the businesses, there's definitely the opportunity and one we're pursuing to do more, particularly I would say with asset managers. So just thinking about our approach to the market from a whole office perspective, it's not just back office or middle office but also what we can do on the front office. So I mentioned for example, integrated trading solutions or essentially outsourced trading for those institutions that's doing more with those clients. So it's using really our position of strength, which is in the back and the middle office to be able to do more in the front office for them. So that's on that side. And I could use, I'll say other examples within the businesses but also I want to add though and highlight it's also across the businesses. And so it's a concerted effort to say if we have a let's say an administration client, fund administration client, are we providing wealth management to the executives of that firm or if we have a corporate client where we are the asset servicer for their pension plans, can we provide a wealth management solution or program what we would call firm to firm for their executive group. So it's those types of cross-business opportunities that historically we've done very well with these but I would say it's more because of the culture and the way that we operate and we're trying to be more purposeful and disciplined about how we do that. Jim Mitchell : Okay. Great. Thanks for the thought. Mike O\u2019Grady: Sure. Operator : All right. We'll move on to Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Mike O\u2019Grady: Hi, Steve. Steven Chubak : Hi, good morning. So I wanted to start off with a question on just some of the NII comments. And specifically, I was hoping you could help us think about the incremental capacity that you have currently to remix some of those excess reserves into securities. And just as we think about modeling the securities yield, where are you reinvesting today versus the 130 basis points on the back book? Jason Tyler : The capacity is a trickier one, because it depends on how quickly the deposits come in. And if we -- and sometimes we have to let deposits season in order to get proper treatment for those and get the confidence level, they're going to be -- that they're going to stick around so that we know we can take more duration risk with those. And so the reality is the size of the deposit base doesn't necessarily correlate exactly to what we can think about in terms of non-cash reinvestment opportunity. In terms of the opportunities on where we are investing at the time, there is more of a distinction there frankly. We did step away from just Central Bank deposits, once we start to feel that the balance sheet was more stable. And frankly, this is something people have missed. Part of the reason that I think all banks were even going to the point of why did -- why were share repurchases suspended banks wanted to be there for their clients in case there were significant loan demand. And in case there is very significant demand to place deposits where we want to make sure that regulatory ratios were going to be adequate. And given the fact that we've got such a large custody base, we wanted to make sure that if those assets started to come toward the balance sheet, we were going to feel good about it. And so we were patient on that. And -- but the more we realized that there was stability from a client perspective, the other components of the regulatory environment were there and more stable, we could take a step away. And what we did in third quarter was really incremental in size and in asset class. But if you think about eventually the things we can start to move more toward longer-dated securities, we can start to move more toward CLOs, more toward MBS. Now the -- unfortunately in a typical environment, you might see more of a 50, 70 basis point differential between the non HQLA portfolio. And the HQLA portfolio that's compressed and it's more like a 30 basis point differential at this point. And there are other things that we can do and explore based on what the opportunity set is given the risk and return framework or the different securities we feel comfortable in. But that should at least give you a little bit of a framework on how we think about it and a little bit of the dynamics from a quantitative perspective as well. Steven Chubak : Got it. Okay. That's helpful color. And then just thinking about the expense outlook. Now looking out to 2021, I just wanted to better understand how we should be thinking about the expense growth trajectory. NII is expected to decline about low double-digits assuming versus the current run rate things are relatively stable. The fee income growth potentially growing, mid-single digits at least on an organic basis. I'm just wondering is there room to do better on costs, where expense growth actually lags some of the organic fee growth to help dampen some of those pressures? How are you thinking about it in terms of the general internal philosophy? Jason Tyler : Well, we still consider ourselves a growth firm and we're investing for growth. And things even like the growth in the money market mutual funds it takes investment upfront to get the cutoff times right and to get investments done with portals. It takes also expense growth on an incremental basis. When you think about the administration fees that we pay to some of the -- around some of the processing side. And so, I think, that's a good example just thinking we think about things more from an operating leverage perspective. And to the extent that we have good operating leverage in the business then we're going to feel okay about the expense growth. Otherwise, we have to be extraordinarily disciplined about it. And so let me just break it down in these three different levels of how -- to your question how do we think about it in three different levels. One is, total operating leverage; two, trust fee operating leverage; and three, organic trust fee operating leverage. Now on the first, with this total operating leverage that's including a very declining component of revenue, which is NII and so it's going to be very difficult. And I don't think it's a very pure test right now given the unpredictability and the disconnect of that line item from the rest of the business so think about that as the one we'd want you to focus on. The other end of the spectrum is organic trust fee leverage. Unfortunately, there that's not a GAAP number. And so we can give you some components of how we think about it, but we can't really ask you to track that and just trust us that it's going to what we're expecting. And so let's focus in the middle on trust fee leverage. And there I think that's probably the best from what you can see and from what we think about that's probably the way to focus our discussion and track how we're doing. But those three elements and certainly trust fee operating leverage a very big one for us to -- as we think about the expense trajectory next year, it's incredibly front of mind for us. Again, we went through the entire re-plan. We did the re-plan on expenses. We did it on capital. We did it on strategy. And so as we go into 2021, the trust fee leverage is going to be a key item to make sure we're doing in exhibiting the discipline we should give the net interest income environment that we're in. We're giving up $300 million. If you think -- if you extrapolate what we're -- what we've done so far this year and put that kind of on a run rate you try to get hundreds of millions of dollars that we've given up in NII. And we're not going to ignore that. We're going to be -- we got to be disciplined and have a high sense of urgency about doing what we can to get the expenses as lean as possible given the environment we're in. Steven Chubak : Thanks for that context. And just two quick modeling questions, if I may. One is just how we should be thinking about the jumping-off point for other income given there's a lot of noise in the quarter as we just look out in 4Q and heading into 2021? And then just on the fee waivers, just to clarify quickly, $5 million was the impact this quarter, but it still sounds like your expectation is somewhere in the range of $25 million to $35 million for quarter headwind exiting this year. Is that right? Jason Tyler : Yes. Yes. Mark Bette : That's right. Jason Tyler : Yes. Again this is -- and I thought about mentioning it earlier, but I want to make sure we're giving you guys everything we can. The -- if you think about call it -- hopefully call it $300 billion base of business and say $200 billion of it is somewhere in flow for waivers. And the different funds jump into waiver mode at different levels. But if you look at where the overnight repo, for example, is right now and if you look at NIF treasure -- if you look at the treasury products, and those are the biggest products we have. And this is all -- you've got to imagine that over 50% of the assets are 30 days or less. And so -- and at $90 billion roughly, you're talking about $9 million per basis point. And so I cringe giving you guys numbers that have such volatility in them, but just think about how much of a dynamic that is if that fund -- if that strategy comes down literally a single basis point it influences run rate by almost $10 million a year. And so the numbers you quoted are right, but I think it's important for everybody to track the overnight repo market, track 30-day treasuries, track 6-month, track 12-month to get a better sense intra-quarter of what that number might be looking like. Mark Bette : And on the other operating income -- this is Mark, it certainly has volatility so I can appreciate the difficulty modeling it. If you looked at averages over the last -- 1.5 years or so you're probably looking at something in the mid to upper 40 range. This quarter we did have some benefit from the supplemental compensation plans that sit within that line that we're a little bit outsized versus what they've normally been. So you're probably a little high this quarter. And if you looked at the average like I said mid to upper 40s. Steven Chubak : Perfect. Thanks for clarifying that. Appreciate taking my questions. Mark Bette : Thanks. Operator : Moving on we have Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Hi. So it looks like you have best-in-class fee growth led by best-in-class wealth and asset management growth. But I still need help on the disconnect between the growth in assets under custody which were up twice the pace of peer year-over-year up 16%. And the custody fee line which is up only half as much. And then you said timing is part of it. But if you look at the last 12 months your assets under custody is up twice as much and you're related fees are that in line. So it just seems like outside AUC growth relative to the fees. And I know you said some of the AUC is not tied to fees, that's fine. But it still doesn't seem to explain everything that's going on there. So either there's something else in there or you\u2019re exciting based on price? Or I'm just missing something? Thanks. Jason Tyler : So let me address it. The -- that business most of the vast, vast majority of AUC in wealth is GFO. And the reason for that is we're -- that's where the outsized portion of clients that might not manage here but that want to use us as a custodian. It's kind of a hybrid business between the wealth business and the institutional business. And so when you look at the AUC number there that's vast majority GFO. That client base is very, very -- it's very, very spiky. And so you get very high number of -- you get a small number of clients that can literally have billions or tens of billions of dollars of assets coming in from an AUC perspective. And that's not going to influence how we think about the pricing on the overall relationship. We think about the relationship very holistically. And if the client has a -- it could be mega, mega liquidity events from a small number of clients that will move that line item that AUC number dramatically without influencing fees. Mike Mayo : And what's happening with those super high net worth customers then? What are they doing? And what have you seen recently? Jason Tyler : Yes. So a lot of times they'll have a large sale. It could be life event. It could be business sale, single stock exposure that they're dealing with they'll ask us to custody those assets for a period of time until they decide where to put those funds to work. And so -- and our goal is to work -- first of all be that provider so that we can be a best-in-class custodian for them and then introduce the other advisers, managers to do what we can to also be a manager and a financial adviser. We might do manager selection for them. We might become an OCIO provider. They might put some of those assets into -- they might move those assets from where they are into our liquidity funds. They might ask us to do tax-advantaged equity investing where we're very tax conscious. They might do a more aggressive ESG mandate. But the custodying in that business especially if it's a mandate of that size is going to obviously significantly change the denominator, but in the short run it's not going to change the numerator which is the fees we're getting off of those assets. Mike Mayo : Okay. And then just one follow-up. So gist -- the gist behind the question was pricing competition in the servicing business. Is it getting worse better? How do you think about competing? I mean sometimes it might make sense to take lower prices because of the scalability? Jason Tyler : Yes. The -- in general, the conversations are -- have been hopefully starting to be more about what is your capability set, what does resiliency look like? How did you handle the crisis? What are you able to do to help us from either investment operations outsourcing? Mike hinted earlier at integrated trading solutions and so all those things in the long run should be helpful in moving away. And just like the asset management business moving away from just talking about investment performance, here moving away from just talking about pricing the more value added. In the short run there were concessions that we agreed to as we do every year. And those played through early in the year. And so but in the longer run we're hoping that these conversations are more about capabilities and about service quality you're going to reduce those -- the frequency and severity of pricing discussions. But we're always going to have... Mike Mayo : Sorry. The word concessions kind of sticks out in my mind, so is there a magnitude of concessions? Do they come back? Or are they just -- how does that work for you? Mark Bette : I think it still comes back to the 1.5% to 2% a year of kind of price compression. So I don't -- the word concession maybe is a little different, but re-pricing that's just the kind of thing that we've seen pretty consistently. And I don't know, Jason, if the business he's talking about that picking up or accelerating at all. Jason Tyler : And Mike, I would just add, so where you have large relationships that are good but those client relationships have grown meaning the assets have grown just like we talked about when their fees are tied to a bid on those assets that were either custodying, administrating whatever it maybe, they tend to then go up over time. And then the client looks at it and says, hey, you know what I'd like to take a look at the pricing on this, because your fees have gone up, because our assets have gone up, and yet from a work perspective you may be doing more but not as much as our asset growth. And so that's the exercise. If you're not able to come to an agreement then a client can say, we're going to take it out for rebid. And then that process then as a result they're likely to get more aggressive pricing on it. Now, again, we try to minimize when it has to go through that full process. But I think that the nature for very large institutions like that. I would also say, on new business just to be clear price is a factor of course, and we lose business on pricing at times. So it's not as though we price to win. We price to win at a profitable margin for us, and have models to be able to determine what are the resources required and therefore where can we price it? And if we can't get there with either where we think it is or you just find out through a process you lost. And the reason why you lost is your pricing was not aggressive enough relative to who they ultimately picked. Mike Mayo : Thank you. Jason Tyler : Sure. Operator : And next we have Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, everyone. I've got a big picture question -- to be able to answer, but we'll give it a try. Your balance sheet and the deposits and in fact Jason you mentioned that, I think earlier to a question. Everyone was surprised that [Technical Difficulty] obviously good. What do you think normal size of your cost base you mentioned customers have much more liquidity today, because [Technical Difficulty] we all know that balance sheet [Technical Difficulty] where do you think your normal size in being do you have any -- or maybe you're at and it will stay. And you may actually get there? Is it 2022, 2023 any thoughts on this? Mike O\u2019Grady: Gerard, its Mike. Why don't I just first just clarify your question it's around as you started it bigger picture question, but with all these factors going on what is your expectation for a normal the normal size I'll call it for the balance sheet. Is that what you're getting at? Gerard Cassidy : Yes. Yeah that's correct. Mike O\u2019Grady: Okay. Okay. Let me make one comment. And then since you led in with big picture that allows me to answer it without all the details that Jason can provide. But I would say, as much as you might say, boy there's been a lot of monetary policy across the globe and that has elevated the size of your balance sheet. And so would you expect that to kind of come out of the system and see your balance sheet go back down. So do you have \"excess deposits\" right now? My perspective on it is we're into a very long-term period for this type of monetary policy. And so I don't know how to define normal. But as far as the liquidity that our clients have right now and what they're doing with it, be it on our balance sheet in the funds, I think there's going to be a lot of liquidity in the marketplace for some time period. Now, it ebbs and flows as far as our client and our balance sheet and funds. But just in general, I think the water level is higher, and I think it will remain higher for some time period. Jason, I don't know if you want to add? Jason Tyler : I think the only thing just to maybe to bookend it is, if you go back a year ago deposits were kind of mid-80s build. And if you think about -- when you look at where deposits are today in the one-teens and so I would use those as the bookends, but I think Mike's comments reflect it's probably near the higher end of that bookends. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then just to come back to the processing error that you have been very good at explaining what happened. You mentioned that processing errors occur all the time. And to you it means processing and processing is every year of course. Was the actual -- whatever the execution was it upsized execution rolled into your normal processing services caused an outsized cost? And then second was it [Technical Difficulty] once the execution have to [ph] take a couple of days to figure it out? Mike O\u2019Grady: Yeah. So Gerald again I -- just because your line is cutting in and out a little bit, but I think I have the question. The first one, you're trying to get your arms around the size of the loss. And there are two things I would say, one, is that it was a large corporate action. So size wise in the marketplace it was a large corporate action and our clients were active in that particular corporate action. So that was one aspect of the size. It was large for the market. It wasn't necessarily any larger for us vis-\u00e0-vis anybody else. It just happened to be a large corporate action. And then second as far as a timing perspective, the air just to be clear was identified within minutes of having been made and so it's not -- and then it was ultimately remediated as soon as we could practically do it. So we did not carry a risk position I'll call it for an extended time period that just got worse because we thought markets were going to change or anything like that it's obviously unfortunate situation. We're very disappointed about it. But we looked to mitigate the potential costs as soon as practical and we were able to do that. Gerard Cassidy : Very good, Mike. Thank you. Operator : And moving on we have Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research. Mike O\u2019Grady: Rob? Rob Wildhack : Good morning guys. Mike you started to touch on it a little bit in the last one-third of the call here. And in the past you've emphasized scalability in your upfront remarks today you emphasize tech solutions. So I was hoping you could give us an update on the progress you've made here on these priorities and where you think are the best opportunities to increase scalability and up your tech solutions going forward? Mike O\u2019Grady: So I think that Rob, the expectation would be that I would say it's all in our asset servicing business and the processes and operations around that, which is certainly from a dollar perspective that's the largest opportunity. And it's one as you mentioned we've been pursuing that and the point here is we'll only continue to do it. And if you did say within 2020 and everything that's happened has that affected the pace I would say it has. And some of it is I would say the fortunate circumstances of seeing the model operate differently and seeing new opportunities for scalability within the business model. So more remote work is definitely a part of that. And frankly managing the processes is different in a remote environment than it is in a facilities in person based model. And so we've had to adapt. And as we've acknowledged there have been changes and risks that come with that. But also I'm saying there's also some opportunity, where we see to get more scalability. But then, the other aspect of my response was going to be that in areas where it's already relatively scalable, so for example, in wealth management as that business becomes more digital, that becomes even more scalable as well. The point being that -- and again, we've seen an acceleration of that in this environment as well, because as much as we will always offer the highest level of service for our clients. And that's our market positioning. That's a differentiator for it. The nature of that has changed over time. And it's only accelerated. Being more specific, clients need to and want to be able to do more things on their own through, mobile or other digital devices. And that's great. So instead of necessarily calling someone here to get something done, they can just go to their phone and get it done. Well that changes the scalability of that activity, because they can -- we can have as much volume of that as you can imagine, but it doesn't increase the resources or certainly at the same rate. So, we see it as I say, kind of across the company. And it's just a matter of continuing to execute. Rob Wildhack : Yeah. That's great. Thanks a lot. A - Mike O : Sure. Grady: Sure. Operator : All right. Moving on, we'll take our final question from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. A - Mike O : Hi, Brian. Grady: Hi, Brian. Brian Kleinhanzl : Thanks guys. I just have one quick question, at this point. When you think about the pipeline, I know it's a mix of different clients that are in there and different services that you're onboarding, but when you think about the onboarding process underneath this operating environment that you have to work with today. How much longer is the onboarding process as we could think about how to lag these revenues in, in this current environment versus what it would have been previously? Thanks. A - Mike O : Sure. So as Jason mentioned, we did have a call it deferral in the transitions, particularly in the second quarter. And then, we picked back up -- transitions picked back up in the third quarter, particularly towards the end of the quarter. And yet, he's also said we have a high level of business that has been won, that needs to be transitioned. And you've identified one of the aspects of, how that has changed the cadence or sequencing of those transitions, because some of them are much easier to do in a virtual environment. So if you think about I'll call it custody type mandates, there's a lot of activity that's required. But that happens or can happen. A lot of it frankly it was already, I would call it very digital or could be done virtually whereas if you think about broader IOO Investment Office Outsourcing mandates, those are more difficult to do. They involve more people. And so, when those people are remote, whether they're the clients or ours or there's some requirement for us to be hiring people to be able to take on that business that does take longer to implement and to get transitioned. And then, there's all types of mandates I would say that are in between there. And we're moving on them. So you heard some of the fund administration wins that we've had, in the 40x space which has been great. But it does take a little bit longer, given the nature of that activity that you're taking on. Operator, any other questions? Grady: Sure. So as Jason mentioned, we did have a call it deferral in the transitions, particularly in the second quarter. And then, we picked back up -- transitions picked back up in the third quarter, particularly towards the end of the quarter. And yet, he's also said we have a high level of business that has been won, that needs to be transitioned.

Operator, any other questions? Operator : No sir that was the final question. That does conclude our Q&A session. So, I'll turn the floor back to you for any additional or closing remarks, sir. Mark Bette : Thanks everyone for joining us. We'll talk to you in 90 days. Operator : All right. And everyone, that does conclude our call again for today. We do thank you for joining us.

Finally, I want to express my sincere appreciation for our staff whose commitment, expertise, and professionalism throughout these extraordinary times has been exceptional. Now, let me turn the call to Jason to review our financial results for the quarter. Jason Tyler : Thank you, Mike. Let me join Mark and Mike in welcoming you to our fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. Let's dive into the financial statements of the quarter starting on page 2. This morning, we reported fourth quarter net income of $240.9 million. Earnings per share were $1.12 and our return on average common equity was 8.8%. The quarter's results included the following three items; first, a $55 million severance charge in connection with the reduction enforced. This charge relates actions we're taking to eliminate approximately 500 positions globally, representing about 2.5% of our staff. This is in line with our ongoing efforts around productivity and efficiency and expected to result in annual run rate savings of approximately $50 million on a net basis. Second, we recognized an $11.9 million occupancy-related expense relating to an early lease exit arising from our workplace real estate strategy. And lastly, we recognized $26.8 million in tax expense related to the reversal of tax benefits previously recognized through earnings. You can see on the bottom of page 2, equity markets performed well during the quarter. Recall that a significant portion of our trust fees are based on a quarter lag or a month lag asset levels and both the S&P 500 and EAFA local had strong sequential performance based on those calculations. It\u2019s worth noting that on a year-over-year basis the EAFE local index remains negative, which creates an unfavorable impact to our global fees compared to the prior year. As shown on this page, average one-month and three-month LIBOR rates continued stabilized during the quarter with only modest decline. Let\u2019s move on to page 3 and review the financial highlights for the fourth quarter. Year-over-year, revenue was down 2%, with non-interest income up 5% and net interest income down 20%. Expenses increased 7%. The provision for credit losses reflected the release of $2.5 million in the quarter compared to a release of $1 million in the prior year. Net income was down 35%. On a sequential comparison, revenue grew 3% with non-interest income and net interest income both up 3%. Expenses increased 5% and net income declined 18%. Return on average common equity was 8.8% for the quarter down from 14.8% a year ago and 10.5% in the prior quarter. Assets under custody and administration of $14.5 trillion grew 21% from a year ago and increased 11% on a sequential basis. Assets under custody of $11.3 trillion Assets under custody of $11.3 trillion grew 22% from a year ago and increased 11% on an sequential basis. Assets under management were $1.4 trillion, up 14% from a year ago and up 7% on a sequential basis. Let's look at the results in greater detail starting with revenue on page 4. Fourth quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $1.5 billion, down 2% compared to last year and up 3% sequentially. Trust administered -- investment and other servicing fees, representing the largest component of our revenue, totaled $1 billion and were up 3% from last year and 2% sequentially. Foreign exchange trading income was $69 million for the quarter, up 6% year-over-year and up 11% sequentially. The increase compared to a year ago was driven by higher volumes and higher volatility, while the sequential growth was primarily driven by higher volumes. The remaining components of noninterest income totaled $93 million in the quarter, up 32% compared to one year ago and up 2% sequentially. Within that, security commissions and trading income increased 16% compared to a year ago and up 24% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential growth were primarily driven by strong performance within our core brokerage business. Other operating income increased 52% compared to the prior year and was down 7% sequentially. The increase compared to last year was primarily driven by a $20.8 million charge in the prior year related to a decision to sell substantially all of the lease portfolio, partially offset by higher expense relating to Visa swap agreements. The sequential decline was primarily associated with lower income in the supplemental compensation plans which also resulted in a related decrease within other operating expense. Net interest income Expense. Net interest income which I'll discuss in more detail later was $345 million in the fourth quarter, down 20% from one year ago and up 3% sequentially. Let's look at the components of our trust and investment fees on page 5. For corporate institutional services business, fees totaled $596 million in the fourth quarter and were up 5% year-over-year and up 2% sequentially. Custody and fund administration fees were $420 million and up 6% year-over-year and up 6% on a sequential basis. The year-over-year performance is primarily driven by new business and favorable currency translation, partially offset by unfavorable non-US market. The sequential increase was primarily driven by new business. Higher transaction volumes, favorable currency translation as well as favorable markets. Assets under custody and administration for C&IS clients were $13.7 trillion at quarter end, up 21% year year-over-year and up 11% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential increases were attributable to new business, favorable markets and favorable currency translation. Investment management fees in C&IS of $125 million in the fourth quarter were up 8% year-over-year and down 9% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by new business and favorable markets, partially offset by money market fee waivers. The sequential decline was primarily driven by higher money market fee waivers. Assets under management for C&IS clients were $1.1 billion, up 15% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. The growth from the prior year was driven by favorable -- favorable markets, client flows and favorable currency translation. The sequential growth was driven by favorable markets and currency translation, partially offset by net outflows. Securities lending fees were $18 million in the quarter, down 22% year-over-year and down 11% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential declines were driven by lower spreads. Average collateral levels were up 6% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. Moving to our wealth management business, trust, investment and other servicing fees were $430 million in the fourth quarter and were up 1% compared to the prior year and up 3% sequentially. Both year-over-year and sequential performance were primarily driven by favorable markets partially offset by money market fund fee waivers. Assets under management for our wealth management clients were $348 billion at quarter end, up 11% year-over-year and up 9% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential growth were driven by favorable markets and net flows. Moving to page 6. Net interest income was $345 million in the fourth quarter was down 20% from the prior year. Earning assets average $131 billion in the quarter, up 22% versus the prior year. Average deposits were $115 billion and were up 29% versus the prior year. The net interest margin was 1.05% in the quarter and was down 54 basis points from a year ago. The net interest margin decreased primarily to lower interest rates as well as a mix shift within the balance sheet. On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income was up 3%. Average earning assets increased 1% on a sequential basis while average deposits were up 2%. The net interest margin increased 2 basis points sequentially primarily due to balance sheet mix and lower costs partially offset by lower asset yield. Net interest income also benefited in the quarter from approximately $5 million in nonrecurring benefits relating to the FTE adjustment and interest recovery in nonaccrual loans. Turning to page 7, expenses were $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter and were 7% higher than the prior year and 5% higher sequentially. The current quarter included a $55 million severance charge related to a reduction in force and an $11.9 million increase associated with an early lease exit arising from our workplace real estate strategy. Expense during the prior quarter included a $43.4 million charge related to a corporate action processing error. Excluding these items in each period, expenses were up 1% year-over-year and up 3% sequentially. Compensation expense totaled $525 million in the quarter and included $52.5 million in severance-related charges. Excluding the charge, compensation was up 2% from both a year ago and sequentially. The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by higher salary expense due to staff growth, base pay adjustments and unfavorable currency translation, partially offset by lower incentives. The sequential growth was driven by salaries and higher incentives. Employee benefits extend to $102 million, was up 10% from one year ago and up 5% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily related to higher pension expense. The sequential increase was driven primarily by higher medical costs. Outside services expense was $208 million in the quarter and included $2.5 million related to severance charges. Excluding the charge, outside services expense was flat compared to the prior year and up 11% sequentially. The sequential increase was primarily due to higher technical services, legal and consulting services and third-party advisory fees. Equipment and software expense of $176 million was up 7% from one year ago and up 3% sequentially. The year-over-year growth reflected higher depreciation and amortization as well as higher software support costs, partially offset by lower software disposition costs. The sequential increase was driven by increases in software disposition, software support and amortization costs. Occupancy expense of $67 million for the quarter included the previously mentioned $11.9 million occupancy charge. Excluding this item, the category was down 4% compared to the prior year and up 7% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was driven by lower rent, as well as lower building depreciation and real estate taxes. The sequential increase was primarily driven by higher building operation costs and real estate taxes. Other operating expense of $72 million was down 18% from one year ago and down 43% sequentially. Excluding the prior quarter\u2019s $43.4 million charge, costs were down 14% sequentially. The year-over-year comparison was primarily driven by lower expense related to business promotional activities. The sequential comparison was impacted by higher costs associated with the Northern Trust sponsored golf tournament in the prior quarter and lower costs associated with supplemental compensation plans. Turning to the full-year, our results in 2020 are summarized on page 8. Net income was $1.2 billion, down 19% compared to 2019 and earnings per share were $5.46, down 18% from the prior year. On the right margin of this page, we outlined the non-recurring impacts that we called out for both years. We achieved a return on equity for the year of 11.2% compared to 14.9% and 20.9% -- in 2019. Full year revenue and expense trends were outlined on page 9. Trust investment and servicing fees grew 4% in 2020. The growth during the year was primarily driven by new business and favorable markets, partially offset by the impact of money market fee waivers. Foreign exchange trading income grew 16%, driven by increases in market volatility and higher client volumes. Net interest income declined 14%. Average earning assets during the period increased by 16%, while the net interest margin declined 41 basis points to the low interest rates. The net result was flat, overall revenue in 2020 compared to 2019. On a reported basis, expenses were up 5% from the prior year. Adjusting for the expense items noted in both year, expenses were up 3% from 2019. Turning to page 10, our capital ratios remained strong with our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 12.8% under the standardized approach and 13.4% under the advanced approach. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 7.6% under both the standardized and advanced approaches. During the fourth quarter, we declared cash dividends of $0.70 per share totaling $147 million to common stockholders. Now looking back at 2020 showed the importance of a strong capital base and liquidity profile to support our client's needs. And we continue to provide our clients with the exceptional service and solution expertise they've come to expect. As we begin the new year, our competitive position in wealth management, asset management, and asset servicing continues to resonate well in the marketplace. Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust fourth quarter earnings conference call today. Mark, Mike, Lauren, and I will be happy to answer any of your questions. Madison, please open the line. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll go ahead and take our first question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr : So, I appreciate you noted that the 4% fee growth in 2020 some of that market, some of that new business. In the press release, you referred to the growth agenda. I wonder if we could just revisit what reasonable expectations and reasonable markets whatever that means could be for trust fee growth over the coming years, and where your investments are made under this -- are being made under this growth agenda. I appreciate that. Mike O\u2019Grady: Sure, Glenn. So, let me start on the growth side and separate the business into the two reported segments, and maybe touch on asset management as well. In C&IS, the quarter and frankly the year reflected good growth. And you see 6% sequential growth from a trust fee perspective in C&IS. A point of that 6% comes from more macro factors between currency markets. But 5 points to that 6% come from good growth in the business. That said, I'd provide a little caution there by splitting that 5% in half and saying about 2.5% coming from what you would think of as very traditional trust fee growth that's more ongoing in nature and then about 2.5% coming from items that are more onetime in nature. And so that could be true-ups on pricing and transaction-related volumes that we wouldn't necessarily consider predictive of what's going forward. But certainly, we viewed the fourth quarter for C&IS as onboarding significant new business. There were a couple of very significant pieces of new business onboarded there and the pipeline in the short run still feels good. If we shift to wealth management and think about the growth there, the business did an outstanding job I think of engaging with clients over the course of the year. The growth there -- and this is fine. This is the nature of that financial model. It came more from growth in equity markets over the course of the year. It was a very odd year for onboarding new clients in wealth, and so we'll see what that looks like going forward. But couldn't feel stronger about how the group did from client interaction over the course of the year. And then a difficult one to predict is asset management. We obviously had extraordinary growth into the money market mutual funds and it's anybody's guess how long that stays on and whether or not we see a shift back to more risk on transactions or not and what the growth looks like there. But I also have to say that business is working on other elements as well to try and bring organic growth into the business. You asked about where we're investing as well and there are several areas. Each of the businesses has their own view of where they're investing, and you see some of those coming to fruition in different areas. But one constant theme across the company is digital. And you'll see in every aspect of the business how we're trying to ensure we're connecting better with clients in our digital engagement. And you see that show up in the income statement in a couple of different line items and outside services and equipment software, for example. Glenn Schorr : I appreciate all of that. My one tiny follow-up is if you could just give a little more color on the wealth management fees only up 1%. I know we have some lag pricing coming and the fourth quarter was up huge. But just curious what might be holding back on the fees even without adding new accounts, markets are good. Just give us a little more color. Thanks. Mike O\u2019Grady: Sure. Well, you hit on a key item which is that there is a lag that takes place there. And then secondly, I think it\u2019s a little harder for you to see. But we did have positive flows in the fourth quarter in the wealth business which was good. And I do think even if you\u2019d said we were going to go through this environment of not being able to be in front of clients a lot and it's just -- it's very, very difficult to test the growth in the wealth business based on what we went through this year in terms of how we're interacting with clients. I would say that the overall trends of clients using us for deposits and also the flows we saw particularly in fourth quarter, I think it\u2019s everyone got more attuned with doing normal business more electronically and more virtually is a relatively positive sign. Glenn Schorr : Okay. Appreciate all of that. Thanks so much. Mike O\u2019Grady: Thanks, Glenn. Operator : All right. We'll go ahead and take our next question from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Alex Blostein : Hey, Jason. Good morning. So maybe building on Glenn\u2019s question also a little bit, in the past, you guys have talked about fee growth kind of aligning with expense growth. You've announced a couple of obviously expense-cutting initiatives that should help 2021, maybe even trickle down into 2022. The market is obviously a big helper. So help us understand maybe how that relationship should progress through 2021 and maybe you can talk to that both sort of including the tailwinds from markets and excluding that, meaning that if fees are up including the benefit of the market, how much of that will naturally trickle down into higher expenses and are you still kind of targeting organic expense growth to mimic organic fee growth excluding the market? So, a couple of things in there but I can clarify if it's not 100% but maybe we can start there. Mike O\u2019Grady: I'm going to take the theme as operating leverage and organic growth, and you tell me if I hit on too little. So first of all, as I think back on the year and we've been talking about it internally, one of the things that jumps out is we did have -- it was a positive year in terms of fee operating leverage. And if you look at the last few years, you go back to 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, we -- it was relatively close to zero which actually isn't bad because over time we'll get market lift. But in 2017, we had adjusted fee operating leverage as it was positive at about 0.7. 2018 was plus 1.6. 2019 was negative 0.5. 2020 was actually positive at 1.6. And then if you unwrap the quarters within 2020, third quarter plus 2 points and fourth quarter is plus four which is one of the best quarters -- maybe the best quarter we've had since we started tracking this number closely over the last five years or so. But I can appreciate that from your perspective people are always trying to how do we match that to what we would expect on the income statement. And so let me just flip to the supplement, flip to the press release table and go to the detail, the year-over-year detail which is page 1 of the supplement and let\u2019s just -- I think it might be helpful for people to circle a couple. This is how I think about the quarter and the overall run rate in hindsight. If you take trust fees of $1,026 million last year, take out -- let's exclude sec lending. So, take out $17.6 million. Take out waivers of $23.5 million. And we had market lift zero in C&IS, there's probably $10 million to $15 million in Wealth. And so you get to about a $10 million, $20 million. And then you compare that to 2019 and for the quarter take out sec lending again and you get something like $970 million. And so the growth is more like $970 million to $1,020 million. That's 500 basis points of growth. And that gets more to how we look at it. And then you compare that to the expenses, do the same type of analysis and take the $1,151 million, take out the $55 million in severance we talked about take out the $12 million in real estate, and you get to $1,084 million. And then compare that to the $1,072 million, it\u2019s more like a point. And then, compare that to the 1072, it\u2019s more like a point. And so, those are the line items I think to look at and to kind of do an analysis to at least, you're getting closer to how we think about it. And by the way, I didn't even -- I didn't even add in how we moved from the reported to the organic numbers on the expense side. There's things like third party advisory fees and other stuff which we take out. But that's how we track internally. Those are the first numbers we're looking at. So hopefully, that's helpful in getting at the spirit of what you're asking. Alex Blostein : Yeah. It definitely helps. I was thinking that maybe we can talk a little bit more kind of perspectively as you think about 2021. And I know you guys are not in the business of giving explicit guidance, but obviously there are some cost initiatives there at play. And I'm just kind of trying to think about like given normal market conditions, given your sort of views on the pipeline and the organic growth into 2021, what is the outlook for expense growth? Maybe a little more explicitly. Mike O\u2019Grady: Yeah. Alex, it's Mike. Why don\u2019t I jump in here as well, just to build on what Jason said. To your point, I -- we do look at that relationship between organic fee growth and then our expense growth. And when we see that the environment is making it more challenging on the organic fee growth side, absolutely need to focus more on the expense to make sure that we have that positive relationship. And then, Jason went through. We were able to achieve that in 2020. Now again, very unusual year. I would say on both sides of that relationship. But that's what we're looking at going into the next year. Now, if we have the opportunity to grow faster organically and profitably, then, we'll look to do that. But not knowing that, we don't want to go in with higher expense expectations. and then have another year where it's very unpredictable as to your ability to onboard that new business. So, that absolutely, the relationship holds and it's just in different environments, you have to attack differently. Alex Blostein : Got it. Okay. Great. That was helpful. Thank you both. Operator : All right. We'll go ahead and take our next question from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I just wanted to revisit the outlook on the fee waivers and the NII. I know there's a great deal of uncertainty and it's all really subject to what's happening to rates particularly on the short end. But I believe, Jason, you had updated the guide to the upper end of around 35%. I think the range was 25% to 35% and you said tacking to the upper end of that on the waiver\u2019s front. And so, I just was curious whether or not we should assume that that holds since you didn't update it. And then you also have in the past said that, I think you had said that you expected NII to be generally stable from 4Q levels, of course, depending on what happens with loan growth. So, is that still true and how are you thinking about loan growth from here? Thanks. Mike O\u2019Grady: So, let me take those, I think, three questions. So, on waivers, the $35 million run rate is pretty good. And I think from here, it's less about what we can see internally from repricing and it's more what you guys can see externally from what's happened in the short end of the yield curve, so overnight repo and what does the short end of the curve look like and AUM and so, I think for the run rate on an annual basis right now is $140 million to -- it\u2019s $140 million to $150 million. And that we expect to hold in. The book is effectively 100%. It's 98%, 99% 100% reprice at this point. And so, from here, it's those factors that I mentioned that -- and I think the key is to be careful and ensure you realize that disparity between C&IS and Wealth, and where the waivers are hitting because the wealth waivers -- well, because the wealthy fee rates are tend to be higher, they got into waiver land first. But the AUM is in its high. And so, now that rates have come all the way down and the duration isn't protected anymore, the waivers are actually going to be heavier in C&IS. And the relationship's not linear. It's their step functions in the middle because you've got some very large funds that kick in at certain levels right around where we're investing right now. But those are the key things I'd want you to keep in mind as you try and model out waivers. On NII, I did mention there's probably $5 million of the $345 million that was more onetime in nature. And so, from there, I think actually very similar theme to what I touched about on waivers. From this point forward, it's pretty predictable. The things that -- we've communicated things we can see, which are that we're running off $1 billion to $2 billion a quarter at about 100-basis-point delta. And so, that gets you $3 million, $4 million, $5 million of drag, about a 1.5 point maybe on a sequential basis. And that has been offset over the last couple of quarters by deposit levels hanging in higher than what we thought of -- than what we thought and also loans hanging in higher than we thought. You'll also notice in this quarter there is a little bit of a shift from the money from central bank deposits into the securities portfolio. Nothing dramatic there, but that was also somewhat protective. And that'll stay going forward. And so from here, the key things are what do you think is going to happen with loan volume, what do you think is going to happen with deposits, and what do you think is going to -- and then also, we're obviously losing two days coming from fourth quarter to first which is probably $3 million, $4 million a day. And then you asked about loan growth. And it's been a positive surprise that loans have held in there. It's something we've talked about internally. We've been we've been working on it, make sure -- making sure that we're talking to clients about our appetite and what our whole levels and interest levels are. And again, clients tend to come to us for liquidity. And there's some correlation between the deposits and the loans for sure. And so that's been a positive that it's held in, and it's been one of the offsets to that continued drag of a point or so a quarter. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Great. That's all helpful color. I appreciate that, Jason. So when we think about organic growth, you walked through -- in response to an earlier question, you walked through some of the rates and some of the kind of profile has looked which is helpful. Is the back half of the year more like what we should expect, kind of like a 2% to 4% organic? Does that seem like something that you guys can hold in this weird environment that we had all stopped dealing with for a little longer, I guess. Is that the way we should think about it from here? And just kind of as a tack-on for that, I think you guys had said there was a nonrecurring servicing fee in wealth, so if it's possible to quantify that, that'd be great, too. Thanks for my multipart questions here. Mike O\u2019Grady: Sure. So, the nonrecurring servicing fee in wealth, it was a couple of million dollars and just has to do with some -- it\u2019s typical business for us. It\u2019s a estate settlement-type work and other items. There's a couple of real estate-related items. But I think a couple of million dollars. On organic growth, broadly, I think you can go back to separating it. [Indiscernible] would say the part of reinsurance in fourth quarter, part of it was a catch-up of some of the new business we had that was in the one-not-funded category. And so, certainly, shouldn't expect 6% sequential continued increases there. But that said, the pipe -- and we had said earlier in the year that we felt like the pipeline had been delayed but not cut off. And so, this fourth quarter was not super surprising to us and that we were able to get onboarded a lot of the new business that we -- that had been delayed. And so, that's good. The other piece of good news is the near-term pipeline. Their view is it still seems decent. And that said, the longer-term pipeline, they're paranoid about. And so, that's just something to watch. On the wealth side, it's more of a continued story underneath the numbers that you see there. GFO continues to have to expect the business to do pretty well. And the east region continues to do pretty well, not necessarily quarter to quarter but over longer periods of time. And then you see the other regions that are more mature not doing and not having the same migrational benefits that the east region does. So that includes Florida and the development of wealth on the East Coast not as robust. And so it will be interesting to see whether or not the experience we had in 2020 of not being able to be in front of clients as much, how much impact that had in suppressing organic growth. Brennan Hawken : That's helpful. Thanks. And you found some paranoid salespeople. That's remarkable. Usually they're optimists. Mike O\u2019Grady: Well, that's a very optimistic group, but they are always making sure that we're not taking in too much on the back end. Operator : All right. We can go ahead and take our next question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : So, yeah, just wanted to dig in a little bit to some of the organic growth commentary particularly on the wealth outside. So you cited the positive growth trends in 4Q. But taking a step back, the organic growth in the wealth business was much more tepid since the start of COVID. And maybe it\u2019s a little bit tough to reconcile given some of your wealth peers. But admittedly greater focus on less affluent cohorts are seeing some acceleration over the past few months across both the wire house and independent channels. I know there are idiosyncratic factors that drive some divergence in organic growth trends, but if you can give some insight in terms of what we should be looking for as the economic recovery continues and this vaccine deployment just to better anticipate the timing of getting back to again growth getting back to a more normalized run rate? Mike O\u2019Grady: I think it's hard to predict. I think it\u2019ll -- a lot of it will depend on how things open up again. And I think it's also important to keep in mind -- and I don't know specifically the peers you're talking about at all. We deal -- we're targeting a client base that's really the upper end and imagine unplugging the -- getting the comfort level, the confidence level to unplug potentially generations of connectivity with a family office from a custody perspective, from an investment management perspective and putting that back in place again. And so again, the business had -- is lower but positive flows for the quarter for the year. And so we're all looking and monitoring and seeing what it looks like but not surprising that in this environment some of the organic growth maybe not look as strong as what it has been historically. Mike, I don't know if you want to add any perspective from your loans line. Jason Tyler : Yeah. I think it's a fair and appropriate question, Steven. And when you think about fee growth for wealth management, as you know there's a number of drivers in that overall fee number. And so if you break it down a little bit, for us there's an advisory component to it. And then there's the investment management fee component to it as well. So, right there you can have different dynamics within that. So, Jason saying we've been building the business but you could have -- and that will drive the advisory fee. But on the investment product side, if you will, where they're utilizing Northern Trust product and others, because we're open architecture. That will have a dynamic as to what's happening to the overall wealth management fees. And, again, our approach with our clients, as Jason pointed out, is to give them a holistic approach to this in outcome. So I -- through different environments, that's going to have a different impact on what the outcomes is -- outcomes are for that mix. And then, beyond that, I would say that's just the fee component. Again, these are holistic relationships that involve banking as well. And so, there's always going to be a shift there between what they put into funds versus what may go on the balance sheet and situations where they're borrowing more. Credit is a bigger component. And those are important as well. We focus a lot on fees for the right reason. But overall, the relationships are much broader, and we're looking to drive those fee lines or revenue lines as well. Steven Chubak : Now thanks for that color. And I just want to follow up on why that's on capital management? Now you\u2019ve had some of your trust fund peers actually outlined some pretty explosive capital targets either somewhere in the zone of a 10% to 11% to Tier 1 or 5.5% to 6% Tier 1 leverage target. I know you've never wanted to deviate from the pack despite not being part of adhesive cover and depending how strong the capital ratios are, as we think about the XUV framework, potentially this payout restriction getting lifted hopefully in the not too distant future, how you guys are picking up the pace of buybacks and capital return and some of those restrictions that are openly active. Mike O\u2019Grady: Now the -- from a capital perspective, in aggregate, you're right, at 12.8% CET1 and at 7.6% on Tier 1 leverage. We feel strong in terms of -- and by any measure in terms of our capital levels. And we certainly, if you think about our overall payout ratio for last year, it was, and particularly the last three quarters, lower than what we would have anticipated. But coming into the year and having the ability to get back to stock repurchase, I'm a broken record on this, but the framework of what are our conversations with the board. Secondly, what do we think about on an absolute basis and how do we want to ensure we're competing externally, not just being at strong capital levels, but how does that resonate with very large family office clients or sovereign wealth funds that look very, very heavily at whether or not they're dealing with financial institutions that are strong, what do the capital levels look like on a relative basis. So, we can say we're not just strong but we're strong relative to our peers. And then lastly, regulators, very big influence in terms of what they're looking for. And so, that -- all that is a mosaic that plays in along with looking at what our return alternatives are as we think about investing in the business. We talked about what we're doing in terms of digital. We've talked about what we're doing in terms of building different, more technologically, deep operating models for our C&IS business. We've done things within the asset management business to ensure that we can have the product set and the technology to be a strong provider of liquidity products that took investment two, three, four years ago. And you couple all that with looking at what -- how we think about the stock on a relative basis from a valuation perspective. And so, it's not one where we say we're going to go down to 12% or we're going to go down to 7% in Tier 1 leverage. It really truly is a conversation. We're looking at all of the factors I just mentioned and determining what's best from a capital perspective. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go ahead and take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Look, you need to spend money to make money. I get it. And your core fee growth is about 500 basis points better than trust bank peers. But on the other hand, expenses were up across the board. And so I guess the first question is was there any extra onetime or elevated expenses in the fourth quarter as you onboard additional business? And specifically, the punch line, do you expect to have fee growth in 2021 faster than expense growth especially with like pricing on a lot of your products? Mike O\u2019Grady: So, on the expense side there were some onetime items that -- the severance charge, $65 million, occupancy, but specifically related to the new business coming on, the timing of that matters. And it's true as you bring on a very, very large clients, some of the clients -- if it's just a custody mandate that may not require us bringing on additional people. If it's investment outsourcing, investments operations outsourcing, then that's going to take people and it'll take people upfront in advance so they can get onboarded and trained in advance of us bringing the assets on and billing. And so that can certainly happen. That's the dynamic that -- that's why we tend to not think about an absolute expense growth level because we can have the foresight in looking at what the new business wins are and what the expense needs are to handle that intra-year unless it\u2019s coming at the very beginning or the very end of the year. And so, as we look into 2020 and as Mike was hinting at earlier -- into 2021 is what Mike was hinting at earlier, we -- our expense experience is going to be driven in very large part based on what we're onboarding, not just the size of it but the nature of it. I think that's something that is very important for people externally to realize. Mike Mayo : So, are you -- I know you don't always answer this question, but for 2021, do you expect fee growth to be faster than expense growth? Mike O\u2019Grady: That's always the -- that\u2019s the goal. That's in -- and that's why we spent a lot of time even this morning talking about that. That if we have -- regardless of where fee growth is, that's how we're testing what the expense growth is. Now, there are often items on the expense lines that are not related to what the -- to bring on new business. And so, last year, we had to -- we brought on $30 million in additional pension expense. That has not -- that has to do with what's the expected return on assets, what's the discount rate. Those are not related. But we actually highlighted those items last year. We talked about real estate commitments, we talked about pension, and we talked about base pay adjustment that we'd committed to last year. And this year, as we come into this year, we're -- it's probably noteworthy that we're not saying any of those items. And pension is a million-dollar drag year-over-year. And I think you can take the occupancy that we had in fourth quarter strip out the $12 million, and you get to a decent run rate. And you should see between comp, you should start to see the direct charges that we talked about start to bed in to about start to bed in to those two line items. And then the other thing we should expect before we get to new business, the equipment and software, that's been a faster growth item. And that's likely going to continue as we make sure we're where we want to be from a digital perspective and outside services. And so from there, Mike, it comes down to -- from those items it really comes down to what new business comes on board. Mike Mayo : Okay. I kind of have a follow-up question. And this is relates the question from a couple of questions ago. If you think of the food chain, and you can correct this framework that I'm going to give you, but from the low end to the high end, the low end would be maybe it's Robinhood or some of these smaller fintechs with a small amount -- huge retail engagement and lots of revenues. Some reports say that New York Stock Exchange volume has gone from 10% to 20% retail trading. And so that\u2019ll be the bottom. And then you get online broker, you get mass affluent, you get private banking and you get the family office. And as you go from left to right, you go from more revenues today, more activity during the pandemic and more erratic, more lumpy. And when you get to your business it's a lot more stable. It's annuity like but maybe not as elevated revenues as it is today. So as you think about the advice business, is it moving more down-market and do you need to move down-market with it or do you view some of the activity down-market over the past six or nine months as kind of one-off? Jason Tyler : Yeah. Actually it\u2019s a conversation we have a lot internally and Mike, why don\u2019t you\u2026 Mike O\u2019Grady: Sure. Mike. First of all, I'd say I would agree with your framework at a very high level as you think of that kind of low to high and the characteristics as you move up that spectrum. And you're absolutely right. We are focused on the upper end of that spectrum. And one point that it highlights is I'll say both the importance of retention but also the benefits of retention. So I'm not going to speak to turnover or what may happen on the lower end because, again, that's not where our business is focused. But I can tell you on the higher end, you have time periods like 2020 where that model of holistic advice and high level of service results in very high levels of retention. So excellent year in retention at that level. But if you said was there a lot of trading activity with that, the answer is no. In fact, as you heard in some of my opening comments there, that's exactly what we, I would say, counseled our clients against because we're goals-driven. And so instead of trading out and then trying to get back in, it resulted in our clients actually doing well through that because they stuck to their goals-driven framework. And then to your point of, well, then how do we think about the growth opportunity going forward, there's still a significant opportunity for us to grow at the upper end of that. So you put GFO at the top, as Jason pointed out, that part of the business has been growing at a high rate for us. And again, we think we are differentiated at that end. And then absolutely, call it, below that with ultra-high net worth, likewise seeing very good growth, continued growth there and still plenty of opportunities. Because as much as just kind of leave that lower and decide for the time being, even in the environment that we're in, there's a tremendous amount of wealth that's being created. That means that there are opportunities for us, whether that's family businesses being sold or companies going public and the executives being in a position of having wealth that needs to be managed in a way that we do it. So we still feel very good about that part. And it's not to say that we don't service clients that are below that ultrahigh net worth end of the market. And frankly that's where a lot of the digitalization efforts that we have underway in wealth will allow us to serve that part of the market. But in a much more efficient way. And so that will enable that growth in that part of the market to be more profitable, more scalable. Operator : I\u2019ll then go ahead and take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Good morning. A bit of a follow up there. In the past you've mentioned that your acquisitions particularly in wealth and intermediary distribution. And I just wanted to understand what level of appetite at this stage given some of the organic opportunities you have. And then maybe layering onto that capabilities when you talk about wealth creation. I'm kind of sitting here thinking about, well crypto got a lot of wealth creation and maybe there's a sleeve there that you could add, so maybe just to speak to that. Thanks. Mike O\u2019Grady: I'll take that Betsy. It's Mike. So to your point, historically our acquisitions have focused on capabilities and that's been across the businesses. So asset management, wealth management and asset servicing, we've done a number of capability type acquisitions which then we're able to leverage that capability and our business model and grow. And there's a number of examples of that. For that type of acquisition, you're right. We continue to look at areas where those types of additions will enable us to further grow with client bases and importantly in segments that are growing faster. So I'm not -- I won't address any one of them in particular. But to your point that can be very -- a very small either acquisitions or investments, for example, in C&IS, where we have a capability that's in an area that has innovative new technology. And then I would say, more broadly than that as far as just appetite, absolutely, to the extent we find something that fits strategically and is attractive financially, we're open and interested in doing that. We've done more, as you know, over time, in C&IS, on the asset servicing side. And I would say we'd be more interested or likely to do it in asset management or wealth management. Betsy Graseck : And just on the crypto side, I mean there's been some loose competitors adding crypto capabilities you're talking about, potentially adding it back on your radar screen or to out there. Mike O\u2019Grady: Definitely from a capability perspective, I -- you've seen some of the things that we've announced in order to have the capability to serve our clients. So, to the extent that digital assets continue to grow, and in the sense of used by not just, call it, personal or retail clients, but also moves more to institutional clients. Those are institutions we need to have the capabilities to serve them. And so, yes, both, I would say, on our own, but more importantly partnering with others to be able to meet those needs. Betsy Graseck : And so, to take a regulatory requirement change it all to do that? I know that OCT recently proved stable calling for banks, which maybe is a part of the announcement you need. But I'm just wondering from a regulatory perspective, is there any -- anything you need from that end to execute on that? Mike O\u2019Grady: Well, I would just say without getting into the specifics around digital assets and the regulatory framework on that, but it is a component. And so, you know from our perspective, there's a technical or technological aspect of it. There's a service aspect of it. Another is how does it fit with other things we're doing for those clients. And then to your point, there's a regulatory aspect. And then I would also say there's a financial aspect to it. So, how can you be compensated for the ability to provide, for example, custody for those types of assets. Betsy Graseck : Right. Yes. Okay. Back to real world deposits -- well, I shouldn\u2019t say real world, but the bread-and-butter here of balance sheet. Could you talk a little bit about how you're thinking about managing deposits? And so, we've heard from some folks that bringing on whether it's operating or non-operating deposits and others have been signaling that they really only want the operating deposits and they discourage non-operating. Can you tell us what your strategy is there as we think about balance sheet growth over the next year? Mike O\u2019Grady: I\u2019d come back to the capital levels and 12.8 and maybe more importantly at 7.6. We've got room to bring on deposits. And we want our balance sheet to be there for clients. And so, when we get -- reach out to clients saying we want to move. And sometimes it's very significant. Sometimes it's not millions of dollars or hundreds. Sometimes it's billions of dollars. And for existing long-term clients, we want to have the capacity to help them. And we have. In terms of how we deal with it, it's oftentimes they'll let us know that it's episodic. It's them moving It's episodic. It's them moving money. They might be liquidating position going somewhere else. And so, there's no formula for -- and so we're not going to take two-year duration on reinvesting those deposits. And that said, there's a component where we do know it's more stable. And so, if you look at the balance sheet, back to the press release tables, it's actually -- you can look at a handful of the line items and see how of the deposits that have come in really roughly half has gone to central banks and stayed short, and about half have gone and been reinvested more in the securities portfolio in one way or another, not out -- if it's an institutional deposit, and it seems from the nature of your question you understand the different regulatory treatment of the deposits as they come in and so we have to hold liquidity and capital for those. But in many instances, it's been -- it's enabled us to take the securities portfolio from $50 billion to $60 billion over the last year. Operator : Okay. We'll go ahead and take our next question from Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Mike Carrier : Good morning, guys. Just a few cleanups here. I think the core tax rate in the quarter is a bit elevated. And you guys mentioned in the release somewhere in the mix. But any change just how you're thinking about the outlook there? Mike O\u2019Grady: No. In general, we've been able to move some of the cash, if I understand your question, some of the cast down into the securities portfolio. Jason Tyler : No, on the tax rate to 28 in the quarter versus 24. Mike O\u2019Grady: Thanks. Thank you. Yeah. So the tax rate that was printed was higher. Obviously, if you take that out, you get back down to 28%. The difference being 28% to 24%, more episodic, it's not something that we think is longer term. We think 24% is still the right number in the long run. That said, I'll say fourth quarter can be -- even within that 24%, fourth quarter can be a tick higher than the 24%. Usually, you'll have first quarter that's a little bit lower. And then second, third, fourth quarter for different reasons a tick higher. But 24% over the course of the year is still good. It's still a good number in the long run. Mike Carrier : Okay. It makes sense. In the release, you guys mentioned some non-recurring fees just in wealth management during the quarter. Could you just explain those or maybe the magnitude since you highlighted it? Jason Tyler : Yeah, Mark, why don\u2019t you\u2026 Mike O\u2019Grady: Yeah, Mike. It\u2019s Mark. It's -- a couple of million was basically the number and it's for the types of services that might not be a recurring thing, a state services, real estate services that kind of thing, so -- and those were a little bit more elevated this quarter that helped some of those sequential growth. Operator : All right. We'll take our next question from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brian Bedell : All right. Good morning, folks. Just maybe on the net interest revenue, just if you could comment the trend into 1Q given we did see a big spike in deposits, I know that's typical of -- at calendar year end, maybe just to talk about deposit balances on an average basis whether they're trending --whether they are trending higher into 1Q, and then also on the loan strategy. But first of all, have the loans fully repriced now given the resets, provided there are some that have lagged? And then just your desire to extend more loans and that trend into 1Q for net interest revenue that can offset the day count and keep flat in 1Q versus 4Q. Mike O\u2019Grady: And loans are 85% repriced at this point. As I worked my way back up and let me know if I miss part of the question but locking from fourth quarter to first quarter, the loan balances and deposit balances have stayed elevated relative to where they were a year ago for sure. And -- but don't -- I really want to caution people to look at fourth quarter at the fourth quarter end of period. It was a particularly large spike that we had at the end of fourth quarter. And we did see that spike come down very quickly. And so -- what's a better predictor is looking at the average from fourth quarter and the average from fourth quarter to the average so far coming into fourth -- into first quarter. It seems the deposits are staying elevated at about that level. But just caution you from looking at how at that $171 billion balance sheeted at quarter end. Brian Bedell : And given those trends, do you think you could keep NII flat in 1Q and offset the day count? That's about $3 million per day headwind, $3 million to $4 million per day headwind on just the day count. Mike O\u2019Grady: That's right. I feel we've probably given I think what we know at this point and I think that what we know at this point and the drivers from what we just went through are going to be more how do large families and how do large institutions handle liquidity, and what happens with rates. And I think that -- I think you guys can monitor, guess at that pretty close to what we can. It's just hard for -- we wanted to be as transparent as possible on this. But there's just uncertainty that comes from what our clients are doing with their liquidity and it happens late in the quarter. And so, at this point, I feel like we've -- the description of how much of the securities portfolio is rolling off and what the impact of that is probably give you a starting point that we have from this point. Brian Bedell : Okay. Fair enough. And then just one on expenses. You talked a lot about it. Thanks for all the detail on the plan to continue to generate positive operating leverage. If I look at the expense trust fee ratio back up and then the money market fee waivers, it looks like 103%, which is an improvement from 106% to 107% last year. If you had to guess, if you just took your normal or your sort of expected organic growth over the long term and you'd say 8% equity market returns on an annual basis and given your expense management plans, on a calendar year basis, what do you think you might be able to get to parity between expenses and trust fees under those scenarios? Mike O\u2019Grady: Couple of things. One, it's not necessarily a specific goal to get to 100%. We wanted -- we want to get -- they want to get going past it and there's no magic between 101% versus 99%. Secondly, there are so many factors that go into what you just said and what type of business is coming in from a trust fee perspective, how much is driven by markets, are we growing from investment operations outsourcing versus custody versus wealth. And so that's what we've tried to give you a good launch point on expenses and then give very firm dynamics of what the key drivers are. But that's probably where we should leave what our predictions are over the course of the longer periods of time. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities. Jim Mitchell : Hey, good morning. Hey. Okay. So maybe if you could just give us a sense of -- we've talked -- we all kind of know what the downside risks are in NII and it doesn\u2019t -- and I think if we just exclude the idea of the Fed raising rates maybe we could just speak to what other drivers could be more positive, I guess, for NII going forward. Is it kind of a steepening in the middle of the curve? Is it mortgage rates and the impact on premium am or is it loan growth? Just trying to think through how we should think about upside risks to NII over the next 12 months. Mike O\u2019Grady: Yeah. So you hit on -- I think two of those three examples are the big ones. And if you get -- right now, if you look at the yield curve, it's interesting. There's not been any movement out for kind of overnight through two years. And so it hasn't really helped us. But if you look out farther kind of 5 to 10, that's where you've seen the life. But we're not buying a lot in between there in that space. And so we have some of that steepness start to come not even overnight, but if it starts to hit, two, three, four years that starts to change things. And then secondly, loan growth. You think about the difference we have in yield in loans versus even the securities portfolio let alone central bank deposits, really, really large. So those are really the two big items. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. Thanks. First question, on expenses. I guess, in the quarter, is there still any trailing impacts from COVID that would have impacted the numbers this quarter? Mike O\u2019Grady: It's slowed down a lot. We've had some -- we had some items early. And by the way, it goes both ways. I mean, please remember that travel is -- and I tried to highlight it in the opening comments by pausing more, but the business promotion expenses being down, that\u2019s COVID-related. And that\u2019s material. And that\u2019ll start to revert hopefully as things open back up again. And then there are also other savings, even cleaning millions of square feet of office space that we've been able to save. And so there's -- with that said, the flipside to it is that we continued to make investments on the resiliency environment that Mike hinted to in his opening comments. And so that means getting fresh equipment in the hands of existing partners. It means making sure that the technology package that new partners have enables them to work on a work-from-home basis that's more consistent. And so that said, I don't think those investments at this point -- and those investment decisions aren\u2019t tens of millions of dollars. The one area that you might connect to this is that we want to make sure that our technology because of being in a resiliency mode, we're continuing this journey of ensuring we're doing a lot from a technology perspective. And we do link that somewhat to somewhat to being in this resiliency period of time. Brian Kleinhanzl : And then a separate question on the loan growth. I mean, a lot of the peers were seeing down loans in the quarter and just deleveraging in general. You're seeing your loans holding. And I guess what's the driver of the loan growth there and can you kind of expect loan growth to continue to improve as you look out 2021? Thanks. Mike O\u2019Grady: Well, a couple things. I mentioned earlier that we have been spending more -- so that is deliberate in conversations we're having with clients letting them know that we're -- our balance sheet is here for them. And part of it is the nature likely of our clients starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel and starting to make more investments in different ways. So it's hard to -- it's very difficult to predict whether or not that increase is going to continue to develop over time or accelerate. I would say it hasn't declined. And even at the end of the -- even coming after that you're looking at where numbers were at year end where they had been just in the first two or three weeks of the year, I think the risk could decline. And it's hard to say this too confidently, but the risk of decline is low. We feel better about it stabilizing and hoping that it continues to increase somewhat. But we've had very stable loans for a long period of time and it's hard to see an environment where it goes up by several billions of dollars. We're talking about $1 billion or $2 billion has significant impact on our overall loan volumes. Operator : All right. We'll go ahead and take our next question from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Vivek Juneja : Thanks. Okay. Thanks, Mike, Jason, and Mark. First one, just a little clarification on a couple of the items you mentioned for the quarter. The fee waivers, Jason, you\u2019ve said $35 million. You\u2019re almost re-priced at the moment. But what was that in 4Q compared to the $35 million? Was that fully -- was that $35 million number for the fourth quarter also or is that currently in the what goes that into what's the change? And another question that you've had on the items you mentioned, the true-ups, 2.5% of growth from true-ups. That\u2019s about $10 million. Never really seen $10 million positive generally helping to have it on the negative side. What kind of true-up was this that was positive? Was it a contract terminated early that you got paid by the client or can you give some color on that? Mike O\u2019Grady: Sure. Well, fee waivers in third quarter -- in fourth quarter were $23.5 million. But, Mark, maybe it\u2019s better for you to explain the true-ups. Mike O\u2019Grady: Yeah. I think you're referring to the comment that Jason made about some of the nonrecurring type of organic growth. So I wouldn't -- not necessarily a true-up or an adjustment per se, but transaction volumes a true-up or an adjustment per se, but transaction volumes were higher during the quarter. And then we also have certain types of services that we might be doing for clients that are billed based on the period that we're doing them at. And so those are the kinds of, I would say, non-recurring fees once they come online. There was also -- there was also some true-ups that might happen from quarter to quarter, but not -- don't want you to think that there was a one $10 million item like that. It was more of kind of an aggregation of the types of fees that we see that might be a little more episodic than just the kind of recurring fees that we see each quarter. Vivek Juneja : And, Mike, I have a bigger picture question for you. The new business that you're seeing and I think the $13.5 trillion that you have in your CIS, the strong growth you've seen there, what client types are you seeing? That $13.5 trillion, how would you break that down, firstly, in terms of mutual funds versus pension versus insurance, etcetera, and where are you seeing more -- and hedge funds obviously and where have you seen more of that growth -- the strong growth you've seen recently? Mike O\u2019Grady: So, Vivek, it's Mike. So I\u2019d start off by just answering your question. Yes, it is across all of those groups if you broke down the $13 trillion. As far as growth, it's interesting because as you look across the globe, at least for us in 2020, we had stronger growth -- asset growth on the asset owner side in North America. And that just relates to having a large business there in the US, also in Canada and having nice growth during the year. But if you look at EMEA and the APAC region, the growth was more from asset managers. So for example, in APAC, specifically Australia, strong growth with asset managers there which, for us, is I would say a nice positive because that business started off years ago primarily focused on asset owners with the strategy over time similar to what we've done in other geographies to then build out the asset manager services. And so that's gone well. And as I mentioned in EMEA, the growth with asset managers primarily being driven in Luxembourg and Ireland where, again, we've made investments to grow those businesses over time. Vivek Juneja : And what percentage of your assets on the test would you say about asset winners North America versus EMEA versus APAC and\u2026 Mark Bette : Yeah. I mean -- this is Mark. So the geography breakdown we'll have in our 10K, I don't have that right in front of me. And it's hard even looking at the assets just because of the assets aren't going to be necessarily equally driving the fees. So a large custody mandate might have lower fees than a smaller fund mandate. So if we looked at the fees themselves, you're looking at, across the regions, almost 40% to 45% EMEA and similar in Americas and then APAC growing quite a bit. And then when you look at asset owners versus asset managers, when you look at the asset servicing fee that to about 60/40 or so at this point, asset managers. So, the assets though, it's not always an easy comparison just looking at the assets because that doesn't necessarily translate through the P&L. Operator : And we will go to our next question. Caller, you may go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, everyone. Thank you. Mike, can you show us or maybe Jason, obviously this year has been or this past year has been unprecedented. We all know that. With the Federal Reserve taking in its balance sheet to just about $7 trillion and many of your private wealth and corporate customers building on their liquidity which led to that incredible deposit growth you and your peers have seen in this past year, can you lay out a scenario where the deposits start to come down? I knew they\u2019re not going to come down right away. But if you look out over the next two years, when will you start to see that change and maybe deposits start pulling off the balance sheet? Mike O\u2019Grady: So, Gerard, to your point, difficult to predict something like that at a very high macro level. And Jason indicated this earlier, where we do see the assets begin to move and it would be true both on the balance sheet but also within the fund, within the money market fund is where our clients which I think is a good proxy for a certain part of the market want to deploy those funds in other ways. And so, to the extent and I think you're already seeing that in the increasing values in other markets, right? So equity is obviously done quite well. Well, that's -- more buyers and sellers as they say and some of that's coming from liquidity, where they're earning anywhere from zero to negative depending on the jurisdiction. And they're saying, well, I need to move into riskier assets. And so that's gradually what's happening, absent what the central banks will do. And so to your point -- at this point, the central banks have kind of said, they're going to stay where they are for an extended time period. So that would indicate you would expect these trends to continue. And then once they begin to shift, yet, similar to the rise in liquidity, you would expect to see a decrease in liquidity and that would then flow backwards, I'll call it, through the system. Unidentified Analyst : Very good. And then second there's been talk on your call today as well as some of your peers about all the different types of wealth managers and asset managers in the system. Can you guys talk about pricing pressure? Do you find that there's pricing pressure on different client categories? Or no, you really don't see it because of the product offerings that you\u2019ve got as well as your reputation of being one of the high quality wealth managers in the country? Mike O\u2019Grady: There's a pricing or fee pressure across all of our businesses. And that has been consistent for some time period. Now does it ebb and flow at different time periods given other dynamics within one of our businesses, for example or even within one of the services? Yes, but if you just start with your -- with the concept of fee pressure is there and it's our expectation that that will continue. Now on the other side of it, to your point is what is our competitive positioning and we very much our focus on providing a differentiated service across each of our businesses. And in doing so, our intent is to be able to offset the market fee pressure. Now, whether you can offset all of it or not, again it depends on many factors. But we are looking to have a differentiated offering in the marketplace and not be commodities as much as possible. In the fee pressure both on the institutional business as well as the personal or is it more on the customer institution business as guys see? Jason Tyler : Yeah. It's across the board. And again depending on the service or the product you can have more or less. But I would say it's across the board. Unidentified Analyst : Great. I really appreciate your insights. Thank you. Operator : All right. We can go ahead and take our next question from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, Brian. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks very much for the follow up. Just one last one on the balance sheet. On the lending strategy, Jason, you mentioned the balance sheet is there for the clients. Is there a change in thinking on that on the lending side, are you seeing more demand from your wealth clients in particular in terms of their desire to either borrow more to fund projects or to benefit from lower the rates or other cash needs. And are you more willing in the past to extend those loans. Then how do you think -- in terms of the size of the balance sheet, how you're thinking about share repurchase given that you are now allowed to buy back up to your quarterly average income for the first quarter? Mike O\u2019Grady: On the loan question, most importantly, there's not been a change in our risk appetite or risk strategy. I'd say if anything, it's just been a change in an intensification of our communications strategy with our clients about what we're -- about being here for them and then being willing to be supportive as they have liquidity needs. And the credit portfolio is held in extremely well obviously. And you look at charge-offs or de minimis over the course of 2020, and nonperformings crept up a tiny bit in fourth quarter, but still very, very low levels. Less than 40 basis points, I think, of the portfolio. And our watch list actually declined for the period. So, everything there looks good. It's been -- but that said, the bankers are intensifying their communication with clients about our lending capacity and willingness. And so, that's really the driver. And then as we think about the capacity of the balance sheet, the size of it, certainly not something that we're actively looking to change in any way. We obviously take the fact that we now have the ability to go back and do share repurchase seriously. It's something we've already started engaging with our board on, so that we can, at the appropriate time, be back in the market within the framework that I described earlier. But it's not something where we'd say we're trying to increase or decrease the size of the balance sheet or the capital level. It's not going to be monumental change from -- the fact that we were out of the market is not going to drive monumental change in how we think about the capital levels. Operator : All right. This concludes today's call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

This will allow us to move through the queue and enable as many people as possible the opportunity to ask questions as time permits. Thank you again for joining us today. Let me turn the call over to Mike O'Grady. Mike O'Grady: Thank you, Mark. Let me join in welcoming you to our first quarter 2021 earnings call. Amid the ongoing public health crisis, I hope you and your families are healthy and well. At Northern Trust, we continue to operate in what we call resiliency mode, which means we are focused on providing our clients continuity of service, while the majority of our employees worldwide are working remotely. Before turning the call over to Jason to walk through the financials in detail, I wanted to offer some brief comments on our performance for the quarter. Our results for the quarter resulted in earnings per share growth of 9% versus the prior year and a return on average common equity of 13.7%. Revenue was consistent with the prior year, as declines in net interest income and trading-related revenue were offset by 6% growth in trust fees. The persistent low interest rate environment has pressured our net interest income, as well as our trust fees as reflected by money market fee waivers. While overall year-over-year operating leverage was negative, the 6% growth in trust fees did produce 1 point of positive fee operating leverage, despite the impact of fee waivers, which reduced our trust fee growth versus the prior year by 5 percentage points. The current quarters\u2019 results also benefited from an improved economic outlook, which drove a $30 million release of reserves for credit losses. Throughout the past year, our strong capital base and liquidity profile enabled us to support the needs of our clients and this was demonstrated further during the first quarter, as we saw 10% sequential growth in average total deposits and 3% sequential growth in average loan balances. Throughout this challenging environment, we have effectively executed on initiatives to continue to drive organic growth within each of our businesses, one of our key strategic initiatives. Within Wealth Management, our digital marketing efforts and Northern Trust Institute have driven more conversations and engagement, and we\u2019ve experienced an increase in client engagement during the quarter. Within Asset Management, we have continued to see success and growth within ESG mandates, with assets under management of $139 billion at quarter end and our quant active strategies have experienced strong relative performance, providing us good momentum. In our Asset Servicing business, we continue to see organic growth during the quarter, with the success being well diversified across regions, products and client segments. Moving forward, we remain focused on continuing to effectively navigate through the persistent low interest rate environment, focusing on driving greater efficiencies, as well as continuing to grow organically in a scalable and profitable manner. Finally, I want to express my sincere appreciation for our employees whose commitment, expertise and professionalism throughout these extraordinary times continues to be exceptional. Now, let me turn the call to Jason to review our financial results in greater detail for the quarter. Jason Tyler : Thank you, Mike. Let me join Mark and Mike in welcoming you to our first quarter 2021 earnings call. Let\u2019s dive into the financial results of the quarter starting on page two. This morning we reported first quarter net income of $375.1 million, earnings per share were $1.70 and our return on average common equity was 13.7%. You can see on the bottom of page two, equity markets performed well during the quarter. Recall that a significant portion of our trust fees are based on quarter lag or month lag asset levels in both the S&P 500 and EAFE local had strong sequential performance based on those calculations. As shown on this page, average one-month and three-month LIBOR rates were stable during the quarter with modest declines. Move to page three and review the financial highlights of the first quarter. Year-over-year revenue is flat with non-interest income up 5% and net interest income down 17%. Expenses increased 5%, while net income was up 4%. In the sequential comparison, revenue grew 4% with non-interest income up 5% and net interest income up slightly. Expenses declined 3%. Net income increased 56%. Recall that the prior year -- the prior quarter included $66.9 million in expense relating to severance and occupancy charges. Excluding those charges, expenses were up 3% on a per -- on a sequential basis. The provision for credit losses reflected a release of $30 million in reserves in the quarter, compared to a provision of $61 million in the prior year and a release of $2.5 million in the prior quarter. The release in the quarter was driven by continued improvement and the projected economic conditions and portfolio credit quality relative to the prior quarter. Return on average common equity was 13.7% for the quarter, up from 13.4% a year ago and 8.8% in the prior quarter. Assets under custody and administration of $14.8 trillion grew 36% from a year ago and increased 2% on a sequential basis. Assets under custody of $11.5 trillion grew 40% from a year ago and increased 2% on a sequential basis. Assets under management were $1.4 trillion, up 29% from a year ago and up 3% on a sequential basis. Let\u2019s look at the results in greater detail starting with revenue on page four. First quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $1.6 billion, flat with the prior year and up 4% sequentially. Trust, investment and other servicing fees representing the largest component of our revenue, totaled $1.1 billion and were up 6% from last year and 4% sequentially. Foreign exchange trading income was $79 million in the quarter, down 12% year-over-year and up 15% sequentially. The decline compared to a year ago is driven by lower volume and lower volatility, while the sequential performance was driven by higher volumes. The remaining components of non-interest income totaled $101 million in the quarter, up 16% compared to a year ago and up 9% sequentially. Within this, securities commissions and trading income declined 17% compared to a year ago, but it was up 8% sequentially. The year-over-year decline reflected lower interest rate swap and transition management activity. The sequential performance was driven by strong growth within our core brokerage business, which includes our integrated trading solutions product. Other operating income totaled $55 million and was up 60% from one year ago and up 11% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was impacted by higher income and the supplemental compensation plans and a prior year market value adjustment for seed capital investment, partially offset by higher expense relating to visa swap agreements. The growth through the supplemental compensation plans had a related increased within our other operating expense. The sequential increase was primarily associated with lower expense relating to visa swap agreements. Net interest income, which I\u2019ll discuss in more detail later was $347 million in the first quarter, down 17% from a year ago and up slightly on a sequential basis. Let\u2019s look at the components of our trust and investment fees on page five. For corporate and institutional services business, fees totaled $621 million in the first quarter and were up 8% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. Custody and fund administration fees were $446 million and up 13% year-over-year, and up 6% on a sequential basis. The year-over-year performance is driven by new business, favorable currency translation and higher transaction volumes. The sequential increase was primarily driven by favorable markets, new business and favorable currency translation. Assets under custody administration for C&IS clients were $13.9 trillion at quarter end, up 36% year-over-year and up 2% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was driven by favorable markets, new business and favorable currency translation. The sequential performance is driven by favorable markets and new business, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation. Investment management fees in C&IS of $116 million were down 4% year-over-year and down 7% sequentially. Both comparisons were impacted by higher money market fee waivers, partially offset by new business and favorable markets. Fee waivers in C&IS totaled $28 million in the first quarter, compared to $11.4 million in the prior quarter. Assets under management for C&IS clients were $1.1 trillion, up 30% year-over-year and up 3% sequentially. The growth from the prior year was driven by favorable markets, client flows and favorable currency translation. The sequential growth was driven by favorable markets and net flow. Securities lending fees were $18 million in the quarter, down 22% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was driven by lower spreads, while the sequential performance was driven by higher volumes, partially offset by lower spreads. Average collateral levels were up 13% year-over-year and up 11% sequentially. Moving to our wealth management business, trust, investment and other servicing fees were $443 million and were up 3% compared to both the prior year and prior quarter. Fee waivers and wealth management totaled $22 million in the first quarter, compared to $12 million in the prior quarter. Across the regions both on a year-over-year and sequential basis growth were impacted by favorable markets, partially offset by higher fee waivers. Within global family office, fees were lower year-over-year and sequentially and primarily reflected higher fee waivers, partially offset by favorable market. Assets under management for our wealth management clients were $355 billion at quarter end, up 28% year-over-year and up 2% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was driven by favorable markets and client flows, while the sequential performance reflected favorable markets, partially offset by net outflows. Moving to page six, net interest income was $347 million in the quarter and was down 17% from the prior year. Earning assets averaged $141 billion in the quarter, up 27% versus the prior year. Average deposits were $126 billion and were up 33% versus the prior year. While loan balances averaged $34.2 billion and were up 6% compared to the prior year. The net interest margin was 1% in the quarter and was down 51 basis points from a year ago. The net interest margin declined primarily due to lower interest rates, as well as make shift within the balance sheet. On a sequential quarter basis net interest income increased slightly. Average earning assets increased 7% on a sequential basis, while average deposits were up 10%. The net interest margin declined 5 basis points sequentially partially due to the balance sheet mix shift and lower rates. Turning to page seven, expenses were $1.1 billion in the first quarter or 5% higher than the prior year and 3% lower sequentially. The prior quarter included a $55 million severance charge related to a reduction enforced and an $11.9 million expense associated with an early lease exit arising from our workplace real estate strategy. Excluding these items expenses were up 3% sequentially. Compensation expense totaled $519 million and was up 4% compared to the prior year and was down 1% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was driven by higher salary expense due to staff growth, prior year base pay adjustments, higher incentive expense and unfavorable currency translation. Excluding the charge in the prior period, compensation was up 10% sequentially, primarily driven by higher equity and cash based incentives. This quarter\u2019s equity incentives included $32 million in expense associated with retirement eligible staff, compared to $34 million in the prior year. Employee benefits expense of $103 million was up 60% from one year ago and up 1% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily related to higher retirement, medical and payroll withholding costs. The sequential increase was primarily driven by higher payroll withholding, partially offset by lower medical expense. Outside services expense was $196 million and was up 2% from a year ago and down 6% from the prior quarter. The year-over-year growth was driven by higher sub-custody, third-party advisor and market data costs, partially offset by lower data processing and consulting costs. Prior quarter included a $2.5 million charge. Excluding the charge costs were down 4% primarily due to lower legal, consulting and technical services related costs. Equipment and software expense of $177 million was up 9% from one year ago and flat sequentially. The year-over-year growth reflected higher software support and amortization costs. Occupancy expense of $51 million were down 1% from a year ago and down 24% on a sequential basis. The prior quarter included an $11.9 million charge relating to an early lease exit. Excluding that charge, the category was down 8% on a sequential basis driven by lower building operation costs and lower rent expense. Other operating expense of $72 million was up 16% from a year ago and relatively flat sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher supplemental compensation plan expense and other miscellaneous expenses, partially offset by lower business promotion and staff related costs. Turn to page eight, our capital ratios remained strong with our common equity Tier 1 ratio of 12% under the standardized approach and 12.8% under the advanced approach. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 6.9% under both the standardized and advanced approaches. During the first quarter, we repurchase 1.4 million shares of common stock at a cost of $136 million. We also declared cash dividends of $0.70 per share, totaling $151 million to common shareholders. The current environment continues to demonstrate the importance of a strong capital base and liquidity profile to support our client\u2019s needs. We continue to provide our clients with the exceptional service and solution expertise they\u2019ve come to expect. Our competitive positioning across each of our businesses, Wealth Management, Asset Management and Asset Servicing continues to resonate well in the marketplace. Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust first quarter earnings conference call today. Mike, Mark, Lauren and I would be happy to answer your questions. Olivia, please open the line. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Please go ahead. Mike O'Grady: Good morning, Glenn. Glenn Schorr : Good morning. Thanks very much. I guess my question is on organic growth. I heard a lot of commentary throughout your 18 minutes of prepared remarks. Thank you very much. On positive net flows across most parts of the business, I think in your prepared remarks, I heard you talk about ESG mandates within Asset Management, but maybe you can cover whether you quantify or qualify, I\u2019ll take either one, where you\u2019re seeing new business, what kind of business you\u2019re winning in Asset Servicing and has there been any pandemic related pause that is now freeing up a lot of them. So any color on that would be great? Thanks. Jason Tyler : Yeah. Mike, do you want to start on it? Mike O'Grady: Sure. So, Glenn, as you described there, we are seeing strong organic growth across the company and specifically in Asset Servicing. And I would say, the first place I would started the foundation of our growth strategy is retaining existing clients. And as you would imagine, going through the pandemic, being able to support clients has been extremely important. But also, I think, I earned us the right if you will to continue to serve our clients, many of them our largest clients. So that\u2019s been a big positive. Second, I would say is that, we have seen, I would say, a full return to marketplace activity. So our clients, both asset owners and asset managers are actively looking at their own operating models and looking for opportunities either to become more effective in how they invest on behalf of their beneficiaries or improving the efficiency of the way they do that. So, consolidating operations or providers, utilizing new technology and that has played very well into our strategies in Asset Servicing that we\u2019ve had underway for years. So thinking about things like front office solutions, which is an investment book of record for clients that have high levels of alternative assets, the ability to look at across their portfolio in order to manage their business and then thinking about our asset manager clients, our whole office strategy is definitely resonating as well, where we can provide services across front, middle and back office. So high level of activity and then, I would say, success with strategies we\u2019ve had in place for some time period. Glenn Schorr : Appreciate that. Maybe just the last follow-up on net interest income, the NIM was down 5, but deposits were up a ton, do you feel net interest income has now finally bottoms and maybe some backup of your thoughts behind that in terms of redeployment opportunities? Thank you. Appreciate it. Jason Tyler : Sure. I don\u2019t want to call a bottom on it. I mean, if you unpack the quarter effectively, we saw loan growth that was strong and up $1 billion and that has a few million dollar impact, if you take our average return on those assets. If you think anywhere from 175 basis points to 200 basis points on that $1 billion, you\u2019re going to get $4 million or $5 million in lift for the quarter. And then you also had, obviously, lift from the deposits overall. But that\u2019s offset by something that\u2019s more predictable going forward, which is we\u2019re still going to have reinvestment in -- as the security book continues to mature and that\u2019s still got some maturation to do. And so it\u2019s easier to predict what\u2019s going to happen on the reinvestment side, then what\u2019s going to happen on the loan side, but obviously, if we continue to see strong loan demand then that\u2019s more important than what we\u2019re seeing on the other components of volume. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi. Jason Tyler : Hi, Mike. Mike Mayo : I see at your Annual Meeting today a 2021 priority is productivity. So I was wondering if you could put some metrics around what you\u2019d like to achieve. And on the positive side, I see the headcounts down 1% quarter-over-quarter, the pretax margin the first quarter is back to the 30s, where it was not last year at all. But on the negative side, I have to imagine the fee waivers will continue and might actually increase. So where does it all end up and where would you like to get to this year? Mike O'Grady: Yeah. Let me take that in a few different buckets. You\u2019re right. The productivity is extraordinarily important. And we go and we scratch and claw and do everything we can to earn new business. That\u2019s hard to do. It\u2019s not overly predictable. But what we can do is exhibit extreme discipline on the productivity side. And so we haven\u2019t put external metrics to that, but we\u2019re looking at it a lot of different ways internally. We look at operating leverage, which we talked about earlier. We look at fee operating leverage and then internally we\u2019re able to look at organic trust fee operating leverage. And so from our perspective, we want to see -- we want to -- we don\u2019t want to just call expenses up or down, because a lot of our business relates -- a lot of our expenses relates to the amount of new business that\u2019s coming in. And if we continue to show growth in the different areas of the business, we\u2019re going to see lift in those expenses, we just want to make sure it\u2019s related in the proper way to the organic growth that\u2019s coming in. Now, you\u2019re right, headcount was down and that comes back to the initiatives that we talked about in January and so you see -- it\u2019s a meaningful reduction for us of about 300 headcount and that played through in lower salary expense for the company. And so that\u2019s -- those are meaningful movements and I think reflective of the discipline that and the commitment we have around expense management. Then on fee waivers, you\u2019re right, it\u2019s a -- that is a -- it\u2019s a very, very difficult dynamic that we\u2019re facing. And I also think people need to realize we\u2019ve talked about the fact that the $50 million we have this quarter, we\u2019re still seeing lower rates on the short end of the curve. As much as we\u2019ve seen the one year, five-year, 10-year up, we\u2019ve seen overnight repo at zero and one and that\u2019s very difficult for a $275 billion pool of money market funds. And that\u2019s why we\u2019ve tried to give consistent information, not guidance, but a consistent run rate on how those fee waivers are going. And as we sit right now that number looks more like $65 million to $70 million on a quarterly run rate basis. Now, hopefully, as the Fed balance sheet changes, we see some improvement there. But that\u2019s where we sit today and so it\u2019s something we have to monitor and obviously it has a big impact on the pretax margin you identified. Mike Mayo : And then the one tailwind you have I guess the higher asset values, can you remind us of the relationship between every change in the stock market and your fees? Mike O'Grady: Sure. It\u2019s going to varies by the areas of business that we\u2019re talking about. In general 60% in C&IS, 60% -- about 60% are based on asset values in some ways and then in wealth, you can split it even more. Mark, you might have those numbers close to the top of your head, but it\u2019s\u2026 Mark Bette : Right. Yeah. The 60% in C&IS is really the asset values, which would be all asset values, equity mark -- equity assets, as well as fixed income or cash. And then as we look across in wealth management, there is more of a relationship there to the assets, but the equity sensitivity if that\u2019s what you are looking at is a little different. And the regions the equity sensitivity is probably 50% to 55%, whereas when you get to the global family office, there the equity sensitivity is probably closer to a third\u2026 Mike O'Grady: Yeah. Mark Bette : \u2026 just because of the way the client\u2019s assets are allocated. Operator : Thank you. We will now go to Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So, first on the loan -- on the balance sheet growth here, quite robust deposit growth. It was a pretty significant inflection from how things were trending in the back half of last year and so I am curious about your thoughts there? How much of this do you view as excess? It seems as though a lot of the Central Bank deposits on the asset side went up, which would imply that you might think this is -- these are short duration deposits. So if you could give maybe some color on what your expectations are for the sustainability of this growth in deposits and how you might be thinking about redeploying those deposits over time and how much time do you need in order to do that? Mike O'Grady: Sure. So you\u2019re right, I mean total interest-related deposits up, interest-bearing deposits up and I think the good news is that interestingly we were able to hold on to the margin. You saw a decline in LIBOR and even in that book we also saw a decline in cost. And despite the fact that part of the book is below zero and I think that\u2019s meaningful. To get to your question about volume levels and the net -- the nature of the deposits, there\u2019s no doubt a lot of those deposits are non-operational and so we need to let them season before we would do much beyond putting those at Central Banks. That said, there are other things we can do, because we\u2019ve got capacity in the balance sheet. But obviously, the nature of how we run the treasury book is to let those types of deposits, the ones that are more institutional and might be more trans -- more transitional season before we would take longer term exposure on those. Brennan Hawken : Okay. All right. Thanks. Appreciate that. And then when we think about, I think, you would had commented Jason in the -- in response to Glenn\u2019s question about, really, when you think about NII, it\u2019s a footrace in between loan growth and reinvestment rates. I think your loan growth picked up bit here this quarter versus the trend of the back half of last year, but period end, not necessarily all that higher than the average. So how should we think about loan growth from here? What are you seen as far as demand for loans amongst your clients? And is the rate for that loan book still -- are we still better off looking at the one month and three-month LIBORs to think about those rates? Thank you. Jason Tyler : Sure. So, first of all, the loan growth has come almost exclusively or the vast, vast majority has come from the Wealth Management side of the business. And even though in dollars, it\u2019s not as big as the deposits, the impact is much more meaningful. And having $1 billion in higher average deposits, it -- that\u2019s quite meaningful for NII and we\u2019ve talked very consistently about the fact that the deposit levels are, interesting they\u2019re chunky, but don\u2019t really do too much on NII. It is difficult to predict what the loan demand will be. However, what we\u2019ve experienced isn\u2019t simply, I\u2019d say, random. We\u2019ve talked about the fact that we have been communicating with clients more aggressively and this is over the last year and a half, two years, about our desire to be with them and be a liquidity provider for them. Our liquidity engagement with clients is it\u2019s a big part of our business and that shows up not just in what we do with the balance sheet on the -- on deposits but also money market funds, where, again, $275 billion in AUM there and also on the lending side, particularly on the Wealth Management clients. And so it\u2019s more -- this has been, I think, more of a strategic lift and so that\u2019s not predictive that it\u2019s going to hold on or continue to accelerate. But we don\u2019t see it is something that we\u2019re dismissing is potentially random either. Operator : Thank you. We will now go to Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Mike O'Grady: Good morning, Alex. Alex Blostein : Great. Good morning, guys. Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I want to shift gears a little bit, maybe talk about capital a little bit and obviously continue to be in very strong position across all the key ratios. Can you guys remind us or kind of how you think about the binding constraints for Northern Trust, obviously, relative to regulatory minimums. That\u2019s not kind of how you set the bar, you typically look at your peers. So given some of the changes that they have made and kind of how they\u2019re thinking about setting the minimum levels they\u2019re willing to run with? How does that inform your view of access capital at Northern Trust and then, ultimately, how does that translate into your appetite for increased buybacks from here? Mike O'Grady: Sure. So, you\u2019re right, that it\u2019s less of a process, it\u2019s less of an algebraic calculation and more where we want to be on a relative basis at this point. We -- I\u2019ve -- you guys have heard us talk consistently about thinking about our engagement with the Board where we\u2019re totally aligned, but we want to make sure that that conversation continues to take place, where are we on an absolute basis, how we think about things on a relative basis and how we think about things from a regulatory perspective. And right now I\u2019d say just keeping an eye on what the industry doing -- is doing is important. So the absolute levels less so. We\u2019ve got plenty of room obviously from a CET1 perspective sitting at 12 given where the regulatory minimum are. And so if you think about Tier 1 leverage, even though the industry has talked about coming down significantly, we\u2019re -- we\u2019ve still printed well into the 6s and that\u2019s $125 billion average deposit base. So I\u2019m not going to -- I\u2019m not giving you our buffers here, but just take a 5% number, just to get your question out about what our capacity would look like. If you came all the way down to 5%, that would translate to a balance sheet of about $200 billion and you could have $170 billion in deposits, all else equal on the balance sheet today. And so you\u2019re talking about easily $40 billion on a base of $125 billion currently and so that\u2019s a lot of room. And I think, also, importantly, it\u2019s not like we use the balance sheet for clients that for organizations we don\u2019t know. We\u2019re really dealing from a candidate pool of depositors that are existing clients. And so, at this point, we feel good about the capacity we have, but it\u2019s obviously something that we\u2019re watching, given how dramatically things can change, given set actions and where deposits were 15 months ago. Alex Blostein : Right. I guess I was trying to get more to the capital return framework of kind of how you guys think about the opportunity for share repurchases from here, given the access capital that you\u2019ve outlined. Mike O'Grady: Thanks for clarifying. Let me tack with that. Let me tackle that directly. It\u2019s interesting, because this quarter is a great example of how we don\u2019t just think about do we buy back stock or not, there are different ways we can invest capital and that return -- that 10% to 15% return target, it comes up in everything we do from a capital perspective, including using the balance sheet to help clients. And so this quarter, you saw the capital levels come down, not because there was a meaningful decline in CET1, but because there\u2019s more activity in from a client perspective and that showed up with an increase in RWA on the denominator. And we saw higher sec lending activity, we saw higher lending activity and we saw higher treasury activity in the form of more bond buying, muni purchases. In each of those areas, we\u2019re thinking about what\u2019s the best way to use our balance sheet in the long run and what\u2019s the best way to think about return. And for us we can think about the returns of buying back $1 stock. We\u2019re looking at the -- we\u2019re looking at everything from what we think our returns are going to be there. What\u2019s -- what are we getting in terms of price-to-book. We\u2019re also looking at the desire to be there with clients and what those returns will look like. And when we have the ability to think about lending or expanding C&IS relationships with the other things I mentioned, those things come up as very attractive ways for us to use capital. It turns into better -- it turns into good growth for us in the long run and good use of capital. Alex Blostein : Got it. Great. That makes sense. Thanks for that. And then just a quick follow-up around NIR again, so I think again in the past, I think, we talked a little bit about some sensitivities to sort of the re-pricing dynamics in the securities portfolio. Maybe refresh us where that sort of stands today. So securities portfolio yield, I think is about, 120 or so. If you look at rates where they are today, I want to say most of the securities portfolio has already re-priced lower, but holding current rates constant sort of how much more of a drag on the securities yield do you guys expect to see over the next couple of quarters? Jason Tyler : Yeah. Well, to give you a sense of what\u2019s re-priced at this point, obviously just take if you look at $150 billion in earning assets, obviously, all of the money market assets have re-priced, 85% of the loan book has re-priced, $60 -- and it\u2019s $60 billion of the security, so about 63% of the securities book has re-priced at this point. And so that\u2019s where we sit at this point. And then it\u2019s interesting, if you think about what\u2019s the impact of that, I\u2019ll tell you in this quarter alone, the -- it was a significant impact. We actually had -- if you -- just from securities portfolio, the NIR was down $10 million and so that was the drain on it. But that\u2019s not -- I don\u2019t want you to think about that as a pure run rate, because we\u2019re thinking there about what\u2019s happening with the loan book and so there are other factors to play in as we\u2019re reinvesting those securities. But I want to at least start with giving you the numbers that you asked for, in terms of how much is re-priced and then also what the implications are. But the runoff coming through at this point and also the fact that the one year, two-year, three-year, five-year, where we tend to be reinvesting has come up, that is brought down the influence on a quarter-over-quarter basis as well. Operator : Thank you. We will now go to Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, Mike O'Grady: Hi, Brian. Brian Bedell : Hi. Great. Hey. Good morning. How are you? If I can start off with maybe one on the loan book, Jason just that comment you made on the 85% of the loan book has re-priced, looks like that you\u2019ll have at least for the last couple quarters now bottomed and is starting to move back up. So my question would be around of the 15% that\u2019s re-pricing sort of what are the dynamics on that versus maybe what are some of those new loans that you\u2019re bringing on that\u2019s helping improve that yield. And then longer term, most of that is tied to LIBOR, maybe just talk about the plan of whether some of those loans are going to use a new reference rate given the planned Jason of LIBOR and how you\u2019re thinking about that? Jason Tyler : Sure. So the longer dated loans are, often it\u2019s going to be in the mortgage book and so that\u2019s what\u2019s going to take longer effectively just you know. The loans that have come on, disproportionately the growth has come again within wealth, but within personal loans and within some of our more corporate based organizations, we do have a lot of corporate there\u2019s small and midsize business activity in that book and that\u2019s where a lot of the growth has been. And then in terms of the LIBOR transition. Yeah, as you know and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re covering really closely, Brian, there\u2019ll be a transition and most of the industry seems to be looking to move from LIBOR to SOFR as a reference rate and so watching that and the implications of it. Brian Bedell : Is that transition to SOFR, I mean, I guess, it\u2019s too early at this stage, because there\u2019s not an effective term rate. But I mean, is there any or you said any implication on the yield of the loan book by that transition or is it simply too early? Jason Tyler : Well, it\u2019s early, but we and I think the industry is hoping that they\u2019ll be -- once we get to those transition dates, there\u2019ll be more of a reset and we\u2019ll have the, not just the reference rate changes, but the spread changes and to reflect -- because obviously, SOFR is different. There\u2019s not credit. There\u2019s not duration in it and so it\u2019s a different rate. And the relationship between LIBOR and SOFR is a lot different today than what it was even a year ago. And so I think the industry has got some work to do to work on what the conversations are going to be like at the point where we actually make that hard switch. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Mike O'Grady: Steve. Steven Chubak : Hi. Good morning. So I had a couple of ticky tack modeling questions. The first is just on the non-asset sensitive fees within custody and fund administration. We\u2019ve had two pretty meaningful sequential increases these past two quarters. That line item exited the quarter at about $178 million versus what historically had been a pretty consistent range of $150 million to $160 million. Just curious what\u2019s driving the recent strength in that line item? And maybe just as we think about from a modeling perspective, what\u2019s the right jumping off point we should be thinking about as we look ahead to 2Q? Mark Bette : Yeah. Just to make sure I\u2019m tracking totally. So you\u2019re talking about other non-interest income at $180 million on the income statement. Steven Chubak : It\u2019s actually the $178 million within custody and fund administration. But it\u2019s the non-asset sensitivity portion. So that\u2019s the part that will presumably move around with that statement. Mark Bette : Yeah. So this is Mark. So you\u2019re referring to, when we talk about the sensitivity of the -- of those fees that about 60% to 65% are asset sensitive and then the rest are kind of either there mix quite frankly, there\u2019s transaction volumes within those. There are some flat fees or fixed fees or even account level fees. So you could maybe say roughly half of it is transaction volume related. So -- and we did see a pickup this quarter in those transaction volumes that created some of the sequential lift that we saw or percent or 1% or so of the sequential lift that we saw. So I hope that is answering your question. Steven Chubak : Yeah. Yeah. That\u2019s sufficient. So -- but we should be expecting some normalization of that, presumably, it could be higher than the $150 million to $160 million, but it sounds like the $178 million may have been a bit elevated and we could see some rebasing there, is that fair? Mark Bette : Yeah. That\u2019s probably fair. I don\u2019t necessarily have the numbers that you\u2019re doing, because we don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t have it broken down specifically like that. That\u2019s kind of a directional guide that moves around each quarter that split. But yeah, I mean, we did -- we certainly saw heavier transaction activity during this most recent quarter, that would have benefited those fees by a bit. Steven Chubak : Okay. No. That\u2019s helpful color. Just for my follow up on the NII, actually you are bit more focused on the liability side, the beat was held by continued grind down in those interest-bearing deposit costs. It\u2019s the second consecutive quarter where we\u2019ve actually seen that come down. Just curious if you see any additional room to cut deposit costs further, if the rate backdrop holds or has that level have been largely exhausted at this point. Mike O'Grady: I felt decent about coming down a couple basis points in that book and I think it\u2019s reflective that a lot of that book is international. It\u2019s in currencies that are already used to having negative rates. And so that dynamic that we\u2019ve talked about that once zero is broken, there\u2019s an expectation that the beta will continue at that point seems to be playing through there. And so wouldn\u2019t necessarily and we\u2019ve talked to clients a lot about where rates are there, because it\u2019s obviously can be a sensitive topic. But I think the win there is. We\u2019ve got good dialogue with clients that indicate we\u2019re all looking at things like the year the same way and tracking deposit costs. So we don\u2019t have further deterioration as the asset side compresses more. Operator : Thank you. We will now go to Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Mike O'Grady: Good morning, Mike. Mike Carrier : Hi. Good morning. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just a question on organic growth, Mike, you provided some good color on Asset Servicing Glenn\u2019s book question, just in investment management in particularly in wealth, where you are starting to see improvement as COVID conditions improved versus last year? And how is the competitive backdrop change, given that it seems like everybody has been focused on that part of the business? Mike O'Grady: So, in wealth, I -- we\u2019ve continued to grow. But you\u2019re right, the marketplace is extremely competitive, which is why it\u2019s so important that we stay focused on both the parts of the market where we think we compete most effectively and on providing for the clients in that segment. So where we\u2019re seeing our strongest growth has been in the upper part of the market there. So think about clients with assets above $20 million and particularly during this time period, where equity values are going up, there\u2019s obviously been an increase in wealth. So that drives growth. But then also with the change in administration and potential changes in taxes and things like that, it increases the need for planning. So a high level of activity, both with our existing clients, but also opportunities with prospects. Mike Carrier : Okay. Great. And then just in terms of the expense outlook, you realize you guys try to focus on aligning that, excuse me, slightly lower than the organic growth levels that firm over time. But as we transition from, say, the low short rates headwinds to NII and waiver headwinds, they eventually stabilizing and then as short rates rise and eventually become a tailwind, like any necessary, like investment areas ahead or like new efficiency areas post-COVID, like real estate that we should be thinking about? Mike O'Grady: I will start and then I am sure, Jason, can add detail to it. But it\u2019s -- on the expense side, it\u2019s a very dynamic situation right now. What I mean by that is, we\u2019re obviously still in this resiliency mode that we talked about, which has certain, say, costs to it, but also there are certain expenses that we\u2019re not incurring at this point. So obviously, travel and business promotion is lower than it was pre-pandemic. We\u2019re not operating with as many people in our facilities. The cost of operating those facilities is lower. So you do have some lower costs on that front that to the extent that we transition out of that you would expect that those would increase. The second thing I would say is, with regard to the organic growth that we\u2019ve talked about, it does require investment. That can be supporting large new clients and it also can come in the form of bringing on new talent to continue this growth. I mean, as you bring on new talent, you want to make sure that you\u2019re providing the right level of service across all of our businesses and that means making sure that we have the people that go along with this. And then the third piece, I would just say, is around our digitalization efforts, which again have accelerated in the last year and I think we\u2019re seeing the benefit of that, but it does require investment in technology as well to ensure that, yes, we\u2019re adding those capabilities, but we\u2019re doing it in the right safe, secure, stable way. So that backdrop does, say, okay, we\u2019re going to continue to grow, but it\u2019s going to require investment and that\u2019s why Jason talked about earlier, we also have to be focused on efficiency. And we did see as a part of the remote working environments, there are some efficiencies in that as well. And so how can we, for example, look at our real estate footprint and see if there are opportunities to shrink the footprint and use that to support some of the investments that I talked about. Operator : Thank you. We will now go to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Mike O'Grady: Good morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Hi. Good morning. Okay. A couple of other themes that we haven\u2019t touched on yet, one is around the Wealth Management business, sorry, and the virtual advising strategy. I know that\u2019s been well underway for a while. I just wanted to get a sense as to if the demand for that is more runway at the stage or are you still seeing acceleration of demand for that strategy that you\u2019ve got there? Jason Tyler : So it\u2019s -- the way we\u2019ve tackled kind of virtual engagement through with clients on the wealth side is the continued use of our goals within Wealth Management approach. And so we were able very quickly to take those discussions and then have virtual conversations, but with that same very -- what we think is a very differentiated platform with clients through COVID. It was very good, engagements were very, very strong and it\u2019s led the business to feel that there\u2019s strong momentum from an overall client engagement perspective. So that\u2019s gone well. And it\u2019s one of the continued large investments in Wealth Management and Mike just talked about our investment and digitizing the business. That\u2019s an area where we can use that as a core platform, but add journeys to it, add specific areas to become more and more detailed and specific with how -- with matching up with what our clients are going through, very strong investment for us and it\u2019s been extremely positive. Our Net Promoter Scores, as Steve Fradkin, who runs that business is just talking about how strong those are and so clearly the -- that investment has been paying off with good client engagement. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then just separately, I know you\u2019ve been in the press recently, with regard to some of the crypto custody activities that you are working on, I\u2019m not sure when it\u2019s going to be launched. I think you\u2019ve got a partnership going on with Standard Chartered. So, maybe you can give us some color on that. And part of the question, too, is it doesn\u2019t just end with custody or can you foresee an opportunity to enable -- to offer crypto to your clients, when I think about European investors, well, not just investors, but the servicers that use -- services -- the asset managers that you work with over there dealing with negative rates. What I hear is that there\u2019s a decent demand for going into crypto because at least it\u2019s not negative interest rate. So how far is it until you or how long is it until you offer crypto is one of your liquidity tool, just to kind of thinking was? Mike O'Grady: So, Betsy, as you know, the financial markets are constantly innovating and evolving, have for some time period and in the business we\u2019re in we absolutely have to keep pace with that. And do it in a way that again, it allows us to provide the safety and security for the clients in managing their assets, and crypto and digital assets more broadly is right now clearly one of the areas that evolving the fastest. And so on that front to your point with regard to custody of crypto assets or cryptocurrencies. We\u2019ve partnered with Standard Chartered in a venture called Zodia, which will provide that crypto custody. And I think what\u2019s important there, what we\u2019re trying to accomplish is leverage the traditional custody expertise that we have, the Standard Chartered has as well, but do it in a fintech way. So that\u2019s why it\u2019s a separate independent entity that again can develop and evolve at that pace. And at this point, we still expect at some point in 2021 that will be approved for clients use. So again, it\u2019s going to be done not only our own, I\u2019ll call it, approvals, but also from a regulatory perspective. And then I think more broadly, to your point, absolutely, we see many different potential opportunities in this space, where clients will look at digital assets and potentially cryptocurrencies in order to address various either challenges they have or ways to earn better returns. And that\u2019s why we\u2019ve not only done what I talked about in cryptocurrencies, but more broadly with the digital assets, whether it\u2019s tokenization, which we\u2019ve done with BondEvalue, whether it\u2019s developing a PE capability on blockchain, which we\u2019ve done with Broadridge. There\u2019s a number of different areas where we\u2019ve experimented either on our own or with partners in order to be able to be a part of that innovation. Operator : Thank you. We will now move to our next question. That is coming from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead. Jim Mitchell : Hey. Good morning. Mike O'Grady: Hi, Jim. Jim Mitchell : Hey. Maybe just a question on the Wealth Management business, it seem to be a quite a bit of disparity in the outcomes even though market appreciation whether it\u2019s lag basis or month lag or full quarter lag was pretty similar. So is it just -- there\u2019s a lot more fee waivers in the global family office? How do we think about that sort of difference? Mike O'Grady: Yeah. You hit it right. It\u2019s -- there is a distinction in the lag in that business there. But that\u2019s not what drove it frankly. It was -- it\u2019s the waivers hit hard. And we\u2019ve talked about the fact that people shouldn\u2019t see waivers as linear. This is a good example. Where the waivers and that the GFO business, obviously, much more institutional and so\u2026 Jim Mitchell : Okay. Mike O'Grady: \u2026 the waivers hit later and we\u2019re now starting to see it come in, whereas the regions have more traditional closer to but not retail pricing and so those waivers just hit earlier. Second dynamic though is GFO is spiking and we have clients there that will move billions of dollars. And so you can have one, two, three clients that if they\u2019re all have significant movements, then you\u2019ll -- you can see big movements on a sequential basis. If you look year-over-year, the organic growth -- the growth rate overall for GFO is actually slightly higher than the regions. But obviously the sequential look was impacted by those two things, one waivers and two, some spiky very large client movement. Jim Mitchell : Okay. And so the incremental hit to fee waivers, is that also going to be in 2Q more in global family office and maybe C&IS or how we think about the geography of that? Mike O'Grady: I think we\u2019re -- I think from here, it\u2019s somewhat -- it\u2019s going to be more linear. I mean, that -- the funds are more -- they\u2019re all there at this point in waiver mode. And so I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see as big of a disparity going forward, but people should just realize it\u2019s not a linear relationship. And I think there was overall $20 billion to $23 billion in wealth and $9 billion of that was in -- $9 billion almost $10 billion was in GFO and so that\u2019s a year-over-year look, that\u2019s just aggregate effectively, but the one quarter look, it was $5 million in GFO alone and so big. That was the increase quarter over quarter. Jim Mitchell : Right. Okay. Thank you. Mike O'Grady: You bet. Operator : Thank you. Next we\u2019ll move to Jeff Harte with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Mike O'Grady: Hey, Jeff. Jeff Harte : Hey. Good morning, guys. To circle back a bit to the buyback, I mean, it\u2019s good to see you guys out there buying $135 million in stock. Historically it feels like the actual buyback comes in kind of below what least our estimated capacity is someone regularly, I think, first quarter might have given us a partial edge with risk weighted asset growth. But can you help kind of differentiate kind of the buyback? The difference in your thinking between just be conservative versus the expectation that risk weighted assets could actually continue ramping up like they did in the first quarter? Jason Tyler : Yeah. It\u2019s completely related and it comes back to that theme of wanting to think about returns. And so, for us it\u2019s not like we\u2019re making a decision of do we buy back stock or just park money at the Fed at 10 basis points. For us we -- it\u2019s -- but it\u2019s nice to be able to see that client activity is driving the alternative to share buybacks. So that\u2019s certainly not to say that we\u2019re doing zero or very little, it\u2019s just to say, those are the different options we think about. And we saw a sec lending activity up significantly, just the loan demand being up $1 billion, that\u2019s going to cause $1 billion in higher RWA, just in and of itself. And then you see the deposits coming in, which is -- it\u2019s nice for us to be able to answer a client need, but that comes with RWA as we redeploy it on the asset side. And so the best thing we can do is have the balance sheet used for good return on equity activity that\u2019s client related, building relationships in the long run. But at the same time, we did do $150 million-ish in share repurchase over the timeframe. So it\u2019s not like we were absent in the market. But you can imagine here it at 12% we\u2019re going to be looking at what is OCI look like, what is client activity look like and balancing all those things together. Jeff Harte : Okay. Thanks. So just to touch on kind of the fee growth, I guess, growth across the relative businesses. It seems like C&IS outgrowing Wealth Management really stopped pacing it for a while now. I mean, is that the right way that we should think about those two business trajectories going forward growth wise or is there a reason to think that kind of Wealth Management could start kind of catching up with C&IS. Jason Tyler : Couple of things, one, what -- every time over long periods of time, we think one of the businesses is growing faster than we think, oh, this is going to be the case for the future, you get an inflection. The businesses have acted as good hedges to each other and it\u2019s always difficult to predict those inflection points and what\u2019s going to grow faster. For sure, if you look over the last couple or few years, you\u2019d see C&IS having grown faster. But in general wealth is got good exposure to equity markets. And so -- and you also think over the long run, there\u2019s a good title growth, particularly at the top end of the wealth market and so those things should help as well. And so we wouldn\u2019t call a prediction necessarily on one of the businesses over the long run in the future growing faster. Mike O'Grady: And I would just add to Jason\u2019s comments. That\u2019s why we really like the combination of the three businesses. Not only is it complimentary from a client perspective, but also from a financial perspective, they have different dynamics. So the Asset Servicing business, which Pete Cherecwich has done a great job leading and growing at a high rate. It also requires resources to do that, as we\u2019ve talked about that and has different levels of volatility in the business. Whereas in Wealth Management, very steady and at a high level of profitability and scalable. And then with Asset Management, again, very high level of operating leverage in the business and as has been positioned over the last couple years, for example, when you can get positioned in the right products, for example, in liquidity and the markets go up or the liquidity goes up, very strong increase in profitability for that and focus on other areas where we can have that same dynamic with ESG and quants. So, we like all the businesses, I would say from a client competitive perspective, but also from a financial perspective. Operator : Thank you. We will now go to Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Mike O'Grady: Hi, Rob. Jason Tyler : Hi, Rob. Rob Wildhack : Good morning, guys. Question from me on organic growth, I think a year ago the prospects for organic growth were probably more uncertain and fast forward to today your comments have been really positive. Coming out of 2020, do you see any new or different sources of organic growth that can maybe increase the long-term sustainable rate you think you\u2019re capable of achieving? Jason Tyler : I will start and Mike I\u2019m sure has some comments on this as well. Let\u2019s take those -- let\u2019s take the different businesses. In C&IS, the -- we had it even early today, the integrated trading solutions is something we\u2019ve talked about a little bit over the last few months, that\u2019s come through. That\u2019s part of the reason I think there\u2019s been that that lift in brokerage commission income, done strategic things in foreign exchange. And those aren\u2019t -- so it\u2019s not accidental I think that we\u2019ve had lift in those areas. And then front office solutions is another area where we\u2019re trying to go to client -- to sophisticated clients and show the breadth of what we can do. In Wealth Management, the engagement there is around expanding and continuing to invest in goals driven Wealth Management and the growth we\u2019ve had particularly in the upper end, that product gets to -- we\u2019ve talked so much about what $50 million, 100 million and hundreds of millions of dollar clients need in order to enter to interact in a good holistic way Thing were set up while there. And then in Asset Management, $215 billion, I remember about a year and a half ago, where we were on the liquidity perspective to now $275 million, and yeah, there\u2019s been great growth, but -- in the industry. But they did a lot of hard things to get cut off times done well to get to open a Northern Trust portal. There\u2019s so many different to invest in the talent we have in that group. And then you think about our ESG and quant capabilities, ESG assets are over $130 billion now, great engagement in across the Nordics with very strong client base there and doing a lot with our ETF platform, including launching new products in Europe there. And so in each of these -- the areas, I think there\u2019s good is good opportunity for us to leverage the work that\u2019s been done to lead to stronger organic growth. Rob Wildhack : That\u2019s great. Thank you. Jason Tyler : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Vivek Juneja : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess just a follow up on the integrated trading solutions. Can you explain that a little bit how it actually works? Are you -- is it an electronic thing or is it people that you\u2019re providing, instead of your Asset Management clients having them and how does that work, if it\u2019s five of your clients want to buy one particular stock? How are you separating all of that? Can you give a little more color on how this actually works? Mike O'Grady: Sure. At $25,000 fee, you can think about it is almost out -- trading, outsourcing, investment trading outsourcing. And where a lot of clients realize, a lot of our Asset Management clients realize that their core competencies around security selection and research, and not necessarily the having the trading operations, the back office that comes with that, trade order entry. And so our ability to say, you can work with us and we can be your effective outsourced trading partner, it appeals to a lot of Asset Management clients. Vivek Juneja : Okay. So they don\u2019t have to have a trader anymore and/or you\u2019re just providing the back office for trading? Mike O'Grady: No. It starts with trading. They can -- we can have portfolio managers and their middle office send us model accounts, send us trades and we can provide that service for them and be more of a full outsource operation from them from middle office through trade execution and trade management. Vivek Juneja : Okay. All right. I\u2019ll follow up maybe a little more offline. Going back to the capital question, Jason, like, so I hear you want to obviously you\u2019re thinking about client needs and all of that stuff. But even if we factor that in as we think about it, what level are you sort of comfortable running your various capital ratios at, whether it\u2019s Tier 1 leverage or whether it\u2019s CET1, is it a 10% or is it an 11%? Whatever the format gets, whether it\u2019s through loan growth, securities learning growth and our buybacks, what is sort of that cut off point below which you don\u2019t want to go? Mike O'Grady: From my -- from our perspective, I think it still is going to depend on where the industry, where our peers and our regular -- our regulators asking us to hold on to capital to not buy back stock at that time. I don\u2019t -- we don\u2019t call an absolute level. We haven\u2019t talked about our buffers externally. Obviously, we\u2019re running significantly above any regulatory minimum, but we haven\u2019t. And so we\u2019ve got buffers that we use internally to manage that, not something we\u2019ve talked about externally. But when we engage with clients, we want to be able to continue telling them that they\u2019ve got -- that they\u2019re interacting with a balance sheet that\u2019s strong on an absolute and relative basis and that doesn\u2019t have. It\u2019s part of our strategic strength when we talk to clients. And a lot of institutions you think about, not just pension funds, but even sovereign wealth funds, if they\u2019re investing, if they\u2019re depositing $500 million, $1 billion, $2 billion, $3 billion, they\u2019re not really depositing, they\u2019re lending to their banks at that point and they want to be operating with institutions that are strong. And so we\u2019re always going to be looking and seeing where the tides are in the industry to make sure we reflect strong capital levels. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. Jason Tyler : Hey, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Hi, Jason. Hi, Mike. How are you? Can you guys share with us, I know you\u2019re not a prime broker. But there was that trading mishap in March with supposedly a large family office, which probably was a hedge fund. But can you just give us any color, because we\u2019ve never seen any risk in your family -- global family office business at all? Can you reassure us that\u2019s still the case and just maybe some color around how that -- how you manage that business and manage those risks? Jason Tyler : Sure. Well, couple things and you\u2019re right we\u2019re not a prime broker. And so we\u2019re not providing that type of trading leverage to or alongside clients and taking positions is we\u2019re dealing with either our hedge fund clients or our family office clients. In the family office business, we have some loans, but those are much more than loans that we see in the traditional wealth business, which are loans against investments that clients will have in long-term clients, they\u2019re not taking that type of exposure. And so the -- the services that we provide for our hedge fund clients and our GFO clients, it\u2019s much more about Asset Servicing, Asset Administration, Investment Reporting, that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to market to deal with those types of clients. And so just to put anybody\u2019s minds at rest, we didn\u2019t have any exposure to the hedge fund/family office that you\u2019re talking about and don\u2019t see that type of exposure in our portfolios. Gerard Cassidy : Speaking of Asset Servicing and Reporting that you just did, is there an opportunity to capitalize and if the SEC requires more disclosure from the family office organizations as a possibility, as a result of what happened, would that be an opportunity for you guys to do more work for your customers, and therefore, maybe more revenues? Jason Tyler : Yeah. It\u2019s an interesting nuance, because we -- a lot of our clients on the hedge space, they actually are SEC registered. And so we\u2019re used to dealing with them and helping those types of institutions on doing the reporting and administration that they need to do for their SEC registration material and engagement and so that\u2019s -- that it would be, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a monumental opportunity for us. We haven\u2019t talked about it that way. But certainly we have that capability set and would be seen as a strong provider for hedge funds that we\u2019re looking to have more of a traditional investment reporting and an overall fund administration engagement with their service providers. Operator : Thank you. We will take our final question from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. Jason Tyler : Hi, Brian. Brian Kleinhanzl : Hi. Good morning. Great. Thanks, guys. Two quick questions. One, first one on the comp expenses, I heard that the $30 million of comp was retirement eligible? And then did you also say that you absorb the merit increases year-over-year, so those are getting paid out in the first quarter now, are those getting paid out in the second quarter, historically, just trying to think of the 2Q to 1Q trend here for comp? Jason Tyler : Yeah. No. The merit will come through second quarter. What I did mention earlier was that this may have been what you -- what get your mind going is, we -- the reduction in overall FTE and headcount for the company did lead to a lower salary level in the quarter. But that one-off -- but that\u2019s not -- that\u2019s distinct from the merit increases. Mark Bette : And just to clarify. This is Mark. The base pay adjustment, the year-over-year increase is still reflecting of any base pay adjustments that happened in the previous year. We\u2019re still lapping that. So if that\u2019s what you were referring to Brian in the release or in some of the comments we made that that would have been what that was referring to not this years. Brian Kleinhanzl : Got it. Thanks. And then could you also just talk about the trends in investment management, I think, you adjust for the fee waivers looking at the first quarter relative to the third quarter, you\u2019re not seeing much in terms of revenue growth, despite the change in market levels over that time period, could you just maybe touch on the flows in that segment? Thanks. Jason Tyler : Yeah. Mark may want to touch on those in general, but\u2026 Mark Bette : Yeah. So on the C&IS line, I think, that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking at the investment management fees. On a sequential basis, ex waivers you are -- I think we were up about 6%. Probably, three quarters of that, two-thirds or three quarters of that came from market lift. So there was some sequential organic growth there. But I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s what specifically if you\u2019re looking at. Brian Kleinhanzl : For the fee waivers so, I mean, it sounds like flow trends and they\u2019re more positive? Mark Bette : Yeah. There were some flow activities that we saw there. Like Mike had mentioned, we\u2019ve been seeing good growth in ESG, some of the quant active products as well. But the waivers there on a sequential basis, certainly, kind of overwhelmed, what we saw from both favorable markets, as well as business flows. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. That will conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. Mr. Bette, at this time, I will turn the conference to you for any final remarks. Mark Bette : Thanks for joining us today and we look forward to seeing you in July for our second quarter update. Operator : Thank you. And thank you all for your participation. This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may now disconnect.",

Let me turn the call over to Mike O'Grady. Michael O'grady: Thank you, Mark. Let me join in welcoming everyone to our second quarter 2021 earnings call. During the second quarter, we continued to successfully execute on our growth strategies across each of our businesses. In our Wealth Management business, our goals-driven approach and last year's launch of the Northern Trust Institute continue to resonate with our clients, further increasing client satisfaction levels. Our digital Navigate The Now campaign, which we introduced last year, is successfully generating new contacts and leads, creating more opportunity. Uncertainty in tax law changes has also contributed to new business momentum. And earlier in the quarter, we announced the launch of our Tax Policy Resource Center, an extension of the Northern Trust Institute. Within Asset Management, we continue to see momentum in our liquidity products as well as strong growth in our FlexShares ETFs and ESG strategies. We continue to focus on expanding sustainable investment solutions. And earlier this month, announced the launch of the Quality Low Volatility Low Carbon World Strategy, an actively managed strategy focusing on high-quality, low-volatility stocks, while maintaining a low carbon footprint relative to the MSCI World Index. We also introduced the  Northern Trust ESG Vector Score, which measures financially relevant ESG-related criteria that could impact the operating performance of publicly traded companies. Within our Asset Servicing business, we continue to see growth that was well diversified across regions, products and client segments. Recent notable public wins include Fundsmith, Marks & Spencer Pension Trust, Martin Currie Investment Management and Coal Pension Trustees Services Limited. We continue to invest and expand our asset servicing solutions as evidenced by us finalizing our acquisition of Parilux Investment Technology, which underscores our commitment to the front office solutions business. The execution of our growth strategies, combined with favorable markets, resulted in 12% year-over-year growth in our trust fees, despite significant headwinds from money market fee waivers. Our expense growth of 8%, inclusive of a pension settlement charge, generated 4 points of positive fee operating leverage. The expense growth reflected new business as well as investments in both technology and our staff as we continue to build a diverse, engaged workforce with skills for the future. I also want to draw your attention to our latest corporate social responsibility report, which we published last week, marking a full decade of transparent, detailed CSR reporting about the company. The report details our progress towards creating long-term value for our clients, employees, shareholders, communities and other key stakeholders. Moving into the second half of 2021 and beyond, we remain focused on continuing to effectively navigate the persistent low interest rate environment, focusing on driving greater efficiencies as well as continuing to grow organically in a scalable and profitable manner. With respect to the public health environment, we continue to operate in what we call resiliency mode, which means we're focused on providing our clients continuity of service while the majority of our employees worldwide are working remotely. However, during the third quarter, we expect to see more of our staff returning to the respective locations. Our return to office plans are being driven first by robust health and safety protocols specific to each location and second, by business function needs and time lines. Finally, I want to express my sincere appreciation for our employees whose commitment, expertise and professionalism continues to be exceptional. Now let me turn the call to Jason to review our financial results in greater detail for the quarter. Jason Tyler : Thank you, Mike. Let me join Mark and Mike in welcoming you to our second quarter 2021 earnings call. Let's dive into the financial results for the quarter, starting on Page 2. This morning, we reported second quarter net income of $368.1 million. Earnings per share were $1.72, and our return on common equity was 13.7%. This quarter's results included a $17.6 million pension settlement charge within the employee benefits expense category. As you can see on the bottom of Page 2, equity markets performed well during the quarter. Recall that a significant portion of our trust fees are based on quarter lag or month lag asset levels, and both the S&P 500 and EAFE Local had strong sequential performance based on those calculations. As shown on this page, average 1-month and 3-month LIBOR rates were stable during the quarter with only modest declines. U.S. dollar was weaker on a year-over-year basis, which had a favorable impact on our reported revenue, but is unfavorable to our expenses. Let's move to Page 3 and review our financial highlights of the second quarter. Year-over-year, revenue was up 5%, with noninterest income up 10% and net interest income down 9%. Expenses increased 8%, while net income was up 18%. In the sequential comparison, revenue and expense were both flat. While net income, taking our credit provision and taxes into account, was down 2%. The provision for credit losses reflected a release of $27 million in reserves in the current quarter compared to a provision of $66 million in the prior year and a release of $30 million in the prior quarter. Return on average common equity was 13.7% for the quarter, up from 12.2% a year ago and consistent with the prior quarter. Assets under custody and administration of $15.7 trillion grew 30% from a year ago and 6% sequentially. Assets under custody of $12.2 trillion grew 32% from a year ago and 6% sequentially. Assets under management were $1.5 trillion, up 22% from a year ago and 6% sequentially. Now let's look at results in greater detail, starting with revenue on Page 4. Trust investment and other servicing fees, representing the largest component of our revenue, totaled $1.1 billion and were up 12% from last year and up 1% sequentially. Foreign exchange trading income was $71 million in the quarter, down 1% year-over-year and down 10% sequentially. The sequential decline was driven by lower client volumes as well as lower volatility. The remaining components of noninterest income totaled $99 million in the quarter, down 3% from 1 year ago and down 2% sequentially. Within this, securities commissions and trading income was flat with the prior year and down 5% sequentially. The sequential performance was driven by lower trading within our core brokerage business, partially offset by higher transition management revenue. Other operating income totaled $54 million and was down 4% from 1 year ago and down 1% sequentially. Net interest income, which I'll discuss in more detail later, was $344 million in the second quarter, down 9% from 1 year ago and down 1% sequentially. Let's look at the components of our trust and investment fees on Page 5. For our Corporate & Institutional Services business, fees totaled $612 million and were up 8% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. Favorable currency translation benefited total C&IS fees on a year-over-year basis by approximately 3 points. Custody and fund administration fees were $455 million and up 21% year-over-year and up 2% on a sequential basis. Both the year-over-year and sequential increases were driven by favorable markets and new business with a year-over-year comparison also benefiting from currency translation. Assets under custody and administration for C&IS clients were $14.8 trillion at quarter end, up 30% year-over-year and up 6% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential growth were driven by favorable markets and new business with currency translation also a benefit in the year-over-year comparison. Investment management fees in C&IS of $101 million were down 22% year-over-year and down 13% sequentially. Higher money market fund fee waivers were the key driver of both declines, partially offset by favorable markets and new business. Fee waivers in C&IS totaled $50 million in the second quarter compared to $28 million in the prior quarter. Assets under management for C&IS were $1.2 trillion, up 22% year-over-year and up 7% sequentially. The growth from the prior year was driven by favorable markets, client flows and favorable currency translation. The sequential growth was driven by favorable markets and net flows. Securities lending fees were $19 million, down 29% year-over-year and up 7% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was primarily driven by lower spreads, partially offset by higher volumes. While the sequential performance was driven by higher spreads and volumes. Average collateral levels were up 19% year-over-year and up 3% sequentially. Moving to our Wealth Management business. Trust investment and other servicing fees were $464 million and were up 17% compared to the prior year and up 5% from the prior quarter. Fee waivers in Wealth Management totaled $29.2 million in the current quarter compared to $22.2 million in the prior quarter. Across the regions, both the year-over-year and sequential growth were impacted by favorable markets and new business, partially offset by higher fee waivers. Within Global Family Office, the favorable impact of markets and new business were offset by higher fee waivers. Assets under management for our Wealth Management clients were $371 billion at quarter end, up 22% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was driven by favorable markets and client flows, while the sequential performance primarily reflected favorable markets. Moving to Page 6. Net interest income was $344 million in the quarter and was down 9% from the prior year. Earning assets averaged $142 billion in the quarter, up 13% versus the prior year. Average deposits were $128 billion and were up 15% versus the prior year, while loan balances averaged $36 billion and were up 2% compared to the prior year. The net interest margin was 0.97% in the quarter and was down 25 basis points from a year ago. The net interest margin decreased primarily due to lower average interest rates as well as mix shift within the balance sheet.  On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income declined 1%. Average earning assets and average deposits each increased 1% on a sequential basis, while average loan balances were up 6%. The net interest margin declined 3 basis points sequentially, primarily due to lower average rate.  Turning to Page 7. Expenses were $1.1 billion in the second quarter and were 8% higher than the prior year and flat with the prior quarter. The current quarter included a $17.6 million pension settlement charge within the employee benefits category. This charge represented approximately 1.5 points of year-over-year and sequential growth. The year-over-year comparison for expenses was also unfavorably impacted by currency translation by approximately 2 points of growth. Compensation expense totaled $486 million and was up 6% compared to the prior year and was down 6% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by higher cash-based incentive accruals as well as higher salaries. The growth in salaries was primarily attributable to unfavorable currency translation. The sequential decline was primarily due to the prior quarter's equity incentives, including $32 million in expense associated with retirement-eligible staff.  Excluding the previously mentioned pension settlement charge, employee benefits expense was up 11% from 1 year ago and down 3% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily related to higher medical expense, while the sequential decline was due to lower payroll withholding, partially offset by higher medical expense.  Outside services expense was $218 million and was up 24% from a year ago and up 11% from the prior quarter. Revenue and business volume expenses accounted for nearly 2/3 of the year-over-year growth and nearly half of the sequential growth. The remaining growth within the category included higher technical services, consulting and legal expense, reflecting investment in the business as well as the timing of engagements.  Equipment and software expense of $178 million was up 9% from 1 year ago and up 1% sequentially. The year-over-year growth reflected higher software support and amortization costs. Occupancy expense of $52 million were down 13% from a year ago and up 3% sequentially. The prior year included costs associated with our workplace real estate strategies. Other operating expense of $68 million was down 21% from 1 year ago and down 6% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was driven by lower miscellaneous expenses, including account servicing activities, mutual fund co-administration costs and supplemental compensation plan expense. The sequential decline was due to lower miscellaneous expense, partially offset by higher business promotion and staff-related costs.  Turning to Page 8. Our capital ratios remained strong with our common equity Tier 1 ratio of 12% under the standardized approach, flat with the prior quarter. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 7.1%, up slightly from 6.9% in the prior quarter. During the second quarter, we repurchased 252,000 shares of common stock at a cost of $30 million. We also declared cash dividends of $0.70 per share, totaling $148 million to common stockholders.  The current environment continues to demonstrate the importance of a strong capital base and liquidity profile to support our clients' needs. And we continue to provide our clients with the exceptional service and solution expertise they've come to expect from us. Our competitive positioning across each of our businesses, Wealth Management, Asset Management and Asset Servicing continues to resonate well in the marketplace. So thank you again for participating in Northern Trust's second quarter earnings conference call today. Mike, Mark, Lauren and I would be happy to answer your questions. Stephanie, will you please open the line? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alexander Blostein : So maybe I'll start with expenses. And I was hoping, Jason, you could unpack some of the trends both on the comp and non-comp side of the equation. And I guess on the comp side, when we look at the sequential decline in compensation, almost all of that is really just kind of explained by the seasonal effects. So comp is pretty well controlled, especially in the context of gets better revenue environment. So how should we think about that for the rest of the year? Are there things that would -- is there enough for you guys to kind of hold the line on the expenses for the second half? And then similarly, on the non-comp side of things, things were, I guess, a little bit higher than originally expected and you previewed that at a conference a few weeks ago. But a similar line of question kind of how should we think about the jumping off points for the non-comp side of the equation? Jason Tyler : Yes. So let me take them in order. I think you hit the comp walking into this period well, in that it was controlled. If you look at headcount in particular, Alex, and that's flat for the second quarter in a row, which evidences how we've been managing through the announcements we made in January about what we were trying to do. And part of that is that we also look to reinvest some of that savings, which maybe plays into the second part of your question, which I'll come to in a second. But in terms of thinking forward for the rest of the year, part of what we did was go through that expense savings exercise. Earlier in the year, we talked about $40 million to $50 million, somewhere in that range of savings. We've gotten through that and executed that pretty well. At this point, not saying that we're going to continue to see a downward trajectory. Now I think, frankly, the business growth and some of the investments we're making in the business might cause that to start to have more of a traditional feel going forward.  So then if I come to the non-comp side. And I think the area you're probably looking at, Alex, is probably outside services. I mean we've got -- there's a $20 million increase sequentially there, and we did talk about that. I did reference that, that line item was going to be higher than anticipated. And so it probably makes sense for me to unpack that a little bit for the group. And the way we've been thinking about it is to separate that outside services category -- outside service line, 2 categories. First, there's a lot of business-related expenses that are in there. And so it's sub-custody, third-party advisory, brokerage clearing, market data. And those are line items that are going to trend with the growth of the business, and about half of the growth that we see sequentially is related to that business growth. And you can kind of even litmus test that, if that's half of the $20 million and say it's about $10 million, compare that to the fact that we saw about $40 million in trust fee growth ex waivers. And so that's not bad. And that's -- you should expect that when we've got that kind of lift on trust fees, you'd expect there to be some increase coming in these business-related growth exercises. And then the second big category, there's a lot of our technology cost is within that outside services line. And we've been -- we've had a very consistent goal of strengthening the foundation of technology, improving data architecture and our client experience. And since we're doing well on those headcount exercises and markets are up, we want to be deliberate and say we're going to reinvest some of that savings back into technology. And that accounts for about half of that increase. Now to your question, how should we think about it going forward? All -- that tech investment is not going to continue to grow at $10 million a quarter. The components of outside services that relate to technology should actually be flat over the next few quarters. And we've got some of the engagements we had with consulting firms and others kind of front-load the activities there. And so at this point, we're thinking that component should be flat. The other component, sub-custody, third-party advisory, brokering, that's going to continue to trend with the business. And in hindsight, I think -- even thinking back to the charges we talked about in January, this is a good example of how we've deployed some of those savings in areas that we talked about to reinvest in technology broadly for the business. Alexander Blostein : Great. That's super helpful. And then maybe I could squeeze another follow-up just around capital return dynamics. The buyback was a little bit late this quarter. Obviously, you guys continue to have very strong capital ratios. And we've seen your peers talk about the willingness to sort of go even a little bit below their internal incentive management targets because the balance sheets have ballooned as much as they did. How does that inform at all your appetite for share repurchases? I know you guys kind of think about yourselves relative to peers and that sort of construct as opposed to the absolute sort of vacuum. But given the backdrop for share repurchases for State Street and BK, curious how you're thinking about yourselves? Jason Tyler : Yes. No, we acknowledge a lot of firms have talked about aggressive share repurchase. To us, share repurchase is tied to a lot of factors as we think about how to deploy earnings. And if we -- to keep capital levels roughly level, we've got to consider dividends, which you consider those kind of predictable, then you're managing to 2 other factors. One, capital required to support RWA growth; and then lastly, share repurchase. So if you look at -- we actually looked at the last 5 years pre-pandemic, and dividends are interesting. They're consistently about 1/3 of net income. And so think about the other 2/3 split between supporting our RWA growth and share repurchase. Over that 5 years coming into the pandemic, RWA wasn't changing significantly. So the increase that we saw related to RWA growth is just about 15%, and that leaves about 50% of our earnings that were redeployed to share repurchase. Since the start of the health crisis, though, the relationship between repurchase and retention is actually flipped. And so dividends are still roughly 1/3, maybe a little higher. But the rise in loans and securities that you see on the balance sheet, that leads to an increase in RWA. So about half the earnings have been redeployed in the form of retention to maintain capital levels. And that left about 15% for repurchase. That's kind of the narrative -- the overall lens of how we've gotten to where we are. Now that is not to say that we wouldn't change our capital levels or that the change in RWA is a long-term phenomenon. We could easily see lower RWA levels in a lot of different scenarios that we could predict. But that at least explains what happened in the 5 years pre-pandemic and the trends you saw there, and then how things have changed in the midst of the health crisis and how, at this point, our share repurchase are like relative to what you saw coming pre-pandemic. Operator : Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : So a question on just rate impact in general. Flat rates from here or better, do we finally see the signs of NIM, NII and fee waivers bottoming out? Or is there another level to think about as nonoperating deposits might start declining? Just curious to get your thoughts and the cadence from here. Jason Tyler : Yes. High level, I think the band at this point has narrowed a lot. And so there's still runoff in the securities portfolio. We're 65 -- or 2/3 of the way through the runoff there. And we're still losing about 40 basis points. But if we think about the impact of what that's doing, it's not as significant as it once was. And then another component, people, obviously, you've seen IOER up. And I think one thing to note there, people see we've got about $35 billion in cash, but we only have about $13 billion, $14 billion, $15 billion at the Fed. And so that translates to $1.5 million or $2 million a quarter, it's not that much in [ lift ]. LIBOR continues to be a big impact. And you actually saw LIBOR come down a little bit and went from 12 basis points to 10 over the quarter. And so all those things together or at least at this point, we're not talking about $5 million and $10 million, $15 million moves, we're talking about $1 million, $2 million, $3 million moves a quarter, and they're offsetting each other largely. So I think we're in a band where the volumes across the portfolio are going to be the driver of what happens in net interest income. Glenn Schorr : Okay. I appreciate that. I wonder if you could just expand or just comment on the fixed versus floating rate mix of both your debt and in the securities portfolio? I'm just curious if you're thinking about locking in either side as rates have moved yet again lower. Jason Tyler : No, it wouldn't cause us -- the recent moves wouldn't cause us to make a change. We're constantly looking out on the market and just thinking broadly about how we feel about it. And so we did have duration step out a little bit. It went from 2.5 to 2.6 -- and 2.6, maybe 2.7, somewhere in that range. But it's that's more reflective of the longer journey we've been on, extending the securities portfolio. But we're conscious to not try and chase return by doing anything inconsistent with what we've talked about strategically. And the strategy we talked about at ALCO has been to get about where we are right now and in duration and in mix. And so no significant changes that I would want to forecast coming up. Operator : Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Can I follow up on the money market mutual fund waiver fees. Now that there's been a slight increase in rates in the reverse repo area, where many of the money market mutual funds are now engaged with the Federal Reserve, do you sense that your money market mutual fund waiver fees could actually decline sequentially? Some of your peers have pointed that out. Jason Tyler : Yes, I think they will. Unless we get a significant change in the short end of the yield curve, but what happened in mid-June was helpful for waivers. And if you think about -- if you just think about the math of it -- well, first of all, I'll tell you -- I can tell you where we were. We peaked at a run rate of $80 million to $85 million a quarter. And that's where we were early June. And now as we sit today, the run rate is more like $70 million a quarter. And that changed -- that run rate changed pretty quickly after the Fed actions, June 16 or whatever it was. Now that said, there's not much -- I don't think there's that much more that's going to come in terms of run rate. And I think at this point, because the money market mutual funds are so short and probably 40% of them on average have 30 days or less in duration in the portfolio, so they've already turned over and reinvested. And so the run rate I gave you is largely reflective of the post IOER and overnight repo facility changes. But yes, there is a benefit that came from Fed actions in mid-June. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then as a follow-up. You've talked a little bit about your reserves at the Fed. I think on your balance sheet, your total deposits at banks, all central banks is around $54 billion. if that's the right number? Can you tell me what's the more normal number once we get into maybe a more normal environment at some point in the future? Are you -- what would be a lower number that you'd be comfortable with? Jason Tyler : Well, I'm not sure it's lower. It's interestingly -- we talk a lot about this, what is -- if we layer in the overall deposits, on average deposits are -- forget about just what's at the Fed. But just in general, what's driving the asset level is the liability side. And if we're at $125 billion, $130 billion, how much -- is that a post-pandemic normal? And it's just too hard to tell. And I think there's -- clients are, right now, they've held on to liquidity longer than what we would have anticipated and that 35 -- the USD 15 billion, the other $20 billion-ish that's in -- $20 billion, $30 billion, it's in other currencies at other central banks, it's all driven by the deposit base. And it's held in there pretty flat for a while now in that kind of $120 billion, $130 billion level. Operator : Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Jason, curious about the loan growth. So that was pretty robust this quarter and actually the end of period, higher than the average. So it certainly suggests it was steady through the quarter. Can you maybe give some color around what's driving the loan growth? And also the decline in the loan yield, was that simply a function of LIBOR? Or was there some mix that was contributing to that as well? Jason Tyler : So the loan growth, I'd put it in 2 buckets. One is there's been an ongoing for the last several months, for this year and maybe even leading up to it, an initiative, a desire, a deliberate level of activity with clients to explain to them, we like the types of loans that we do, but we're willing to do more of them with those clients. And I've talked about being perceived as more of a reluctant lender. And so we're -- we've been talking to clients saying we'll do more. And so there's -- that has been a continued lift to our loan portfolio, I think, particularly relative to what we've seen in the rest of the industry. Now that said, there's also a chunk of it that's more -- that's probably more episodic. And we've talked about the spikiness in the deposits that can come from particularly GFO clients or very large asset owners. And there's an element that's there that's -- that we would view as episodic and spiky, and that's leading to both a big part of the increase that you mentioned and also is a driver of the yield. But back to the fact that we did see LIBOR come down a couple of basis points, that obviously is also going to have an impact on the loan portfolio as a whole. Brennan Hawken : Got it. Okay. And then thinking about organic growth in the quarter, what did you guys had signaled recently that things were starting to pick back up after being on hold with the pandemic and all of the disruption? So how did organic growth come in this quarter? And when you think about organic growth, particularly on the Wealth Management side, do you all typically use metrics that are consistent for Wealth Management like net new assets in order to gauge that growth? And is there any chance that we'll be getting some disclosure, maybe some formal disclosure around those metrics at any point so we can have a better, more clear sense of how this business is growing? Jason Tyler : Well, the -- we feel like -- we're giving revenue numbers by region and also splitting out the family office business. And -- so we can come back to the disclosure element, if you'd like, but just maybe start sequentially with your questions. The organic growth across the company was good, and it was strong in C&IS for the quarter. We look at that very much year-over-year. It's very difficult to try and unpack that on a sequential basis. But the C&IS business has had strong new business growth and that's coming to fruition, it's being onboarded and we're seeing good organic lift in the business. And then wealth, as you can see, it's benefiting a lot. It's more exposed to market growth. And so that's been more of a help. But there's also been good year-over-year growth in the Wealth Management business as well. I'll also call out and looking at the numbers a little bit deeper that a portion of the growth sequentially in Wealth came from what we think it was some nonrecurring items. We have those items in C&IS and we call those out, but we also have those in the Wealth Management business. And so that can be trust and state settlements. It can be how we account for alternatives. Coming out of the income statement, not a huge amount, but you call it $3 million, $4 million of the lift that we had, nonrecurring in nature. But overall, it was a good -- it was -- we'd say very strong organic growth quarter for the enterprise. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Michael Mayo : Mike, your opening comment, you mentioned the digital strategy and some changes that you made and how that's helping out right now. That's a very high-level comment, and it's appreciated. But can you connect that to some more concrete metrics on how it's actually impacting the results that we're seeing and maybe will impact the results ahead? Michael O'grady: So I think with digital, Mike, there's a number of ways to look at it. But to start with the reference in my opening comments there, particularly in Wealth Management. A lot of this is, as I've talked previously about switching from a new business generation model that has historically been primarily, I'll call it, either in-person or on the phone, if you will, to being more digital. And so when I talked about the Navigate Now campaign, that was essentially or driven by an online digital campaign. And the key to it was that how do we generate more opportunities from that, so leads from that. And so both with what was online, it was supported then with some more traditional media through advertisements. That generated thousands of leads for us at a high level, which then have been worked through to get to the leads that fit our profile and then could be followed up, I'll call it, in a more traditional way in doing that. The other one I'll mention, Mike, that I referred to is the Tax Policy Resource center, which is part of the Northern Trust Institute. And while we talk a lot about, that is our knowledge base that we leverage for our clients, but it's also a significant new business generation assets. And the reason why that's also digital, specifically to your point, is when we launch that center, which essentially is online, then that has generated significant new leads. So just with that policy resource center, since it's been launched, we've had over 250,000 views of that. And then from that, that gives us the data, if you will, to then follow up with those that are going to the center. And again, that doesn't mean that 250,000 of them will be \"good leads,\" but it's the funnel, which you then work those through down to, ultimately, being new clients. So that's -- when I mentioned digital, that was the reference on that front. And then to your point, more broadly with what we're doing just with digitalizing our entire business, that's much broader with regard to our technological capabilities that drive both new capabilities for clients, but also efficiencies for our business model. Michael Mayo : And on that last point, when you talk about efficiencies for the business model, is there any way you can size the potential, your aspirational targets, lowering unit costs, improving the expense relationship? Any kind of context you can put around that? Jason Tyler : Yes. So as you know, and you highlighted it there, there's a number of financial metrics, but one that we've looked to, which is the expenses to trust fees. And we've continued to drive that down over time. And I do think at a high-level financial perspective, that's where you're going to see it come through. And just to try to make that more tangible. So one of our big investments in Asset Servicing is in our matrix platform. That first is focus on transfer agency. And -- so with it, yes, it will provide a much better experience for our clients' clients, right, because we're doing that on behalf of asset manager clients. But also that is going to yield significant efficiencies for us. Essentially, that's the first, I'll call it, funding mechanism for the business plan to make that investment. And then the other, of course, is generating new business because of the capabilities. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : With regards to the outlook, Jason, I was hoping you could speak to what's driving. Is this some of the increased loan appetite in the current environment? I know you talked about really strong growth and demand across your client base. But I was hoping you could provide just some context around how much of seasonality or factor that maybe drove the step up given some of the tax seasonality? And just the implications for the NII trajectory in the back half? Whether there's a sufficient offset to the securities yield headwind that you had cited earlier in your remarks? Jason Tyler : The -- not a lot -- there's not a lot of seasonality on the loan side for us at all. Some on the deposits, but not on the loans. And so what I was talking about earlier is there may be a layer there that's less about seasonality, but more about just the spikiness of how some of our very, very large clients will sometimes come to us and say, we want to borrow a very large dollar amount to either avoid selling a large asset, avoid the public sale of large assets and we're happy. Those are extremely high-quality loans, and they're meaningful to clients to help on their liquidity needs. But you can also imagine pricing on them isn't something that's driving incredible increase in NII either. And so I don't think that -- I think it probably sticks out more in volume levels than it will in NII levels over time. Steven Chubak : Got it. And just for my follow-up also on NII. I was hoping to get a sense as to how you're thinking about managing some of the excess liquidity that parked at the Fed? You saw a very healthy step-up not surprisingly sequentially. And the securities growth has been relatively tepid as excess reserves have continued to expand. I want to get a sense as to whether you have sufficient excess liquidity or buffer? Some of those incremental funds back into securities? Jason Tyler : Yes. We've got a lot of -- we've got plenty of room right now if we wanted to move from whether it's HQLA to non-HQLA, whether we wanted to increase the balance sheet size of clients were the driver there, and saying we wanted to do significant increases. Again, we haven't -- we're not incredibly receptive to the phone calls from organizations we don't work with saying, \"Can we park $10 billion to $5 billion on the balance sheet?\" We've always talked about the balance sheet being there for our clients and being a strategic resource for us engaging with our clients. But at this point, we feel like we've got a lot of flexibility. I think you look at Tier 1 leverage of 7.1, and that gives an indication in and of itself of tens of billions of dollars of room that we could have to bring on additional assets and then include in terms of how we would deploy it. there's also plenty of room we have to move between HQLA and non-HQLA based on what we see as attractive in the market and the risk profile that we're looking at across the different asset classes that we invest in. Operator : Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : I had a couple of questions on some of the initiatives that you've announced recently, in particular, the European ETF launch and the alternative asset servicing digitization initiative. Maybe you can give us a sense as to how we should be thinking about the rollout, the timing, the impact? Is it likely to come through earnings in the next couple of years? Or is this client acquisition over time type of initiative? Jason Tyler : I'd headline both as long-term, strategically important, but short term, not needle moving from the income statement perspective. And take, for example, the European ETF, just -- we've got $160 billion in AUM in overall assets, mostly in Europe related to ESG. And we've got a nice business in Europe when it comes to dealing with ESG and fund launches. And so that's a good example of us thinking about what's important for our clients and working with the Asset Management business to determine what they can do to provide incremental resources for clients long term. Not -- if you think about the size of $1.5 trillion in assets in AUM in the Asset Management business, and that's not something that we think is going to be a needle mover to that $1.5 trillion, but also strategically really important. I don't know, Mike, if you have anything you want to add. Michael O'grady: Betsy, to address the other one, it fits into my comments on digitalization and the fact that the first driver often is the efficiencies that we get from it. So what we announced there on the alternative asset side is the ability to use machine learning in order to essentially capture all the data for alternative assets and digitize them, if you will, so that then they can be much more efficiently processed through the entire process. And so something that will benefit us on the efficiency and productivity side. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then just separately, obviously, equity markets are up nicely. We're hearing about a lot of pension plans that are looking to get frozen and put into the hands of OCIO providers. I know you're involved in that business. Could you give us a sense as to how you believe you're positioned for what seems like is a wave of opportunity here? Jason Tyler : Yes. You're right. I mean we're in that business and in a good way. And we -- if you think about particularly North America pension plans, our OCIO business is -- I'm a little stale on the numbers, but it was a 1 point within the last few years. We were the leader in that space. And so it falls into our sweet spot well. We've got very good expertise, very sophistic client base, particularly on the DP side of the OCIO market. Now flip side to it is you get a lot of clients who, as they derisk and do other things with their portfolios, they can -- that can sometimes work against you. But -- and so I don't think about it as a big wave that again is going to move the needle on $4 billion in fees. But it's -- but that's a very strategically important business for us, where we've done extremely well over time with high-quality clients and a very talented team. And so when there's money in motion there for firms to be thinking about outsourcing their DB plans, I think we're very well positioned. Michael O'grady: Yes. And I would just add, Betsy, because we do believe we're particularly well positioned for that trend because in addition to what Jason said, if you think about our business model, you have the OCIO practice that Jason talked about, but also we have relationships through Wealth Management and through the family office part of that as well, where we have exposure and connections into a number of foundations that might not be as large as some of the biggest that you read about, but are going through the same decision-making of whether they want to just outsource the investment activity there. And we think that will continue. And we think, again, we cover it, I would say, as broadly as anybody. Betsy Graseck : Okay. All right. And then just 1 squeeze-in question on the dividend. I know we talked earlier about the buyback, but should we be expecting any changes to the dividend going forward? Jason Tyler : Well, if you look over the last few years, particularly pre-2020, which is kind of a goofy year, but our dividend is pretty consistently 30% to 50% of net income. And it's been very consistent. And if you look at where this quarter falls, it falls right in the middle of that 30% to 50% range. And so nothing there that would raise a flag up or down, and we think it's very attractive. And we also -- interestingly, I think something people don't do a lot. We look at dividends relative to RWA, which is an interesting way to combine thinking about payout ratio with returns. And so as we look at our peers and you can pick your own, but both in terms of that -- the level of that payout ratio on a percent basis relative to earnings, the consistency of it and also how it is relative to RWA, which again gets to both returns and payout, we -- relative to the peers we look at, we score really well on those different lenses. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Kenneth Usdin : Just a follow-up on that point on capital further. I just want to make sure I clear that. It seems like you're focusing as much on just maintaining capital ratios with that balancing act you mentioned on RWA versus the combined shareholder return. So I know you guys don't give us formal targets. But I think historically, I might have thought you might have lived relative to where the others are. Is this a little bit of difference? Maybe it's post pandemic or maybe it's a -- you want to keep some aside for inorganic opportunities? Just wondering like just how we think about -- how Northern Trust thinks about your absolute capital in that regard? I understand the mix of usage has changed, but coming back to just like where you want to live on absolute levels. Michael O'grady: Sure. And Ken, it's Mike. I think you hit on the key factors and how those do change over time. So to your point, you said while the pandemic and how you may feel about that, that criteria is the operating environment. So we're always looking at that operating environment, determining where we think we need to be. The second, I would say, is certainly from a regulatory perspective. And again, feel very good about where we are there, but that's another lens to make sure that we think we're in the right place vis-a-vis all the ratios and the whole CCAR process and everything. And then third, as you mentioned, it's -- instead, I'll call it absolute, it's the relative capital ratios, which we know that, that is a part of the considerations that clients have when they think about a financial partner, a partner that they need to trust not just today to be around and be strong, but be around for a very, very long time. I mean that's part of the pitch, if you will, Ken, is that Northern Trust has been around and will be around through all types of environments and that we have amongst all the capabilities, but we also have the financial strength and capitalization. So that's why that criteria is important. And to your point, that can change over time as our peers move their capital levels up and down. Kenneth Usdin : Right. Okay. It just would seem to me that you've got plenty of capacity on all of those factors, plus room for balance sheet growth, plus room for buybacks, but it just seems like the mix of the buyback has become a smaller proportion, obviously, as we saw this quarter? Michael O'grady: Yes, it did. But as Jason went through, we've just gone through in the last 6 quarters, a meaningful increase in RWA. Largely intentional, if you will, as Jason talked about, where we saw the opportunity to really support clients and to get prospects that would not just be credit clients, but broader relationships. And so we saw that as a better opportunity at that time to redeploy in the business and RWA went up, as he said, more in the 6 quarters than it did in the 5 previous years in a meaningful way. Does that stay the same going forward? Yes, obviously, we don't know. But generally speaking, these things tend to change over time. Kenneth Usdin : That's very fair. And just 1 question on the deposit growth, which has remained stickier as you guys have mentioned. Are you comfortable housing at all on balance sheet, even though you're getting relatively low returns in the low rate environment? Or do you contemplate trying to move some of it off into off-balance sheet vehicles? Jason Tyler : We can start in that instance with what's best for clients. And we've got $280 billion in money market fund family. And so -- and the performance there is good. It's a very attractive set of money market mutual funds. At the same time, some clients really like the saying we want to be on the balance sheet. And some of i is geographic. Obviously, in the U.S., there's much more prevalence to use funds where some of our European clients like to use the balance sheet more. I think we're in a good position where we've got room on both sides, really good attractive offerings on both sides. Don't need to nudge clients one way or another for us. When -- that said, we sometimes look in different operating environments. We can think about pricing. We can think about the value proposition that we can offer clients in one platform versus another. And we can have conversations with them about that and do things, but not in a position at this point to have to nudge. Again, that 7.1% in this environment where all bank balance sheets are inflated, it gives us a lot of room to be able to just lead with what makes the most sense for large sophisticated depositors. Operator : Our next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Vivek Juneja : Just let me go back into the capital question since that -- since the buybacks and dividends have caught everybody's attention. Following up on your comment that you do, do it versus you watch versus peers and that you're focused on the risk-weighted assets, so that would imply that you're focused on the CET1 ratio versus peers. Is it a gap? What is the gap that you're trying to maintain above peers? Is it 100 basis points? Is it 50? Can you give us some sense of sort of as we think about how to -- in the constructs of your balance sheet, whatever assumptions we make, what is it that we should be keeping in mind? Jason Tyler : Yes. There's no gap in particular, and that's not even -- I also wouldn't say that's the only ratio that we look at, CET1. We're looking at -- we've talked about Tier 1 leverage a few times just this morning on this call. And there are other things that we look at as well in terms of the balance sheet strength and what -- credit quality and other factors and how all that -- duration and what exposures like to interest rate risk. And so there's a lot of ways to litmus test that. And then at the same time, we've also mentioned and Mike just walked through the framework a few minutes ago. We're thinking not just about the relative, but at an absolute level where we want to be, thinking about what the regulatory environment is like. And then I always remind people that we're not just making this decision unilaterally internally. We have really good engaged conversations with our Board around this topic as well and where we might want to be -- where we might want to take the balance sheet strategically. And so I know it's tempting to kind of look and say, okay, well, what's the floor and where are you going? But there are so many factors that we're looking at. And also, what's the reinvestment opportunity set look like. And if we've got opportunities to let RWA grow in ways that we think are building the future earnings, and that's what I think some people can miss is that the RWA growth isn't just a drag. That theoretically should give you -- should give a sense that there's potential future earnings that's expected. And we're still -- we're trying to grow earnings. And so looking at dividends and share repurchase, I think can sometimes take -- pull that narrative toward thinking about those things as the better way to redeploy earnings. But the RWA growth is reflective in some ways over the long run of the base of business that we have. Now again, it's not to say that we think RWA is going to continue to increase, it could come down. Even mentioning the loan growth we've talked about is something that had a significant increase in RWA at this period. If that goes away in a year, then the RWA would come down. And so there's so many factors that when we sit around the table and talk about where do we want to go with redeployment of earnings, we've got to try and predict not just where things are, but where things are going in each of these elements. But it's certainly broader than thinking about a specific gap on CET1. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Okay. Great. And one more on -- as you look at your overall expenses, you told us that the other operating expenses, what do you expect the trajectory to be. Are you seeing any other impact from an inflationary standpoint? Any color on that given the big talk in the environment about inflation? What are you able to do to offset that? Jason Tyler : I think we missed the operative word there. Are we looking to see any changes in -- what did you say to that? Vivek Juneja : From the rise in inflation, are you seeing any inflation creep impacting your expenses, Jason? And if so, how are you -- what are you being able to do to offset that? Jason Tyler : Thanks for clarifying, and then just another component of the question. The comments we made earlier weren't on other expenses. It was on outside services, just to make sure everybody understands what we were talking about in detail there. But -- the inflation is showing up in different areas. I mean every firm is dealing with talent issues and the pressure is there. We certainly see that and experience it, and talking at management levels about how to address it and the inflation we see across the business in different areas as well. And some of it is unit cost, but some of it is just the increased cost of doing business. And we talked about the significant increase in technology-oriented expenses that we're having. In some ways, that's an inflation cost on the business. It's not just a unit price in inflation, but it's inflation in the overall cost of doing business. So it's showing up in different ways across the organization. Michael O'grady: Yes. I would just add, Vivek, if you think about it in a manufacturing context, to Jason's point, we're seeing inflation on the cost side in a number of ways. In a manufacturing context, your question would be, are you able to pass that on to the end consumer? And that's not the way our operating model is set up. That said, if you think about generally how we're pricing what we do, a lot of it relates to the asset level. So to the extent that, that inflation is going through to AUM, AUC levels, you're capturing some of it there. And then also to the extent that you believe that there's inflation on the horizon as well, you would expect interest rates to go up as well, and we know where we are on rates and what the impact would be to the extent that those increase. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but maybe just to come back on the seasonal expenses in the second half. You gave us the color on the outside service expense. Typically, you see a seasonal bump in equipment and software expense, that's been pretty reliable at least over the last 3 years. So if you could just maybe comment on whether we expect to see that similar dynamic? And then in other expenses, just -- I don't know if I missed it, but the Northern Trust open is that it's going to be a factor for 3Q. Jason Tyler : Thanks for bringing up the equipment and software probably should have referenced that earlier. Yes, there's likely to be an increase there, as we think about what's happening over the remainder of the year. And it's not 1 or 2 areas that I could point you to, but it's just -- you're right, there are some dynamics where that tends to tick up. Some of the expenses that we -- some of the capital expenses that we put in place, you start to see depreciation come up there. And it's in a lot of different line items. It's -- but there should be a tick up there, a normal-ish or maybe even slightly above that increase in equipment and software. And then in terms of, Mike, you want to take that? Michael O'grady: It will be in the third quarter. Mark Bette : Yes. And Brian, this is Mark. I mean you could look at the business promotional line, even though that's not all the, but there's seasonality to it. And if you looked at it, 2017 through 2019, there was about a $16 million to $17 million step-up from second to third quarter. So that's probably a decent way to think about it. Brian Bedell : Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then -- yes, yes, go ahead. Jason Tyler : Last year, as we came into people wondered whether because of the pandemic, those numbers would be lower. And I think everybody should be thinking about it as more of a normal year. Numbers are marked throughout. That would be the 1 thing that's important for people to take away, right? Brian Bedell : Right. Okay. Yes, still make sense. And then maybe just on ESG, just back to that. 2-part question. You mentioned -- I think, Mike, you mentioned the ESG vector score that you launched. I think that's for asset owners, if I'm not mistaken. I guess the question there is, is that something that you are charging for separately or more built into the overall service offering? And then on the wealth side, are you seeing demand from your wealth clients increasingly to invest in investment with social responsibility? And are you meeting that through your own investment management or other open architecture managers on the platform? Michael O'grady: Yes, we are seeing the demand, Brian, kind of across the fronts that you talked about. So let me just give a little more detail to it. First of all, with our asset servicing clients, to your point, as they invest more in ESG, they need the analytics and data on reporting to support that. And so we are providing that type of service to them. And one of the examples that I mentioned earlier, the Marks & Spencer mandate that we had in the quarter was for that service, just as an example. And then with Wealth Management, absolutely, our client base is interested in ESG and increasing their investable assets in that area. And as much as we have an open architecture model with Wealth Management, much of it is serviced through NTAM. And so we've seen the benefit of that in NTAM. And NTAM on its own or in addition, on the institutional side is seeing that demand and fulfilling it as well. And so just to put some numbers on that, our ESG assets and NTAM now are at about $155 billion, which is up over 50% from a year ago. So healthy growth in that area, and it's an area of focus for us as a company. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's Q&A session. Thank you for joining the presentation.

At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mark Bette. Please go ahead, sir. Mark Bette : Thank you, Alan. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Northern Trust Corporation\u2019s third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Joining me on our call this morning are Mike O\u2019Grady, our Chairman and CEO; and Jason Tyler, our Chief Financial Officer. Our third quarter earnings press release and financial trends report are both available on our website at northerntrust.com. Also on our website, you will find our quarterly earnings review presentation, which we will use to guide today\u2019s conference call. This October 20th call is being webcast live on northerntrust.com. The only authorized rebroadcast of this call is the replay that will be available on our website through November 17th. Northern Trust disclaims any continuing accuracy of the information provided in this call after today. Now for our safe harbor statement. What we say during today\u2019s conference call may include forward-looking statements, which are Northern Trust\u2019s current estimates and expectations of future events or future results. Actual results, of course, could differ materially from those expressed or implied by these statements because the realization of those results is subject to many risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. I urge you to read our 2020 annual report on Form 10-K and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for detailed information about factors that could affect actual results. During today\u2019s question-and-answer session, please limit your initial query to one question and one related follow-up. This will allow us to move through the queue and enable as people as possible the opportunity to ask questions as time permits. Thank you again for joining us today. Let me turn the call over to Mike O\u2019Grady. Mike O\u2019Grady: Thank you, Mark. Let me join in welcoming you to our third quarter 2021 earnings call. During the third quarter, we continued to have success, executing on our growth strategies across each of our businesses. In our wealth management business, we have driven strong growth across each of our regions and our Global Family Offices business. We continue to see improved levels of engagement in new business activities with both, existing and new clients. During the quarter, we\u2019ve also invested and strengthened our depth of expertise. There is no question that labor markets are tight and competition for talent is fierce, but even admits this environment, we are very pleased with the additions to our team across the country. Within asset management, we continue to see momentum in our Quant active FlexShares ETF and ESG strategies. We launched six new climate-themed ETFs, which incorporate our new ESG Vector Score. Two of the launched funds were in Europe, marking our second launch of FlexShares offerings in Europe. We\u2019ve also continued to have growth in our liquidity products, and our money fund surpassed $300 billion in assets under management during the quarter for the first time. Additionally, our asset management business was recognized by Investment News as a 2021 Excellence in Diversity, Equity and Inclusion award winner for the third consecutive year. Our asset servicing business continues to see growth that is well-diversified across regions, products and client segments. We remain focused on driving profitable growth, while investing and expanding our asset servicing solutions. The current environment has continued to pressure margins earned by investment managers. And as they rethink their operating models and whether to move to outsource solutions, our Whole Office approach has put us in a position to help them achieve their goals. We\u2019re also positioned well to benefit from the trends of asset owners managing more assets in-house, as the flexibility of our model and ability to combine capabilities for these clients has been an area of strength. Our growth strategies within each of our businesses resulted in 11% year-over-year growth for our trust fees and 10% growth in our revenue. Our expenses also increased year-over-year, albeit at a lower rate as we continue to invest in technology and our staff, including higher levels of compensation as we build a diverse, engaged, workforce with skills for the future. Taken together, this resulted in both positive fee operating leverage, as well as positive total operating leverage. To close, I also want to express my sincere and immense appreciation for our employees around the world whose commitment, expertise and professionalism in serving our clients, communities, and one another continues to be truly extraordinary. Now, let me turn the call to Jason to review our financial results in greater detail for the quarter. Jason Tyler : Thanks Mike. Let me join Mark and Mike in welcoming you to our third quarter 2021 earnings call. Let\u2019s dive into the financial results for the quarter starting on page 2. This morning, we reported third quarter net income of $395.7 million. Earnings per share were $1.80. And our return on average common equity was 13.7%, which matches our performance from the prior two quarters. You can see some historical market data on the bottom of page 2. Recall that a significant portion of our trust fees are based on quarter lag or month lag asset levels. And both the S&P 500 and EAFE local had favorable sequential performance, based on those calculations. As shown on this page, average one-month and three-month LIBOR rates were modestly lower during the quarter. Let\u2019s move to page 3 and review the financial highlights of the third quarter. Year-over-year, revenue was up 10% and expenses increased 3%. Net income was up 34%. In a sequential comparison, revenue was up 4% and expenses were up 1%, while net income was up 7%. The provision for credit losses reflected a release of $13 million in reserves in the current quarter compared to a release of $27 million in the prior quarter. Return on average common equity was 13.7% for the quarter, up from 10.5% a year ago and consistent with the prior quarter. Assets under custody and administration and assets under custody were both up 21% compared to the prior year and flat on a sequential basis. Assets under management were $1.5 trillion and were up 17% from a year ago and also flat on a sequential basis. Let\u2019s look at the results in greater detail starting with revenue on page 4. Trust, investment and other services fees, representing the largest component of our revenue, totaled $1.1 billion and were up 11% from last year and up 3% sequentially. Foreign exchange trading income was $66 million in the quarter, up 8% year-over-year and down 6% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was driven by higher volumes, while the sequential decline was due to lower volumes and lower volatility. The remaining components of noninterest income totaled $110 million in the quarter, up 21% from one year ago and up 11% sequentially. Within this, securities, commissions and trading income was up 40% from the prior year and up 10% sequentially. Higher levels of interest rate swap activity benefited both the year-over-year and sequential results while higher core brokerage revenue also benefited the performance versus last year. Other operating income totaled $62 million and was up 17% from one year ago and up 15% sequentially. The increase compared to a year ago was driven by distributions from certain investments in community development projects as well as higher banking and credit related fees, partially offset by lower miscellaneous income. The sequential increase was primarily driven by lower expenses related to Visa swap agreements, and the higher income from investments and community development projects. Net interest income, which I\u2019ll discuss in more detail later, was $357 million and was up 6% from one year ago and up 4% sequentially. Let\u2019s look at the components of our trust and investment fees on page 5. For our corporate institutional services business, fees totaled $630 million and were up 8% year-over-year and up 3% sequentially. Custody and fund administration fees were $460 million and up 17% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential increases were driven by favorable markets and new business. Unfavorable currency translation and lower transaction volumes also impacted the sequential comparison. Assets under custody and administration for C&IS clients were $14.8 trillion at quarter-end, up 21% year-over-year and flat sequentially. The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by favorable markets and new business. The sequential performance was driven by new business and favorable markets offset by unfavorable currency translation. Investment management fees in C&IS of $114 million were down 17% year-over-year and up 13% sequentially. The year-over-year performance was driven by higher money market fund fee waivers, partially offset by favorable markets and new business. The sequential performance was driven by new business and favorable markets. Fee waivers in C&IS totaled $49.9 million in the third quarter, essentially unchanged from the prior quarter but up compared to $0.9 million in the prior year. Assets under management for C&IS clients were $1.2 trillion, up 17% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. The growth from the prior year was driven by favorable markets and client flows. The sequential decline was driven by modest unfavorable impact from markets and currency, partially offset by positive net flows. Securities lending fees were $20 million, up 2% year-over-year and up 3% sequentially. Average collateral levels were up 22% year-over-year and up 3% sequentially. Moving to our wealth management business. Trust, investment and other servicing fees were $481 million and were up 15% compared to the prior year and up 4% from the prior quarter. Fee waivers in wealth management totaled $26.7 million in the current quarter, compared to $29.2 million in the prior quarter and $4.4 million in the prior year. Across the regions in Global Family Office, the year-over-year growth was driven by favorable markets and new business, partially offset by higher fee waivers. For the sequential performance, the growth within the regions was mainly due to favorable markets as well as slightly lower fee waivers. Within Global Family Office, the sequential growth was primarily due to new business, favorable markets and lower fee waivers. Assets under management for wealth management clients were $373 billion at quarter end, up 17% year-over-year and essentially flat on a sequential basis. The year-over-year growth was driven by favorable markets and client flows, while the sequential performance primarily reflected client flows, mainly offset by unfavorable markets. Moving to page 6. Net interest income was $357 million in the quarter and was up 6% from the prior year. Earning assets averaged $144 billion in the quarter, up 11% versus the prior year. Average deposits were $130 billion and were up 15% versus the prior year, while loan balances averaged $38 billion and were up 16% compared to the prior year. The net interest margin was 0.98% in the quarter and was down 5 basis points from a year ago. The net interest margin decreased primarily due to lower average interest rates, partially offset by the benefits of balance sheet, volume and mix. On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income grew 4%. Average earning assets and average deposits increased 1% on a sequential basis, while average loan balances were up 6%. The net interest margin increased 1 basis point sequentially, primarily due to changes in balance sheet, volumes and mix. Turning to page 7. Expenses were $1.1 billion in the third quarter and were 3% higher than the prior year, and up 1% from the prior quarter. This quarter\u2019s results included a $6.9 million pension settlement charge within the employee benefits expense category, while the prior quarter included a pension charge of $17.6 million. Also, recall that last year\u2019s results included a $43.4 million charge relating to account servicing activities. Excluding these items, expenses were up 7% versus the prior year and up 2% sequentially. Compensation expense totaled $496 million and was up 7%, compared to the prior year, and was up 2% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by higher cash-based incentive accruals as well as higher salaries. The sequential increase is primarily due to higher cash-based incentive accruals. Excluding the previously mentioned pension settlement charges, employee benefits expense was down 3% from a year ago and down 6% sequentially. Outside services expense was $211 million and was up 13% from a year ago and down 3% from the prior quarter. Revenue and business volume expenses accounted for approximately three quarters of the year-over-year growth. The remaining year-over-year growth within the category included higher technical services, consulting, and data processing related costs, reflecting investment in the business as well as the timing of engagements. The sequential decline was driven by lower technical services, legal services and third-party advisor fees, partially offset by higher subcustody-related costs. Equipment and software expense of $185 million was up 8% from one year ago and up 4% sequentially. Both, the year-over-year and sequential increases reflected higher software support and amortization costs. Occupancy expense of $54 million was up 4% from a year ago and up 3% sequentially. Higher real estate taxes and building operation costs were the primary drivers of both increases. Excluding the prior year\u2019s charge, other operating expense of $81 million was down 3% from one year ago and up 20% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was driven by lower miscellaneous expenses and staff-related costs, partially offset by higher business promotion spend. The sequential increase was impacted by higher costs associated with the Northern Trust sponsored PGA Golf Tournament, partially offset by other miscellaneous expenses within the category. Turning to page 8. Our capital ratios remained strong with our common equity Tier 1 ratio of 11.9% under the standardized approach, down slightly from the prior quarter. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 7.1%, in line with the prior quarter. During the quarter, we purchased 860,000 shares of common stock at a cost of $100 million. We also declared cash dividends of $0.70 per share, totaling $148 million to common stockholders. The current environment continues to demonstrate the importance of a strong capital base and liquid balance sheet profile to support our clients\u2019 needs, and we continue to provide our clients with the exceptional service and solution expertise they\u2019ve come to expect. Our competitive positioning across each of our businesses, wealth management, asset management and asset servicing continues to resonate well in the marketplace and is generating organic growth across each business. Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust\u2019s third quarter earnings conference call today. Mike, Mark and I would be happy to answer your questions. Alan, will you please open the line? Operator : Certainly, sir. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr : The first question is on custody and fund administration fees, usually, we\u2019re beating you up and saying, why didn\u2019t they grow as much as assets. At this time, at 17% growth, almost kept pace with the 21% growth in assets. So, I guess, the underlying question is, what\u2019s the nature of the new business that you\u2019re adding on? How is that average fee compared to the overall average? And if there\u2019s anything else you could add on in there that would be great, because it\u2019s interesting. Thanks. Jason Tyler : Sure. Well, I\u2019ll start, and if Mike wants to jump in. In looking at what\u2019s been added on, what was interesting to me is that it\u2019s a really good blend across geographies and across client channels. And so, there\u2019s been good business that\u2019s been onboarded in EMEA, APAC, but also in North America. And then, you look at the client channels, whether it\u2019s our traditional institutional investor group, IIG or our fund services group, there\u2019s been business that\u2019s been onboarded across the board. Interestingly, we don\u2019t look that much at kind of the average fee per the assets coming on board. We look much more at what are we doing for those clients. And so, I think what jumps more to me is how we\u2019ve been able to continue to build in some of the other ancillary services that we\u2019re doing for clients. Things overall, like core brokerage and you see FX down mostly because of the summer dynamic, but it\u2019s up nicely over year-over-year. Mike, anything to add? Mike O\u2019Grady: I would just add, Glenn, two points. One is that with some of the new business that came on line during the quarter, it was -- as Jason mentioned, in North America, it was in fund services and specifically fund administration, plus other services related to that. So, think about those as kind of full-service clients, to your point, where per dollar of assets is going to be higher. So, good client wins on that front. And then, the second thing is that we also get growth through the, I\u2019ll say, success and growth of our clients. And we\u2019ve seen that particularly in the alternative assets area where they\u2019ve had good flows and good appreciation and that has flowed through to some of the increase in fees that you\u2019ve seen for us. Glenn Schorr : That makes a lot of sense. Maybe just a quick follow-up, now that you mentioned the alternative world. Obviously, it\u2019s a big push and ongoing momentum in the high net worth individuals, increasing their allocations to alts. We\u2019ve seen that at a bunch of the big broker dealers. We\u2019ve seen the alts getting success in distributing their product is big wealth management platform. Can you just talk to us about where you\u2019re at in terms of that evolution? Mike O\u2019Grady: So, strategically, we see that as -- it\u2019s been successful, to your point, Glenn, but still is a big opportunity for us across the Company, so meaning each of our businesses. And with each of those, I would say, we are trying to provide more in the way of services around that. So, within asset management, our 50 South business is completely focused on providing alternative solutions for our both wealth management clients, but also institutional clients. Certainly, within asset servicing, I mentioned there a little bit alternative asset managers. As you know, we have a relatively meaningful business in hedge funds -- with hedge funds, we\u2019re looking to expand that more to private capital where, again, we have a strong client base but looking to grow that faster. And then also within wealth management, if you just look at the asset allocation of our wealth management clients. At this point, it would indicate that overall, their allocation to alternatives should be higher over time. And so, how can we provide that? We have some solutions on our platform in addition to 50 South, where they can invest directly in alternative funds. But, we believe that there\u2019s more we can do across the spectrum of clients that we have. Operator : Next question will come from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : So, I just wanted to start off with a question on organic growth, and maybe specific to the wealth management segment. Some of your peers have been citing that flow rates have been running hot, expecting some moderation or normalization in the coming quarters. I was hoping you could speak to where organic growth within the wealth segment is running today? And what you believe is a sustainable flow rate for that business longer term? Jason Tyler : Well, I\u2019d start with separating the regions from GFO. And in general, over the last several years, the GFO business, which obviously is -- people that are less familiar than you are, Steve, that serves the very upper end of our market, clients with dedicated family offices. And we think that that matches our brand particularly well. And we\u2019ve seen strong growth there on a consistent basis. And so, within the wealth segment, that\u2019s where we\u2019ve seen higher levels. And then, I think progressively, in general, the higher the client base in terms of assets, that\u2019s where we\u2019ve done well. And so, that\u2019s been a continued theme for us. And as we look year-over-year, there\u2019s -- we\u2019ve always talked about the fact that wealth will be lower organic growth relative to C&IS through a cycle, but still positive, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen, even if we look year-over-year. Mike O\u2019Grady: I would just add, there\u2019s also a tremendous amount of activity right now, which difficult to predict how that will continue. But, when you think about family-owned businesses and other liquidity events, for business owners, that wealth creation, where it goes from a business to being liquid wealth, creates the opportunity for us to work with those clients in a different way. And so, there\u2019s been a high level of activity on that front. And we\u2019ll see what happens through the end of the year here, potential tax changes, things like that that generally creates opportunity for us. Steven Chubak : That\u2019s great. And just for my follow-up on the NII outlook. It\u2019s certainly encouraging to see the uptick in securities yields in the quarter. And just curious if the forward curve holds, have we reached a point where we\u2019ve lapped reinvestment headwinds? And just bigger picture in terms of the NII outlook more broadly, given strong loan growth and improving rate backdrop, should we expect to now grow off the current NII base level? Jason Tyler : So, we\u2019re still -- we\u2019re not fully all the way through from an NII perspective. The whole balance sheet is, call it, 85% to 90% through. But obviously, we\u2019re not quite all the way there yet from a securities perspective. We\u2019re getting close. We\u2019re still losing, I\u2019d call it, based on the reinvestment rates right now, about $1 million a quarter in reinvestment. But that\u2019s going to eventually taper off. And it\u2019s not as big of an impact as it was a year ago, obviously, just having $1 million quarter drag. And so, you\u2019re right in that from here, mostly the drivers are going to be based on what\u2019s happening in the business. And so, you saw strong loan growth and other factors of where we\u2019re investing be the key drivers of the movement in NII. And the drag from reinvestment is definitely much, much lower than what it was before. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : I\u2019d like to follow up on Steven\u2019s question. And his point I think is really fair. We\u2019ve seen a pretty significant acceleration from a lot of the wealth management firms, and it\u2019s happening broadly. It\u2019s happening in the mass affluent space. It\u2019s happening in the high net worth space. It doesn\u2019t seem like you guys have seen a similar magnitude of acceleration. But, we\u2019re not sure because we don\u2019t get the granular disclosure. So number one, could you maybe juxtapose -- do you juxtapose your growth versus some of those peers? And then, maybe if the growth hasn\u2019t accelerated the way we\u2019ve seen it, some of the others, why do you think that is? Do you think it\u2019s because you were focused on ultra-high net worth? Do you think it has something to do with your approach? And how you market to clients where face-to-face meetings are a lot more important? What do you think might be going on there? Thanks. Mike O\u2019Grady: So I\u2019ll start. And I think to your point, our business is different than what I would call the broad market for wealth managers. And as we\u2019ve talked about many times, we\u2019re more focused upmarket where some of that activity can be lumpier, if you will, where there are large transactions that either our clients are a part of or large wins where we\u2019re bringing on new clients with very meaningful wealth. And so, I think in that sense, you are going to have different dynamics that happened there. Now, we do internally track closely the flows and the revenues that are coming in from the different types of clients. And as much as there\u2019s been some variability in the proportion that\u2019s coming from the ultra high net worth versus the high net worth, it\u2019s still relatively steady. So, I would say, to your point, we are participating in this very kind of broad base. Whether we\u2019re participating as much as any one of the other particular competitors, I can\u2019t speak to. But on the higher end, it has its own set of dynamics. Brennan Hawken : And Jason, you recently flagged some upward expense pressure at an industry conference, which has been a big focus for investors. So, understand that, and it\u2019s probably too early to get much of a sense for magnitude on that front. But, if it is possible to try to frame the magnitude, that would be helpful, number one. And number two, even with that upward pressure, is the commitment and the focus still on generating fee revenue, operating leverage or organic operating leverage, ex the fee waivers? Jason Tyler : Thanks. I don\u2019t want to ramble, would it be helpful for me to just give a little bit of an overview expenses in general, or do you want me to just stay specifically on kind of what happened with technology, equipment and services, outside services? Brennan Hawken : No. It\u2019s much more about the outlook and thinking about next year versus what\u2019s happened here recently. Jason Tyler : So -- sounds good. So, we mentioned historically that we think about expenses in four categories. There\u2019s inflation, efficiencies, investments and growth. So, just keep that framework in mind, and I\u2019ll give some of the key themes that we\u2019re thinking about as we\u2019re thinking about 2022 expenses. So, first, inflation is going to hit in a couple of areas. Mike talked earlier about the pressures we\u2019re feeling there. In comp, we\u2019re going to see higher growth levels. Every firm is talking about the challenges of retaining and attracting top talent, we\u2019re no different. So, this will hit -- it\u2019s affecting the salary base now, but it\u2019s going to continue to embed over time, and we\u2019ll see a larger than historical adjustment in second quarter when our normal base pay adjustments actually hit. It also though -- it affects incentives, and that\u2019s already hitting the income statement. We\u2019ve got -- there\u2019s a higher incentive accrual in third quarter of 2021 as we\u2019re addressing these issues. And then, secondly, as you talked -- you highlighted kind of the equipment software and outside services line, which I think are -- we should really talk about those in concert with one another because there\u2019s some movement between those lines. And we want to -- we\u2019re going to continue investing in strengthening the technology foundation, given that we\u2019ve got the digital transformation that\u2019s happening in wealth management, and everything we want to do to maximize defenses against cyber threats. That means equipment, software and outside services are going to -- they\u2019ll continue to be on a higher growth rate relative to the other expense categories. Now, just remember, about half of those lines are tied to business growth, but we\u2019re going to see the foundational element of those continue to be invested in. The third theme I\u2019d call out is -- call it, a return to normal. And that\u2019s going to touch on occupancy and then travel, which hits in other operating expenses. We\u2019re going to be on the road more often, and that will hit that line item. And we\u2019re not going to likely get to pre-COVID levels, but -- by the end of next year, but that will be significantly higher. And then, the last theme is on efficiency actions. We embedded efficiency and productivity targets into our plan every year. We made a big push on efficiency this year with the staff actions. We took out 400 roles, mostly in North America. And that drove the savings we talked about of about $50 million. We\u2019re going to continue to push for opportunities across all the expense categories to find efficiencies. But those are the big four themes that have been on my mind is -- in our minds, not mine, all of our minds as we talk -- as we start to talk about 2022. So, hopefully, that\u2019s helpful in giving you a little bit of an outlook of how we\u2019re thinking about expenses. Brennan Hawken : It is helpful. Just the last piece to remind you about is the fee operating leverage, like despite this pressure, is that still committed? Jason Tyler : Yes. Thank you so much for reminding me that, because that is -- it\u2019s super important. And I think a lot of people try and think about, are Northern\u2019s expenses going to be flat, up? It depends. We consider ourselves still a growth company. We want to drive revenue growth. And so, that fourth element of the framework I gave in the beginning of those comments around growth, if we\u2019re growing expenses because of that -- because we\u2019ve got good revenue growth, that\u2019s fine. That\u2019s good. And so, the key thing we look at when we put all that together, well, what does the operating leverage look like for the company? Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : This follows the last question -- I\u2019m not sure you answered that last question. Maybe that was intentional because you\u2019re going to wait. So, do you think you\u2019ll have the operating leverage based on fees relative to expenses, even with the higher comp and cyber? But the general question is, where are you on the broader investing curve? I mean headcount this year should probably grow only by about 1%. And for the prior five years, it grew by about 5%. That\u2019s a dramatic reduction in the number of people that you\u2019re adding. So, it looks like a lot more productivity. So, the question is, how much is that driven from technology, and it\u2019s sustainable and it should help drive positive operating leverage in the future? And how much is simply more productive employees might cost more in the future? Jason Tyler : So Mike, I\u2019m going to start with that because you\u2019ve highlighted I think a really important dynamic, which is we have seen this meaningful increase in productivity. That said, looking at the drivers of that, yes, some of it is from technology that has enabled us to automate activities and other initiatives that we\u2019ve been executing on for some time period. That said, another driver is the tight market for talent. And so, -- and just the remote working environment. It\u2019s changed the operating environment. And to your point or question on sustainability, my judgment would be that it\u2019s a little tight. It\u2019s too tight at this point. So, we\u2019ve continued to grow as Jason\u2019s highlighted. Some of that growth, yes, comes through the markets. But we\u2019ve also added new clients, net new business for us. We\u2019ve added people as a part of that. We\u2019ve tried to do it very efficiently. But also, it\u2019s been a heavy burden, I would just say, on the employees to be able to deliver that in a remote working environment. And so, back to this broader question on what we\u2019re driving towards. It\u2019s profitable growth, which does mean growing fees, growing revenue faster than we\u2019re growing our expense base with that. Now, in any quarter and any year, it can ebb and flow a little bit, but that\u2019s the objective over time. And when we look at the profitability in this quarter, whether you want to look at the ROE, the pretax margin, or the fees to expenses, they\u2019re all at pretty attractive levels. Could they be better, particularly on the pretax margin if the rate environment changes? Absolutely, and we\u2019d like to see that. But, we think we\u2019re operating pretty efficiently today, certainly look to do more, but we\u2019re in an unusual operating environment. Mike Mayo : And then, one related question. As far as the investments in your back office, which you retooled, as it relates to the cloud, I think you are more conservative with your plans to move more workloads to the public cloud. And I\u2019m just curious as to why the more conservatism on your part versus some other financial firms? Mike O\u2019Grady: So, I would say we -- our cloud strategy is absolutely focused and tailored to our business, our client base. And so, the pace or how it would be characterized, Mike, relative to somebody else could be viewed differently. I don\u2019t have a problem with that. We\u2019re looking at how does it fit with what we\u2019re doing. Given the nature of our client base and what we do for them, yes, we are highly sensitized to all the potential impacts and risks of a transition like that. Now with that said, we have been very-focused, first, on the private cloud. And beyond the fact that that\u2019s been a strategy that we\u2019ve been executing on for years, in this past year, we completely upgraded the capabilities of the private cloud for us, and have many, many of our applications and activities in the private cloud. As far as public cloud, we\u2019re taking a hybrid cloud approach to that. To your point, I would say, being thoughtful about how we do it. And we are still in the earlier stages of the actual transition of applications and activities into the public cloud. The strategy is there to continue to do that but in a thoughtful, secure, stable way for our business and for our clients. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Jason, can you give us some color on -- you had real good loan growth this quarter sequentially. Just what was driving the loan growth? And then, also with the balance sheet, your average deposits, you pointed out, grew sequentially, but the period end numbers fell. So, maybe if you could give us some color on that as well. Jason Tyler : Sure. So, let me start with loan growth. Two buckets. One is in the personal side. And again, in that bucket, those are extremely -- those can be extremely high net worth clients that want to use our balance sheet to solve for liquidity needs. And the reason I highlight that is because it can be very volatile and unpredictable, but roughly half of the sequential increase came from that general bucket. The second bucket is commercial, which was about the other half. And that\u2019s more stable, and that\u2019s been in various areas, but we\u2019ve talked about going to our existing clients and doing more of the existing loan types with them, but explaining to them that we\u2019ve got appetite to do more with them. And part of our business model, not just financial model, is to grow with our clients. And I think that\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s driven our loan growth as our clients have been -- they\u2019ve been active. And we\u2019ve told them we\u2019re happy to participate with them more in those ways. And so, that\u2019s hit on the commercial line. And so again, I think part of it is the base there is -- it has definitely risen. But part of it is more -- some components that might be more volatile over time. And then, on deposit volumes, as you know well, because I know you follow this closely, that can also just be volatile. And we\u2019ve got -- our clients will -- don\u2019t call us and ask to put not millions, but sometimes hundreds of millions or billions of dollars on the balance sheet. And so, we don\u2019t -- we tend not to look at the deposit at the quarter end balances. I do look, coming into the quarter and after the quarter, how they trend and this quarter didn\u2019t look very different in terms of how balances trended coming in or out. So, I didn\u2019t over read the dynamic that you mentioned of the average versus quarter end. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Thank you. And then, you and your peers have had strong year-over-year growth in your fee revenues. You\u2019ve talked about it already on this call. Can you pull out for us, what percentage would you attribute the growth in the custody fees and the wealth management fees that is from market appreciation versus new business or additional flows from clients? Can you parse through that? Jason Tyler : Sure. So, I can split it. Let\u2019s just start. We do year-over-year. And if we think about the C&IS business, there\u2019s -- I\u2019d say, a good chunk has come from markets, call it, high -- mid to high single-digit. And then, there\u2019s also the organic or net new business, and other dynamics would represent the rest. And that adds up overall to kind of again, mid to high single digits but a little bit single digits, but a little bit last. Call it 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%. Mike O\u2019Grady: That\u2019s not total C&IS trust fees. Jason Tyler : Yes. And then, on wealth, I can do the same type of split for you. And a little bit more weighted toward market there, which is -- that had an impact that\u2019s stronger, if we look year-over-year, more like 15%, 20% type. And the organic piece, if I add it up, also strong but more in the low single digit range on a percentage basis. Mike O\u2019Grady: And waivers are certainly in that too. Operator : And your next question will come from line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : I had a question just a bit more strategic to kick-off on how you\u2019re thinking about the returns that you\u2019re going to be generating from the investments you\u2019re making today, in the various sleeves and across the globe. I\u2019m just wondering if we think about where we are today versus pre-COVID, has the return profile changed much for your incremental investment spend? Thanks. Mike O\u2019Grady: Betsy, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say that the return profile has changed. In many respects, what I think has been interesting through the crisis here is that, although there was a pause in some of the execution of projects and programs around investments in the initial stages of the pandemic, it picked up pretty quickly thereafter. And instead of groups all being in one room, working together on the digital project, they figured out how to do it by WebEx, Zoom or Teams. So, in that sense, we\u2019ve continued to make really good progress on investments, such as, just to give you an example, the digitalization of our wealth management business where there\u2019s a number of components to that journey, as we call it. And so, that progress has been very good. And I\u2019d say, in general, to your point on the timing or the profile for the returns on that should be similar to what we would have expected when we started it. The one thing I would say is just the characterization or the character, if you will, of investments in the different businesses, I talked earlier in the call about launching new funds in asset management, for example. So, there\u2019s meaningful investment that goes into product development. And again, throughout the last couple of years here, they\u2019ve continued to put out new products. And then, it takes some time period for those to obviously build AUM, but then are very profitable over time. That profile is very different than asset servicing, where a lot of the investment -- the return you\u2019re going to get is near term in the sense of bringing on a large client. There\u2019s some integration transition costs with that. But then, once that\u2019s up and running, essentially, you\u2019re getting the return for that investment. And then finally, just wealth management, I talked about some additions that we\u2019ve made, not just in the last quarter, but could go back. And there, you\u2019re hiring people and teams that are in different parts of the country. Again, it takes a little bit of time for them to get on and get acclimated, but they\u2019re productive relatively quickly as well. So, we look at all of those when we put together, both our longer term strategic planning but also the annual plan. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then, just a little more nitty-gritty. I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s any update on how you\u2019re thinking about the reinvesting the expenses that have been associated with the golf tournament. Is that going to flow through in other types of marketing, or is that really get thrown into the bigger bucket of opportunity set, and we could see that migrate into other areas of investment, not specifically around that sleeve of client that you\u2019ve been investing in with the golf tournament? Thanks. Jason Tyler : Yes. The way I would characterize it, Betsy, is the golf tournament was a great opportunity for us to build our brand and particularly focused on a certain target market, and that was highly successful. Going forward, we\u2019ll continue to invest in the brand. So, yes, some of that investment will go into brand building and marketing. However, there are also a portion of that, to your point, will be considered more broadly in the investments we\u2019re making, whether that\u2019s in people or technology or other areas to continue to grow the Company. Operator : Next we\u2019ll go to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Jason, wondering if you can give us an update on your thoughts around fee waivers from here, they came down a little bit. Obviously, rates moved a touch, but not that much. Just any updated thoughts on where you expect those to sit and vis-\u00e0-vis waiting for bigger movements in rates going forward? Thanks. Jason Tyler : Sure. A couple of thoughts. One, even though we saw a little creep this quarter, particularly relative to what we thought, it was actually if you think about it, it was driven more by volume. And we -- Mike talked in his opening comments about the fact that money market mutual funds are over $300 billion. That\u2019s a record for us. And so, -- and I think people sometimes forget that we\u2019re participating in the growth, but it also causes higher waivers. And so -- but what\u2019s more important is that the overall base of business that we have there is good. And so, if you add up the waivers plus what we\u2019re earning, and so you think about the overall capacity that we have at the current volume level, it\u2019s something like $475 million to $500 million. And that\u2019s a strong capacity that we have there. Now, will volumes stay in as rates go up, probably -- maybe not. But, it\u2019s nice that we\u2019ve had good volume growth there. And the other thing to remember is it doesn\u2019t take a big lift in rates for the waivers to come down. And a lot of our AUM there is more institutional pricing. Even our -- even on the wealth side, even the waivers that are associated in the wealth management side -- the nature of our client base means they price themselves more like institution. They have got the purchasing power to have more of an institutional approach. And so, the fees aren\u2019t that high. And it doesn\u2019t take that much more yield to clear those hurdles and start to get back to that capacity level. And then, if you -- the other dynamic is run rate wise, we\u2019re still -- as we sit today, we\u2019re still a little over $300 billion that held in over the quarter-end. And the run rate on waivers is right at $75 million a quarter. Ken Usdin : And then, second question is just coming back to the operating leverage point. This year, a bit of like easy comp for market levels, right, driving the huge trust fee growth, and then kind of a harder comp for costs off of last year\u2019s really low base. So, this year, you\u2019ve got this really wide gap, but an absolute revenue and an absolute cost growth rate that are both above trend, so to speak. And so, I think the reason why the questions keep coming up about cost growth is, next year when presumably we don\u2019t get as much of that back-end lift from markets alone, what happens with the absolute growth of expenses relative to what might be a slower -- and naturally slower overall revenue growth rate. So, how much of this year\u2019s 5%, 6% growth rate was also influenced by just kind of easy comps from last year, so to speak, as it helps to think us about like absolute levels of expense growth next year. Thanks. Jason Tyler : Yes. Just a perspective on that for you, Ken, is I think you\u2019re right. I mean, we did get a meaningful benefit from the market in the fee growth. And that helps that positive operating fee leverage -- fee operating leverage. The other way that I think about it is what is the absolute level of the expenses to fees. And so, now for this quarter, we\u2019re at about 102%. That is a much lower level than we\u2019ve been, and that\u2019s evidence of this positive fee operating leverage over time. And so, at that tight level, to your point, to then say, in the next year, can you continue to drive that down at that same rate? That\u2019s why I say, it kind of ebbs and flows, right? But we want to be in that range around that 100%, 105%, somewhere in there to make sure that we are appropriately investing in the business, et cetera, but also growing. We don\u2019t want to squeeze that so much that it impinges on our ability to serve our clients and to grow. Ken Usdin : Yes. Good perspective on reminding about that expense to trust fees. Thanks. Jason Tyler : Yes. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to Jim Mitchell with Seaport Research. Jim Mitchell : Hey. Just maybe on the balance sheet. If I look over the last two quarters, securities -- average security levels have been declining while cash levels have been growing. Is this you positioning for higher rates, or is this something else driving that? Mike O\u2019Grady: Something else driving that. And it\u2019s -- there\u2019s a hard line that people see externally between the -- between cash and securities. But, there\u2019s so many different security types that are actually within the cash and within the securities. And on the cost of cash and securities, there are some areas where we\u2019ve strategically gone back and forth into and out of. And that\u2019s frankly where the change in classification that you see has been driven. And so, there could be securities that are -- that have a risk return profile that are very similar to one another, one of which would be classified as cash and one would be classified as securities. And that strategically where we\u2019ll make some of the kind of portfolio decisions of where we want to be playing, based on what we\u2019re seeing in the marketplace and how we think about the risk return characteristics. And just in a sentence, that\u2019s what\u2019s been driving that -- the distinction that you see based on the external reporting classification. Jim Mitchell : Okay. But, can you maybe speak to whether you, a, believe asset sensitivity increased quarter-over-quarter? And how much of that Central Bank cash you think is available to invest when you feel the time is right? Mike O\u2019Grady: So, plenty of availability from a non-HQLA perspective. And we -- from our perspective, we\u2019re not constrained by that. We feel we\u2019ve got plenty of liquidity, plenty of buffers to be able to react if we see more opportunities in the marketplace. And we\u2019ve just -- we\u2019ve been running the portfolio based on consistent risk return characteristics and where we want to be from a liquidity perspective, but certainly no constraints and plenty of dry powder whether it\u2019s from a regulatory perspective or even our own view of what we want to do from more of an economic liquidity perspective for us to be able to put more to work, if we see the opportunity to do so. Jim Mitchell : Okay. And the asset sensitivity question? Mike O\u2019Grady: Yes. We\u2019ve actually stepped out a little bit. One way to get at that, just to give you more of a quantitative. We\u2019ve stepped out to about 2.7 in duration. And so, -- and there are other ways we can -- say again. Jason Tyler : Securities. Mike O\u2019Grady: For the securities portfolio. Thank you. That\u2019s not the overall balance sheet, but the securities portfolio, but it gives you a sense of how we\u2019ve made it. That\u2019s from 2.6 last quarter. And there are other things we can do even within that to provide to provide more flexibility, if we see opportunities coming on the yield curve. But, haven\u2019t done -- we haven\u2019t done much strategically there to change asset sensitivity. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but I do have two more. One, sorry if I missed this, but the growth in CI&S investment management up -- linked quarter, up 13% with money market waivers being flat. What was the main driver of that? Mark Bette : Hi Brian, it\u2019s Mark. So, you\u2019re looking at the sequential growth in C&IS investment management fees? Brian Bedell : Yes. Mark Bette : Just to make sure. Yes. So, yes, it was a combination of both, markets and organic growth. And to Jason\u2019s point, we did have with the higher money fund levels, even though waivers go up, that does come with fees, with net new fees. And that would have been partly behind that. But, if you were going to break it down, I\u2019d say that the new business or organic growth I would say drove a little bit more than the market growth did on that sequential growth. Brian Bedell : And it actually is a good dovetail into my second question, little bit broader, but ESG asset management, I think, last time I saw it, it was $155 billion, correct me if I\u2019m wrong on that, on Northern Trust, ESG AUM. Maybe just, the question I guess would be from the organic growth side of your investment management business. And as you think of that, coming both from the institutional side, and then especially on the wealth management side, how are you viewing that? First of all, it\u2019s important to your wealth management clients to have this capability -- investment management capabilities? And I think Mike, you mentioned launch of new products in the quarter. But then also the organic growth potential for Northern Trust investment management from developing those ESG capabilities, is that going to be a major driver going forward? Mike O\u2019Grady: So, Brian, I would say that that is a another major trend, obviously that\u2019s in the marketplace, but also big driver for our strategy going forward. Yes, across the Company, but as you highlighted, particularly within asset management, and at that $155 billion in AUM now, the growth rate over the last five years, there has been about double of what the market growth rate has been for ESG that we can measure it there. And to your point, this hits across our client spectrum. So, a lot of that -- it started more outside the U.S. in EMEA, where we initially saw that the greatest growth with institutional clients. But now, we are seeing it more through funds, and in the U.S. and with both institutional clients, but also, with our wealth clients. And we think we\u2019re still in the early days. We think that that ESG or sustainability investing will be at a higher growth rate than the rest of the market overall. Jason Tyler : And the 155 number\u2019s still ballpark, good number in AUM. Brian Bedell : And the plan is to develop even more product there, or do you think you\u2019re fairly set where you are? Mike O\u2019Grady: No. Definitely more product. A lot of it is leveraging this ESG Vector Score that was developed, which gives us a lot of capability to do more. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research. Rob Wildhack : A question on capital allocation. You\u2019ve been very transparent on the components of your overall capital allocation strategy ratio relative to peers, paying dividend, supporting growth, et cetera. Any change in your outlook on any of those components that could impact the capital return trajectory going forward? Mike O\u2019Grady: Thanks for reminding the framework for everyone. But, the key element there that has been a driver has been we\u2019ve been able to see the RWA growth because we\u2019ve seen loan growth coming. And that is -- it\u2019s a big factor in how things get driven. And there are other things too we could see from securities lending and other components of RWA. And at this point, we don\u2019t see the same type of RWA lift. Now, that -- it\u2019s not to say that it can\u2019t happen. And if it does happen and if we see it, then we\u2019ll then look at the other factors and determine where we want to be from a CET1 perspective in other areas. But as we sit today, we don\u2019t see the type of organic growth coming in RWA. That\u2019s the one component of that overall mosaic I would highlight. Operator : Next we\u2019ll go to Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : So, I had a question around the money market fund business. You\u2019ve had quite a lot of success growing that business in AUM and really gaining share against a large sort of book of inflows that the whole industry has seen. How sticky do you think those assets are going to be in light of tapering, hopefully near term, but also sort of longer term as we start to contemplate interest rate increases? I think we\u2019ve also sort of got accustomed to thinking about, alright deposits will probably start to leave the industry. But how intertwined do you think the money market loan business is with that as we sort of contemplate how much of fee waivers could ultimately come back? Mike O\u2019Grady: I\u2019ll start, Alex, and then Jason, who knows that business well, can give his perspective. But I think what\u2019s interesting is coming into the pandemic a couple of years ago, you had a combination of two things. One is the obvious, which you\u2019re pointing out, which is just significant easing on the part of the central banks, increased liquidity. And that absolutely drove the flows into the money market funds is one place. But the other dynamic is, that was also at a point in time where strategically, NTAM was expanding its distribution for money funds. And so, not only having a portal, but being on other portals. And so, it was an intentional strategy that hit at the right time to essentially capture more a greater share of the increased flows coming from the additional liquidity in the marketplace. So then, if you take that and then try to answer your question of what happens to the extent that you have tapering and some contraction there, I think, yes, of course, you\u2019re going to see it go down. But I think it\u2019s going to be stickier than you might think in the sense of it wasn\u2019t just the one factor. Alex Blostein : My follow-up sort of related to that, sorry, to go back to the operating leverage dynamic again. Mike, I appreciate you framing it the way you did is like, look, we\u2019re doing 100% to 105% expenses to total fees. That\u2019s kind of where we hope to be. As we contemplate fee waivers coming back, should I think of the expenses to fees going below 100%, which I guess would imply almost all of the fee waiver benefit will come through to the bottom line at 100% margin, or 100% to 105% is kind of what you see yourself living even within normalization and sort of interest rates? Mike O\u2019Grady: Yes. So, kiddingly, if you could also tell me what equity market levels are going to be at that point in time, that would help as well because -- but you\u2019re highlighting the right thing, Alex, that we\u2019re benefiting now from strong markets with regard to that ratio, and we\u2019re being penalized, if you will, by the money market fund fee waivers. And so, that\u2019s playing out in there. But I would say, more importantly, to your question is, yes, that\u2019s going to ebb and flow. But I don\u2019t believe that that is a ratio that just continues to grind down below zero and well below zero, et cetera. Because I think that that would actually -- again, that would impact our ability to have the right talent, make sure that they\u2019re compensated appropriately and fairly for all the value that they\u2019re delivering to invest in the technology to take care of our clients, but also to grow the business. So, simplistically, it would be a draw on the business if you try to squeeze it too tight, so to speak. So, that\u2019s why my own view is that that range is more importantly -- more important. Now, that said, that is not the only ratio that drives overall profitability and returns, as you know. And right now, with rates where they are and net interest margin where it is. The other revenues, so to speak, which are a bigger driver in driving the pretax margin are at a lower level than they have been. And so, point being, you can be in that range and yet have the other revenues growing in such a way that your profitability is going up and your returns are going up. Operator : All right. We\u2019ll take another question. We\u2019ll go to Vivek Juneja with JP Morgan. Vivek Juneja : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple of them. Firstly, balance sheet, given the plans for Fed tapering, your average deposits have been gradually going up. What do you see as the outlook for that given the tapering thing that I just mentioned? Do you see yourselves being able to continue to grow that? Jason Tyler : Well, I think it\u2019s hard to tell. I think, our clients right now see the flat yield curve. And I\u2019ve been saying -- I think it\u2019s less about the very short end of the curve. And in some ways, that\u2019s more to do with the shape of the curve. And if there\u2019s some lift in the medium, then I think that\u2019s more than anything else what might cause clients to move off of the overnight effectively to try and get some yield. Right now, with rates flat so far out, there\u2019s just no enticement to do anything else. Another dynamic is that some clients think about cash as an asset allocation. And we were just talking about the equity markets have done well. And so, with markets now where they are, and everyone is seeing their overall portfolio so much stronger, we should also assume clients are going to want to have more allocation to cash. And so, I think both of those dynamics need to be played through as we think through. But, we certainly think that the things Mike talked about with the money market mutual funds and the strength of our balance sheet are things that do attract clients to think that it\u2019s a good place for us to be able to provide liquidity resource for them. Vivek Juneja : A separate question for both of you. What are you seeing in the alt space in terms of pricing? The pricing compression overall that all of you talk about in the custody business, but specifically alts, which has always had a higher fee rate. Do you see that coming down more than the overall fee rate pricing? Do you see more compression there, given it\u2019s higher or any thoughts and color on that? Mike O\u2019Grady: Vivek, are you speaking to the investment product side of it? Vivek Juneja : No, to the custody business, the C&IS business, Mike, thinking more from that perspective, both hedge funds and the private side, especially with new players like you getting in, as you mentioned, trying to grow that more. How do you see that dynamic playing out? Mike O\u2019Grady: Yes. I would say that particularly on the hedge fund administration side of it, some of that has already played through in previous years. And so, like -- it would be similar then to other asset classes. On the private capital side, so PE and infrastructure and real estate and things like that. To your point, it\u2019s earlier in the development of that market. More of it I think will be outsourced over time. The size of the funds obviously are increasing. And so, just from a pure rate perspective, yes, I do think that that will play out and more compression on that, if you will, than in some of the other asset classes. Operator : We have one more question. We\u2019ll take that from Jeff Harte with Piper Sandler. Jeff Harte : So, pretty much everything has been asked, but the one I had left. Is there anything to highlight on the sequential increase in nonaccrual loans in the quarter? Mike O\u2019Grady: No. That did tick up. It\u2019s more episodic. We don\u2019t feel like we\u2019re going to have losses there. And we\u2019ve obviously -- reserves are very, very strong given the quality of our portfolio, but nothing to highlight there that jumped out at us as a concern. Operator : All right. It looks like we have no further questions at this time. So, I\u2019d like to turn it back to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks. Mike O\u2019Grady: Thanks, everyone, for joining us, and we\u2019ll talk to you in January for our fourth quarter results. Operator : All right. That does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank everyone again for their participation.",

Let me turn the call over to Mike O'Grady. Michael O'Grady: Thank you, Mark. Let me join in welcoming you to our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. I hope you and your families are healthy and well. Our performance in the fourth quarter generated a 9% increase in revenue compared to the prior year and a return on average common equity of 14.5%. Revenue growth reflected strong organic growth across each of our businesses, which also contributed to full-year earnings growth and a return on average common equity of 13.9%. Throughout 2021, we continued to have success executing on our growth strategies across each of our businesses, while enhancing our foundational strength through advancements in our data and digital efforts. In our Wealth Management business, we have driven growth across each of our regions and our Global Family Office business. We continue to see improved levels of engagement and new business activities with both existing and new clients, and we ended the year with a continuation of the strong growth in loans and deposits that we have seen throughout 2021. During the quarter, we began executing on our plans to expand our Florida footprint into Jacksonville, one of the fastest-growing Northeast regions within Florida. We were honored to be recognized by the Financial Times Group as the Best Private Bank in the U.S. for the 11th time in the past 13 years. We were also named the Best Private Bank in the U.S. for Family Offices, recognizing our Global Family Office group for its commitment to families of significant wealth, their private foundations and the family offices that serve them. Within Asset Management, we continued to see strong organic growth across key strategic areas of focus, highlighted by our money funds surpassing $330 billion in AUM during the quarter, our FlexShares ETFs reaching $20 billion in assets and ESG strategies growing to more than $165 billion in assets. During the year, we also benefited from growth in our multi-manager strategies and our outsourced Chief Investment Officer services. Our Asset Servicing business continues to experience growth that is well diversified across regions, products and client segments. A highlight of our new business success is the recent announcement of the expansion of our relationship with Pendal Group across Australia, the UK, Ireland and the U.S. Northern Trust has provided fund administration, global custody and transfer agency services to Pendal since establishing its first mutual fund offering in the U.S. in 2009. This mandate will now be extended to include fund accounting, regulatory reporting, collateral management, foreign exchange and middle office services across all of Pendal's businesses. This is an excellent example of how we grow our asset servicing business, by targeting a premier asset management firm, developing a relationship, providing exceptional service, growing along with their success in increasing their assets under management and then expanding the relationship by consolidating their activities and providing a broader set of capabilities. I want to commend the efforts of our employees around the world whose commitment, expertise and professionalism is serving our clients and communities and continues to be extraordinary. As we enter 2022, we remain focused on our long-term priorities and investing wisely for future profitable growth to deliver long-term value to our various stakeholders. Now let me turn the call to Jason to review our financial results in greater detail. Jason Tyler : Thank you, Mike. Let me join Mark and Mike in welcoming you to our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. Let's dive into the financial results of the quarter, starting on Page 2. This morning, we reported fourth quarter net income of $406.4 million. Earnings per share were $1.91 and our return on average common equity was 14.5%. Results for the quarter included a severance charge of $6.1 million, a pension settlement charge of $3.4 million, a $13 million gain within other operating income relating to property sales and net one-time tax benefits of $13.9 million, primarily relating to a lower net tax impact from international operations. Let's move to Page 3 and review the financial highlights of the quarter. Year-over-year, revenue was up 9% and expenses increased to 2%. Net income was up 69%. In the sequential comparison, revenue was up 2% and expenses were up 4% while net income was up 3%. The provision for credit losses reflected a release of $11.5 million in reserves in the current quarter compared to a release of $13 million in the prior quarter and $2.5 million in the prior year. Return on average common equity was 14.5% for the quarter, up from 8.8% a year ago and up from 13.7% in the prior quarter. Let's look at the results in greater detail starting with revenue on Page 4. Trust, investment and other servicing fees, representing the largest component of our revenue, totaled $1.1 billion and were up 8% from last year and flat sequentially. Foreign exchange trading income was $77 million in the quarter, up 12% year-over-year and up 16% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was driven by higher volumes, partially offset by lower volatility, while the sequential increase was due to higher volumes as well as higher volatility. The remaining components of non-interest income totaled $119 million in the quarter, up 28% from one year ago and up 8% sequentially. Within this, security commissions and trading income was up 11% from the prior year and down 1% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was driven by higher core brokerage revenue. Other operating income totaled $72 million and was up 46% from one year ago and up 16% sequentially. The increase compared to the prior year was primarily driven by the previously referenced $13 million in gains from property sales, distributions from investments in community development projects and higher banking and credit-related service charges, partially offset by lower miscellaneous income. The sequential increase is primarily due to the gains on property sales, also partially offset by lower miscellaneous income. Net interest income, which I'll discuss in more detail later, was $371 million and was up 7% from one year ago and up 4% sequentially. Let's look at the components of our trust and investment fees on Page 5. For our Corporate & Institutional Services business, fees totaled $625 million and were up 5% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. Custody and fund administration fees were $458 million and up 9% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by favorable markets and new business, partially offset by lower transaction-based fees. The sequential decline was driven by lower transaction-based fees and unfavorable currency translation, partially offset by favorable markets and new business. Assets under custody and administration for C&IS clients were $15.2 trillion at quarter end, up 11% year-over-year and up 3% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by favorable markets and new business. The sequential performance was primarily attributable to favorable markets. Investment management fees in C&IS of $113 million were down 9% year-over-year and were flat sequentially. The year-over-year performance was driven by higher money market fund fee waivers, partially offset by new business and favorable markets. Fee waivers in C&IS totaled $50.9 million in the fourth quarter compared to $49.9 million in the prior quarter and $11.4 million in the prior year quarter. Assets under management for C&IS clients were $1.2 trillion, up 13% year-over-year and up 3% sequentially. The growth from the prior year was driven by favorable markets and client flows. The sequential increase was primarily driven by favorable markets. Securities lending fees were $19 million, up 8% year-over-year and down 6% sequentially. Average collateral levels were up 16% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. Moving to our Wealth Management business. Trust, investment and other servicing fees were $486 million and were up 13% compared to the prior year and up 1% from the prior quarter. Fee waivers in Wealth Management totaled $30.2 million in the current quarter compared to $26.7 million in the prior quarter and $12.2 million in the prior year quarter. Within the regions, the year-over-year growth was driven by favorable markets and new business, partially offset by higher fee waivers. For the sequential performance, the growth within the regions was primarily driven by new business. Within Global Family Office, the year-over-year performance was driven by favorable markets and new business being more than offset by higher fee waivers. The sequential decline was mainly related to higher fee waivers. Assets under management for our Wealth Management clients were $416 billion at quarter end, up 20% year-over-year and up 12% on a sequential basis. Both the year-over-year and sequential increases were driven by client flows and favorable markets. Moving to Page 6. Net interest income was $371 million in the quarter and was up 7% from the prior year. Earning assets averaged $149 billion in the quarter, up 13% versus the prior year. Average deposits were $136 billion and were up 18% versus the prior year, while loan balances averaged $40 billion and were up 20% compared to the prior year. On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income grew 4%. Average earning assets grew 3% and average deposits grew 5%, while average loan balances were up 4%. The net interest margin increased 1 basis point sequentially. Turning to Page 7. Expenses were $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter and were 2% higher than the prior year and up 4% from the prior quarter. As mentioned earlier, the current quarter included $9.5 million in charges related to severance and a pension settlement, while the prior quarter included a $6.9 million pension settlement charge. Also recall that last year's results included a severance charge of $55 million and an occupancy charge of $11.9 million. Excluding these items, expenses were up 7% versus the prior year and up 3% sequentially. Excluding severance charges, compensation expense was up 7% compared to the prior quarter and was up 2% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by higher cash-based incentive accruals as well as higher salaries. The sequential increase was primarily due to higher salaries, partially offset by lower equity-based incentives. Excluding the previously mentioned pension settlement charges, employee benefits expense was up 3% from one year ago and up 10% sequentially. Both increases were impacted by higher medical costs and lower payroll withholding. Outside services expense was $224 million and was up 8% from a year ago and up 6% from the prior quarter. Revenue and business volume expenses accounted for just over a third of the year-over-year growth. The remaining year-over-year growth as well as the sequential growth within the category included higher technical services, consulting and data processing-related costs, reflecting investment in the business as well as the timing of engagements. Higher legal services costs also contributed to the sequential increase, but were down compared to the prior year. Equipment software expense of $196 million was up 11% from one year ago and up 6% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential increases reflected higher software support and amortization costs. Excluding the prior year charge, occupancy expense of $52 million was down 6% from a year ago and down 4% sequentially. Other operating expense of $79 million was up 9% from one year ago and down 3% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was driven by higher business promotion expense, partially offset by lower miscellaneous expenses. The sequential decline was impacted by higher costs associated with the Northern Trust-sponsored PGA golf tournament in the prior quarter, partially offset by increases within other business promotion spend and miscellaneous expenses within the category. Turning to the full-year. Our results in 2021 are summarized on Page 8. Net income was $1.5 billion, up 28% compared to 2020, and earnings per share were $7.14, up 31% from the prior year. On the right margin of this page, we outline the non-recurring impacts that we called out for both years. We achieved a return on equity for the year of 13.9% compared to 11.2% in 2020. The full-year revenue and expense trends are outlined on Page 9. Trust, investment and other servicing fees grew 9% in 2021. The growth during the year was primarily driven by new business and favorable markets, partially offset by the impact of money market fee waivers. Net interest income declined 4%. Average earning assets during the year increased by 16%, while the net interest margin declined 20 basis points, driven by lower average interest rates. The net result was revenue growth of 6% in 2021 compared to 2020. On a reported basis, expenses were up 4% from the prior year. Adjusting for the expense items noted in both years, expenses were up 6% from 2020. Turning to Page 10. Our capital ratios remained strong, with our common equity Tier 1 ratio of 12.1% under the standardized approach up slightly from the prior quarter. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 6.9%, down slightly from the prior quarter. We declared cash dividends of $0.70 per share, totaling $146.8 million to common stockholders. The current environment continues to demonstrate the importance of a strong capital base and liquid balance sheet profile to support our clients' needs. And we continue to provide our clients with the exceptional service and solution expertise they've come to expect. As we begin 2022, our focus is on balancing a variety of factors in the months ahead, with the prospect of higher interest rates benefiting our revenue, but conversely, the higher levels of inflation and the competitive labor market impacting expenses. We are relentlessly focused on strengthening our competitive position within each of our businesses, investing in our workforce and technology all while delivering attractive returns. Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust's fourth quarter earnings conference call today. Mike, Mark, Lauren and I would be happy to answer your questions. Ali, will you please open the line? Operator : Thank you. We'll go ahead and take our first question from Glenn Schorr from Evercore. Please go ahead. Michael O'Grady: Good morning, Glenn. Jason Tyler : Hi, Glenn. Glenn Schorr : Good morning. How are you? So a quick question for you. On that last comment you made about focusing all those things, you are not alone there. And so you had nice fee operating leverage for the year. The fee and expense ratio came up a little bit, obviously, because it was a super low number in the third quarter. So as you balance all those things as we look out into 2022, can that be the same key focus that it's been in the past as you balance all those things, meaning you'll get the benefit of rates over time, but the cost inflation is here now? So should we be prepared for 2022 being a tougher year for that metric? Jason Tyler : Yes, we should, Glenn. I mean \u2013 and you're hitting on an important point, which is that we all are seeing the prospects of rates. And we are extremely levered to the front end of the rate curve, both in NII and also in waivers, obviously. But the inflation is \u2013 that's hitting faster. And we saw it in the third quarter as we were looking at incentive comp accruals. We saw it in fourth quarter as we made some off-cycle adjustments, which we can talk about in salaries. But that inflationary component \u2013 and by the way, it's not just in compensation, it shows up in other areas of the income statement, it's going to hit first. But at the same time, the leverage we have to the front end of the yield curve means that when rates do go up, it's extremely beneficial to us. And we've been talking about that for two years, obviously, how much net interest margin and also waivers in the money market products have been impacted. Glenn Schorr : I appreciate all that. I'll let one of my peers ask on the NII stuff. I did want to ask a quick question on organic growth as a follow-up. You mentioned it, you spoke to it. It's clearly there because you can see it in your asset growth. But can you talk about whether it be new business wins and asset servicing and asset management or a one, but not yet funded pipeline? Thank you. Jason Tyler : Sure. Thanks, Glenn. Both of the businesses, and as you know, when we talk about the organic growth, we tend to talk about year-over-year, not on a linked-quarter basis, and that's a really important distinction. That said, and you touched on it, both asset servicing and Wealth Management had good lift from an organic perspective year-over-year and frankly in the quarter as well. And so you saw we've been talking about increased momentum in the Wealth Management business. We're starting to see that come through with higher fees on a quarter-over-quarter basis that's driven by new business and we get the same effect coming in asset servicing. The pipeline in both of the businesses \u2013 in the short run, it looks strong. The pipeline for the businesses has different timing, but in both instances, they're reflecting good activity in new business. And I think in the C&IS in particular, they see good activity overall. In the front end, it might be a little bit different. The back end is a little bit harder to tell. Glenn Schorr : Okay. Thanks. Jason Tyler : Sure. Thanks, Glenn. Operator : And we'll move on to our next question from Steven Chubak with . Michael O'Grady: Steve? Steven Chubak : Thanks a lot. Good morning, everyone. So wanted to start with just a question on capital management. As you noted, capital ratios continue to be quite strong. I believe, Jason, on the last call, you had talked to or spoken to the fact that the RWA inflation, the loan growth was consuming a lot of the capital build that you guys are generating. This quarter, that wasn't the case. We didn't really see any RWA growth and yet you tempered the buyback. I was hoping you can give some perspective as to what informed that decision. And how should we be thinking about the pace of buyback from here, especially if the pace of RWA growth does begin to moderate? Jason Tyler : Sure. Well, a couple of thoughts there. One, just for the quarter, what \u2013 the RWA growth is one dynamic, but of course, AOCI hits capital. And that's another dynamic we have to manage as well, which is why we were flattish quarter-over-quarter. That said, as we think about the overall \u2013 I know a lot of people are wondering what our game plan is from a buyback perspective. And if you just take \u2013 it's a good time to just take a look back at the year, and we generated $1.5 billion in capital last year from earnings. And so you take a step back and just say, where did \u2013 just the math you're doing, where did the $1.5 billion go? We did return $600 million to shareholders in the form of dividends over the course of the year. But we very intentionally grew the loan book. We saw high-quality opportunities on the horizon, and we wanted to be there for clients. And so you look year-over-year and loans are up $7 billion. And even within this quarter, they are up $1 billion or $2 billion. And if you think about where our capital ratios are, that $7 billion increase in loans, that drives \u2013 that takes another $900 million in the capital that we generated. And so you look at dividends and what happened with loans, that's right there, that's 100% of the capital we generated. Now even so, we did buybacks in the year of about $250 million. And so that's why you saw CET1 drift down a little bit. But the next important question is, is the loan growth good? And it was very good. It's good strategically for us because we supported clients, but it's also good economically. If you think about the ROE of loans, it's very attractive, particularly in a low interest rate environment. And so we feel really good with what we did in 2021. In 2020, the door was closed. Last year, we think we did the right thing for clients and shareholders by growing relationships and earnings. But as you're trying to predict what we're going to do in 2022, it's very different. We don't see the same loan growth on the horizon. And we've even talked about the fact that some of the loan growth we've had is in some of the areas of our business where it can be very spiky. And just as our clients put on \u2013 they can put on $1 billion or $2 billion or $3 billion in a deposit, they can do the same thing in lending. And so we could see lending be spiky both up and down, but don't see that same type of $7 billion growth year-over-year. Steven Chubak : Thanks for that color, Jason. And just for my follow-up, I wanted to ask \u2013 sorry about that. On the expense side, you did give that perspective, noting that the \u2013 on an adjusted basis, the expenses grew 6% to 7% this past year. Obviously, we had some nice market tailwinds, which will drive some impact on the variable expense lines. But as we think about some of the inflationary pressures that started to manifest late last year and are going to continue into this year versus that up 6% to 7% that you had talked about in 2021, should we expect the expense growth to be similar or even above that given the inflationary pressures that you spoke to? Jason Tyler : Well, let me hit the big three. Maybe I'll hit comp and then I'll hit technology, which gets it outside services and equipment and software expense. If you look at the comp line, again, we've already seen some inflation hit that line this year. And you see it was just the increase in comp this quarter, linked-quarter, $13 million of that alone came from salaries. And the impact of what we've done in these off-cycle adjustments, not done yet. And so we're \u2013 just from the actions we've already taken, we're going to see another $3 million lift in the comp line, just from those salary adjustments. Now secondly, what are we going to do with our normal base pay adjustments, which as you know, that starts in second quarter, but that's going to be higher and it's reflective of inflation. Usually, we see that be an $8 million to $10 million a quarter impact. This year, it's going to be more like $20 million a quarter. And so those salary actions combined are going to give, just in and of itself, that will lift the total comp line 5% year-over-year for the year. And on top of it, we then have to think about what hiring are we going to do and what other adjustments might we have to take. But that at least gives you a lens of what we can see at this point. Now let me switch to tech. And that's the other area where all financial services companies are spending a lot of time and a lot of investment. That hits us all across the P&L, but mostly in outside services and equipment and software. And you saw big sequential increases of about 6% in both of those categories this quarter. But as we look forward, very different impacts of what we think is going to be existing in 2022. In outside services, there's tech services within that category, a lot of project work that we're doing. We got a lot of that done in fourth quarter. We do not see a significant impact and significant lift in 2022 in outside services. In fact, the number you see now for fourth quarter, that's a good starting point for 2022, and any motion from there is going to be driven more by business activity. And obviously, there's a lot of business-related activity in that line item that could drive it, but the tech component, largely done and from an increased perspective. Equipment and software, very different. We are on a ramp there against 6% increase there. We ended that year well with the category, it was up 9% year-over-year over 2020. We're going to see that same type of lift in that category in 2022, maybe slightly higher. So what are we doing there? It's really four factors : one, depreciation, and that alone, as we know we can see, as we sit today, that's going to be up $45 million or $50 million. So just depreciation, which is kind of in the bank at this point, we know it's going to grow equipment and software by about 7% alone. And we know that there's some other increases coming. Two, inflation of the underlying costs and that hits in different ways. Three, we're continuing to invest in technology to get stronger and maintain a very strong foundation. And then lastly, business growth, including digital, so a lot of investment going on there in a handful of different categories. But those are the three big categories of expenses to give you a sense of what we know at this point. Steven Chubak : No, very helpful breakdown. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Jason Tyler : Thanks. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Kenneth Usdin : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Jason, you mentioned earlier that the company is meaningfully asset-sensitive. And I wanted to ask you \u2013 your disclosures in the 10-Q and 10-K give you an expected change over a base forecast. But I wonder if you could give us a more simple way of thinking about this cycle, what each 25 basis points of rates would give you in terms of NII dollars? Jason Tyler : Sure. Well, first of all, and you know this really well, it's not linear, and so let me give you the first one. I wish that the fourth and fifth were the same, but the first alone is, at a high level, if you think about, we've got about $70 billion in floating-rate earning assets. And we think we'll get about a $40 million lift on a quarterly basis alone on the asset side. We'll give up maybe $5 million of that in higher borrowing costs. So that's net $35 million before we really talk about significant beta, but we think that first lift is probably in that $35 million a quarter range. Now that the first lift, it also gets to waivers, Ken. And we've talked about the fact that our money market mutual fund family is \u2013 it's priced much more institutionally. And so it only takes one lift to work fully through the duration of the portfolio to get the vast, if not all, of the waivers off the table as well. And as you know, this past quarter, we waived $80 million and run rate on that is lower now. But I think it's important to think about both of those. If we go back to NII, as we get those second, third, fourth rate hikes, that's when we start to give up some of the gain coming from the deposit costs. Kenneth Usdin : Yes, perfect. And then just second one quickly on C&IS. You mentioned lower transaction activity. That line was flattish. Can you just kind of give us a help on magnitude on what type of holdback that might have been? And maybe just talk through FX translation headwinds as well? Jason Tyler : Sure. And it's interesting, as we talk about transaction costs \u2013 transaction volume, I think people look to FX and they look to security commissions and trading. Even within the custody and fund administration fees, there are transaction-related fees that feed into that line. And so that's what we're referencing when we're saying that some of those \u2013 that those costs were lower in the quarter. And you'll note in FX, for example, good quarter. And so just transaction volumes in FX and other areas were high. But within \u2013 as we really dug into why, what happened within the custody and fund admin lines within C&IS, it was more the transaction component, the non-asset, the AUC, non-AUM-based fees that were light in the quarter. Kenneth Usdin : Okay. And I guess, was that meaningful? And was FX translation a meaningful headwind this quarter too, sequentially? Jason Tyler : Yes. Mark, go ahead. Mark Bette : Yes. Ken, it's Mark. Combined, you're looking at about 2% there, with the transaction-based fees being more than half of that. So the two were a, I'd say, a fairly significant drag when you look at custody and fund administration on a sequential basis. Kenneth Usdin : Okay. Got it. Thank you. Mark Bette : Thanks, Ken. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jason Tyler : Hey, Alex. Alexander Blostein : Great. Thanks. Hey, guys. Good morning, everybody. So a couple of questions around the rate dynamics. I guess as we think about your deposit betas, and I appreciate nobody has a crystal ball, but as you think about the current cycle versus the prior cycle, has the nature of the deposit base changed much for us to sort of contemplate as we think about deposit betas over the next several quarters, right? Or do you think the experience you guys saw in the last cycle is a pretty good one as a sort of benchmark for deposit betas for this time around? Jason Tyler : We talk about it a lot, and I've thrown out to our team, is it similar to last time? And it's just \u2013 it's hard to tell. What I can give you some facts that, and it's less to the deposit beta, but more to just the overall asset sensitivity of the securities portfolio on the balance sheet. The duration has come down from \u2013 last quarter it was 2.7 and now it's at 2.6. And ironically, though, if you look at the duration of the overall asset side of the balance sheet cumulatively, it's much higher than what it was in the prior cycle. And so I can actually tell you this \u2013 as it sits right now, it's about 1.16. And if you go back to the last tightening cycle, 2015, it was 0.7. And so that's meaningfully different. Now we have to see how the deposits specifically react, but that at least gives you a sense of what the exposure of the overall balance sheet is like. But Mark, I don't know if you have anything to add. Mark Bette : The other thing that we've heard as well from our team to keep in mind, Alex, is the trajectory of the rates. I think last time, the rate hike started much slower than what it appears that might happen this time. So you might go through those rising betas in a quicker way because of that. So we'll have to see how that plays out as well. Alexander Blostein : Got it. Thanks for that. And then my follow-up is around, I guess, expenses again. And Jason, I appreciate you guys giving different pieces and that's helpful. And obviously, acknowledging that you guys don't give \u2013 put out guidance in terms of expense growth. I do like the way you talk about expenses to fees as a ratio and that got to some of the Glenn's points as well. But if you guys are at around 104 by our math in terms of expense to fees in 2021, you talked about inflationary pressures, but also you're getting money market fees back likely in 2022, which I would have thought would come in at a really high kind of incremental market. So when you blend it all together, net-net, we're staying kind of in this 103, 104, 105 range for 2022 and beyond as we kind of think about that ratio as a guide post sort of thing between the revenues and expenses? Michael O'Grady: Alex, it's Mike. I think your framework is correct or at least, I would say, aligned with the way that we're looking at it as well. Of course, we don't know what the market levels are going to be and how quickly the fee waivers come back, and obviously, we're managing through the expense side of that. But to your point of kind of being in a range of, I'll call it, efficiency there, we're in that range. And particularly in an inflationary environment, that can be challenging to try to get that ratio to go down. And as Jason alluded to earlier, where you really see the other side of the coin, if you will, is on interest rates and therefore, NII that then drops down to operating leverage. And so in the same way, we're saying, okay, stay in that expense to trust fee ratio as far as efficiency, but then look to pick up through NII so that you have positive operating leverage and that your pretax margin is in that range that you want to get the right returns. Alexander Blostein : Yes. That makes sense. That's consistent with kind of how we're thinking. Okay. Awesome. Thank you. Michael O'Grady: Thanks, Alex. Operator : We'll go ahead and take our next question from Brennan Hawken from UBS. Please go ahead. Jason Tyler : Hey, Brennan. Brennan Hawken : Hey. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to follow-up, circle back a little bit on capital and pull together a couple of the comments that you made on that, Jason. It seemed like what you said was that in the current quarter, there was some AOCI consumption of capital. And while you had $1.5 billion some-odd base of loan growth, the outlook for the loan growth is swelling and not really there. So number one, does that mean that your further consumption of capital from the loan growth side may slow? Of course, there could be a handoff to AOCI. And then number two, when you talked about the $7 billion versus the $900 million, it seems like that suggested a pretty high risk weight density in the loan book. Can you talk about the risk weight that you have in that loan book? And what kind of loans are driving that growth? Thanks. Jason Tyler : Sure. Well, let me start with the end, but don't let me forget the first part of it. The loans that we have are \u2013 and you can see it in our reporting, the first cut is it's weighted more heavily toward Wealth Management, obviously. And within that, it's a blend of personal, commercial real estate, corporate, commercial, and the risk rates on those don't vary dramatically from a risk weight allocation perspective. And so at a really high level, if you look at what our outstandings are and it's not going to vary within those categories significantly. Now then there's also some off-balance sheet commitments that aren't reflected there. But that gives you a general sense. And we've talked a bit, and I could now, if you'd like, if it's helpful to give you more of a breakdown of the loans and what they look like by category, and the growth has actually been relatively consistent. If you think about the increase, just for example, if you're trying to do the math there, if I look at increase in loans from third quarter to fourth quarter, commercial has been about \u2013 it's up about $1.5 billion, commercial about $650 million and personal loans about $350 million, commercial real estate $250 million and then some other stuff with the remainder. And so you can tell, it's relatively consistent to our overall volumes in the $40 billion portfolio. If I come back to your first... Brennan Hawken : Yes, go ahead. That's what I was just going to remind you about the first part. That's all. You're on. Thanks, Jason. Jason Tyler : I am notoriously bad at multiple-part questions. You've got to remind me. We just don't \u2013 we don't see the same outlook on loan growth. And I think you couple that with, again, we had \u2013 we generated $1.5 billion in capital. And we're starting \u2013 and if we do get what we walked through earlier, if we get multiple rate hikes and we start to have improvement from a net interest margin perspective, we start \u2013 waivers start to go away, then the math becomes different. And we can think about different ways to return that capital generated to shareholders. And we obviously \u2013 we go through the same framework that we always have. We think about the dividend first to make sure that it's something we're comfortable with and it's within the range we've talked about. And then we start to look at the outlook for the size of the balance sheet to stay where \u2013 within a range that we feel is appropriate, given all the dynamics we've talked about historically. Brennan Hawken : Excellent. That was very thorough and helpful. And you touched on the size of the balance sheet there, so maybe I'd like to ask for the follow-up. When you think about deposit runoff, because you typically with the business model, you tend to see deposit growth when the Fed is expanding its balance sheet and runoff when it's shrinking. But last cycle, the runoff for Northern for you guys was less than it was for some of the other custody bank peers. So when you think about what's driven the deposit growth at different types of businesses that have driven the deposit growth the past two years, is it largely \u2013 does it look similar to how it looked last cycle? Or has the composition of deposit growth shifted, which might suggest we should think about deposit runoff in a different way? Jason Tyler : No, I look at it a little bit differently. One is, I think we have to look at just what's happened with the asset values. And if you go back to the end of 2019, pre-health crisis and you look at what's happened with the S&P 500 from then to the end to now, the S&P is up, it's something like 48%. And if you look at our deposits on average, we went from averaging $85 billion to $90 billion up to $135 billion to $150 billion. It's a very similar increase. And then the second thing to look at is what's operational versus non-operational. And did we have similar growth \u2013 did all of the growth come in non-operational deposits? And the answer is absolutely not. A lot of \u2013 more of our growth has come in operational deposits. And then the third dynamic, which you got at is there is just this overwhelming dynamic of the Fed having put trillions of dollars of liquidity into the market. And whatever our little tiny $150 billion balance sheet looks like, it's still going to be impacted by what the Fed does. And so you put all those things together and you just \u2013 I don't think there's reason to believe, at this point from what we see just from that data, that there's some massive unwinding coming. Now it could come, but those data points tell you that not necessarily. Brennan Hawken : Got it. That's helpful. Thanks, Jason. Jason Tyler : Sure. Operator : We'll go ahead and take the next question from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Jason Tyler : Hey, Brain. Brian Bedell : Good morning. Jason, thanks for all that color on the expense areas and great granularity to . One follow-up on just a couple more areas and that's just the Northern Trust open, I think obviously, you're not doing that this year, but I think you alluded to in the past of potentially doing a marketing campaign in its place. And then maybe just any commentary around the travel, potentially higher travel expenses if we're all back to office and COVID hopefully recedes. Jason Tyler : Yes. So maybe I'll touch on travel and business promo and then maybe Mike can talk about golf tournament. So we're seeing business promo pick up again. It was up in fourth quarter. And so \u2013 and no one is cringing at that. I mean, it means that we're in front of clients more. And so is it going to get back to the levels we saw before? Boy, that's highly, highly unlikely, but already partially in the run rate in fourth quarter in other expenses. And we do expect that to continue to come. Now it's not \u2013 that's not adding $10 million a quarter in expenses, but it is adding to the expense run rate. Mike, do you want to touch on golf? Michael O'Grady: Sure. And the golf tournament has been a very successful marketing effort and client entertainment effort for us, particularly around branding. And as much as we've ended that relationship at this point, we still need to continue to invest in the brand. And so some of the proceeds that or the funds that are deployed for that brand building through the golf tournament are being redeployed in other areas. At this point, Brian, it's not going to be at the same levels as what we were spending on the golf tournament. Brian Bedell : Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just on expenses overall. I mean, it's actually a pretty good playbook over the last 10 years in terms of your expense history, with a pretty reliable middle single-digit type of expense growth in each year, which kind of, I think, ties... Michael O'Grady: I think we lost you, Brian. Maybe Brian, maybe you could re-queue and we could take that. Jason Tyler : Otherwise, we've got, I think, one more. Ali, do you want to \u2013 Alex, can you hear us? You're next in queue. Alexander Blostein : I can hear you guys. I don't know if I'm speaking live. Jason Tyler : We can hear you, so go for it. Alexander Blostein : Great. Sorry. Thanks for the taking the follow-up here. So a lot unclear on the deposit trajectory in terms of the sizing of the balance sheet. I'm curious how that could play out with money market funds because that industry has obviously seen tremendous amount of inflows as well. If you go to the last cycle, it's really not that clear there was a huge amount of decline in money market fund balances as the Fed started to unwind their policies in QE. How are you guys thinking about the sustainability of all the market share gains you've seen in the money market fund space because that will obviously inform the amount of money market fee waivers that's going to come back? So $80-ish million is kind of what you're waiving today per quarter. All of it is presumably going to come back with the first hike, but that obviously seems the balance to stay in the same place. Jason Tyler : Yes. So I think the similar math that we went through earlier on the deposits, I mean, we were at something like $215 billion in AUM pre-crisis and then we ended 2020 at $272 billion. We ended 2021 at $333 billion. And I can tell you, as we sit day before yesterday, we're at $324 billion. So it came down a little, but we have gained market share by any measure that we look at. And that's not \u2013 we don't think it's accidental. We did a lot of things related to cutoff times and the investment performance has been exceptional in those funds. And so we think we've earned higher market share there. And I think it's tough to tell. There's not just what happens as clients unwind, but there's also the prospect of regulation in the 2a-7 fund industry. And as you know, in Europe, there's much more of a demand for large institutional clients to use balance sheet as opposed to funds. And we'll see what happens here if there's a shift. And it's one of the reasons why we've done other things to try to launch new products to help our clients on liquidity to be able to provide other services and to be a third-party repo provider and to launch new funds that are more appealing with better cutoff times. And so we'll see what comes there, but the best defense we can have in the short run is having a good liquid balance sheet and have availability to bring on deposits if our clients want to, which is one of the reasons we always leave room to try and to bring more on to the balance sheet. That's why our leverage ratios have tended to be strong. Alexander Blostein : Got it. All right. Awesome. Thanks for the follow- up Operator : And we'll go ahead and move back to Brian Bedell. Please go ahead. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks. Sorry about that. Can you hear me now? Jason Tyler : You're good, Brian. Brian Bedell : Okay, great. Thank you. Sorry about that. Yes, just the follow-up was also on expenses. And I don't know if you heard me start the question. It was really about your expense growth on an annual basis, been pretty reliable over the last decade annually in that mid-single-digit area, almost exactly 5% over on an annualized basis, which I know you try to target some natural organic growth or the organic revenue growth. However, in the last tightening cycle in 2017, 2018, it was more elevated naturally in that 8% to 9% area, given obviously the leverage from rates. And I just wanted to get a sense of, is that \u2013 and as we think about sort of a trajectory, is that a reliable type of indicator versus the sort of the average over the last 10 years? Jason Tyler : A couple of thoughts and then Mike may jump in as well. One, in this cycle, things are driven less by what is the Fed doing to control growth. It's what is the Fed doing to control inflation. And inflation is correlated to our cost base. And so we're going to feel that and that's going to be different. And walking through the expenses earlier, just in the comp line, having a 5% growth there, and then equipment and software having a growth at or above the 9% we had year-over-year, you can tell we're in a mode where we're feeling expense growth over time. It's just got upward pressure on it. Now the good thing is that the growth in the business is good. And the benefit coming from rates, which is it's not distinct, it's correlated to the inflation. When inflation exists, we are getting a benefit partially coming from the fact that the Fed is fighting that inflation with higher rates. And luckily, we have good leverage in that. And we walked through earlier on this call that the impact to NII and the impact to fees. And so it's good, but I don't think that historical 5% is necessarily something we'd look at and say is that the right target given the environment we're in today. Mike? Michael O'Grady: Yes, just to add on that, Brian, is the reality is to serve our clients, but equally important to compete and win in the marketplace, we need the best people and we need digital capabilities. And so as Jason is saying, if you're in an inflationary environment, that's something you have to deal with because you need that expertise. You need the people to develop the technology as well. You need the people who service those clients and the price or cost of that is different. And the same thing with developing the technological capabilities to be able to compete as well. So hard to pick a number on that, but as far as the dynamics that you're going through, I think it's a combination of what Jason said there and then just what's happening in the competitive marketplace. Brian Bedell : Right. Yes. I was thinking the growth would be closer to that 2017, 2018 level of the 8% to 9% rather than the historical 5%, given everything that you've been saying, if that makes sense? Michael O'Grady: Yes. Brian Bedell : Okay. Great. That's super helpful. Thank you. Michael O'Grady: Thanks, Brian. Operator : And we'll move on to our next question from Gerard Cassidy from RBC. Please go ahead. Michael O'Grady: Hi, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Good afternoon. Hi. How are you, Jason and Mike? Jason, you brought up a good point about the appreciation in the markets correlating with the Fed's balance sheet growing so dramatically. In your slides, you gave us that the total revenue for the full-year that trust investment and other services fees were up 9%. I think you also showed us that the S&P on a fourth quarter to fourth quarter was up 25% or thereabouts. How much of the 9% growth would you attribute to the markets going higher versus your customers bringing in new business? Jason Tyler : I can get you pretty close on that. Mark Bette : Yes. You want me to\u2026 Jason Tyler : Yes, go ahead. Mark Bette : Sure. So Gerard, this is Mark. You're looking at the 9% full-year trust fee growth. And so if we can get there directionally for you because we did have, obviously, the significant waiver drag as well. So waivers, if you did the math, I think we're about a six to seven point drag, so that kind of brings you up to about a 16% growth without the waivers. And more than half of that was market, with the rest of it being organic, but fairly close. I mean, call it, 9% or 10% or so of that 16% would have been from markets. And then there's some other impacts like currencies and things like that. But the markets \u2013 that would give you a good proxy for the markets. Gerard Cassidy : No, that's very helpful. And then Jason, following up, you mentioned a couple of times about you don't expect your loan growth in 2022, which was up, I think, 20% in 2021 could be that strong. Can you maybe give us some color on where you're expecting to kind of pull it back or just not to be as aggressive in 2022 versus 2021? Jason Tyler : Yes, it's not a pullback. It's more \u2013 we felt \u2013 a couple of years ago, our bankers felt they made a good observation, which was \u2013 I think we were seen as a reluctant lender with our clients. And our clients were doing things. They took pride in having large assets for us to manage and advise, but they didn't \u2013 they thought we might not want to be a lender to them. And we wanted to deliberately go back and explain to those clients that if they wanted to buy a third home, if they were going to buy another business, if they were involved in private equity and needed warehouse lines, we're there for them to do that. And we're excellent in doing the underwriting and we're competitive on the pricing. And we didn't want to go out and do new types of lending with new types of clients. We wanted to do the same types of lending with the clients we knew. And so we've gotten through a lot of that. And we will \u2013 so from here, I think our lending opportunities will be more what does the market provide, but that go back to those clients and explain to them how much we want to be supportive of them. A lot of that has played through. And then the second dynamic, and I've talked about it before, is in this type of volatile environment, some of our ultra, ultra-high net worth clients, they will do very large loans. And so that's driven some of the growth as well. And it's just unpredictable whether that will stay on the books for a long time. Gerard Cassidy : And I know, Jason, you don't want to give a forecast on loan growth, but could it revert back to like pre-2019 levels in terms of that kind of growth as we look forward? Jason Tyler : I think it's less easy to predict. I do think at this point, the message is out that we're there for our clients. And so the answer is probably somewhere in between. But the spikiness, which could go up and could go down, is just something that our portfolio size-wise isn't as granular on a percentage basis. And so I just always try to remind people of that as they are doing calculations quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. Gerard Cassidy : Great. Appreciate all the color. Thank you. Jason Tyler : Yes. Thanks, Gerard. Operator : And with that, that does conclude our question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn it back over to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks. Mark Bette : Thank you. Thanks for joining us, and we'll talk to you in April for our first quarter earnings. Operator : And with that, that does conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

This will allow us to move through the queue and enable as many people as possible the opportunity to ask questions as time permits. Thank you again for joining us today. Let me turn the call over to Michael Grady. Michael O\u2019Grady: Thank you, Mark. Let me join in welcoming you to our first quarter 2022 earnings call. I hope you and your families are healthy and well. Like so many around the world, we at Northern Trust are deeply concerned by the tragic events unfolding in Ukraine. Our hearts go out to the Ukrainian people. Northern Trust has made contributions to humanitarian relief efforts and has match contributions from our employees to maximize their impact. While we have minimal direct exposure the crisis brings unique challenges. The broad use of economic sanctions and market restrictions means that we, along with our peers and counterparties have been called upon to play a role in implementing the world's response. The crisis has added to the uncertainty in the current environment, including volatile markets, supply chain constraints and persistently high inflation. While we are navigating this challenging backdrop, our performance in the quarter generated a 9% increase in revenue compared to the prior year and a return on average common equity of 14.2%. Revenue growth reflected organic growth across each of our businesses as well as the impact of rising interest rates. Compared to the prior year, our results generated approximately two points of positive fee operating leverage and one point of positive total operating leverage. We continue to have success executing on our growth strategies across each of our businesses, while enhancing our foundational strength through advancements in our data and digital efforts. In our Wealth Management business, we are growing across each of our regions and our Global Family Office business. We continue to see strong levels of engagement and new business with both new and existing clients. Later this week, we will host our second annual virtual Wealth Planning Symposium which will bring together experts from across the country to share planning strategies and perspective to support the needs and interest of our clients. The theme of this year's symposium, Wealth Redefined, builds on the Northern Trust Institute's 2022 wealth planning outlook which examines how shifting values have given investors the resolve to pursue what matters most in our rapidly changing world. Within Asset Management, we saw strong year-over-year organic growth across key strategic areas of focus, including our FlexShares' ETFs which surpassed $22 billion in assets, up 13% for the quarter. We saw strong growth in funds that traditionally offer inflation protection, including our Global Natural Resources Fund. We've continued to expand our FlexShares' ESG and climate funds with the recent announcement of the launch of a fund with exposure to emerging markets. This fund builds on our existing suite of Climate ETFs which currently includes U.S. large-cap equities, developed markets and two fixed income funds. Our Asset Servicing business continues to drive organic growth across regions, products and client segments. Our client focus and flexible global operating model continue to support our strategy and our pipeline remains strong. At the start of this year, we combined our Corporate & Institutional Services team with our Global Services operational team, creating a single integrated business unit with operational expertise focused on serving the needs and providing solutions for our institutional clients around the world. With this change, our Corporate and Institutional Services reporting segment has been renamed Asset Servicing. We recently released our 2021 philanthropic impact report which highlights our commitments to our communities through charitable contributions and the many hours of volunteering from our staff. Our employees, the heart of Northern Trust, are extraordinarily talented and caring and I commend their efforts in serving our clients and our communities. To close, we remain focused on our long-term priorities and investing wisely for future profitable growth to deliver long-term value to our various stakeholders. Now let me turn the call to Jason to review our financial results in greater detail. Jason Tyler : Thank you, Mike. Let me join Mark and Mike in welcoming you to our first quarter 2022 earnings call. Let's dive into the financial results of the quarter, starting on Page 2. This morning, we reported first quarter net income of $389.3 million. Earnings per share were $1.77 and our return on average common equity was 14.2%. Results for the quarter included $18.5 million in reclassification of certain fees that were previously recorded in other operating income, or as a reduction to other operating expense that are now included in trust, investment and other servicing fees. Of that amount, $6.9 million relates to fees previously recorded in other operating income, with $3.5 million now included in Asset Servicing trust fees within the other category and $3.4 million in Wealth Management trust fees. Additionally, $11.6 million that was previously recorded as a reduction to other operating expense is now included in asset servicing investment management fees. Prior period adjustments have not been reclassified and these reclassifications resulted in no impact, pretax or net income. Let's move to Page three and review the financial highlights of the quarter. Year-over-year, revenue was up 9% and expenses increased 8%. Net income was up 4%. In the sequential comparison, both revenue and expenses were up 3%, while net income was down 4%. The provision for credit losses was $2 million in the current quarter. Return on average common equity was 14.2% for the quarter, up from 13.7% a year ago and down from 14.5% in the prior quarter. Let's look at the results in greater detail, starting with revenue on Page 4. Trust, Investment and Other Servicing fees, representing the largest component of our revenue, totaled $1.2 billion and were up 10% from last year and up 5% sequentially. Foreign exchange trading income was $81 million in the quarter, up 3% year-over-year and up 5% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential growth were driven by higher client volumes and market volatility. The remaining components of noninterest income totaled $88 million in the quarter, down 12% from one year ago and down 25% sequentially. Within this, security commissions and trading income was up 4% from the prior year and up 1% sequentially. Other operating income totaled $41 million and was down 25% from one year ago and down 43% sequentially. The increase -- the decrease compared to the prior year was primarily driven by the previously referenced $6.9 million accounting reclassification. The sequential decrease was primarily due to gains from property sales in the prior quarter, the aforementioned accounting reclassification and lower distributions from investments in community development projects. Net interest income which I'll discuss in more detail later, was $388 million and was up 12% from one year ago and up 5% sequentially. Let's look at the components of our Trust and Investment fees on Page 5. Our newly named Asset Servicing business fees totaled $662 million and were up 7% year-over-year and up 6% sequentially. Custody & Fund administration fees were $453 million and up 2% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by favorable markets and new business, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation and lower transaction volumes. The sequential decline was driven by lower transaction-based fees and unfavorable currency translation, partially offset by favorable markets and new business. Assets under custody and administration for asset servicing clients were $14.5 trillion at quarter end, up 5% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by favorable markets and new business, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation. The sequential decline was primarily attributable to unfavorable markets and currency translation. Investment management fees and asset servicing of $147 million were up 27% year-over-year and up 30% sequentially. The year-over-year performance was primarily driven by new business, the previously mentioned $11.6 million accounting reclassification and favorable markets. Sequentially, the increase was primarily due to lower money market mutual fund fee waivers and the accounting reclassification. Fee waivers and asset servicing totaled $28 million in the first quarter compared to $51 million in the prior quarter and $28 million in the prior year quarter. Assets under management for Asset Servicing clients were $1.1 trillion, flat year-over-year and down 8% sequentially. The sequential decline was driven by market declines and client flows. Securities Lending fees were $19 million, up 3% year-over-year and flat sequentially. Average collateral levels were flat year-over-year and down 4% sequentially. Other trust fees were $44 million, up 9% compared to the prior year and 24% sequentially. Both the prior year and sequential increases were due to the previously referenced $3.5 million in accounting reclassification. The sequential performance was also driven by higher seasonal benefit payment services fees. Moving to our Wealth Management business. Trust, Investment and Other Servicing fees were $506 million and were up 14% compared to the prior year and up 4% from the prior quarter. Fee waivers in Wealth Management totaled $23 million in the quarter compared to $30 million in the prior quarter and $22 million in the prior year quarter. Within the regions, the year-over-year growth was driven by favorable markets and new business. For the sequential performance, the growth within the regions was primarily driven by favorable markets, lower fee waivers and new business. Within Global Family Office, the year-over-year performance was driven by new business and favorable markets. The sequential increase is mainly related to new business and lower fee waivers. For both the regions and Global Family Office, the previously referenced $3.4 million in accounting reclassification also contributed to the year-over-year and sequential increases. Assets under management for Wealth Management clients were $396 billion at quarter end, up 11% year-over-year and down 5% on a sequential basis. The year-over-year growth was driven by client flows and favorable markets, while the sequential decline was driven by client flows and lower markets. Moving to Page 6. Net interest income was $388 million in the quarter and was up 12% from the prior year. Earning assets averaged $150 billion in the quarter, up 7% versus the prior year. Average deposits were $139 billion and were up 10% versus the prior year, while loan balances averaged $40 billion and were up 16% compared to the prior year. The net interest margin was 1.05% in the quarter and increased 5 basis points from a year ago, driven primarily by volumes and mix as well as higher interest rates. On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income grew 5%. Average earning assets grew 1% and average deposits grew 2%, while average loan balances were down 1%. The net interest margin increased 6 basis points sequentially, driven by primarily higher average interest rates. Turning to Page 7. Expenses were $1.2 billion in the first quarter and were 8% higher than the prior year and up 3% from the prior quarter. The current quarter's expenses included the impact of the $11.6 million accounting reclassification which increased other operating expense. The prior quarter included a $9.5 million charge related to severance and a pension settlement. Excluding these impacts, expenses were up 7% versus the prior year and up 3% sequentially. Excluding severance charges in the prior quarter, compensation expense was up 9% compared to the prior year and was up 12% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by higher incentives and salaries. The sequential increase is primarily due to higher equity-based incentives as well as higher salaries. The current quarter's equity incentives included $49 million in expense associated with retirement-eligible staff, compared to $32 million in the prior year. Employee benefits expense was up 1% compared to the prior year and was flat with the prior quarter, excluding last quarter's $3.4 million pension settlement charge. Outside services expense was $213 million and was up 9% from a year ago and down 5% from the prior quarter. Revenue and business volume expenses accounted for just over 1.5 of the year-over-year growth. The remaining year-over-year growth reflected higher technical services and consulting expenses. The sequential decline was primarily driven by lower technical services, consulting, legal and third-party adviser cost. Equipment and software expense of $194 million was up 10% from one year ago and down 1% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by higher software support, rental and amortization costs. Occupancy expense of $51 million was up 1% from a year ago and down 1% sequentially. Other operating expense of $80 million was up 11% from one year ago and up 1% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was driven by the accounting reclassification, partially offset by lower miscellaneous expenses. The sequential performance was impacted by the accounting reclassification partially offset by lower business promotion expense. Turning to Page 8. Our capital ratios remained strong with our Common Equity Tier ratio of 11.4% under the standardized approach, down from the prior quarter's 11.9%. Our Tier one leverage ratio was 6.5%, down from 6.9% in the prior quarter. An increase in net unrealized losses on the available-for-sale of securities portfolio was a primary factor in this quarter's decline in capital ratios. During the quarter, we purchased 295,000 shares of common stock, totaling $34 million and we declared cash dividends of $0.70 per share, totaling $147.8 million to common stockholders. The current environment continues to demonstrate the importance of a strong capital base and liquid balance sheet profile to support our clients' needs and we continue to provide our clients with the exceptional service and solution expertise they come to expect from us. Our focus remains on balancing a variety of factors in the months ahead, with the prospect of continued higher interest rates benefiting our net interest income and inflationary pressures impacting our expense base. As our trust fees are impacted by both quarter lag and month lag markets, the negative markets in the first quarter will be more impactful for us in the second quarter. We continue to be relentlessly focused on strengthening our competitive positioning within each of our businesses, investing in our workforce and technology, all while delivering attractive returns. Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust's first quarter earnings conference call today. Mike, Mark, Lauren and I are happy to answer your questions. Jennifer, will you please open the line? Operator :  And our first question today comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. I guess I wanted to just unpack a little bit the outlook that we should be thinking about with regard to the 2022 expenses? I know that you have talked in the past about pressures on the business from inflation, et cetera. But this quarter came in really nicely. And it seems like there was quite a bit of expense management going on. So I just wanted to get a sense of how you're thinking through that. Jason Tyler : Yes. Let me start with the biggest volatility, maybe. And I think we should give some comments on the compensation line. And then if it's helpful to touch on one or two others, I can. So the biggest piece of the increase is obviously the Retirement Eligible Equity incentives which as you know, Betsy, hits in first quarter. That was just about $30 million last year but it was around $50 million this year. So that increase is driven by higher levels of grants, reflecting stronger relative 2021 performance but also the changes in retirement eligibility of staff actually receiving those grants. That's an important distinction. So if you take out that $50 million seasonal increase, that would imply that our comp run rate is flat from fourth quarter but there are some important puts and takes in there. So first, salaries were actually up $5 million to $10 million. And that's combination of some of the strategic hiring and the plan that we described to address the labor environment through some targeted off-cycle base pay adjustments. Secondly, that amount was offset by lower severance currency translation and some other small items that were favorable in this quarter. So if you look forward on the comp line, I'll make -- give you three nuggets. One is we know that annual base pay adjustments are going to be up $20 million that hits in the second quarter instead of a more typical run rate for us which is about half that level. Two, we're still going to be doing some projected hiring and some other adjustments and that could cause an incremental $5 million to $10 million lift next quarter. And then lastly, just a reminder that as pretax income changes, our underlying incentive levels are impacted. And that's important to keep in mind, just because of the potential increase in rates and that could have a meaningful impact on pretax to drive that line. So hopefully, that's helpful on the comp line which I think had the biggest volatility. Betsy Graseck : Got it. Okay. No, that's great. And then just a follow-up question on how we should be thinking about buybacks for the rest of the year. We've got some market volatility obviously impacting AOCI. Just thinking about whether or not as you're planning through the rest of this year, does AOCI matter? You obviously have still a very strong CET1 and TCE to TA, so maybe the answer is no. But given the back up in rates already Q-to-date, it looks like we're going to have another slug of this AOCI hit in 2Q. So how should we think through those dynamics? Jason Tyler : You're exactly right. And even -- we're 25 days or whatever into the quarter and we're already close to -- we're $350 million plus in the impact to AOCI for second quarter. And so we've got it -- we obviously have to keep line of sight on that. Now that said, you're also right. We -- first of all, we absorbed the AOCI hit in first quarter pretty well. CET1 capital was down just about 6%. The CET1 ratio stayed well into the 11s, it's 11.4% and so we absorbed it well. But you know that we're going to keep an eye on what we look like relative to peers in terms of capital and what happens with AOCI. It's a big lever. And the quickest thing we can do to address that is making sure that we're prudent about how we think about buybacks and that's one of the big pillars we look at as we think about capital actions. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And just to make sure, when you said you were $350 million plus, are you saying that if you had to close the books today, your AOCI hit would be $350 million more than it was last quarter, is that what you mean? Or it's less than? Jason Tyler : I'm sorry. Thanks for clarifying. Another 350 -- and it's actually like $367 million hit to capital. Just you've seen obviously -- yes, incremental and what the yield services -- that's right. That's what -- based on what the yield curve has done just so far this year, and that's as of last Friday for what it's worth. Betsy Graseck : Got it. Okay, thank you. Jason Tyler : Sure. Thanks, Betsy. Operator : And our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : Good morning, Jason. Hey, Mike. So obviously, lots of discussions around the trajectory of balance sheet in this rapidly changing market backdrop with interest rates picking up in QT. Relative to last cycle, it looks like Northern's balance sheet has increased materially more than it did in the last cycle. And in the last cycle, deposits overall have actually hung in relatively well compared to the rest of the industry. So maybe help us think through the latest thinking on both the mix of interest-bearing to noninterest-bearing deposits and kind of how that's going to evolve to your best, kind of, crystal ball capabilities? And then ultimately, the overall size of the balance sheet, how you expect that to evolve with QT? Jason Tyler : Well, on mix of the deposits and interest-bearing, noninterest bearing. I think what's -- I think the more important factor there is do we hold on to the operational deposits in the Wealth space. That's a big driver of value overall, the way we think about it. And -- and so far, we have not seen cash -- we haven't seen deposits moving off the balance sheet. However, have to anticipate that, that's going to come at some point given Fed actions and also just a rising yield curve where clients think about what their options are laddering out, taking some duration. And so that's super important for us. We're going to -- we want to maintain those high-quality deposits. There's another group that's more on the Asset Servicing or Institutional side. Even within there, there's some very high-quality core deposits but some of the more sophisticated clients will move those dollars around. And so that's just unpredictable. What we have seen so far that has created more movement that's been meaningful is out of the money market funds. And already, we've seen -- and you can track this on our website and in the industry. You've already seen clients in general in the industry moving out of money funds. And whether they're moving into ultrashort or other a little bit longer duration product, or whether they're moving into more risk assets is difficult to tell. Then on -- so that's a little bit on mix. On size, if you go back precrisis, the balance sheet, the deposit level was like 80 -- $85 billion and you look where it is on average now, much, much higher. And so I think we will -- we have to predict it's going to come down some but things are just different at this point and we anticipate that the balance sheet is going to hold in at closer to these levels and not give up dramatically what we saw precrisis. Alex Blostein : Got it. That's helpful. And then I guess, following up along the same lines, kind of reading between the lines, your comments around wanting to hold on to some of these core deposits. Any thoughts around deposit betas and maybe how they may be similar or different versus what we saw in the last cycle? Jason Tyler : Yes. For us, compared to last cycle when everyone was anticipating a move at a time and no one could really predict are we going to end it at 1% or 1.5%, every move seemed like you wanted to make sure you're handling betas the right way because it might be the last move. In this instance, we know that we're going to get rates moving a lot. And so I think that's something to think about differently strategically. We want to make sure -- again, we hold on to deposits with our good clients, particularly knowing that it's going to take a while before the Fed is done with these actions. And so already -- and you saw we had very good results in terms of raising net interest margin even given the fact that the Fed didn't move until very late in the quarter. That said, our bias is going to be hold on to client activity and hold on to client assets, particularly given the fact we think it's going to take a long time before things level out and the yield curve has reflected all the Fed actions that they're contemplating. Alex Blostein : Great, thanks. Jason Tyler : Thanks, Alex. Operator : And our next question will come from Kenneth Usdin with Jefferies. Kenneth Usdin : Good morning, guys. So follow-up on the NII discussion. Last quarter, you gave us a rule of thumb on how much each hike would give you both in terms of a gross basis and then how the deposit costs would act. I was just wondering if you might be able to update us just given that so much has changed, if that's still a net $35 million for each $25 million. And -- just any general thoughts on how you'd expect NII to traject from here, given Alex's points and just the magnitude of hikes that are now expected. Jason Tyler : Sure. Well, let me answer your question directly and then I'll give you some broader thoughts that you asked for. So first of all, the $35 million, we did say that was the first hike. And on a run rate basis that played through well. The good news is that even with that, that contemplated just the short end, the very short end of the curve moving up. But the overall yield curve has moved up. It's not as helpful but you'll get more lift as we get more -- as we get benefit from reinvestment. So let me use that as a transition to your other question, because you're right, NII is certainly on a sharp trajectory. So the eventual outcome is likely very dependent on the pace of change and again, what the shape of the yield curve looks like. So instead of giving an overall rule of thumb, let me give you some of the key sensitivities so you can sharpen your estimates as the key factors develop. So three big buckets on earning assets. One, on cash, the key item to remember is only 60% of those assets are in the U.S. dollars. Sometimes people forget that and I think that's important to remember. Two, securities portfolio. A higher percentage are in U.S. dollars but only 30% resets in 90 days or less. So just over $1 billion of the long-term securities are getting reinvested per quarter. We're currently experiencing about 85 basis points of reinvestment benefit on that reinvestment tranche. That translates to just over a couple of million dollars in lift quarterly for the long-term portfolio. And then third, loans, virtually all of that is USD and about 3/4 is tied to short-term floating rate indices. And so I gave you some comments on the liability side but that breaks down earning assets in the three categories. And so hopefully, that's helpful in thinking through the math as different things happen across the yield curve. Kenneth Usdin : Yes, very much so. And just a follow-up in terms of asset mix and growth, just on the prior questions about capital. The period end loans and securities are both down. Is that just a function of the deposits? Or is the change in capital causing you to change anything in regards to where you want to see asset growth or securities portfolio duration, et cetera? Jason Tyler : No, the headline is no change in philosophy. And the way the balance sheet works from -- once the deposits come in and size the balance sheet, the first determination is where do we need to hold cash across different central banks for various activities. And then the second is, what is loan demand? And the third is, therefore, what do we do with the securities portfolio? And so the loan demand is what really drives effectively in this environment the size of the securities portfolio. You did see in this quarter what looks like a bigger move between cash and the securities portfolio. But it's not -- that's not strategic. Some of the investments we make are more -- just classified, it's more of the classification in that three category bucket between cash and securities but there's nothing happening strategically there. Kenneth Usdin : Okay. Thanks a lot. Jason Tyler : Sure. Operator : And our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Adam Beatty : Good morning. This is Adam Beatty in for Brennan. Just wanted to draw in a little bit, basically following on the discussion that we were just having around Central Bank deposits and kind of a need across different geographies to have those in place. And kind of what's been driving that? And then what's the outlook, particularly on the non-U.S. front in terms of potential interest rate increases. Jason Tyler : Sure. It's driven by, well, largely just the activity and predominantly the Asset Servicing business. And so as we bring in deposits that are non-USD denominated, we need to keep cash and liquidity on hand for matching purposes and then we might even have agreements with different central banks to make sure that we've got funds on deposit in those institutions. And so the headline is it's driven vastly by the mix of international business on the Asset Servicing side. Adam Beatty : Does that change ? Jason Tyler : No, it does not have significant changes over time. Adam Beatty : Yes, great. And then if I could, I'd just like to drill into the loans and particularly the yield on the loans. You kind of alluded to the rates supporting that. I was wondering if there was any change in the mix of the loan book that also contributed to the increased yield. Jason Tyler : No nothing of note. I mean you have seen over time some of the -- more of the residential portfolio coming down. But -- but overall, mix is relatively stable over time. Nothing that would have a meaningful impact on the net yield of the loan portfolio. Adam Beatty : Got it. Thank you. Appreciate it. Jason Tyler : Sure. Operator : And our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Jason Tyler : Good morning, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Hi Jason, can you give us kind of a rule of thumb? Obviously, your assets under management and custody are skewed to equities. And can you share with us, is it primarily domestic U.S. equities that is comprised in that number? And second, -- is there any a 10% increase or decrease in equity values leads to X percent, or X percent decrease or increase in revenues in Asset Servicing? Jason Tyler : Sure. Mark, do you want to -- you want to take that? Mark Bette : Gerard, it's Mark. So when you're looking at the investment management fees themselves, it's probably a pretty good balance between both. We look at EFA Local and S&P 500 just as guidelines. EFA local, just because that removes the currency mix out of it. When we do look at the equity market sensitivity, just based on the asset allocation, a little bit more than 1/3 of the Asset Servicing investment management fees are equity-market sensitive. And those are -- those do happen both on a quarter lag as well as a month lag. And then if you move up to the Asset Servicing custody and fund administration category of fees, we said before about 40% of those fees are not asset sensitive. They're based on transaction volumes or fixed fees or fund level fees. The remaining 60% though, there is equity sensitivity there. That too is quarter lag and month lag. If you looked at that line overall, the custody and fund administration line, I think, $453 million in fees, about 27% of that would be equity sensitive just based on how the current allocations are. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Thank you for those insights. And then just as a follow-up question. Obviously, with the short-term interest rates moving higher, your money market mutual fund fee waivers will eventually go away. Should they -- and if the Fed raises rates in May by 50 basis points, will they be eliminated by the end of the second quarter? Or what's the schedule there? Jason Tyler : Ironically, we should split the waivers into two categories at this point. One is what are waivers that came as a result of interest rates forcing yields below stated fees. That first hike in mid-March eliminated -- it absolutely eliminated those fees, the waivers. Conversely, the business has decided to keep some waivers in place on -- some fee waivers in place for strategic reasons. And that's adding up -- they won't do that perpetually. But at least for the time being, they think that, that's important strategically. Again, in the spirit of keep client assets and make sure that we're attractive relative to our peers that currently is on a run rate of $10 million to $15 million a quarter. And that will persist but again, not perpetually. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Thank you. Jason Tyler : Sure. Operator : And we'll hear next from James Mitchell with Seaport Global. James Mitchell : Hey, good morning. Can you just maybe give us a sense of where you are duration-wise in the securities portfolio as well as the balance sheet overall? Did it change at all? Did it shorten up? Or just where we are on that front.. Jason Tyler : Sure. So right now, we're at about 2.7 . And we were -- I'd say, at the upper end of a range that we feel comfortable in. And -- so if there's any bias, it might be a little bit down. But again, we're -- the team looks very opportunistically at what's available in the marketplace and where we see good value. But right now, ticked up to about 2.7 , just under that. And then overall, the balance sheet is -- the overall asset duration is . James Mitchell : Right. Okay, that's helpful. And just maybe a follow-up on the custody and fund administration fees. How much on a quarter-over-quarter basis was the FX impact versus the volume impact? Because as you noted, you got a little bit of lift from the markets. Just trying to get a sense of those two other impacts in the magnitude. Jason Tyler : And you're looking on a sequential basis? James Mitchell : Yes, sequentially. Jason Tyler : Currency was not a lot. It was a drag of, call it, a little under 0.5 point. Right. And as you saw the transaction activity, that's where there was more of a drag than from the currencies on a sequential basis, Jim. James Mitchell : And is that just seasonal? Or do you think that, that persists? I mean obviously, a year ago was pretty active. Jason Tyler : Yes, we actually have seen sequentially for a few quarters now, the transaction type of fees kind of declining. So it's actually been something that we've seen for the last three quarters, I believe. So it's hard to say if that persists or not, we'll have to see. Certainly, there's been some pickup in at least what you would think is market activity in the last month or so. So we'll have to see how that plays out right through. James Mitchell : Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : And our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Hey, good morning. If you could talk more about this internal restructuring that formed the new Asset Servicing segment. I assume that to increase wallet share and market share with your institutional clients, if you could verify that. And also, just by ZIP code, if you don't have the exact number, what kind of share do you have with these institutional clients now and this restructuring will kind of get you to what kind of targeted market share or something in the ballpark. Do you have 2% share, looking to 4% or 5% going to 10%? And if my premise is correct, as to why you restructured. Michael O\u2019Grady: So Mike, it's Mike. The primary reason for integrating those two parts of our company are to be more aligned with the clients and being able to provide better service for them. So we really are trying to integrate everything from the front aspect of our business, the client servicing part of it through operations. And just the scale of our Asset Servicing business now is such that it made sense to integrate those parts of the business. So that's the overall aspect of it, or I should say, objective is better client service. I think that there are added benefits to it as well certainly from an efficiency perspective being more aligned. And then to your point, if we are effective in doing that, should it increase our wallet share? Absolutely over time. But I would think about wallet share a little bit differently in the sense that, that can vary based on the type of client that we have. So just a little bit of context there. If you think about asset-owner clients, maybe start with the corporation that has a defined benefit plan and the defined contribution plan. We may be the asset servicing provider to one or hopefully both of those. And so by providing better service, if it's only one, you're absolutely right. The objective is to be able to do for both and we have examples of that in this recent quarter. And then on the asset manager side, there again it's going to depend on the asset manager. If you think of the largest asset managers in the marketplace, we are an asset servicing provider to them. To your point on wallet share, it may be a minority proportion of their overall business on that front. But given the magnitude of the size of the client, it still can be a very attractive client for us. And the reason why that works that way for those largest asset managers is, one, just the sheer magnitude of what they're doing and the needs they have, they want to have diversification of providers. You've certainly seen that in the marketplace. But also, they have many more different fund types. They're in more geographies. And so they look to have best in breed, if you will, depending on the fund and the location and other factors. Now that said, as you look at other large asset managers that are not the largest but say, $50 billion to $100 billion in assets under management, there we're looking to have, I'm going to call it, 100% market share. But essentially, we're looking to do everything from them, front office through middle office and including back office or custody. And so in those cases, it's critical since we're their operational partner there, that we're able to provide seamless service for them. And this integration between the C&IS business group that we had in Global Services into one unit enables us to do that better. Mike Mayo : And  benefit efficiency savings or not? Or is it really about just the customer  ? Michael O\u2019Grady: Definitely about the customer. First, my belief, Mike, is that we will get efficiencies over time. But just to be clear, when we put these together and you can see in our results here, it did not involve a reduction in force or a charge or anything like that. And that's because we're looking at it to make the business stronger and provide better service, not to try to cut parts of the operations out. Mike Mayo : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research. Rob Wildhack : Good morning, guys. Wondering if you could stick with fee revenues a little bit more and just talk about the organic growth trends both in the quarter and as you see for the rest of the year in Asset Servicing and in Wealth? Jason Tyler : Sure. Let's start on Asset Servicing. And first of all, even though you saw the not as strong of a lift relative to prior periods, we did have positive new business in the period. And if I kind of do a further double-click into what we talked about earlier, new business was slightly positive. I'm just talking sequentially, market impact was a little bit of a lift. And then to Mark Bette's point, transaction volumes, that was a big drag. As we look forward, we do see good  funded business and the pipeline there is strong. And so it's above average for the business. And so the near term looks positive. And then you look a little bit further out, it's not as clear but the activity seems fine there as well. If I switch down to Wealth Management, you'll see that the GFO business really stood out. And I'll unpack that a little bit, if it's helpful. We saw just again sequentially a meaningful increase there of about $10 million or $11 million. $5 million of that was from waivers but another $5 million of that increase came from higher average balances in -- particularly in the money market mutual fund space. And the reason that I call out the money market mutual fund space is that's another area we're coming -- at the end of the year, balances were quite high. And because they're in funds and those are daily charged fees, we got a benefit of those funds sticking around the first couple of months of the quarter. But as we look into second quarter, the launch point is a little bit lower, just a couple of million dollars but it's just something that's noteworthy. But overall, you do see the family office business is doing well and it's just underlying good client activity -- or some of our strongest, largest clients choosing to do more with us. And then if you look at the regions, a similar story overall, just not as large in terms of movements but positive from a net new business and flows perspective. Waivers helped there a little bit and markets helped and then the accounting change shows up a little bit as well. And part of what you're seeing there and the region is not doing well, day count had an impact in the regions of a few million dollars, so they had to offset that coming from fourth to first quarter. But again strong particularly in the family office business. Rob Wildhack : Okay. And maybe just to follow up on that. I think there's been some commentary and maybe an uptick in competitive intensity in the ultra-high net worth space. So maybe you could comment just broadly on the competitive intensity you're seeing in Wealth generally but especially in that ultra-high net worth or GFO-type segment. Jason Tyler : Mike, do you want to start? Michael O\u2019Grady: Sure, so you're absolutely right. I mean it's a high level of competition. But that's -- we look to differentiate ourselves from. And as you heard in some of my opening comments there, we really try to differentiate based on the advice that we provide the expertise that we have and then certainly the services and the performance that go around that. And candidly, the numbers are demonstrating that, that does make a difference. If I step back a little bit and just look at the environment we've been in for the last couple of years, it's been a strong environment, a healthy environment for wealth creation and particularly for that segment of the market. So it's a time period where you've seen a high level of sales of family businesses, given the demand for that, the high valuations, concerns over changes in tax law. So high level of activity. And then I think we're well positioned for that. Not only do we have relationships with families over time but also we have very strong relationships with what we consider centers of influence. So think about it, attorneys and bankers, investment bankers that work with these families that we've been working with for long periods of time as well. And a good portion of our new business comes from those relationships as well. So it's been a good environment. We think we provide a differentiated proposition to those clients and prospects. And it's a competitive environment but one that, again, we think that would stand out favorably. Rob Wildhack : That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you, both. Jason Tyler : Sure. Operator : And our next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Vivek Juneja : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. A couple. Firstly, what's your expectation for deposit betas on operational versus nonoperational deposits as you look out over the first 100 basis points and then the next 100 basis points, given that we may have lot more rate hike system? So if you can parse that into the operational versus nonoperational. Jason Tyler : I don't know if we want to try and cut it that finally. And as you can imagine, there are some clients where a portion of the deposits are crossover categories and -- so I think for us, it's just looking at what does the market give us. And we're not a price maker in the deposit side. And this is very much working with clients and thinking about the relationship holistically. There are, oftentimes, with large holistic relationships where thinking about deposit pricing can be something that's part of the overall narrative in pricing around the relationship. And so difficult to make high-level comments about what our expectations are there. Vivek Juneja : Okay, different topic. You gave outlook for comp expenses. Any update on the non-expense lines, Jason? Jason Tyler : On the non-comp expense lines, do you mean, Vivek? Vivek Juneja : That's right. That's right, Jason. Jason Tyler : Yes. I can give a couple of comments on -- I think, the big ones, equipment, software and outside services. So on outside services, that came in lower than it was in fourth quarter. And big drivers there, consulting and legal but a lot of the consulting costs were lower. And some of those matters matured more quickly but we may still get back to that fourth quarter run rate but more like the end of the year. It's hard to say at this point. But we have been able to get some of those more consulting-related projects down. And then, also technology services costs were down despite the fact that market data costs were up, because of good business activity. So I think that's notable. And then on equipment and software, that's relatively flat from fourth quarter. And so if we look at that sequential period, no significant headlines. It's more driven by the timing of some of our anticipated spending. However, I will say that over the remainder of the year, we can see depreciation coming in and that's going to start to hit. And we can see that from what's now already in the pipeline. And that could accelerate and it could be another $5 million a quarter starting in second quarter for the remainder of the year. Vivek Juneja : All right. Thank you. Jason Tyler : Sure. Operator : And our next question comes from Dean  with Evercore ISI. Unidentified Analyst : Hey guys, this is Dean  on for Glenn. Just had a quick question around T+1. It looks like the SEC is looking to implement T+1 by the end of next year. So wondering if we could just get your thoughts on why this move might be harder versus prior settlement reductions? Any estimates around how much time and money it will cost you guys to get there? And then I guess, just broadly the positives and the negatives of shortening the settlement cycle. Michael O\u2019Grady: Sure. A relatively technical question there and we can follow up, I'll say, with the experts on some aspects of it. But what I would say is we've been moving and I think the industry as well for some time period to shorter and shorter settlement times. And that has -- actually, I think, been very beneficial to the industry to our clients. And I view this as a continuation of that. Now where it ultimately ends as far as settlement, I don't know exactly. And as you know, that it cuts across different markets and different types of securities. But from a client service perspective and what we offer, we've tried for some time period to be able to provide real-time information. So even if the settlement may occur at T+1 or T+2, we have the ability to do it on a settlement basis but then also the ability to do it on a real-time basis in some circumstances or at least a T+0 basis. And so that's been the movement for some time period. You're right, it absolutely requires investment in technology, changes in processes and controls to be able to do that. But the direction of traffic has been that way for some time period and we think that will continue. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. That\u2019s all for me. Jason Tyler : Thank you. Operator : That does conclude our question-and-answer session and concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jennifer Childe. Please go ahead. Jennifer Childe : Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone and welcome to Northern Trust Corporation's second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Joining me on our call this morning are Mike O'Grady, our Chairman and CEO; Jason Tyler, our Chief Financial Officer; Lauren Allnutt, our Controller; and Mark Beatty and Briar Rose from our Investor Relations team. Our second quarter earnings press release and financial trends report are both available on our website at northerntrust.com. Also on our website, you will find our quarterly earnings review presentation, which we will use to guide today's conference call. This July 20th call is being webcast live on northerntrust.com. The only authorized rebroadcast of this call is the replay that will be made available on our website through August 17th. Northern Trust disclaims any continuing accuracy of the information provided in this call after today. Please refer to our Safe Harbor statement regarding forward-looking statements on Page 11 of the accompanying presentation, which will apply to our commentary on this call. During today's question-and-answer session, please limit your initial query to one question and one related follow-up. This will allow us to move through the queue and enable as many people as possible the opportunity to ask questions as time permits. Thank you again for joining us today. Let me turn the call over to Mike O'Grady. Michael O'Grady: Thank you, Jennifer. Let me join in welcoming you to our second quarter 2022 earnings call. We generated solid results in what turned out to be a more volatile and uncertain market and macroeconomic backdrop than we've experienced in some time. New business momentum continued to be strong and our capital position remains robust. Revenue increased 12%, EPS grew 8%, and we delivered a return on average common equity of 15.7%. Second quarter results benefited significantly from higher interest rates and the elimination of money market fee waivers related to low rates. The weaker equity and fixed income markets began to impact our fees and client levels, and due to the lag in our billing cycle, this impact will continue in the third quarter. We saw a 7% sequential decline in average deposits, however, these were largely non-operational in nature. Our clients continue to see us as a valuable partner for the liquidity needs. Our expenses increased 9% compared to the prior year, reflecting inflationary impacts across our cost base, particularly within our Compensation and Equipment and Software lines. Despite this inflationary pressure, we achieved three points of positive operating leverage in the second quarter. In Wealth Management, we continue to see healthy levels of engagement with new and existing clients. Growth within our Global Family Office was particularly strong. In Asset Management, consistent positive flows into our FlexShares' ETF complex helped to partially offset equity market headwinds and broad-based liquidity outflows in our institutional channel. At $21 billion, our FlexShares' assets under management were up 13% year-over-year. We also saw strong growth in our alternatives offerings in the quarter. Notably, we were recognized by Asia Asset Management's 2022 Best of the Best Awards as the Winner of the Best ESG Manager in Asia, Best Factor Investing Manager in APAC, as well as the Best Application of ESG. Our Asset Servicing business continued to see positive new business momentum and the pipeline remains robust. Notable wins announced in the quarter, including Wilmington Trust and U.K.-based International Biotech Trust. Our Integrated Trading Solutions capability continues to be an area of strength. We also continue to see strong interest in our Investment Data Science product suite. In closing, as we navigate these volatile and uncertain times, we remain laser-focused on serving our clients, generating profitable long-term growth, and delivering value to our stakeholders. Before I turn it over to Jason to review our financial results in greater detail, I would like to note that we plan to publish our 2021 Sustainability Report in the next few days. I'm very proud of the progress we've made in our sustainability journey and serving as a force for change. Highlights for the report include our commitment to be net zero by 2050, a summary of our community support initiatives and the launch of a more holistic business diversity program. I'll now turn the call over to Jason. Jason Tyler : Thank you, Mike. And let me join Jennifer and Mike in welcoming you to our second quarter 2022 earnings call. Let's dive into the financial results of the quarter starting on Page 2. This morning, we reported second quarter net income of $396.2 million. Earnings per share were $1.86, and our return on average common equity was 15.7%. Results for the quarter included a $20.3 million pension settlement charge within the employee benefits expense category. Also recall from last year, we implemented accounting reclassifications to certain fees at the beginning of the year, which will continue to impact the year-over-year comparisons as noted on this page. Our effective tax rate was 26.7%, which compared to 24.3% in the prior year and 23.8% in the prior quarter. The increase is largely related to our international earnings mix, including reserves for uncertain tax positions. We now expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 24% to 25% on a go-forward basis. Let's move to Page 3 and review the financial highlights of the quarter. Year-over-year, revenue was up 12% and expenses increased 9%. Net income was up 8%. In the sequential comparison, revenue was up 3% and expenses were up 1%, while net income increased 2%. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar resulted in a reduction in our year-over-year revenue and expense growth rates of approximately 2%, and a reduction in the sequential growth rates were approximately 1%. The provision for credit losses was $4.5 million in the quarter. Return on average common equity was 15.7% for the quarter, up from 13.7% a year ago and up from 14.2% in the prior quarter. Let's look at the results in greater detail starting with revenue on Page 4. Trust, Investment and Other Servicing fees representing the largest component of our revenue totaled $1.1 billion and were up 6% from last year and down 2% sequentially. All other remaining non-interest income declined 2% from both the prior year and the prior quarter. Net interest income, which I'll discuss in more detail later, was $470 million and was up 37% from one year ago and up 21% sequentially. Let's look at the components of our Trust and Investment fees on Page 5. For our Asset Servicing business, fees totaled $643 million and were up 5% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially. Custody and Fund Administration fees were $434 million, down 5% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was primarily driven by unfavorable currency translation, partially offset by new business. The sequential decline was driven by unfavorable currency translation, as well as unfavorable markets. Assets Under Custody and Administration for Asset Servicing clients were $12.8 trillion at quarter end, down 13% year-over-year and down 12% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential declines were primarily driven by unfavorable markets and unfavorable currency translation. Investment Management fees and Asset Servicing of $148 million were up 47% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. The year-over-year performance was driven primarily by lower money market mutual fund fee waivers and the previously mentioned accounting reclassification, partially offset by client outflows. Sequentially, the increase was primarily due to lower fee waivers, partially offset by client outflows and unfavorable markets. There were no fee waivers relating to low interest rates in the second quarter results compared to $28 million in the prior quarter and $50 million in the prior year quarter. Assets Under Management for Asset Servicing clients were $950 billion, down 19% year-over-year and down 13% sequentially. Both declines were driven by unfavorable markets, client outflows and unfavorable currency translation. Securities Lending fees were $22 million, up 11% year-over-year and up 14% sequentially as wider spreads offset the impact of lower volumes. Average Securities Lending Collateral levels were down 7% year-over-year and down 5% sequentially. Other trust fees, fees were $39 million, up 7% compared to the prior year and down 11% sequentially. The sequential decline was primarily driven by higher seasonal benefit payment services fees in the prior quarter. Moving to our Wealth Management business. Trust, Investment and Other Servicing fees were $501 million and were up 8% compared to the prior year and down 1% from the prior quarter. There were no fee waivers in relation to low interest rates in the current quarter compared to $23 million in the prior quarter and $29 million in the prior year quarter. Within the regions, the year-over-year growth was driven by lower money market mutual fund fee waivers and new business. For the sequential performance, the decline within the regions was primarily driven by unfavorable markets, partially offset by lower fee waivers. Within Global Family Office, the year-over-year growth was driven by lower fee waivers, new business and favorable markets. The sequential increase was mainly related to lower fee waivers, partially offset by unfavorable markets. Assets Under Management for our Wealth Management clients were $353 billion at quarter end, down 5% year-over-year and down 11% on a sequential basis. The year-over-year decline was driven by unfavorable markets, partially offset by client flows. The sequential decline was driven by unfavorable markets and client outflows. Moving to Page 6, net interest income was $470 million in the quarter and was up 37% from the prior year. Earning assets averaged $140 billion in the quarter, down 1% versus the prior year. Average deposits were $129 billion and were up 1% versus the prior year, while loan balances averaged $41 billion and were up 12% compared to the prior year. On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income grew 21%. Average earning assets and average deposits both declined 7%, while average loan balances were up 3%. The net interest margin was 1.35% in the quarter, up 38 basis points from a year ago and up 30 basis points from the prior quarter. The increases from the prior year and prior quarter were both driven primarily by higher average interest rates, a favorable balance sheet mix and $7 million in non-recurring interest received from certain non-accrual loans. Turning to Page 7. Expenses were $1.2 billion in the second quarter and were 9% higher than the prior year and 1% higher than the prior quarter. The current quarter's expenses included a $20.3 million pension settlement charge within the employee benefits category, while the prior year quarter included a pension settlement charge of $17.6 million. Also included in the quarter is the impact of the previously mentioned accounting reclassification, which increased other operating expense by $10.4 million compared to the prior year. Excluding these impacts, expenses were up 8% versus the prior year and flat sequentially. Compensation expense was up 12% compared to the prior year and was down 3% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by higher salaries, as well as higher cash-based incentives. The sequential decrease was primarily due to the quarters -- to the prior quarter's equity incentives, including $49 million in expense associated with retirement eligible staff, partially offset by higher salaries. Both the year-over-year and sequential comparisons benefited by favorable currency translation. Excluding the previously mentioned settlement charges, employee benefits expense was down 1% compared to the prior year and down 5% from the prior quarter. Outside Services expense was $213 million and was down 2% from a year ago and flat sequentially. The year-over-year decline was primarily driven by lower third-party advisor and technical services costs, partially offset by higher consulting expenses. Equipment and Software expense of $204 million was up 14% from one year ago and 5% sequentially. The year-over-year and sequential growth were both primarily driven by higher software costs due to continued investments in technology, as well as higher amortization Occupancy expense of $51 million was down 2% from a year ago and flat sequentially. Other operating expense of $90 million was up 33% from a year ago and up 13% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was driven by the previously mentioned accounting reclassification and higher business promotion and other miscellaneous expense, partially offset by lower supplemental compensation plan expense. The sequential performance was primarily due to higher business promotion and staff-related expense. Turning to Page 8. Our capital ratios remain strong, with our common equity Tier 1 ratio of 10.5% under the standardized approach, down from the prior quarter's 11.4%, our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 6.7%, up from 6.5% in the prior quarter. An increase in net unrealized losses on the available for sale securities portfolio was a primary factor in this quarter's decline in capital ratios. Accumulated other comprehensive income at the end of the current quarter was a loss of $1.5 billion with the loss in the second quarter totaling approximately $600 million. During the quarter, we declared cash dividends of $0.70 per share, totaling $148 million to common stockholders. As announced yesterday, our Board of Directors approved an increase in our third quarter dividend to $0.75 per share. The current environment continues to demonstrate the importance of a strong capital base and liquid balance sheet to both weather the uncertain economic conditions and to support our clients' needs. We remain laser-focused on providing exceptional client service, while executing on our strategic priorities to grow the franchise and create long-term value to our shareholders. Before we open it up to questions, I'd like to take a moment to thank Mark Beatty, who is transitioning from heading Investor Relations to his new role as CFO for our Shared Services Group. Mark, thank you for your leadership, your partnership and your unwavering commitment to serving our analyst and investor community over the past six years. I know I speak for all of us when I say we've learned so much from your insights and perspective. So thank you. And with that, please open the line for questions. Operator :  And the first question today comes from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Jason Tyler : Good morning, Alex. Alex Blostein : Hey Jason. Good morning, everybody. I'd like to echo your prior comments from Mark as well. I was as great working with you, and good luck in your next role. So it's maybe to start with the NII related questions and I'm sure you guys would expect that given the theme of the quarter. You've spoken in the past about deposit outflows about a month ago. They seems like they have continued a little bit in June. So maybe help us unpack sort of the sources of where you guys seeing some of deposit outflows, the mix between interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing, any comments on kind of how the things are standing so far in the third quarter? And any sort of broader commentary you might have around where deposit levels could ultimately trough? Jason Tyler : Sure. So I'll give you some thoughts. So don't hesitate if you want us to touch on a different component of it. First of all, just taking a longer-term perspective, deposits have been strong since the beginning of the pandemic, including relative to peers in the industry. So the institutional channel has declined in the last few months, but it appears that we just -- we may have peaked later. And since -- if you go back to the beginning of the pandemic, our deposits are still up meaningfully. We started the pandemic at about $90 billion, and you see now, we're around $130 billion. So going forward, the strategy is very consistent, remain focused on retail and operational institutional deposits. The retail deposits are effectively all operational. So our second quarter deposit volumes were down 6.5%. But let's -- I want to unpack where those sub-channels came from. So, first of all, more than half of that decline was in non-operational financial deposits. And generally, that is the most rate sensitive channel by far. It's also the fastest declining category for us, it was down over 11%. The second fastest category of decline was actually other non-operational deposits, which also -- which declined about 5%. And so if you focus on the wealth channel and the institutional deposits that are operational, the decline was just 3%. And another dynamic to think about is that within that period, we had tax payments, and so you'd expect some decline alone just coming from that. So I think that just highlights the focus on the fact that the vast majority of the decline has come in non-operational. And then I think you wanted to get a sense of where we are in the quarter even at this point, deposits have been down from the average of second quarter, but they seem to be leveling off. The decline that we saw in the second quarter was actually largely just in the month of May. And since then, deposits have stabilized at about $120 billion. So that's a lot, but I'll stop there, but that should hopefully give you a good sense of how deposits have been trending. Alex Blostein : Great. And is this fair to assume that the outflows that you guys have seen, albeit smaller outflows so far in the third quarter are also non-operational? And is there a way to frame what you guys think the total size of non-operational deposits kind of bucket is and how much of that could ultimately still leave? Jason Tyler : So I'll answer the first, which is just what we've seen so far this quarter, 85% of that has been non-operational. So strong continuing of that theme that those deposits are non-operational. We haven't talked externally about the mix of operational and non-operational deposits. And so we can think about that and whether in future quarters we want to do it, unless -- but I think that's a lot for you guys to be able to work from at this point. Mark Bette : And this is Mark. And as a reminder, the non-operational deposits wouldn't all be at risk. I mean we had plenty of them before the pandemic. And so -- but that is where we've seen the flows, the movement so far. Alex Blostein : Got it. All right, thanks. I'll hop back in the queue. Jason Tyler : Thanks, Alex. Operator : We can go to Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Jason Tyler : Steve? Steven Chubak : Hi, good morning. So wanted to start off with a question on the NIM outlook, just looking at last rate cycle your NIM peaked somewhere in the low  (ph). I saw a nice uplift this quarter. And with loans composing a similar percentage of the balance sheet today versus last cycle, you have the benefit of higher terminal Fed funds, higher non-U.S. rates contributing as well. Is it reasonable to expect higher NIMs this cycle, any way you could help us frame how you think about peak NIM potential given some of those tailwinds? Jason Tyler : Sure. So one, you're absolutely right, if you go back to mid-2019, even if you look inside 2019, we were over 160 in the middle of that year. And you're highlighting the right things to look on mix, there is no reason we shouldn't achieve or frankly surpass that level. The only caveat would be if you saw a very significant change in the yield curve, but we're not anticipating that. So no reason why we couldn't achieve or surpass that 160-ish. And then just as you're thinking about the starting point though, we gave you that number is about, it was $6 million or $7 million in interest income that came from recovery of those non-accrual loans. And so the starting point should be not 1 -- it's a little net, but it shouldn't be  (ph), think about it more at  (ph). And then betas is another thing that'd be helpful maybe to give you just so you can work the models better. For second quarter, betas are right at 25%. And as we're looking into third quarter, the betas could be twice that, but not 100%. And so we're still seeing attractive increase. And so I'm glad you asked about that because we hit on deposit levels and then NIM. And so we're trying to give you both volumes and betas, so that at least gives you the building blocks to work from as you're thinking about modeling NII going forward. Steven Chubak : Thanks for that color, Jason. And just for my follow-up on capital, you've noted in the past that you want to run with capital levels that are consistent with your G-SIB peers despite the lower reg requirements. And given some of the AOCI volatility that we've seen, as well as the strong loan growth, which has certainly consumed some capital of late. I was hoping you could provide some updated thoughts on how you're thinking about target CET1, whether that 10% to 11% range or something you're comfortable running at? And just how it informs your appetite to potentially accelerate buybacks, especially if other categories like lending potentially begin to slow in a rising rate backdrop? Jason Tyler : You're right in that. We -- just competitively, we like to have a strong position relative to the G-SIB peers. And it's -- when we're -- I always say when clients are depositing $100,000, they -- those deposits are insured usually by the FDIC. When they're depositing $100 million or $1 billion, they're effectively lending money to us, and we want to reflect that our balance sheet is strong, and so we look at that closely. We look at the CET1 is important which you highlighted, but also the leverage ratio. And so looking at those in conjunction, we look good on a relative basis and obviously plenty of room relative to any regulatory limits. But we'll continue to look at where things are competitively. And we'll also continue to look at what opportunities we have in the returns on buyback versus what opportunities we're seeing, the loan growth we had, we were very deliberate in looking at what the returns on that growth are. And we also talked about the spikiness of loan volume and other activity that even right now, currency markets moving aggressively has an impact on FX positions, which has an impact on what our RWA looks like. So all these things come into play. But in general, we feel good about the capital levels, but you've got to also note, we have historically been in a higher range. Steven Chubak : That's great. Best of luck, Mark, in the new role, and thanks so much for taking my questions. Mark Bette : Thanks, Steve. Operator : The next question comes from Glenn Schorr of Evercore. Jason Tyler : Hi Glenn. Glenn Schorr : Hi, hello there. So in the quarter, obviously, the operating leverage is welcome, but we know what's coming with the lag deposit pricing and lower fees. So I wonder if you could give us any thoughts on expenses on a go-forward basis? I know on any given quarter, you will have ups and downs, but just your thoughts on the jumping-off point for expenses and then the possibility of operating leverage on the full-year? I know it's moving part -- moving boat right now. Thanks. Jason Tyler : Sure. Well, you're right that it's hard to look in a quarter. And it's -- in this year, it's even hard to think too aggressively about operating leverage for the full-year. If you think about what's happening in the influence of rates, the -- it's -- it has a big impact on net interest income, that's coming over time, it comes over quarters, the impact on expenses is happening more quickly. And so we can't get too excited about the net interest income coming and -- but we've got to stay focused on expenses. But let me walk through a little bit on the expense side and just give you a couple of highlights, and if you want us to drill in farther, we can. So first, and it relates to inflation, let's talk about compensation. And so for the quarter, just a couple of comments, and I'll give you a bullet point or two on third quarter. The base pay adjustment came into play in third quarter and fall, and that's in and of itself, $20 million lift quarter-over-quarter, it's usually half that amount. And then headcount was higher, and we also had some off-cycle adjustments, which brought in another, call it, $10 million. Currency helped significantly, call it, $5 million to $10 million. And then -- but a big component is the cash -- is cash-based incentive accrual. And so I think sometimes people forget as we do better, even in a category like NII, we're going to have higher CBI accrual coming along with it. And so that's something that's really important to think about. The second category on expenses that I'll call out is Equipment and Software, because that was a big -- that was a $10 million lift just quarter-over-quarter. And we mentioned it in the last conference that we were going to have about a $5 million lift in amortization alone, that's coming through. We'll have another sequential lift going into third quarter. And then the other component that we experienced in second quarter in addition to the increase in amortization is just software rental and support costs are higher, and some of that is inflationary, some of it is just our consumption is higher, but we are at this point anticipating another similar rise. And so just looking into third quarter, you'd see a similar step-up potentially from second quarter to third quarter than what we experienced in first quarter to second quarter. So those are the two big categories within expenses that I'd call out at this point. Glenn Schorr : Okay. That is definitely helpful. I appreciate it. And maybe just a quick follow-up to the previous combo on deposits and NII. Just curious, it might be a timing thing. You made the point, obviously, that your investment portfolio turns over time, so you get the NIM benefit of higher rates over time. Can you grow NIM from here in the near-term if betas are doubling? Just curious how to think about that in the short-term? Jason Tyler : Yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely. And the power of rates going up on where we are, and if you look at just the way the balance sheet is naturally positioned, and loans are high -- probably 75%-ish floating, and then even a big chunk of the securities portfolio reprices within a year, and then, obviously, the cash position is short. And so the asset side is significantly floating. And so even if we give up just half the increase on the deposit side, then we still have plenty of room to grow NIM and NII significantly on -- in a rising rate environment even from here. Glenn Schorr : Awesome. Thank you for that. Appreciate it. Jason Tyler : Sure. Operator : The next question comes from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo Securities. Jason Tyler : Hi, Mike. Mike Mayo : Hi. A part of -- hey. A part of your NII guide, I guess higher, but you're -- I guess, you're not telling us how much higher, because you tell us your sensitivity to lower stock markets, the impact on fees, but you're not giving us the NII guide, but I guess you're giving us some building blocks. But one component is loan growth, and it's up 12% year-over-year. And one reason, some investors hold Northern stock is because it's perceived as a safe haven during a recession, your loan losses tend to be a fraction of the industry. So my question to you is, what are you seeing in the loan growth, especially among your retail customers? How much appetite do you have to expand that? Are you noticing some more competition because some of your peers are mentioning this more vocally about being a growth area? And does Northern experience recession, if we were to have one, because the clients are such high-end? Thanks. Jason Tyler : Sure. So a few things there on loan growth, the rate should definitely slow relative to what we experienced over the last two years. The last two years, that growth was highly initiative-driven. We were -- we had a plan to communicate more with our clients, tell them that we wanted to be there more in their journey of investing more in their businesses. And we wanted to be being a liquidity provider isn't just taking deposits, it's also loan, it's also creating loan opportunities for clients when they need it. The growth has been very largely in the -- in that type of channel, and the quality in our appetite has not changed at all. And we're extremely deliberate in saying our appetite from a credit quality perspective was not changing. And if you look at some of the -- even the numbers around credit quality at this point, nothing has changed. All of the increases we had this quarter were in the inherent reserves, not specific reserves. We actually have net recoveries again, a small amount. And so all early signs are very good and that gets into your last question was do we have a recession? And do we have loan issues in a recession? We don't want to proclaim victory before something like that happens. But at this point, all the indicators are -- what are look good, and we haven't changed our appetite and what we brought on. Mike Mayo : And I'm going to ask one more, really big picture question. Maybe this is for you, Mike. But one concern about going into a recession is the negative wealth effect. And since you deal with the highest end customers, especially the family offices and like, what's the behavior of your customers after such decline in their personal net worth? Thanks. Michael O'Grady: You're exactly right, Mike, that portion of our client base does have different dynamics to it. And so we're coming off of a time period, whereas we know not only did we see asset values increase significantly, but also as we've talked about in previous calls, the opportunity to monetize assets if you will meaning sell businesses or real estate or whatever it may be. Also was at a very high level. And so that dynamic clearly has changed as we've seen. So you see it in the sense of market activity as far as IPOs and things like that going down. And as much as there's still plenty of private equity capital that's out there, and looking to do transactions, valuations are lower and that changes their attitude about whether now is the right time to sell that business. That said, the position that a lot of these clients are in is that -- they've had a high level of liquidity and so when they see the markets go down, they are in a position to be very long-term investors. And so we see a lot of those clients actually deploying capital into the markets at this point so investing that liquidity that they've raised in the previous phase. Now as you move forward from that beyond having no idea where markets go et cetera, but just to your point on the wealth effect, there's no doubt that our business benefits when the overall wealth is increasing and accumulating their markets are robust. So that is a better environment for us. We think that it's more resistant on the downside of it as well. But all the same, it's at a lower level than when things are so good. So hopefully that addresses your macro question. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Michael O'Grady: Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Brown of KBW. Michael Brown : Hi, good morning. Jason Tyler : Mike, how are you? Hello? Michael Brown : Good. Thanks for taking my questions. So the AUC/A decline was a bit greater than we were expecting this quarter and above some of your peers on a sequential basis. Can you just expand on some of those key drivers? I mean, you called out that you had some wins into your quarter. But was there any material loss business? Or was it truly just FX and markets at the AUC/A levels this quarter? Jason Tyler : Mike, just to confirm, did you say AUC/A? Michael Brown : Correct, AUC/A. Jason Tyler : It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s under custody administration, okay, yes. And yes, I can take it and you add anything you'd like, Mark. But nothing significant from a flow perspective to call out, that -- so if I look at it mathematically FX was -- so currency translation was 2.5% hit and market levels another 8%. And so the vast majority of the movement you see was in those two factors. But the core business nothing to note from a flow perspective. Michael Brown : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you, Jason. And just as a follow-up, one of your peers talked about a plan to reprice certain aspects of their servicing business and they talked about areas that are experiencing greater wage pressure and capacity constraints. I was curious, is this a dynamic that you guys are seeing? And is there any opportunities to reprice your business higher as you think about in the coming quarters or a year with the inflationary pressures that you and the industry are experiencing? Michael O'Grady: Well, why don't I take that Michael? So I would say that we tend to approach the client relationships a little bit different I think than differently than some of our competitors. What I mean by that is on an ongoing basis, we look to make sure that we have a -- I'll call it balanced relationship or one that is generating value for both the client and ourselves. And there are a lot of dynamics to the relationships that we have with our clients, meaning that we're providing a lot of services that we're paid a fee for. There's a lot of other activity, whether it's balances or FX and things like that, that we're doing that the nature of the compensation, the revenues are different. And so it's always kind of shifting and sometimes it can go more or less to one side with particular clients and we like to be in dialogue with them. That doesn't always involve a change in the fee up or down, it can be a change in the level of activity that we're doing with them. That they do leave more balances with us or do other things. And so it's a different approach and I would say less programmatic about going out at a particular time and looking to necessarily increase fees. And as we know just over time because the asset levels have gone up, that's why there is a bit more pressure on the fee side of the equation to come down over time. When you have periods like this with inflation, I think you do see less of that activity, because all the players are in the same position. So a client or prospect going out to put their business out the bid so to speak is less likely to get aggressive bids by multiple parties in this type of environment than they would and others. So I would say there's no doubt that as you can see, we're feeling the impact of inflation on the expense side. We get a benefit in the sense of interest rates are higher. So that's a little bit of a hedge if you will that's built into our financials. And then just something that we look at over longer periods of time. Michael Brown : Yes. Thanks very interesting perspectives Mike. Appreciate it. Michael O'Grady: Sure. Operator : The next question is from Brennan Hawken of UBS. Michael O'Grady: Good morning, Brennan. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. And I'd also like to say, congrats to Mark, you know, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a real pleasure working together, always helpful to talk to you and wish you the best of luck. Mark Bette : Thanks, Brennan. Brennan Hawken : You got -- sure. So curious, you guys gave a lot of color on the non-operating deposits. And the runoff and kind of comparing that to how the operating deposits look. But I -- and it was clear that the deposits were under pressure, but the NIM was really good this quarter. So what I'm hoping to understand and maybe you could give us a bit of a comparison. Can you help us frame what the spreads look like for non-operating deposits versus operating deposits? I think that might help when we try and frame not just what mechanically the deposits might -- and the balances might look like. But really how that might actually triangulate NII? Jason Tyler : Yes, absolutely. So one, just a couple of things at a high level and then I'll dig in a little bit. So I mentioned, I think before probably 75% of the loans repriced, repriced within 90-days and even the securities portfolio about a third of those are floating. And then the cash portfolio obviously is very short, those are the three big categories. And it's interesting, because in non-operational deposits and that's why I specifically separated the financial versus the non-financial. The most extreme case of something where you have to stay liquid with the deposit is the non-operational financial services channel deposit. You really can't go -- you really can't invest that long. And so that just that stays effectively overnight. And it's largely, and there are exceptions, but largely. And that's part of the reason why if you see our -- the deposits come down, I talked about the fact that they were largely non-operational and that's why you saw the decline on the earning assets come largely from our cash position. And so you can see what the yields are in the cash positions. And if you think about the cost on the non-operational deposits, again, highly rate sensitive. And in many instances, those clients are saying it's Fed funds minus something. And so it's tight, those spreads are tight. And then if you work toward operational deposits those are ones that by nature, you're able to invest longer. And so those are -- there's a component of it that you have to keep liquid, you have to maintain liquidity for. But generally, that's what's going to be represented in the longer duration of the securities portfolio. And in today's environment where those are re-pricing and we're waiting anxiously for those to mature, but it just gives you a sense that those spreads are actually likely going to increase over time. So first of all, those clients tend to be those are transaction accounts. They tend to be less spread sensitive and we've got opportunity to invest them longer. And so that's why we keep emphasizing this distinction between the operational and non-operational or transactional or non- transactional, because the economics underneath them are very, very different. Brennan Hawken : Right, okay. That's a really important and thanks for laying that out, Jason. It sounds like there's a big difference in between the economics. I guess my follow-up would be on beta. So you talked about the beta increasing in the third quarter. Number one, that's a third quarter beta commentary to roughly 50% not a cumulative, right? So we would be not necessarily looking to get the whole cumulative up to 50%? And then does that increase in beta also contemplate the reduction in these far more rate sensitive non-operating deposits running off? And maybe how much are those non-operating more rate sensitive deposits pressing that beta higher? Are they the largest contributor and as they continue to run off will that help to contain continued increases in beta? Sorry, it's a multi-parter, but -- Jason Tyler : That is multi, multi part. But so let me give you a couple of thoughts, but don't hesitate if I -- we want to be helpful as you guys are thinking this through, so don't hesitate to clarify anything. So let me try to work backwards, I mean, I get all the way back to the beginning. Yes, to the extent that the non-operational deposits are the ones that continue to run off faster that insulates betas a little bit. And then secondly, as we provided some commentary on what betas look like in the third quarter. Yes, that is incremental within the quarter, but that's us leaning in, in the spirit of trying to be helpful to uncertainty, we just don't -- a lot of what we're doing is just trying to hold on to those deposits, those operational deposits, because we feel they're so volatile. And so we're not starting from we want our betas to be 50%, and we'll see what deposits hold in. It's -- we're talking with clients telling them we want to be the liquidity partner for them. And so we're going to -- in large ways, at this point in the cycle, we're going to follow what we see out there to make sure that for those valuable operational deposits, we maintain deposit levels. Brennan Hawken : Okay. And third quarter beta of 50%, that's just a third quarter, not a cumulative, right? Jason Tyler : Yes. Yes, but again a lot of uncertainty in what that's going to look like. That's less factual, it's less target and it's more just our forecasting of what we think is going to happen based on what we think is going to happen with the yield curve and what we think is going to happen in the market. Brennan Hawken : And it's -- so the last component of the -- I know and I apologize it was so many parts, but the last component is, does the 50% like -- is that based on the current mix of operational, non-operational, financial, non-financial? Is it based on the current mix? Or as that non-operating piece winds down, does that ease the upward pressure on the beta, what I mean, so could allow for some better paying outcomes that you're thinking? Jason Tyler : Yes. That 50% is overall based on what we currently see and project the mix to be, which reflect -- Brennan Hawken :  I appreciate the color. Jason Tyler : Yes. Sure. Operator : The next question is from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Jason Tyler : Good morning, Brian. Brian Bedell : Good morning. Good morning, thanks very much. And I also echo all my comments for Mark as well, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been great working with you through also best of luck. I think Brennan got my multiparts on the deposit betas as well. So I'll move over to expenses. And the only other two categories, again, Jason, thanks so much for the granular color there. The only other two categories, I just wanted to get a comment on was the typical seasonal lift that we see in outside services in the second half of the year, whether you think that's likely to repeat as it has in the past? And then on the other expense line, in lieu of having the Gulf Open, I know you wanted to reallocate those expenses to marketing initiatives? Is that also a second half event like Northern open was? Or have you done those over the course of the year? So we shouldn't see as much of a spike up? Jason Tyler : All right, so let me start on outside services. So yes, there tends to be a second half lift there. We don't expect it to be that dramatic at this point in this quarter, it was we actually remember a lot of the expenses there are actually volume related and so it's related to you guide market data and other transaction related services, there's other items that are very volume related and frankly some of it market level related. And so that's something to just keep in mind that can dominate the seasonality component of that line item. And so in the second quarter, volumes were down slightly and that was fully offset by little bit higher consumption level in consulting and legal. And so as we go into third quarter, we'd actually -- those two dynamics are probably still at play, and we'll see which ones as we get further into the quarter, which one wins out. And then on marketing related, Mike, you want to about that? Mark Bette : Sure. Just on the marketing, Brian, there. Yes, we're spending that, if you will, throughout the year, so there's no seasonality, major seasonality like you had with the Golf tournament. And as we've talked about before, it's less about one particular area and more just doing marketing within the three businesses. Brian Bedell : That's great color. Thanks and then maybe Mike, if I could just follow-up on alternatives. I think you mentioned that in your prepared remarks briefly. But If you could just characterize the -- what you're seeing from your wealth client base in terms of demand for illiquid products both private equity, private credit, impact funds? And to what extent you've added those products onto your platform? And clearly, it's a great way to retain clients given their interest in that. But maybe just also share if you think that can also have a revenue impact for Northern Trust even if you're not managing that, but rather having them on your shelf so to speak? Michael O'Grady: You described it well as far as our approach there, which is we want to be able to provide the full set of alternatives for our clients and yet provided the added value, if you will, of certain particular funds that we can offer for them and then funds that we manage on our own or through vehicles on our own. And so within wealth management, for the platform, you kind of hit on some of the areas that are of greatest interest right now like private credit. And so it's a much broader set than maybe it was years ago as to alternatives. When somebody says alternatives, used to minimize that hedge funds or PE, now it's a much broader set of the types of products that they would have there. And then also my comment around the growth was particularly related to 50 South Capital, which is within asset management where we offer funds of funds. And there again, we've seen strong interest on the part of our clients to have that type of more diversified exposure to alternatives. And you're right, it has the benefit certainly from a return perspective for our clients, but from our perspective it is something that has a more attractive financial profile for us and one that further cements the relationship that we have. So we expect although there's always ups and downs in volatility with the various categories, but longer-term still that alternatives will be an area of growth. Brian Bedell : Good. That's great color. Thank you. Michael O'Grady: Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Jason Tyler : Good morning, Ken. Ken Usdin : Hey, good morning guys. Thanks, just one more follow-up on the earning asset side. Just given rising rates and the OCI. Just can you talk us through about where your securities portfolio duration is? And what you're seeing on incremental pickups of new pickups relative to the roll off on the back end? And just how you're thinking about mixing the portfolio and protecting OCI from here? Thank you. Jason Tyler : Sure. So a couple of thoughts : one duration overall -- duration is down to about 2.6% from 2.7%. And then secondly, just as from a reinvestment perspective, we're -- just that fact alone indicates we've been going shorter. And as reinvesting maturities that are maturing, we're leaving that powder dry effectively for the time being given the couple of dynamics. One, just the significant volatility in the markets and then secondly anticipating higher rates and so it -- we've very much been not reinvesting longer on the curve at this point. Then what was the second part? Ken Usdin : The second part was then -- just related to capital on the earlier question. Just about OCI and have you been moving things from AFS to HTM? Are you rethinking at all how -- and to your prior point about changing duration, how do you protect incremental AFS from here? And I guess just how would you expect the existing OCI to kind of return back into capital over time, so just all things related to OCI management? Jason Tyler : Sure. Couple of thoughts there, one is we did move about $7 billion from AFS to HTM. And we did that post quarter close actually. And the future impact is that should be -- that should protect about half of the exposure we have had on from an OCI perspective. And then in terms of return, it should be about 3.5 years total for us to recoup maybe a little bit longer to recoup that, but it just gives you an overall general sense of what the trajectory looks like. Ken Usdin : Okay. Got it. Thanks a lot, Jason. Jason Tyler : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Michael O'Grady: Good morning. Betsy Graseck : Hi, okay. Just want to make sure you're hearing me. A couple of questions : one, a little new picky, but on the average balance sheet, so I think you show what the yields are obviously by asset class. And I'm just wondering repo yields went up, it looks like a repurchase agreement went up about 2 percentage points Q-on-Q, and I wanted to make sure I understood that? Mark Bette : Yes, Betsy. Part of that, this is Mark. Part of that was a -- there's a footnote I think on our reports that kind of talk about a netting change that we made. And those yields, I think it's both on the asset side and the liability side, and the yields would have been, for instance, on the asset side, trying to find that line, which is reported as  (ph) million. I think it would have been around $70 million, I believe. But there is -- so that -- so it was really driven by this kind of gross to net change both on the asset and liability side. Betsy Graseck : Okay. So any details there we can do offline? The second question is just as we look at the 10-Q analysis regarding rate sensitivity and impact of 100 bp parallel shift, versus what we got this quarter. Obviously, this quarter was a much bigger benefit than what the Q would suggest. And I just want to make sure I understand the differences of what the assumptions are in the Q that we see versus what happened in the real world? Michael O'Grady: Yes. I mean, I guess one thing I would say is that in the Q, it's a model process and it does look at the forward curve and it's really a shock movement away from the forward curve. So I know that I think from beginning of the quarter, the end of the quarter, there was a move from the forward curve, but probably not in the same magnitude of how it would have been modeled within the Q. So it's a directional guide, I mean, the base case is what is not there, which is what the forecast is with the forward curve. But -- so I don't know if that helps, Betsy. Jason Tyler : And timing matters a lot too. I mean, we came into the quarter with some lift from where rates were prior and then we also had mix was another benefit of probably 8 basis points alone just by higher mix in the balance sheet. And so there are other dynamics that came into play. And frankly, back to when you're doing those shock scenarios, you're making assumptions around beta, you're making assumptions on a bunch of different things, but it's not in reality, it just doesn't always play out that way. And the beta is at 25% for us were low. And we also had movements in other currencies and so a lot of things at play that led to the increase in NIM. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then just lastly, I know at the beginning of the call you mentioned that non-operational deposit outflows look like they've stabilized. And I guess my question is, how do you feel your non-operational deposit -- depositors are behaving? In other words, we're about to get another 75 bps next week. And do you feel that they are optimizing for their -- over this next six months already? Or do you feel like they optimize each time the Fed's moving? In other words, I'm wondering if we should be expecting another outflow as the Fed continues to jack up rates here? Jason Tyler : I think those -- I think that, that channel of depositors disproportionately relative to others have relationships at multiple institutions. And cash doesn't have a long-term commitment on it and they're able to seek yield when it's important to them. And I'm glad you asked the question, because I don't want the interpretation to be that we don't want non-operational deposits oftentimes those deposits are tied to broader relationships. Sometimes we do want those deposits for various reasons. The reason that we're highlighting the distinction is just the economics and the behavior of those deposits is very different. And as you think about where NII is going, it's important to understand and appreciate those differences. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thanks so much for the color. Jason Tyler : Sure. Operator : Our next question is from Vivek Juneja of JPMorgan. Vivek Juneja : Hi, thanks for taking my question. A couple of -- one is how much benefit did you have to expenses from FX translation, Jason? Mark Bette : So on a year-over-year -- this is Mark, on a year over year basis, it was about 2% and on a sequential basis, it was about 15 and that's for total expense. Vivek Juneja : Right, right. And most of that would show up in which lines? Mark Bette : Most in comp and benefits, it would be as I look at it, probably -- Jason Tyler : A little in equipment and software. Mark Bette : Yes, equipment and software and you're probably looking at just like our expense base, I guess, maybe two-thirds of that probably being within comp and benefits. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Completely different question, Wealth Management assets in the -- sorry, wrong one. Assets servicing, assets under management fell 19% linked quarter, much more than overall Wealth Management AUM down much less, 19% seems like a lot. Any color on that? Did it seems more than what markets dropped? Jason Tyler : Sure. Yes. That was -- we had outflows in the Money Market mutual fund business. And so that business has grown significantly since prepayment, but declined in the quarter from a flow perspective. Vivek Juneja : All right. Thank you. Jason Tyler : Sure. Operator : The next question is from Jeff Harte of Piper Sander. Michael O'Grady: Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Harte : Hey, good morning, guys. Excuse me, one question left for me. How do you expect funding cost non-U.S. interest bearing deposits to move with the ECB hiking? I'm just trying to think, could we see some near-term pressure on NIM or NII as ECB goes from negative through the -- to zero bound to something higher than 25 basis points? Jason Tyler : Yes. Higher beta and, you know, the client, it's -- and again, I'm glad you brought that up. And for clients where they have potentially been in negative rates that we're expecting betas to be higher. This is clients to say, we understand that we were negative, but when do we get out and that's the one channel where we expect that to be aggressive. Mark, what would you -- anything to add there? Mark Bette : The only thing I would -- I was just going to mention that the size of that, so the Euro deposits for us, it's about -- it's a little bit over 5%, 6% of our total deposits. So that's just something to keep in mind from a order of magnitude perspective. Jeff Harte : Okay. I mean, any guess to how much higher betas might be there? Like, it would be truly a guess, I suppose, but -- Michael O'Grady: Yes, it's just super hard to tell and sometimes rates are part of larger pricing and relationship considerations, but we would just expect at this point in the curve for those betas to be quite high. And again not -- it's 6% of the total, it's not tremendous an impact, but I don't think it's crazy to assume. And again, we're -- I'm just speculating say 75% to 100%. I don't think it changes the dynamics of the outcome significantly on NII, but it's -- when I -- when we say significantly higher, it's not 55% versus 50%, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more like 75% to 100% is a safer way to model it. Jeff Harte : Okay. Thank you. Jason Tyler : Sure. Operator : Next question is from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the folow-up. Hello, again. Thanks for taking a follow-up. I wanted just to get your perspective, maybe top of the house view on operating leverage. And over the years, we've kind of gotten accustomed to thinking about operating expenses as a percentage of fees and obviously quarter-to-quarter that will move around and you guys gave some explicit guidance I guess for a couple of line items. So really just kind of want to zoom out and think about in an environment we're in today where the markets are a little choppier, and I guess to say the least and inflation is rising. What is the new normal for that expense to fee ratio over the next say a year or two, right? So clearly, you guys are highlighting that some of the higher NII will show up in comp with respect to I guess incentive based compensation. So that will I guess also pressure that expense to fee ratio. So help me just kind of think through that is like if we lived in a 105, but we're now thinking like 110 plus. And are there any expense initiatives that you guys have started to contemplate beyond 2022, it feels like the budgeting for this year has sort of left the station, but any incremental thoughts there would be helpful? Michael O'Grady: Sure. Alex, it's Mike. So the way that we're thinking about it is that as you put in a number of factors on both the revenue side and on the expense side, that we want to be in the range for a pretax margin of kind of that mid -- low to mid-30%s, that's the type of range that gets us at the higher end of our ROE target as well. So that's what we're shooting for. And then you're exactly right, we're also looking at that expense to trust fee ratio, which has a different set of dynamics to it and has more pressure on it when you have markets going down and inflation. But that's not a reason to say that we're not focused on trying to keep that in the range that we've been in. So that is kind of whether it's one 105 plus or minus around that, that's where we're trying to keep it because our view is that over time that's a better more stable level or measure of our profitability for the business. So that's what we're looking to do. As far as looking at expenses again always trying to be focused on that and I would say even though you said the train has left the station for this year, we are very much focused on getting productivity in all the businesses, but particularly in the asset servicing business. And so those initiatives were very much in place at the beginning of the year and we're executing on those. And as we do next year, there'll be a new set of initiatives around how we get greater scale and efficiency in the company, but particularly in that business. Alex Blostein : Great. Very helpful. Thanks, Mike. Michael O'Grady: Sure. Operator : The next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Michael O'Grady: Hi, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Hi, Mike. Hi, Jason. You guys may have touched on this and I apologize if you did and I missed it on your call. But obviously, you're talking a lot about betas with deposits, with rates going higher. Have you guys been able to map out or build models to see what impact the full blown quantitative tightening will have on deposit flows at your organization? You figure they're going to reach what $95 billion a month coming up soon here. And we really haven't gone through this before, we're in uncharted territories. So how do you guys approach that? Jason Tyler : We have modeled it. We've looked back to see what correlation there is. And I have to say the takeaway is it's not our client base just doesn't -- it's not granular enough to say that there's strong correlation between what the modeling spits out. And you think about $130 billion deposit base, we have clients that have $10 million, $50 million, $100 million, $200 million, some super large institutional or even global family office clients to be over -- sometimes over $1 billion. And so it's just -- it's very spiky and it's hard to throw a correlation out publicly at what those models spit out. I think what's -- the one thing I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d think it's instructive to think through is that a lot of our clients think about cash as an asset allocation output, and so one of the things to think about is you're predicting where even core operational transactional deposits will look like is what are overall asset levels and what are market levels, because our clients consistently think about liquidity as an asset allocation tool. And probably less affected in a predictive way by what's happening at the macro level by the Fed. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Thank you. And then as a follow-up, granted the market conditions are very unsettling today and a lot of disruption going on out there. But there's also probably opportunities to pick up maybe some businesses at discounted prices relative to where it was maybe a year to two years ago. Northern over the years has done acquisitions. So Mike, can you give us kind of some color of allocating capital or should something come up for sale that really makes sense? Is that something you guys could consider in the next 12 to 18-months? Michael O'Grady: Gerard, you're right. Historically, the company has been opportunistic and having the ability to add core capabilities during times like this. So that attitude or approach hasn't changed. I wouldn't say that we're out looking to take advantage of the environment per se. I would say it's more a similar strategic focus, which is growing the business organically. And then over time, if there are opportunities to accelerate that through acquisitions that we consider it. Gerard Cassidy : Great. Thank you. And Mark, good luck in the next run. Good luck going on. Thank you. Mark Bette : Thanks, Gerard. Appreciate it. Operator : We can go back to Vivek Juneja of JPMorgan. Vivek Juneja : Hi, thanks for taking a follow-up question. Going back to capital, Jason, I hear your comment on your competitively, you want to be ahead of your peers. But is there a level below which you would not want to see your CET1 go, especially given there's still uncertainty in the markets and volatility? And what do you intend to do to not let it go below that? Jason Tyler : We've got a lot of different guardrails around how we think about what to do. We obviously -- we have not been share repurchase is the first thing to do conversely saw us increase our dividend at this point. And so I think that tells you that we're not desperately trying to increase levels from here. We feel fine and again, we've got plenty of room from a regulatory perspective and we feel good how we look on a competitive basis. And so -- and we've always said it's a combination of different factors. We have very good conversations with our Board about how we want position capital levels. But we feel good where we are and always want at the same time take advantage of any opportunities in the market to grow the business. And sometimes that means just what we did with loans a couple of years ago and we made a big investment there from a capital perspective in the form of higher RWA exposure. And so it's just a good example of how we're balancing different factors at any given point in an economic side. The absolute levels is an important, but it's just one of those factors. Vivek Juneja : Thank you. And Mark, I was remiss. Thank you for -- it was great working with you and good luck in your role. Mark Bette : Thanks, Vivek. Appreciate it. Operator : And to Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo Securities. Jason Tyler : Hi, Mike. Mike Mayo : Yes. As we tweak or update our earnings models, I'm just looking at Page 38 of your proxy and I'm looking at your peer group and you do have a lot of banks in this peer group, but the two most comparable banks seem to have tax rates that are 500 basis points below what you have. So I think you're in the range of 25% and those other two trust banks are closed through 20% or below, give or take? And so the question is, we always talk about pretax margins, what about after tax? What can you do, Jason, to better manage your taxes, which is one of the biggest expenses at the firm? And then you'll love this question, Mike. So would you -- under what circumstances would you consider a move away Chicago like Citadel, to the extent that, that could help your taxes? Thanks. Jason Tyler : Two very different questions, I'll hit the first one. And you're absolutely right tax rate matters. And so I'll give you a sense of -- first I'll give you a sense of how -- where we are relative to others. First, a high percentage of our income is from wealth management and that's predominantly a domestic business, which comes with a higher tax rate. Two, even within the domestic exposures, we're in Illinois, California, New York, we're in high tax states. Then a lot of our -- we've got less benefits from tax credit investments. And another dynamic is we've got less income from tax exempt income. And then more of a nuanced, but important factor is there are limitations on U.S. foreign tax credits and that's actually increasing in our difference relative to our peers. And so those are at least a half dozen things that are that get to vast majority of the reason why there is a difference. Going forward, there are things that we can look at and try and implement to try and get that tax rate down. And so we're not just resting on that as a pay to complete. We -- it's something that we want to work on over time. Michael O'Grady: And Mike, I would say we're a global company that is headquartered in Chicago. I'm proud to be headquartered in Chicago. And like other important decisions, we look at it from a stakeholder perspective. You highlight one, which is -- I'll say the tax rate, but more broadly, the financial implications of being headquartered anywhere. And that is absolutely a relevant consideration and one that we're looking at all the time. But then you have other stakeholders that are critical to that, certainly where our clients are and where we need to be to serve them. But then also equally important is all of our partners, meaning our employees. It needs to be a great place to live. And so we are very focused on not just monitoring that over time and determining if it's a great place to live, but I would say actively being a part of the community to address the challenges and make Chicago an even better city to live in and to have our headquarters. Mike Mayo : Thank you. Jason Tyler : Sure. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back to Mark Bette for any additional or closing remarks. Mark Bette : Okay. I think we're all good. So thanks everyone for joining us. Appreciate it and we'll talk to you next quarter. Jason Tyler : Congratulations, Mark on a great run. And congratulations, thanks everyone. Mark Bette : Thanks very much. Michael O'Grady: Thanks everybody. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time all participants are in a listen-only-mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jennifer Childe, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jennifer Childe : Thank you, Victor. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Northern Trust Corporation's third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Joining me on our call this morning are Mike O'Grady, our Chairman and CEO; Jason Tyler, our Chief Financial Officer; Lauren Allnutt, our Controller; and Mark Bette; and Briar Rose from our Investor Relations team. Our third quarter earnings press release and financial trends report are both available on our website at northerntrust.com. Also on our website, you will find our quarterly earnings review presentation, which we will use to guide today's conference call. This October 19th call is being webcast live on northerntrust.com. The only authorized rebroadcast of this call is the replay that will be made available on our website through November 18th. Northern Trust disclaims any continuing accuracy of the information provided in this call after today. Please refer to our safe harbor statement regarding forward-looking statements on Page 11 of the accompanying presentation, which will apply to our commentary on this call. During today's question-and-answer session, please limit your initial query to one question and one related follow-up. This will allow us to move through the queue and enable as many people as possible the opportunity to ask questions as time permits. Thank you again for joining us today. Let me turn the call over to Mike O'Grady. Michael O'Grady: Thank you, Jennifer. Let me join in welcoming everyone to our third quarter 2022 earnings call. In the third quarter, we continue to execute well through a challenging operating environment. Compared to the prior year, revenue grew 7% as the elimination of fee waivers and the favorable impact from higher interest rates more than offset the significant headwind from weaker equity and fixed income markets, asset outflows and unfavorable currency movements. Expense growth of 9% reflected inflationary impacts across our cost base, particularly within our compensation and equipment and software lines. EPS was flat, and we generated a return on average common equity of 14.9%. New business activity in Wealth Management was encouraging, and we continue to engage actively with new and existing clients. In Asset Management, weak markets and institutional cash outflows reduced assets under management, yet we saw a continued growth in our alternatives, tax-advantaged equity and ETF complex. And within Asset Servicing, we continue to win new mandates and our backlog of new clients that haven't yet been onboarded has expanded meaningfully and is expected to transition over the coming quarters. In closing, we remain well positioned to navigate the current macroeconomic and market uncertainty from a position of strength. Our new business pipeline remains robust, and our capital position continues to be strong. In a slowing growth environment, we've also begun prudently tightening our expense controls and focusing on realizing productivity benefits from the investments we've made over the past several years. I'll now turn the call over to Jason. Jason Tyler : Thank you, Mike, and let me join Jennifer and Mike in welcoming you to our third quarter 2022 earnings call. Let's dive into the financial results for the quarter, starting on Page 2. This morning, we reported third quarter net income of $394.8 million. Earnings per share were $1.80, and our return on average common equity was 14.9%. Results for the quarter included a $17 million pension settlement charge within the employee benefits expense category. Also recall that in the first quarter of this year, we implemented an accounting reclassification of certain fees, which will continue to impact the year-over-year comparisons as noted on this page. Let's move to Page 3 and review the financial highlights of the quarter. Year-over-year, revenue was up 7% and expenses increased 9%. Net income was flat. In the sequential comparison, revenue was down 1% and expenses were up 1%, while net income was also flat. Return on average common equity was 14.9% for the quarter, up from 13.7% a year ago, and down from 15.7% in the prior quarter. Looking at the results in greater detail, starting with revenue on Page 4. Year-over-year, unfavorable currency translation impacted revenue growth by approximately 200 basis points. Trust, investment and other servicing fees, representing the largest component of our revenue, totaled $1.1 billion were down 3% from last year and down 6% sequentially. All other remaining noninterest income declined 8% from the prior year and 2% from the prior quarter. Net interest income, which I'll discuss in more detail later, was $525 million and was up 47% from a year ago and 12% sequentially. Let's look at the components of our trust and investment fees on Page 5. For our Asset Servicing business, fees totaled $603 million, and were down 4% year-over-year and down 6% sequentially. Within Asset Servicing, custody and fund administration fees were $407 million, down 12% year-over-year and down 6% sequentially. Custody and fund administration fees decreased sequentially, primarily due to unfavorable markets, unfavorable currency translation and lower transaction volumes. Custody and fund administration fees decreased from the prior year quarter, primarily due to unfavorable currency translation and unfavorable markets, partially offset by new business. Assets under custody and administration for Asset Servicing clients were $12 trillion at quarter-end, down 19% year-over-year and down 7% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential declines were primarily driven by unfavorable markets and currency translation. Investment management fees within Asset Servicing were $136 million, up 20% year-over-year and down 8% sequentially. Investment management fees decreased sequentially, primarily due to unfavorable markets and asset outflows. Investment management fees increased from the prior year quarter primarily due to lower money market fund fee waivers and the accounting reclassification previously discussed, partially offset by asset outflows and unfavorable markets. Assets under management for Asset Servicing clients were $873.7 billion, down 25% year-over-year and down 8% sequentially. Both declines were driven by asset outflows, weaker equity and fixed income markets and unfavorable currency translation. Moving to our Wealth Management business. Trust, investment and other servicing fees were $475.5 million, down 1% compared to the prior year and down 5% from the prior quarter. Within the regions, the year-over-year declines were primarily driven by unfavorable market impacts, partially offset by the elimination of money market fund fee waivers. Sequentially, the decline within the regions was primarily driven by unfavorable markets. Within Global Family Office, the year-over-year growth was driven by lower fee waivers and new business, partially offset by unfavorable markets. Sequential decrease was mainly related to unfavorable markets. Assets under management for our wealth management clients were $336 billion at quarter-end, down 10% year-over-year and down 5% on a sequential basis. Both the year-over-year and sequential declines were driven primarily by unfavorable markets. Moving to Page 6. Net interest income was $525.3 million in the quarter and was up 47% from the prior year. Earning assets averaged $132 billion in the quarter, down 8% versus the prior year. Average deposits were $118 billion and were down 9% versus the prior year, while loan balances averaged $41 billion and were up 8% compared to the prior year. On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income grew 12%. Average earning assets declined 6%. Average deposits declined 8%, while average loan balances were up 2%. The net interest margin was 1.58% in the quarter, up 60 basis points from a year ago and up 23 basis points from the prior quarter. The prior year quarter increase was primarily due to higher average interest rates and favorable balance sheet mix shift. The sequential increase is primarily due to higher average interest rates. Turning to Page 7. Expenses were $1.2 billion in the quarter, 9% higher than the prior year and 1% higher than the prior quarter. On a year-over-year basis, expense growth benefited by approximately 300 basis points due to currency translation. The current quarter's expenses included a $17 million pension settlement charge within the employee benefits category. This compares to similar charges in the prior year quarter of $6.9 million and $20.3 million in the prior period quarter. Also included in the current quarter is the impact of the previously mentioned accounting reclassification, which increased other operating expense by $9.4 million compared to the prior year. Compensation expense was up 12% compared to the prior year and up 1% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by higher salary expense in part due to inflationary pressures, partially offset by favorable currency translation. The sequential increase is primarily due to higher salary expense, partially offset by lower incentives and favorable currency translation. Outside services expense was $221 million and was up 5% from a year ago and up 4% sequentially. The year-over-year increase is primarily driven by higher consulting and technical service costs, partially offset by lower third-party advisory fees. The sequential increase is primarily due to higher technical services and consulting costs. Equipment and software expense of $212 million was up 15% from 1 year ago and up 4% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by higher software costs due to continued investments in technology, as well as inflationary pressures and higher amortization. The sequential increase is primarily due to higher software amortization expense. Occupancy expense of $51 million was down 5% from a year ago and up 1% sequentially. The other operating expense of $82 million was up 1% from 1 year ago and down 9% sequentially. The sequential decline was primarily due to lower miscellaneous expenses in the current period. Turning to Page 8. Our capital ratios remained strong with our common equity Tier 1 ratio of 10.1% under the standardized approach, down from the prior quarter's 10.5%. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 7%, up from 6.7% in the prior quarter. An increase in net unrealized losses on the available-for-sale securities portfolio was a primary factor in this quarter's change in capital ratios. Accumulated other comprehensive income at the end of the current quarter was a loss of $1.8 billion with the loss in the third quarter totaling approximately $300 million. As previously announced, in the third quarter we increased the quarterly common stock dividend by 7% or $0.05 a share to $0.75 per share. During the quarter, we returned $159.5 million to common shareholders through cash dividends of $158.4 million and share repurchases of $1.1 million. The current environment continues to demonstrate the importance of a strong capital base and liquid balance sheet to both weather the uncertain economic conditions and to support our clients' needs. We approached the end of the year on solid footing and remain well positioned to serve our clients and communities while generating long-term value to our shareholders. And with that, Victor, please open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning... Michael O'Grady: Good morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Hi. How are you doing? Michael O'Grady: Really well. Betsy Graseck : I did want to just dig in a little bit on the expense side. And when I listen and look at the results, there's some areas where it feels like you know, maybe the inflation is impacting a little bit. I know you're being very disciplined in how you're investing. But I just wanted to make sure I understand how you're thinking about managing the expense base as we go through this inflationary environment? And is there an opportunity to pull back on some of the consulting side, professional services side? Or should we anticipate that the kind of rate of change we're seeing in this quarter should persist? Thanks. Michael O'Grady: Sure. Well, let me start with a direct answer to the question. And yes, there are things we can do, and we've been focused on to address expense growth. And so let me - predominantly, even within this period, in mid-September, we announced internally some additional expense controls. We always have those in place, but we meaningfully ramped up expense controls, particularly around hiring. That's obviously the largest component of where we see expense increases. That's our largest line. And so that will have - that will lead us to have just a higher bar on where we have increases in expenses and particularly from a hiring perspective. That's not to say that we are going to stop investing in the - that we're not going to continue investing in the things around technology and other areas where we know we've had important investments to take place. But at the same time, we do see an opportunity for us to raise that bar to try and tamp down the growth that we've seen in expenses. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then just separately, as I'm thinking through the growth profile here, you've got some nice exposure to international, at the same time, we've got you know, the strong dollar weighing on the results to a certain extent. Maybe you could help us think through the impact of the dollar and if we excluded that, how results would have looked this quarter? Thanks. Michael O'Grady: Sure. Well, at a super high level, the company has a very natural hedge in the \u2013 in from a currency perspective. And so this quarter, it was very roughly, call it, 200, 300 basis points and impact on both the revenue side and the expense side. And so the dollar does play in, but it plays on both the revenue and the expense side. The other impact that's not as symmetrical is how the dollar plays, is how currency plays in more from an asset level perspective. That played into asset level movements over the - in both assets under custody, as well as assets under management and something people won't typically think about it, even played in on the deposit decline. And you think about the movement we've had, and we can talk about that in more detail, but even the deposits had a downward move in value of about $1.5 billion in aggregate across all currencies. Betsy Graseck : Okay. I got it. Thanks. Michael O'Grady: Sure. Operator : Thank you. And one moment for our next question. Our next question will come from the line of Alexander Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Michael O'Grady: Good morning, Alex. Alexander Blostein : Hey, guys. Good morning. Sorry, didn't catch my name there. So a couple of questions. I guess, one, obviously, deposit outflows sounds like picked up in September relative to sort of the last update that we heard from you guys at the Barclays conference, I think you said around 120, came in a little bit lower. But the mix, in particular, I think, was a little bit more pronounced too with noninterest-bearing declining substantially. So maybe just an update on sort of how the quarter has progressed, but also more importantly, where the deposits stand today and the mix, noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing, as well as any of your sort of updated thoughts on where the deposit levels could ultimately trough out? It looks like the noninterest-bearing piece is getting pretty close to the kind of pre-COVID levels, but curious to get your thoughts there? Michael O'Grady: Sure. So first of all, on the deposit levels and where they were relative to our expectation, they actually came in really close particularly given what I - what we mentioned earlier and that the currency effect of the non-USD and so where they landed at the quarter - where they averaged actually was pretty close. And I mentioned that because as we get to the next quarter, I think we - it's very difficult to predict in general. And so - but let me hit mix first. So you're right, noninterest-bearing dropped significantly during the quarter. And that's something we expect to happen. A lot of our financial services clients that use our balance sheet are often in noninterest-bearing accounts, but the rate - as rates rise off of zero, they have the opportunity to move into interest-bearing accounts, and they did that. A lot of the - a very high percentage of the accounts that are eligible to do that, have done so at this point, which gets exactly to your point, Alex, that we're kind of it in some ways at those pre-COVID levels. That's not to say we won't see additional movement there. But we think, certainly, a lot of it has already taken place. And then the third part of your question is where do we see things today? Just looking at the first two weeks of the quarter, deposits behaved about what we would anticipate. They tend to come down a little bit at this point in the quarter. And so we're in that kind of 110 to 115. What we expect to happen between now and the end of the quarter is an interesting dynamic. There's two forces working against each other. One is with quantitative tightening and the yield curve being higher and clients across the board continuing to look at how they can allocate non-operational, but more investment cash that continues to put a downward pressure. But in the short run, there's an offset to that. There's an upward pressure in the seasonality that we've seen in fourth quarter, which tends to have more of an upward pressure. And so it's difficult to see which one of those is going to have stronger influences. But best guess is you might call it flat from here. And so that 110, 115 level, but appreciating that there's big forces moving against each other. Alexander Blostein : Got it. Thanks for that. I appreciate the color. And I guess speaking of institutions looking to earn a little bit extra yield on their cash. When I look at Northern securities portfolio, you guys are yielding, I think, about 1.8% and the market rates they're probably closer to 4, maybe a little higher. Now geographically, could be different with the mix. But obviously, an attractive opportunity to reprice there. I guess with AOCI losses already running through your capital, any appetite to sell down, I guess, some of the lower-yielding securities without necessarily changing the profile of fixed versus floating and kind of keeping the overall duration of the portfolio in a similar place. But I guess, crystallizing some of the losses, but picking up incremental NIR in the current environment? Michael O'Grady: Yeah. So we talk about it a lot. And I think an important dynamic for everyone to know, and I know you appreciate this 100% is that the economics of taking the loss, reinvesting that lower amount at the higher yield, the efficiency of markets are just telling you that over time, the impact of that should be relatively equal. Now their - the second component, though, is that there may be other reasons to do that. You might be looking to - you might have a view that the yield curve is going to change significantly. You might want to handle other ratios by doing that. And so it's not to say that we wouldn't do it, but it's just to say that the quick trade of take the - realize the loss, invest at a higher rate. it's not as easy and it's not as beneficial. We care about just the long-term value of what the securities portfolio is yielding, not just the NII or NIM in the short run. Alexander Blostein : Right, fair enough. Thanks, guys. Michael O'Grady: You bet. Thanks, Alex. Operator : Thank you one moment for our next question. Our next question comes from line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Michael O'Grady: Good morning, Mike. Mike Mayo : I had two [Technical Difficulty] Michael O'Grady: Yeah. Let me answer - I'm getting a lot of static in the background, and I want to make sure that \u2013 I want to make sure we answer your question, right. You want to - any way you can try and clarify your line... Mike Mayo : Is that any better? Jason Tyler : Dramatically. Michael O'Grady: Good. Go forward it, Mike. Mike Mayo : So much for my iPod. So look, are the tailwinds done? And Jason, you correctly predicted the NIM going back toward levels 2019, you know, elimination of fee waivers, those are good. On the other hand, I guess, you still have some tailwinds from the uninstalled business, which really isn't clear why that's so much higher or the delays, are you just winning business. On the other hand, you have the headwinds from the lower stock markets. Is that going to continue? Or is that mostly in the numbers now. So if you can help me with the tailwinds and the headwinds question. And the reason I ask that is because you got those tailwinds and you still had negative operating leverage. So it's - are you just a hostess your business model? Or can you have revenues grow faster than expenses? Jason Tyler : Yeah. So a couple of things in there. Let me try and hit them, but certainly ask me to clarify then I don't get all of them. One, on rates, is it done? The answer is no. we still have upward movement. And in fact, we look just within the quarter at the month and September was at just a tiny bit above 160. And so we got into that level. And - so - and even at this point, betas will be much higher, but won't be 100%. And so we'll get an incremental lift. And then the third dynamic of that is that as the securities portfolio is repricing, just Alex's question earlier, it takes time, but we have opportunity to reinvest at these higher rates. So not done yet. Second, on the pipeline of business that has taken longer to come that - some of the opportunities we have in Asset Servicing in particular, in the one not onboarded category are very big and they're chunky. And those just take longer. And the volatility in the markets, we think is just made clients just want to make sure that everything is lined up properly. And so that one not onboarded category is significantly higher than it is on average, but it's - we're confident about it coming through. And then the stock market dynamic, you're right, this - usually, we talk about operating leverage, and it's - the numbers are just much smaller. It's - can we get the expense growth plus a little bit of market lift to match and - but in this environment, the macro environment is just dominating what's happening to both expense growth and revenue growth. And so I've been saying all year, we cannot - they are false positives in the operating leverage. There are false negatives in the fee operating leverage. And this is a year where we have to just understand that those numbers are dominated by the macro factor, it's not typical. It doesn't change our long-term financial model. Mike Mayo : And on the one not onboarded category, can you size that to some degree and give us some sense of timing? Jason Tyler : Yeah, I can give a sense of timing, which is it's actually - it's more back half of '23 that we're scheduling some of this stuff coming in play. And that seems a long way away, but it's just - that's us making sure and working very closely with clients to make sure everything is lined up properly. And from a sizing perspective, we don't tend to give a number on that, but what I can tell you is that it's meaningfully higher than - that aggregate is meaningfully higher than what it has been historically. And pipeline- and then the outside of the one not funded, the asset servicing business will tell you that the pipeline activity is also very high. Mike Mayo : Okay. Thank you. Jason Tyler : You bet. Thank you, Mike. Operator : Thank you. One moment for next question. Our next question will come from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Your line is open. Jason Tyler : Good morning, Ken. Ken Usdin : Hey, morning, Jason. Follow up on that organic growth side. Can you just talk about the Wealth business? And if you could also try to separate the markets from just where organic growth is there? And any updates in terms of - is there a same type of holdback at all in terms of customers moving, coming over, bringing assets over given the environment? Jason Tyler : Yeah. Actually, I'm really glad you asked that because the Wealth business is - the journey is very different. The Wealth business, the organic - the growth there was higher first half of the year. And they - the business is still doing well, but they don't feel - but the one not funded is not as strong relative to history as the asset servicing business. Now both of those client channels will tell you, importantly, their win rates in the market are very attractive, and they are very consistent with what they have been historically. And so it's just about for Wealth, their view is equity markets are lower, less capital markets activity, and it's put just less money in motion. And so year-to-date, organic growth in wealth has been in line with historical levels. First half strong, frankly, higher than normal. Second half looks lighter, but money in motion is down, fewer IPOs, fewer liquidity events, but importantly, their sense is their win rate in the market is consistent with what it has been historically. Ken Usdin : Okay. And then if I could just ask one follow-up to Alex's question. So if there's more room to go on the NIM, the challenge is overcoming the magnitude of that size decline in the balance sheet. So how far out is your line of sight? I know you're not going to give specific guidance, but in terms of NII growth being able to continue post the third quarter result? Jason Tyler : No, I mean, the way you're framing the algorithm is right. It's just we - rates are - it's going to start to flatten out. And our betas this coming quarter, we're anticipating that they're - we're anticipating betas of 80% in this coming quarter. And so the benefits are just flattening out, but as rates go higher, we're still getting a benefit and the repricing of the securities portfolio is a positive lag effect to that effectively. Now all that said, the volume levels matter a lot as well. And just as rates were increasing, we talked about the importance of loans. That's where the real yield is, but we can't ignore the fact that when volumes are coming down, it puts pressure on the securities portfolio and on money market assets, which has an impact less on NIM, but more on NII. Ken Usdin : Right. I got it. Okay. Thank you. Jason Tyler : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment for next question. Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken from UBS. Your line is open. Jason Tyler : Morning, Brennan. Brennan Hawken : Hey, Jason, I'm glad you said good morning, because my line cut out when you said my name. Okay. I'd love to ask a question about what you're seeing here so far. Number one, just to clarify, the 110 to 115, that's kind of like the range you've been seeing in deposits quarter-to-date, right? And assuming that's the case and as you said, hard to predict. But if we do end up that seeing some continued pressure on the deposit side, is - should we expect that wholesale funding line to plug the gap to the extent that AFS securities cannot come down quick enough. Should we think that, that line is going to continue to grow if the deposits remain under pressure? Jason Tyler : Yeah, you're right in that that's what we think - that's the last fulfilment mechanism on the balance sheet, and we don't use that - there's no strategic initiative there to use it, but it does in the short run act as the fulfilment mechanism, depending on what's happening. And the good news is there's a positive carry - there's a positive carry on that, and rates are decent. So it helps NII, but we don't use it as a way to push and lever the balance sheet more than we need to. We use it as effectively just a fulfilment mechanism. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Right. So that's sort of the output to the extent that you don't have a - you need to plug. That makes sense. And then when we think about nonoperating deposits, where do we stand in total for nonoperating versus where we were at the peak of the last rate hiking cycle. Have we retraced that decline? And you spoke to the shifting of nonoperating from noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing. I'm guessing that's what's driving up the betas. What kind of magnitude impact does that - because I'm guessing the non-op is a more demanding customer base on the beta side? Is that fair? Jason Tyler : Yeah, it is. It is, for sure. And there's actually another layer within there, which we've talked about a little bit. So it's good for us to find continue asking more detail on it. But even within the nonoperational, there's financial and nonfinancial. And not the financial nonoperational or the areas where there's the highest rate sensitivity and frankly, it's also the area we have to have the highest amount of runoff anticipation. And therefore, it's the area where we do the shortest and least yielding investing on the other side of it. And so that - and you're right, that component is - it continues to be the higher runoff in terms of volume level so far. So if I look at the numbers, it is across all the categories we look at. It's the single - it's the single highest decline on a percentage basis even this quarter. And that said, there's declines in other areas as well. And so even within the operational base was down, I'll call it, 5% to 10%. And - but that's more that client base looking at different investment options and saying, I might have - with the yield curve at and flat at zero might not have been looking to ladder in treasury securities or look at an active fixed income portfolio, but now they're very much looking to do that as they talk to their advisers. And so very different dynamics at play. Brennan Hawken : Okay. All right. Thanks for the color. Jason Tyler : You bet. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment for next question. And our next question will come from the line of Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Jason Tyler : Good morning, Brian. Brian Bedell : Good morning. Great. Just first, one clarification on the deposit beta of 80% that you just mentioned, Jason. That's an incremental beta as opposed to, say, an absolute level that you'd be at in the fourth quarter. Is that correct? Jason Tyler : I want to make sure I understand. So yes, that's the - as we think about incremental rate changes that's the beta that we're experiencing on those incremental changes. Brian Bedell : On the incremental, yeah. Yeah, that's what I wanted to clarify, yeah. And then maybe just on expenses. I guess one question just around the seasonality expectations because you have some of the cost controls in place that you mentioned that you initiated in September. So how should we think about the typical seasonal lift in outside services and equipment software, for example, that we usually see. And then also short term, just the pension charges, is that - should we think of that as more recurring or really sort of you're kind of done with that? Jason Tyler : Sure. I'll hit the first one just on expenses. And then Lauren is here and can also talk on the pension settlement accounting issues. So on expenses, we've mentioned that in - the depreciation is higher. And so in equipment and software, in particular, we're anticipating another lift in fourth quarter similar to what we had in the third quarter. And despite the expense actions we're taking to - part of that is just baked into our base right now, particularly from a depreciation and amortization perspective. That said, we'll be looking hard at expenses even within that line item. But we've also talked about the importance of us investing in technology, but we'll see that similar lift going into fourth quarter. And then from - and then consulting is without a doubt, one of the key areas where we're looking very hard to make sure that anything that comes on at this point is critical and that we're handling that with a very high bar of what we're doing, but it's very correlated M&A instances as well to what we're doing from an equipment and software perspective. With that, Lauren, do you want to talk on pension for a second... Lauren Allnutt : Sure. So as we think about pension, we definitely would expect to see that recur in the fourth quarter. The fact that we have triggered this accounting mechanism of the settlement accounting does mean that our run rate of pension expense in the current year is lower, but we will expect to see that in the fourth quarter. It is difficult to predict whether that's something that we would expect to see going forward into 2023. Brian Bedell : Okay. Okay. Great. And if I could just squeeze one more in there on expenses. In terms of the onboarding of the clients, you also expect - typically, we see expenses in advance of that, particularly if they're more larger complex assignments and asset servicing. Is that similar dynamic that we may see either now or in the first half of next year in advance of the onboarding of this client? Michael O'Grady: This is Mike. I would say we've already experienced some of that. So it's Jason has mentioned, some of these transitions just are taking longer for a number of reasons. I think part of it, too, is that if you look at the pipeline right now on the asset servicing side, it's a high proportion of asset managers and those mandates just tend to take longer to transition in than for asset owners. And so we've been - already have been at work in doing that and incurring some of the expenses that go with it. And then as you point out, as those start to transition in, it kind of normalizes into the rate. Brian Bedell : Yeah, perfect. Thanks so much for the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question come from line or from Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Michael O'Grady: Good morning, Glenn. Glenn Schorr : Hello there. So I guess in some way, you're a bit of a microcosm of the inflation issue we have in the market. So my question on the expense side is, is head count up 11 comp up like 12 and that's half the expense dollars. So is it fair for me to assume that we could be more careful going forward, but this higher level of dollars on employee comp and benefits is probably going to be with us for a while, just like the market fears overall? In other words, you can't take comp away that you just gave? Michael O'Grady: Yes, Glenn, I think that's true in general. Just to expand on that, I would say that for us at least, we've gone through a time period here with inflation but also tremendous competition for the best talent. And as you know, that's where we look or one of the ways we look to differentiate ourselves. So it's very important to us to make sure that we were retaining the best talent and also attracting new talent as well. And so yes, we've had that increase in comp that is then a part of the run rate going forward. The question is what happens to the rate of growth going forward. We're looking at that very carefully, I would say, but we need to be competitive on that front. And then the other part, as Jason mentioned, we've added a number of additional partners, employees for us. And that's something which was very appropriate as we invest in taking care of our clients, invest in technology, invest in resiliency. So it all makes sense, we just going forward have to be really, really focused on making sure that we're only adding for very critical roles so that, that growth rate of head count is appropriate. Glenn Schorr : I hear you're not alone there. One question on - when markets are going off a lot like they used to, you would have plenty of clients that would have either fee ceilings or fee caps such that your fees just don't scale up as markets go up. My question is, does it work that way in reverse and markets fallen like 22% this year. Do we have any protection on the way down, whereas maybe fees might not drop as much as the markets would imply going forward? Michael O'Grady: So a couple of thoughts there. One, even within the contracts that are asset based, a lot of the components of them are flat. And so as you see increases and decreases the fee rates don't move 100% in the same magnitude. And secondly, outside of that, there are certain volume - there's certain transactions that are charged for on a per unit basis. And so that in and of itself adds a layer that doesn't - that's uncorrelated in many ways to the level of assets. And so - and even this quarter, one of the things we experienced as we think about organic growth and particularly in the asset servicing business, that was another dynamic transaction volumes were down. And that may have had some correlation with markets being down, but we actually think it was more correlated to just the volatility where a lot of the managers that the asset manager clients we have we're doing less because of the - particularly the currency volatility. And so different dynamics at work, but without a doubt, the trust fees won't move 100% in line with market with markets. Glenn Schorr : Yeah. Maybe one last one on Wealth Management. Big difference in the AUM change year-on-year, down 10 versus down 25 for asset servicing. I'm assuming that's mostly mix and wealth management clients holding 20 something percent in cash. So I wonder if you could, a, confirm that; and b, talk about what clients are now doing with that all that cash? Michael O'Grady: Sure. So from a - from a wealth perspective, the clients may take a different approach and saying, that they're thinking about investing and they might - it's more of an asset class change for them an asset allocation change by class. And the institutional market, those clients will often think differently, and they might be moving between providers. They might be moving and they've got more options to think about what their existing option sets are. I will say, in general, our - if you think about deposits and the money market funds combined, the wealth just the movements tend to not be as extreme. And so deposits might be a better place to look at that. They've actually just been flatter. And so the wealth clients just tend to be ironically, I mean we all think about that component of the market maybe being more moving around more, but I think it's the nature of our specific clients that they tend to be to move less and just be more patient through cycles. Glenn Schorr : Okay. Thank you for all that. Michael O'Grady: Sure. Operator : One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from line Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jason Tyler : Morning, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, Jason. Digging a little deeper into the decline year-over-year of assets on the custody administration you touched on it in your prepared remarks. Can you share with this how it breaks out between just market conditions and fixed income versus equity? You already discussed a lot about the deposit issues. And then also, would the dollar may have contributed to that decline? And lastly, were there any customers that left? Jason Tyler : Sure. So AUCA is down, call it, 6.5%. Markets were over half of that. Currency to your point and observation was about a third. And we've got a significant international exposure higher than what most people realize in AUC and in fact, only 70% is USD. And then client outflows were the remainder. And so not heavily significant portion of either AUC or of the decline itself. And importantly, the decline in AUC that was related to outflows, it was related to our - largely our asset manager clients underlying business having outflows. And our asset owners rebalancing, but there is no material change in our client base or in our wallet share. And the business just emphasizes that win rate continues to be high and consistent, but this was a dynamic of our underlying clients having outflows. And over time, that works in our favor. Our clients do well. It's - and we grow with them. This period was one where particularly the asset managers had outflows, which impacted AUC. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then second, asking the revenue question a little differently. Can you share with us what percentage of your fee revenues are variable rate price, meaning you charge maybe a couple of basis points to your customer as a percentage of assets under custody? So as assets under custody go up and down, revenues, of course, follow. Where does that stand today? Jason Tyler : Yeah. Maybe something just to give you a quick sound bite that we could come back on. It's different across asset servicing. And let me offer a couple of things that might be helpful to you. In asset servicing, 40% of the fees are not asset value sensitive. They're driven by transaction volumes and account-level fees or flat fees of the asset-sensitive fees, that's 60%, about 75% operate on a month lag and about 25% on a quarter lag. And if I transition to wealth management, I'll split it between the family office and the regions because they're different. In the family office, probably it\u2019s about a third of the fees are sensitive to equity markets in some ways and about 10% are sensitive to the fixed income markets. So close to half overall. And then in the regions, about half, a little bit more are sensitive to equity markets, but a quarter are sensitive to fixed income. And so that should give you a good tool set to work from. Gerard Cassidy : Yeah, it does. Thank you. Jason Tyler : Sure. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question will come from the line of Vivek Juneja from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Vivek Juneja : Thanks, morning. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple of questions here. Capital. Your CET1 is down to 10.1%. Mike, you've always wanted to keep a gap versus your peers that Gap has really disappeared for the moment. What are you thinking, especially if rates stay high for a while? What is your plan in terms of trying to bring back that gap? Michael O'Grady: So Vivek, you're right as to our objective on capital there. And I would say that hasn't changed. What has changed, as you know, with rates, the impact of AOCI on that. And so over time, that will accrete back into capital, and that's our plan, if you will, is to allow the capital ratio to continue to be in the range that we've had for some time period. Right now, it's just in the lower part of that range as a result of AOCI. Vivek Juneja : Okay. So no plans to shrink the balance sheet or anything in the near term to try and do anything about it? Michael O'Grady: Yes. So I would say there are no specific plans around that, Vivek, but we do look at risk-weighted assets very closely because it is - that's a proxy then for the amount of capital that's being deployed in that activity and are we getting the right return. Jason talked about the size of the balance sheet earlier and the fact that we do get positive returns across all of those activities, but some of them more than others. And so we've never looked to just expand the balance sheet if it was going to be in low-returning activities. So that will be the same and in this environment, every dollar of RBA [ph] is precious. Vivek Juneja : Got it. Different question, a little detailed one. Jason, you mentioned other operating expenses were down due to lower miscellaneous expenses. Is it sustainable at this lower run rate given the cost sort of focus that you've got? Or is that just temporary and comes back? Jason Tyler : There's a lot of different factors going within that line item. And so it's just a difficult one to predict. We tend - we try to call out the big moves, but difficult to say that there's any trend within that. There's nothing we'd call out at this point. Vivek Juneja : Okay. One last one, if I may. You mentioned Investment Management is seeing outflows how much and which products are you seeing there? Jason Tyler : Across AUM in general, the declined about 7%, the majority of that is within Asset Servicing. And then from an asset class to your perspective, it's a combination of mostly cash but also equity and then also set lending cash collateral pools. But at the same time, markets drove about 40% of the decline and currency was the remaining approximately 10%. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Thank you. Jason Tyler : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. One moment for next question. We have a follow-up from the line of Brennan Hawken from UBS. Your line is open. Q - Brennan Hawken Thanks for taking my follow up. You touched briefly on this before, Jason. But could you give us an updated currency mix of the deposits and whether or not the FX moves we've seen has caused some shift there? A -: Yes. And Mark or Jennifer, if you get it before I do Yes, this is Mark. USD deposits that you were asking about the currency mix of deposits, Brennan. Q - Brennan Hawken Yes, exactly. Current deposit.... Michael O'Grady: Yes.. So in the current quarter, it's a little bit over 70% is U.S. So it's 71%. And then as you go down for total deposits, a little bit more than 10% is pounds, a little bit more than 5% as euro. And then you get to Aussie dollar, which is also right around 5% and then the rest is kind of spread out among the remaining 5% or so, 5% to 10%. But still not a significant change from what we've seen before, even though the volumes have come down. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Got it. And then earlier on expenses, you guys spoke to taking some actions on expenses to try to diminish some of the inflationary pressure. Is it possible to give some color or help us think about what kind of magnitude we should be expecting as far as those action goes, those potential actions go and what the timing would be? Michael O'Grady: I'll hit on timing. And from that perspective, it's - we started and announced internally these higher levels of controls in early mid-September. And so we're already seeing some beneficial impact from that. And certainly, change in heightening of the bar on what we're bringing in. And again, I got to emphasize, there are still things that we think about from an investment perspective, from a -- to the extent we have growth, we're going to follow that growth with appropriate level of investment. And - but this is also about productivity and making sure that we address inflation very aggressively. Those are the two components that we're looking at. And we've taken more of a five -quarter approach to this year's planning process for 2023. And to ensure we work hard on fourth quarter so that we maximize our ability to do well and be where we want to be in coming into next year. And from a magnitude perspective, too early to - we're not going to give numbers on that at this point. It's just - it is noteworthy enough that we wanted to make sure to communicate that this is something that it's been a pivot and a significant increase in the controls around higher levels - around spend increases. Brennan Hawken : Okay. But just framing it, is it best to think about - as you said that this was about addressing the inflation and whatnot, you're not stopping the investment, of course. But given the challenging environment. So should we think about this could help to offset some of the recent inflationary pressure that you saw this year. So it's about like bringing the growth rate down right? Is that the right way to think about it? Or is it more containing further pressure and sort of like stopping it from continuing to go higher? Michael O'Grady: It's both. It's - we're - if we go back and it's a good thing for you to encourage us to frame it. And so let's just come back to the way we usually - we always talk about our expenses, which is around productivity inflation growth and investing. And if we use that framework, typically, we want - we'd like to see productivity offset inflation. That's a lot easier to do when inflation is at 2%. Inflation at 8%, 9%, 10%, it's very difficult, but that should tell you we are going to be looking extremely hard at productivity at where we can look at our existing base of business and find opportunities to be more efficient. And then in the concept of investing those - that's where you just have to have a high bar. And we have to say our growth rate historically has been high, but we've accomplished a lot of the things we wanted to do. In wealth management, we went through digital metamorphosis. - in our infrastructure. We went through -- we've gone -- we've gotten a lot of work done on migrating to the cloud. And in our risk in cyber and regulatory bucket, we've done a lot of investing to ensure that the brand that we have is protected well. And those are the 3 components around technology spending importantly that we're talking about things internally. So that infrastructure foundational piece is one -- the second is that middle layer of risk regulatory cyber. And the third is around what's client driven. And there are opportunities in each of those, but the risk regulatory cyber is one where you'd say, we're going to ensure that we're doing everything we need to do there to make sure we are where we should be as a franchise. The other two buckets, we've got to think about pacing. We've got to think about who we're using to help us on those things. There are levers we can pull. And then that last overall bucket of what do we do from a growth perspective to the extent that there is good business out there for us to bring on, we're going to do it. And that we care as much about the organic growth of the company as about wanting to make sure that the expense growth rate is where it should be. Brennan Hawken : Thanks for taking my follow ups. Michael O'Grady: No, thanks for encouraging the framework. Hopefully, that's helpful. Operator : One more for next question. Our next question come from the line of Mike Brown from KBW. Mike Brown : I just wanted to ask about the volatility that we saw in the gilt market, we saw some headlines about some challenges related to processing for your business. You had some context around the situation there? And will there be any financial impact related to the volatility there and specifically for your business? Mike Brown : Yes. So Mike, you've given the background there largely just that there has been a significant amount of both volumes and volatility in the gilt market, and we have a meaningful client base of U.K. pensions that are affected by that. And a number of those pension clients also utilize liability-driven investment strategies and managers that provide those strategies. And likewise, we have some very meaningful clients on that front. So we've been in the middle of that volume and volatility and have been doing everything that's required to be able to handle that. Needless to say, it has presented challenges for all of the players in that marketplace as it continued to work its way through. And I would say still uncertain in our expectation is that although some of the volumes may have come down here more recently, we are prepared that they could pick back up again and that the volatility has not gone away. And so from that perspective, we've been very focused on taking care of the clients, making sure that everything is getting done. And I would say as far as any particular financial exposure or anything like that. There's no change to the business model for us or necessarily exposures or things like that. Mike Brown : Okay. Very good. And just - on share buybacks, I don't think we really heard much about that on this call and certainly were very low this quarter. And if I heard Jason's comment correctly before, it sounds like a lot of focus will probably be on rebuilding the CET1 ratio. So is it fair to assume that the buybacks will probably be relatively muted here and maybe just dependent on how the AOCI accretes back into capital? Or just any thoughts on the framework for thinking about buybacks would be helpful. Mike Brown : Yes. I think you got it largely right that with AOCI, it billion to $2 billion on a cumulative basis, that's a high amount. We care about our CET1 levels. And we've got -- obviously, we've got strong -- very strong capital positions, but we think about it so much on a relative basis as well and an aggregate basis. And so we feel good about the capital levels, but also our have a, I'd say, a bias toward making sure we're -- we stay relatively where we want. Mike Brown : Thank you. Operator : One moment for our next question. We have a follow-up from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Gerard Cassidy : Jason, just a quick follow-up on the beta that you mentioned, incrementally, 80% for the upcoming quarter is what you pointed out. Can you - two parts to the question. How does that compare to the last tightening cycle is 80% at this point, normal or similar, I should say, not normal -- and second, if rates continue to go higher let's say, another 75 to 100 basis points, will the incremental beta approach 100%.? Jason Tyler : So in terms of where it is relative to prior cycles, it has not been linear in this cycle. Each rate hike seems to have its own dynamic to it. And another dynamic is that historically, we've seen the most of the dynamic come from the Fed. -- but this cycle and the mix of our deposits, there's more impact from non-USD currencies, and so you've got to play that in as well. It's really important. And then to the second, and those betas also behave very differently. And then also our wealth, even within USD, the wealth deposits behave differently. They don't flatten out as much. even at higher levels from here, which gets to the second part of your question, does it level off completely at some point? It does not up another 100 basis points for sure. ] But each currency behaves differently. And depending on where we are, behaves differently, too, betas were very high in non-USD negative rates. -- you can imagine clients were highly demanding of getting 100% of the benefit as they were in negative territory as they got to 0 and a little bit above, the conversations change. And then also the dynamics of what -- what do alternatives look like. And so the shape of the yield curve matters. And -- so all those things come into play, but the direct answer is we don't anticipate a flattening even at a -- even with another 100 basis point lift, but we'll continue to see higher betas as we get there. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then, Mike, just to follow up on the pension answer that you gave over with the London or U.K. accounts. Is it safe to assume that you guys are primarily acting as agent for those customers rather than any balance sheet risk or you're not underwriting LDI products? Michael O'Grady: Correct. So we are not an LDI product provider, if you will, on the asset management side. And you're right, we're the asset servicer for either the U.K. pension or for the LDI manager that's our client. And so yes, we're acting as agent for them. Now with sales of gilts with moving collateral around -- there's a tremendous amount of movement of cash and bonds as a part of that. And so we will act as a go-between because of that. And so that can create temporary exposures, if you will, which is what would be the case. That's normal as part of the offering that we have for them. And I would just add that with all of the increases in volumes and volatility that I talked about, which have been multiples of what is normally the case. We've put additional resources to doing everything we can to make sure that we can handle those. So that's really been our position on it. And again, I can't predict where it's going to go, but we're trying to be prepared for this to continue for some time. Gerard Cassidy : Sure. Thank you. Speaker 0 Operator : That concludes our Q&A for today. I'd like to turn the call back over to Jennifer Childe for any closing remarks. Jennifer Childe : Thanks, Victor, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. And we look forward to speaking with you again very soon. Operator : Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Jennifer Childe. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am. Jennifer Childe : Thank you Marjorie. Good morning everyone and welcome to Northern Trust Corporation\u2019s fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Joining me on our call this morning are Mike O\u2019Grady, our Chairman and CEO; Jason Tyler, our Chief Financial Officer; Lauren Allnut, our Controller, and Mark Bette, Briar Rose, and Grace Higgins from our Investor Relations team. Our fourth quarter earnings press release and financial trends report are both available on our website at northerntrust.com. Also on our website, you will find our quarterly earnings review presentation, which we will use to guide today\u2019s conference call. This January 19 call is being webcast live on northerntrust.com. The only authorized rebroadcast of this call is the replay that will be made available on our website through February 18. Northern Trust disclaims any continuing accuracy of the information provided in this call after today. Please refer to our Safe Harbor statement regarding forward-looking statements on Page 13 of the accompanying presentation, which will apply to our commentary on this call. During today\u2019s question and answer session, please limit your initial query to one question and one related follow-up. This will allow us to move through the queue and enable as many people as possible the opportunity to ask questions as time permits. Thank you again for joining us today. Let me turn the call over to Mike O\u2019Grady. Michael O\u2019Grady: Thank you Jennifer. Let me join in welcoming you to our fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. I\u2019d like to start by thanking our teams across the company for their strong execution throughout the year in the face of significant global, political and market turmoil. It is our partners\u2019 unwavering focus on supporting our clients in uncertain and volatile times like these that truly differentiates Northern Trust. For the full year, revenue was up 5%, including trust fee growth of 2% and our return on average common equity was 12.7%. Excluding the impact of $303 million in charges detailed in the presentation, revenue for the full year grew 8% and our return on equity was 14.9%. Fourth quarter results reflected trends that were consistent with those we saw through the first three quarters of the year, namely on a year-over-year basis weaker markets pressured our trust fees, but this was more than offset by strong increases in net interest income. Within our wealth management business, assets under management and advisory fees grew sequentially in the fourth quarter. Total fees declined, however, due to the lag affect of markets, strategic price reductions in our index funds, and shifts in client allocations out of liquidity products. Overall, new business generation in wealth management was healthy in 2022; however, we did see some deceleration in the second half of the year as market activity waned. We continued to execute on our growth strategy in wealth management, including increasing the size and effectiveness of our sales force, expanding our digital marketing efforts, and leveraging the differentiated capabilities of the Northern Trust Institute. In asset management, assets under management were up sequentially but fees declined due to the outflows we experienced in our liquidity and indexed products as a result of the impact of both weaker markets and clients seeking alternatives. We did see solid increases in alternative funds throughout the year, including year-over-year growth of more than 20% in the fourth quarter. Our ETF complex also continued to perform well with year-over-year organic growth of 12%. Our product launches during the year focused on ESG capabilities, including three new ESG funds in the fourth quarter. Within asset servicing, we delivered a solid finish to the year. We saw healthy momentum throughout the year with our whole office offering as investment managers are increasingly considering outsourced solutions in the face of continued margin pressure and the challenging macroeconomic environment. Whole office integrates our global asset servicing platform with innovative partners facilitating access to new technologies, services and solutions. One recent client win offers an insight into what differentiates us in the marketplace. After an exhaustive RFP process during which we conducted a complete review of a large U.K.-based asset manager\u2019s front to back operating model, we were selected to provide a holistic full suite of core asset servicing, capital markets and data, and analytics products and services. This client was particularly impressed with our ability to digitalize their investment process to maximize the value of their data. We learned that this client chose us because of our combination of market-leading tools and first rate client service. We also saw continued strong demand for our integrated trading solutions offering throughout both the quarter and the year. In 2022, the number of clients on the platform increased 20% year-over-year to nearly 100. Our [indiscernible] transition backlog that we spoke to you about last quarter started to transition in during the fourth quarter and our pipeline remains strong. Expense growth continued to be elevated in the quarter, reflecting investments in people and technology to strengthen our resiliency, advance our digital modernization efforts, and drive growth in the business, all critical initiatives but the level of growth is too high. Some of the charges we announced today reflect early steps we are taking to bring down the trajectory to better align with the current operating environment and create capacity for profitable growth. To underscore our commitment, we recently launched a dedicated office of productivity to reinforce our approach to driving efficiencies throughout the company. Jason will provide more color on this in his prepared remarks. In closing, as we begin 2023, we remain well positioned to navigate the ongoing macroeconomic and market uncertainty from a position of strength. Our focus is on driving organic growth, improving our productivity, and continuing to bolster our foundations. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jason. Jason Tyler : Thank you Mike, and let me join Jennifer and Mike in welcoming you to our fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. Let\u2019s dive into the financial results of the quarter, starting on Page 2. This morning, we reported fourth quarter net income of $155.7 million. Earnings per share were $0.71 and our return on average common equity was 5.9%. Our results were unfortunately impacted by the inclusion of $266 million in pre-tax charges which reflect $199 million in net income impact and $0.94 in earnings per share impact. These charges included the following on a pre- tax basis : $213 million of investment security losses related to the intent to sell certain available for sale debt securities, which were subsequently sold in early January; $32 million of severance-related charges; $14 million of occupancy charges related to early lease exits, and $6.8 million of pension settlement charges. Also recall that in the first quarter of this year, we implemented an accounting reclassification of certain fees which continues to impact the year-over-year comparisons, as noted on this page. Let\u2019s move to Page 3 and review the financial highlights of the quarter. Including the charges previously mentioned, year-over-year revenue was down 8%. Expenses increased 13% and net income was down 62%. In the sequential comparison, revenue was down 13%, expenses were up 8%, while net income was down 61%. Excluding the charges previously mentioned, year-over-year revenue was up 5% and expenses increased 9%. Excluding the charges previously mentioned, on a sequential basis revenue was down 1% and expenses were up 5%. Let\u2019s look at the results in greater detail, starting with revenue on Page 4. Year-over-year unfavorable currency translation reduced our revenue growth by approximately 200 basis points. Trust, investment and other servicing fees representing the largest component of our revenue totaled $1 billion and were down 6% from last year and down 3% sequentially. Our trust fees continued to be unfavorably impacted by the weaker equity and fixed income markets and unfavorable currency movements. As a reminder, a significant portion of our trust fees are recorded on a month or quarter lag basis, so this quarter\u2019s performance is largely reflective of the third quarter\u2019s market performance as well as the months of October and November. The year-over-year and sequential declines in all other remaining non-interest income are primarily driven by the $213 million pre-tax investment security loss due to the intent to sell certain available for sale debt securities. These securities were subsequently sold in early January 2023, which I\u2019ll describe in more detail in a few minutes. Net interest income on an FTE basis, which I\u2019ll also discuss in more detail later, was $550 million and was up 48% from a year ago and up 5% sequentially. Let\u2019s look at the components of our trust and investment fees on Page 5. For our asset servicing business, fees totaled $588 million and were down 6% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially. Within asset servicing, custody and fund administration fees were $406 million, down 11% year-over-year but importantly they were flat sequentially. Custody and fund administration fees decreased from the prior year quarter primarily due to unfavorable markets and unfavorable currency translations, partially offset by new business. Assets under custody and administration for asset servicing clients were $13 trillion at quarter end, down 16% year-over-year and up 6% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was primarily driven by unfavorable markets and currency translation. The sequential increase was primarily driven by favorable markets and currency translation. Investment management fees within asset servicing were $124 million, up 9% year-over-year and down 9% sequentially. Investment management fees decreased sequentially primarily due to asset outflows and unfavorable markets. Investment management fees increased from the prior year quarter primarily due to lower money market fund fee waivers partially offset by asset outflows and unfavorable markets. Assets under management for asset servicing clients were $898 billion, down 25% year-over-year and up 3% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was driven by asset outflows, weaker equity and fixed income markets, and unfavorable currency translation. The sequential growth was driven by favorable markets and currency translation partially offset by asset outflows. Moving to our wealth management business, trust, investment and other servicing fees were $454 million, down 7% compared to the prior year and down 5% from the prior quarter. Within the regions, the year-over-year declines were primarily driven by unfavorable market impacts and asset outflows partially offset by the elimination of money market fund fee waivers. Sequentially the decline within the regions was primarily driven by unfavorable markets, asset outflows, and a strategic re-pricing initiative. With global family office, the year-over-year growth was driven by lower fee waivers and new business, partially offset by unfavorable markets. The sequential decrease was mainly related to asset outflows, unfavorable markets, and the re-pricing initiative. Assets under management for our wealth management clients were $351 billion at quarter end, down 16% year-over-year and up 5% on a sequential basis. The year-over-year decline was driven by primarily by unfavorable markets and asset outflows. The sequential increase was primarily due to favorable markets. Moving to Page 6, net interest income was $550 million in the quarter and was up 48% from the prior year. Earnings assets averaged $134 billion in the quarter, down 10% versus the prior year. Average deposits were $116 billion and were down 14% versus the prior year, while loan balances averaged $42 billion, up 6% compared to the prior year. On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income grew 5%. Average earnings assets were up 1%. Average deposits declined 2% while average loan balances were up 2%. The net interest margin was 1.63% in the quarter, up 64 basis points from a year ago and up 5 basis points from the prior quarter. The prior year quarter increase is primarily due to higher average interest rates. The sequential increase is primarily due to higher average interest rates partially offset by an unfavorable balance sheet mix. Turning to Page 7, on a year-over-year basis expense growth benefited by approximately 300 basis points due to currency translation. As reported, expenses were $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter, 13% higher than the prior year and 8% higher than the prior quarter. The current quarter\u2019s expenses included $53 million in charges. These charges in part reflect steps we\u2019re taking in conjunction with the launch of our office of productivity. To shift away, we approach and manage our expenses. Through this initiative, we expect to leverage data and analytics to help us better understand the efficacy of our spending so as to optimize our cost base and drive greater efficiencies throughout the organization. We\u2019ll update you on our progress in the coming quarters as appropriate. Excluding charges in both periods, expenses in the fourth quarter were up 10% year-over-year and up 5% sequentially. Also, recall that the current quarter includes the impact of the previously mentioned accounting reclassification, which increased other operating expense by $8.6 million compared to the prior year. Compensation expense was up 15% compared to the prior year and up 6% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by higher salary expense in part due to inflationary pressures, and the previously mentioned severance-related charges partially offset by favorable currency translation. The sequential increase is primarily due to the aforementioned severance-related charges and higher salary expense, partially offset by lower incentives. Employee benefits expense was down 4% compared to the prior quarter and down 6% sequentially. The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by lower ongoing pension expense partially offset by higher medical costs. The sequential decrease was primarily due to lower pension costs, including the lower pension settlement charge relative to the prior period partially offset by higher medical costs. Outside services expense was $233 million and was up 4% from a year ago and up 5% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher technical services costs, legal services and consulting services, partially offset by lower third party advisory fees and sub-custodian expense. The sequential increase was primarily due to higher technical services costs and legal services, partially offset by lower sub-custodian expense and consulting costs. Equipment and software expense of $229 million was up 17% from a year ago and up 8% sequentially. The year-over-year and sequential growth are both primarily driven by higher software costs due to continued investments in technology as well as inflationary pressures, and higher amortization. We also recognized a $3.8 million termination charge associated with our mainframe strategy. Occupancy expense of $66 million was up 27% from a year ago and up 28% sequentially. The year-over-year and sequential growth were both primarily driven by the previously mentioned $14 million of charges related to early lease exits. Other operating expense of $108 million was up 37% from a year ago and up 31% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher staff-related expense, business promotion, and miscellaneous expense. The sequential increase is primarily due to higher business promotion, supplemental compensation plan expense, and miscellaneous expenses in the current period. Turning to the full year, our results in 2022 are summarized on Page 8. On the right margin of this page, we outline the charges that we called out for both years. Included in these items, net income was $1.3 billion, down 14% compared to 2021, and earnings per share were $6.14, down 14% from the prior year. In 2022, these charges had a $227 million impact on net income and a $1.08 impact on earnings per share. In 2021, these charges had an $18 million impact on net income and a $0.07 impact on earnings per share. Full year revenue and expense trends are outlined on Page 9 and include the charges previously mentioned. Trust, investment and other servicing fees grew 2% in 2022. The growth during the year was primarily driven by lower money market fee waivers and new business, partially offset by unfavorable markets and unfavorable currency translation. Net interest income grew 36%. Average earnings assets during the year decreased by 10% while the net interest margin increased 64 basis points, driven by higher average interest rates. The net result was revenue growth of 5% in 2022 compared to 2021 and expense growth of 10%. Excluding these charges in both periods, revenue for the full year was up 8% from the prior year and expenses were up 9%. Turning to Page 10, our capital ratios remain strong with our common equity Tier 1 ratio of 10.8% under the standardized approach, up from the prior quarter\u2019s 10.1%. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 7.1%, up from 7% in the prior quarter. A decrease in net unrealized losses in the available for sale securities portfolio and less foreign exchange volatility were the primary factors in this quarter\u2019s increase in capital ratios. Accumulated other comprehensive income at the end of the quarter was a loss of $1.6 billion. During the quarter, we returned $158.9 million to common shareholders through cash dividends of $158.8 million and share repurchases of $0.1 million. In early January of this year, we sold $2.1 billion of higher capital consuming, lower yielding, non-HQLA debt securities and reinvested the proceeds into lower capital consuming, higher yielding HQLA assets. This repositioning offered the unique opportunity to de-risk our portfolio, free up capital, and improve our liquidity ratios while simultaneously generating more attractive returns. With that, Marjorie, please open the lines for questions. Operator : Thank you very much. [Operator instructions] We\u2019ll pause for a moment to allow the opportunity to signal for questions, but while we do, we\u2019ll take our first question from Glenn Schorr from Evercore. Please go ahead. Jason Tyler : Good morning Glenn. Glenn Schorr : Good morning. I guess I\u2019ll try and focus on deposits. So the interest bearing down 12%, the non-interest bearing down 48% year-on-year, but there\u2019s a clear declining impact on a sequential basis, so I\u2019m curious, a much higher rate paid and a decelerating outflow of deposits, how can you help us think through what to expect in 2023 on both attrition, mix and betas for deposits? Thank you. Jason Tyler : Sure, well let me--you know, there\u2019s a lot going on with the balance sheet, with the repositioning as well, so let me give you a couple of the key ingredients and then let me know if there\u2019s additional detail you\u2019d like. Just on volume, we saw volume up--down left to 116. We still think that that 110 to 115 is a good starting point for first quarter, and as you know, the quarters have some seasonality. We usually get a spike at the end of fourth quarter, first quarter gets some build from tax preparation, and in the second quarter we\u2019ll start to see outflows as clients pay taxes. But as you think about first quarter at least, 110 to 115 is still a good range. Then let me take beta in three different--or rates, really, in three different parts. First beta, and you noted that beta was high. We\u2019d indicated we thought it would be at this point in the cycle, and we still think that that\u2019s a pretty good indication of what we\u2019ll look like over the course of the next three months. Beta for interest-bearing deposits was 75%, 80%, it was in line. We do anticipate that to be similar. Balance sheet repositioning, that takes $2 billion, a little bit more at what was about 2% or 2.25%, then it reinvests it on the short end of the curve a couple hundred basis points higher. Right now, we\u2019re mostly overnight, but we\u2019ll continue to think about what we want to do with that from a non-HQLA perspective. But at least the starting point you should be thinking about is moving that $2 billion to overnight. Then just lastly as we\u2019re talking about rate, just a quick reminder the runoff on the portfolio is just over a billion dollars, and you\u2019re moving that from 2%, 2.25% to higher rates we\u2019re repositioning as we mature securities to the short end, so there\u2019s a similar pickup there. Then last thing on outlook, just as you think about first quarter, just remember that day count costs us about $8 million going from fourth quarter to first quarter. Those are the big ingredients. Hopefully that\u2019s helpful. Glenn Schorr : Wow, that\u2019s well prepared. Thank you. Appreciate it. Maybe just a follow-up, a similar question on average earning assets up 1% quarter-on-quarter. Should we feel in the range of stable now, or I guess-- Jason Tyler : Yes, it\u2019s hard to tell. I mean, I think about it very much from--obviously, as you know, it\u2019s a liability-driven balance sheet, and so the common carry on deposits is really what\u2019s driving the size of average earning assets in general. What we saw in the quarter, it certainly does look like things have--like client behavior has settled and leveled out a little bit, but we\u2019re not calling it flat at this point. We\u2019re still operating in a way that we\u2019re anticipating some muted but continued decline. That\u2019s why that 110 to 115, that\u2019s really the drive--you should think of that as the driver of average earning assets. Glenn Schorr : Okay, I appreciate all that. Thanks. Jason Tyler : Sure. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. I heard all the commentary around the expenses and the efforts to slow the growth rate as we go forward here, but maybe you could help us understand maybe the pace at which you think you can do that, because when I strip out the one-timers from the expense ratio, it still looks like the expense ratio moved up a bit, around 400 basis points Q-on-Q. How should I think about the trajectory from here? Does it stabilize where it is, is there still some push up from here, or should we expect that the arc begins to come down in 1Q? How should we think through that? Jason Tyler : Well, it doesn\u2019t stay where it is, and it certainly doesn\u2019t increase over time. That expense ratio needs to come down. You\u2019re talking about, I assume, expense to trust fees, and so a few-- Betsy Graseck : Yes. Jason Tyler : Yes, a few things to think about. One, and we can get into more detail on it, but in the short run at least from an expense perspective as we think about what first quarter is going to look like, I can give you some thoughts there, just as you start to model out what does it look like. Compensation is obviously our biggest line, and so we\u2019ve got to start there. We\u2019ve got the $30 million, which you indicated even pulling that out, so what does that look like going forward, we actually think that in general, that line item should start to flatten out in the near term as some of those severance-related activities come online, and we should get a benefit from that. To your question on timing, we should get a benefit on it this year. We\u2019re not going to get the benefit of it right away, but a significant portion, more than half of the actions we\u2019re going to take with severance, we\u2019re anticipating to take place by the end of the first quarter, so we\u2019re going to start to see benefit of that. We\u2019re going to backfill some of those roles, but they\u2019re not going to be in expensive locations. This is very--this is less about us addressing FTE or headcount and it\u2019s getting at what the economics are, which is the salary run rate line for the business showing up in comp. We\u2019re going to get a benefit of that this year, and so as you think about first quarter, don\u2019t forget that we\u2019ve also got retirement-eligible incentives coming online. That hits $50 million in that quarter, but that\u2019s very predictable and seasonal. The other dynamics for compensation, I\u2019d call it a wash as we think about going into first quarter. Then equipment and software is where we\u2019ve seen a big uplift over the last couple years, and we talked a few weeks ago externally about the fact that we thought that line would be at about $225 million. It came in higher at that at $229 million, but that difference--100% of that is the $3.8 million contract termination we decided to do very late in the quarter. Otherwise, we feel like that line item is starting to flatten out as well. We\u2019re going to have--we will have a step-up as we come into first quarter, but we think beyond that, that line item is going to flatten out. That\u2019s obviously where all of our depreciation is, but we\u2019re going to see an uplift of about $12 million in first quarter in equipment and software. One hundred percent of that is coming from depreciation and amortization, but other than that, we\u2019re anticipating that line item to start to flatten out. We\u2019re not going to see this kind of growth going forward. Then the other side of it is, as we think about trust fees and growth in the business, that\u2019s going to help the ratio that you started with as well. Mike, I don\u2019t know if you want to talk more strategically about how you\u2019re thinking about this? Michael O\u2019Grady: Yes, I would just add, Betsy, to your point, it is about trajectories and curves, if you will. We\u2019ve been on a downward trajectory with trust fees as a result of the factors that Jason has gone through. Obviously we\u2019re trying to drive that the other way, primarily through growth. When it comes to NII, we\u2019ve had a strong trajectory up. That\u2019s not likely to carry through into the new year or into 2023, just as a result of the rate cycle. Then looking at the expenses, as Jason went through there, we\u2019re clearly trying to bend down that expense growth curve without a doubt through the productivity office, but also just in every day in how we operate the business. Betsy Graseck : And that curve bend downwards sounds like it\u2019s a second half--like, we\u2019ll see that more in second half than in first? Michael O\u2019Grady: Yes, I think that\u2019s right, because as Jason\u2019s saying, some of these things, there\u2019s actions that we already took in the fourth quarter which we had talked about in the previous call, the intent to get going on those, and then more of them that are happening in the first quarter as well, and then carrying through. So you\u2019re right - by the time you see the impact, it\u2019s delayed relative to the actions. Betsy Graseck : Okay, thank you. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken from UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : Good morning, I hope you guys are doing well. Hoping to get more specifics here. Productivity office - you know, helpful that we\u2019re seeing that emerge, but what are the objectives, right? What are the metrics that they\u2019re looking to drive? You gave some generally kind of high level comments on how to think about bending the curve and whatnot there in response to Betsy\u2019s question, but really, expenses have been a bit out of control - just being blunt, especially relative to the peer group and especially relative to the revenue trends. Investors are really--I\u2019m getting hit a lot this morning, people looking for some more details, better understanding, and what specific metrics you\u2019re using and how we can make sure to--that you\u2019re hitting your goals when you\u2019re pushing through to make these changes. Jason Tyler : Yes, I can--first of all, the thing that we look at to litmus test how we\u2019re doing from an expense management perspective is still expense to trust fees, and even pulling out the charges from this quarter, being anywhere near 120, that\u2019s not where the business is going to be in the long run. That\u2019s going to come down. Then you start to think more tactically, how does the productivity look to do that, and just to be--you know, just to say what are the numbers associated with it, historically we have talked about productivity matching inflation. When inflation was at 1% or 2%, we felt like we were doing that really well. With inflation at 8% or 9%, we are not going to get productivity to that level, but we should absolutely have productivity above 2% of our expense base. Second, every group in this company has productivity goals. We go through it all the time, every year in our planning process, and then next if you start to just think tactically, how is this office going to get at this work, where are the buckets that we\u2019re going to get at, I\u2019ll give you how the group is laid out. First of all, it\u2019s technology - that\u2019s the largest component and the fastest growing expense item we have. That\u2019s $1.4 billion, and so we have to--we\u2019ve got to get at technology costs. We accomplished a lot in 2022 and 2021, but we\u2019ve got to do it efficiently, and that means determining how we\u2019re purchasing, how we\u2019re developing technology, how we\u2019re consuming it, how we\u2019re delivering it. Two is vendor strategy and how we\u2019re thinking about engaging with our partners externally. Three, investment governance - there are areas around the company where we\u2019re investing in growth for the business, we\u2019re investing to get deeper and stronger, but we\u2019ve got to accomplish those things but at the same time test whether or not we still want to be investing at the same rate, at the same timing. Then lastly, fourth is a big pillar is workforce analysis, and a couple things there. You already see us getting at larger severance than we normally take, and that should get to 300, 400 positions that will be impacted. That\u2019s why we\u2019re focused on driving productivity across operations, and then a step earlier than this, we took out hundreds of technology-related contractors in fourth quarter, just as an indication of how aggressively we\u2019re getting at this internally, and that\u2019s a big effort to do that. But again, we accomplished a lot and now it\u2019s time to turn the corner on it. Michael O\u2019Grady: Yes, and Brennan, I would just add, I think Jason described it well, but think about it as bottoms-up and top-down, right, which is each of the groups, as Jason was saying, they have to have their productivity initiatives that work their way up to their productivity goals that are in the plan. The top-down part is the productivity office, which is doing things that can cut across the enterprise and also have the structure to work with the groups to help them meet those productivity initiatives. That\u2019s the approach to it, and again this is--we always have productivity as a part of the planning process, but as Jason is saying, when you have inflation like we do, you have to be able to ramp up those activities in order to get greater efficiencies. Brennan Hawken : Sure, sure, and everybody is dealing with inflation and it\u2019s certainly troubling and it\u2019s weighing on the results for that question. That was a lot of color and I appreciate that color, Jason and Mike. I would encourage you please to provide some actual metrics, though, to the investment community so that we can measure your progress, understand what your goals are, and actually have some visibility in order to think about where you\u2019re going and what you\u2019re trying to do, not just from a conceptual perspective but from a numbers perspective, because I think that would really help in improving the confidence. One follow-up question would be on wholesale funding. I just took a look - you know, wholesale funding was up again this quarter. Should we think about it getting back to the 2019 levels where it was, like, mid-6% of the funding side of the balance sheet? Is that reasonable, because it still looks like there\u2019s a little ways to go to get there, or is this the upper end of the range and are you trying to limit that growth? Jason Tyler : There\u2019s not--there\u2019s nothing strategic that we\u2019ve been doing in that area to bring it down, and so it is instructive as you\u2019re doing to look back at more historical levels. It\u2019s not to say that\u2019s the target, but it is to say that where we are right now is not reflective of any strategy that we have for lower levels. Brennan Hawken : Okay, all right. Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you very much. We\u2019ll take our next question from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Alex Blostein : Hey, good morning. Thanks for the question. Maybe I\u2019ll pivot a little bit. I was hoping to spend a couple minutes on the wealth management and the global family office trends. You guys highlighted outflows, client outflows, asset outflows I think in both of those for the quarter. Wealth management tends to kind of ebb and flow, but global family office historically, I think, has been a source of stronger organic growth, so maybe help us unpack what\u2019s driving the outflows in both of these businesses, and maybe also hit on the strategic price reductions that you mentioned, how much of that is fully captured in the Q4 results. Is there any kind of negative carryover effect into Q1 as we think about fees, and again maybe a little bit more color on the reasons behind these pricing reductions and what you ultimately expect to achieve there. Jason Tyler : Sure, so let\u2019s just walk the fees, because that\u2019s probably what--is kind of how you\u2019re framing the question. Fees down roughly $20 million for the quarter, right, half of that is markets and then a quarter of it is the re-pricing that we mentioned earlier. As this group knows extraordinarily well, in the asset management side of the business, fee compression is still persistent, and so we have not done those types of reductions a lot recently. We want to make sure that we\u2019re priced appropriately, and so with some of the indexed products, we took a--we took fee reductions, that\u2019s only on the product side, not on the advisory side. Those are done, so there\u2019s a step down there, no incremental benefit going forward and, at this point, no plans to do more. The other quarter of the decline was outflows, and that was--but that was product-related outflows, so really client repositioning in the money market space, in the liquidity space. We\u2019ve seen a journey there for our clients across both wealth as well as asset servicing. It\u2019s very closely aligned to what we saw in deposits of large decline as we came into COVID, and decline as markets gained more confidence and then started to redeploy assets into risk assets. The way we litmus test the business in wealth is to think about our advisory fee, frankly, not the product side but what are the assets and what are the fees related to the advice we have with clients. That\u2019s gone well - in the quarter, client flows for wealth management from an advisory perspective overall were positive. On a linked quarter and year-over-year basis, the net new business and flow activity that we track was positive - low single digits, but it was positive, so the business is not in decline. What we\u2019re seeing is a lot of clients deploying away from their historical mix of using our money market funds and then, in this quarter, re-pricing of product. Alex Blostein : Got it. As you think about pricing broadly for the products, not the advisory component, but if you think about the money market offering, given the fact that money market funds are actually giving a pretty healthy yield, is there any thought around reducing your money market fees as well to become more competitive to maybe capturing more of those flows or prevent folks from leaving and seeking better yield options net of fees? Jason Tyler : We look at it all the time. It actually--it\u2019s more--that comes more into play on the institutional side, and we\u2019ve got a really--we\u2019ve got a very large and successful money market mutual fund business. We do a lot of liquidity work for our clients, and so even now there are some strategic waivers that we have in the institutional side of the business, where we\u2019re working pricing to ensure that we\u2019re as attractive as we can be. But it\u2019s not just pricing that clients look at. On the institutional side in particular, they look at size and they look at the underlying quality of the assets. A lot of the ultra-large investors have investment policy restrictions on how big they can be within a fund, and so the fact that we\u2019ve got funds that are $40 billion, $50 billion, $60 billion, it enables those large investors to put money to work, and so the competition set is a little bit lower on the institutional side. We\u2019re above that threshold, so in the long run, that\u2019s very good for us. There will be ebbs and flows based on other factors, but in the long run it\u2019s good. On the wealth side, that\u2019s just going to ebb and flow with the business. Traditionally it\u2019s been more aligned, this is just a period of time where our clients, they\u2019re also thinking about deploying to building their own treasury portfolios, laddering in portfolios there, and then potentially other products, they\u2019ll use ultra short. We do have high confidence that the mix of the usage of this product is going to come back to where it was historically, and you\u2019re exactly right - it\u2019s a very attractive engagement for us economically. Alex Blostein : Okay, thanks. I\u2019ll hop back in the queue. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Hey, good morning guys. Jason, sorry to come back to NII, but I was just wondering, can you kind of put that all into context for us in terms of if the balance sheet\u2019s shrinking, you get a little bit of help from the repositioning, can NII grow from here based on what you still expect on the rate curve? I guess that would be the question. Thanks. Jason Tyler : Yes, I appreciate you pushing on that. The answer is yes, it can absolutely grow from here, and we anticipate that throughout the year, it will. I don\u2019t think first quarter is going to see--I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s going to see meaningful growth, but the trajectories are still in our favor. The balance sheet repositioning in and of itself is--that\u2019s an attractive lift, and then betas are not 100%, and so with the Fed actions, we\u2019re going to do well. We\u2019ve also got the runoff which helps us too, so the only offset to that is volumes. That\u2019s what--you know, we\u2019re not sure what that\u2019s going to look like, but even that remained relatively flat, right--it was at the top end, maybe a tiny bit above what our anticipation was last quarter. If I look out through the year, absolutely the anticipation for NII is to be growing from this 550 level. Ken Usdin : Okay, thank you. My follow-up to that is how do you think about incremental betas from here in terms of deposit cost increases? You had said you expected a decent move up this quarter - you did get that, so how do we just understand that mix of deposits and the beta that you\u2019re looking at? Thank you. Jason Tyler : Sure, yes. I mean, the mix, I don\u2019t--we haven\u2019t seen that changing dramatically, but you\u2019re raising an interesting point, which is that the betas are actually different depending on the currency that you\u2019re talking about, so I just think that\u2019s something that\u2019s important for people to think about it. Most of the way the industry also calculates beta is on just the interest-bearing portion. I think it\u2019s instructive to think about the total beta as well, because as we\u2019ve talked about, the mix of interest bearing to non-interest bearing changes over time, and so that has an effect as well. But the betas on the institutional side, I think you\u2019ve got to call them close to 100% at this point. It varies by currency, but I think you\u2019ve got to call it close to 100%. Then on the wealth management side, it\u2019s less than that, and you can imagine for us to get to a blended level that I\u2019m talking about in kind of that 70% to 80% range, wealth is closer to 50%, and the institutional side closer to 100%. Ken Usdin : Okay, got it. Thank you Jason. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Good morning folks, Mike and Jason. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just to also ask about NII, actually more to focus on that deposit growth trend, and you talked about 110 to 115 in 1Q. As you come into second quarter, maybe it\u2019s hard to assess this early, but what type of headwind would tax payments be on that? Then sort of a related question would be to what extent do you want to, or do you think you need to defend those wealth--those strategic wealth deposits and raise the beta further as we get into 2023? Jason Tyler : I\u2019ll go in reverse order. We\u2019ve talked about heavy defensive wealth deposits. The economics are important and that\u2019s the--those are the things we want to be doing with our clients, hard stop, and so we\u2019re going to do everything we can to defend those. They\u2019re largely relationship driven, but there is--also, there are pockets where our clients look really aggressively at rate, and so we\u2019ve got good governance and infrastructure to make sure we\u2019re doing what we can to maximize that. Then throughout the year, you\u2019re just asking how are we thinking about it over the course of the year, we\u2019ve tended--you can go back and look historically at first quarter to second quarter and see what kind of decline there has been. We don\u2019t think--we don\u2019t anticipate anything different this year, and then what I can tell you is that from there, we don\u2019t expect--we have more of a flattish outlook, but we\u2019ve got to just remember that that second quarter decline does take place, and history should be a pretty good judge. Brian Bedell : Yes, that\u2019s helpful, and maybe just on expenses, you mentioned the equipment and software up $12 million in the first quarter. Is that from the 229 level in 4Q, or is that 225 ex-the charge? Jason Tyler : Thanks for confirming that. It\u2019s off the 225 level. Brian Bedell : Great, okay. Thank you, I\u2019ll get back in the queue. Operator : Thank you, and we\u2019ll take our next question from Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global. Please go ahead. Jim Mitchell : Hey, good morning. Maybe just a little bit on the pension accounting. Did that get triggered again this year, and should we expect more charges this year? Jason Tyler : Every year we come into it and we don\u2019t expect there to be--to trigger settlement accounting, and it\u2019s ironic because in 2021, we had the thresholds but then we did a larger RIF, and those ended up triggering, and then this past year, it was interest rates going up significantly that led to a higher level of retirements than we anticipated. In no year do we anticipate it at this time, but the bad news is we\u2019re in the exact same boat this time, which is that we look at the thresholds with our outside actuaries, with our consultants, but we can\u2019t predict with high degrees of certainty what the experience will be from a retirement perspective. We have to let that play through. That said, what we experienced in \u201921 and \u201922, we had not experienced prior to that, and so it\u2019s not like this is something that--it\u2019s happened the last two years, but if you look over the last 10 years, it hasn\u2019t happened outside of these last two years. That\u2019s how we think about it. It seems like more of a trend certainly than what we\u2019re planning or anticipating. Jim Mitchell : Okay, and maybe just on capital, you had a nice sequential improvement in capital ratios. You didn\u2019t really do much in the way of buybacks in \u201922. Do you see that being a bigger part of the EPS story this year? Jason Tyler : Yes, at some point. If you think about the framework we\u2019ve used historically, and I\u2019ve talked about it a lot, there\u2019s no red flags there. We don\u2019t have to have all of those components of the framework saying green. We look at it in combination at any given point in time, and we\u2019re at 10 :8 right now. We also still have $1.6 billion in AOCI - that will come down a little bit, actually in a chunk because of the securities repositioning, because we did that after the quarter, so we\u2019ve got, call it a $1.4 billion that\u2019s going to be accreting into capital over time. The returns in the business are still strong, and so there\u2019s no reason we wouldn\u2019t be back at some point. Jim Mitchell : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Rob Wildhack from Autonomous Research. Rob Wildhack : Good morning guys. On the fee side, I just wanted to check in on organic growth and the competitive landscape, you know, this quarter and into \u201923 for both the institutional and the wealth businesses. Thanks. Jason Tyler : Sure, so I\u2019d say different stories there. We talked about wealth a little bit earlier, and if you think about just the core underlying business, really focusing more on the account management side, then the business had a very strong first half of the year and the second half of the year was weaker. We\u2019ve also noted GFO was much stronger than the regions, but again that\u2019s going to ebb and flow over time; but organic growth the way we have calculated it and communicated it historically was negative in the regions for the quarter, and call it flat for GFO--actually, slightly positive GFO if you think about it on a year-over-year basis. It at least gives you a sense of where that business is. But then again, from the advisory side, even both for the year-over-year and at the end of the quarter, the advisory fees did well, and so the core business there is strong. We think it\u2019s the product mix and other factors leading to the way we\u2019ve calculated organic growth as being negative. In asset servicing, different story - we talked at the early part of the year that we felt the pipeline was good. That pipeline has started to on-board in fourth quarter, and we feel good about the growth in that business. The proxy there should be more custody and fun servicing fees, just as I talked about account management fees in wealth management, the proxy--the same corollary there is custody and fund servicing. That was a positive in fourth quarter, it was actually really attractive. We had new business that Mike talked about early coming online in the business to the tune of kind of mid single digits, and we feel like that business is back to its historical organic growth rate. That\u2019s evidenced by what we on-boarded. The one not on-boarded business we have right now is higher than our three-year average, and the pipeline of business they have, that they\u2019re still bidding on in late stages, is higher than the three-year average for the business, so a lot of positive signs in the asset servicing business from an organic perspective. Rob Wildhack : That\u2019s helpful. Just on that starting to on-board business in asset servicing, I think in the past you had talked about that not really coming online until the second half of \u201923, so is that a pull forward there? Jason Tyler : Actually, there is--go ahead, Mark? Mark Bette : It was \u201922. Jason Tyler : Yes, I\u2019m sorry - it was early \u201922 that we talked about there being business in the back half of the year that was on-boarding, so that did come into play. We do have right now--there is a chunk of business that we know is on-boarding in the short run. The pipeline is good, and then you go out farther to the end of \u201923 and there\u2019s another chunk of large business that we\u2019re anticipating to come on in a couple different areas fourth quarter, and even into first quarter of \u201924. The pipeline for that business at various stages is looking good. Rob Wildhack : Got it, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi. On the expenses, oh my - I get it. You guys are dealing with the first decline in both stock and bond markets in over 50 years. You said you\u2019re preserving growth by investing in people and tech. There\u2019s inflation, but wow, this is the worst quarterly operating leverage that I can recall for you guys. For the year, it was negative operating leverage of 500 basis points, and even cost has grown twice the pace of revenue growth. I guess what I\u2019m looking for is more assurance that expenses haven\u2019t gotten away from you. I get it - at the high level, you said--you know, it looks like you\u2019re right-sizing headcount with severance, you took out hundreds of tech-related contracts, you have some kind of mainframe strategy. I have to tell you, I just don\u2019t understand what that means from a bottom line standpoint. I guess the question is, you\u2019ve said your expenses to trust fee ratio of 120% is unacceptable, but what is acceptable and when should you get there - like, 2024, 2025? What kind of sense of urgency do you have, because this is not the Northern we\u2019ve gotten to know over the past long while, aside from your resiliency through tough times. Thanks. Michael O\u2019Grady: Mike, it\u2019s Mike. To your point, if you go back a number of years, where we were at levels that were like this, it\u2019s been a long time, and that\u2019s why it is considered unacceptable where we are. We were effective in driving that ratio down into an area where, yes, we thought it was within that range for us to be able to continue to operate, and that\u2019s kind of that 105 to 110 range. We have the same objective now of getting it back into that range. That calculation is a numerator and a denominator, and we\u2019re trying to drive both of those. Beyond the challenging environment on the fee front, which is going to happen at various times, we\u2019re trying to drive the organic growth there, and as much as we had good growth in the year, it was not one of our stronger organic growth levels, so challenged on the numerator both, I would say conditions, but also what we did on our part. Then on the other side, from an expense perspective, as Jason said, we got a lot done not just this year but the last couple of years in really making, call it the company more resilient, and I\u2019ll get into a little more detail on that; but just contextually if you think back a few years with the pandemic and the last couple of years, the technology infrastructure of the company is just critical to your ability to be just what you said, which is resilient and there for your clients in any set of conditions, and so that\u2019s required a lot of investment in technology. Some of it, if you think about it, you have to be able to operate completely remotely, and so you have to invest to be able to do that, and you also have to be reliable for clients, so when it comes to modernizing all the technology you have, it does require investment on that front. In the meantime, we also push forward with our digitalization efforts, which is much more the client-facing part of that which is essential to being competitive and essential to growing. It\u2019s been very active across that. Some of that is, call it non-discretionary, right - it needs to be done to be able to do what I said. Other parts of it, you do have more discretion in the speed, particularly around the digitalization front, and you\u2019re looking at the returns that you\u2019re going to get for that. We talked about things like Matrix, which has been a meaningful investment which will drive both productivity but also will drive our capabilities, and therefore revenue and organic growth on that front. The same thing is happening in wealth management, where we have to make sure that our interface with our clients is frictionless, as Steve would say, in the technology interface with the clients. That part of it, again, we can pay some, and that\u2019s part of what we\u2019ll have to do on the technology front. The last part of it is just the need for efficiencies around the technology spend and then just more broadly, which we\u2019ve done many times and need to just increase the focus on execution around those, what I\u2019ll call more traditional ways to drive productivity. You asked the question on, okay, when does it get into that range, is it \u201923, is it \u201924? I don\u2019t know, because I don\u2019t know exactly what\u2019s going to happen with the numerator and the denominator, but that\u2019s what we\u2019re driving towards, is to get it into that range and, in the meantime, also trying to drive profitability, meaning driving pre-tax margins above 30%. That\u2019s kind of the view and the plan. Mike Mayo : Can you give any specifics for the year? I know it\u2019s not always your style, but in terms of expense growth for the year or what the savings are from the elimination of all the tech contracts, or even just if I think of investing along a J-curve, seems like you\u2019re on this tech journey, like a lot of others are, and some are still in the investing phase and some are in the harvesting phase. When do you think you go from investing to harvesting on this broader tech strategy, which seems to be impacting your expenses? Michael O\u2019Grady: Yes, so I\u2019ll answer both but then let Jason add, too. We are clearly in the investing stage, but I would say--you know, and you\u2019re always investing of course in that, because the needs change over time, etc. But from a cresting perspective, etc., we\u2019re more towards that than we are away from it, if that makes sense. In other words, we have gotten a lot done in the last couple of years on that front, so that\u2019s my view. Then as far as the expenses, we talked about for the year expenses at 9%, so that\u2019s the part where we\u2019re saying that doesn\u2019t work, and so how do we bring that down. Now, there is still going to be growth in expenses for the year because there\u2019s certain aspects that just carry into the year, right? You do have base pay increases that flow in and you do have some of the technology costs that are amortizations that just come into the year, but outside of that, you\u2019re trying to do everything you can with productivity to offset other increases. Mike Mayo : All right, thank you. Oh, you said Jason was going to follow up? Jason Tyler : Well, I can give you a little bit more color on the year, if it\u2019s helpful, and whatever information is helpful, obviously I\u2019m happy to give what we see at this point. But one thing as you\u2019re thinking about the next several quarters, not just the next one, is outside services was elevated and lots of things happening there is fourth quarter. Some of that is episodic, some of that has--I\u2019m sorry, other expense, some of that is episodic agency expense, supplemental pension plan. Some of those have more of a longer term trend, so think travel, marketing - that was actually up $8 million over third quarter, that\u2019s likely going to stay elevated. But some of these were episodic, and so we don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see other expenses at $107 million. It should even--that should quickly unless-- and some of it\u2019s out of our control because things like the supplemental pension plan are market affected. But that should get to below $100 million and hopefully stay that way going forward. Then you just think about the impact also of compensation. Just to give you some color there, we know base pay is going to come online in second quarter - that\u2019s going to be a $20 million lift, and then to severance activity, we think that\u2019s going to help us help offset that a little bit, probably $5 million to $7 million on a quarterly basis starting in second, third quarter. Then we\u2019ll have some additional hiring, but that\u2019s going to be in line with the growth of the business. That at least gives you a sense of some of the line items. The last thing, visibility on equipment and software, the depreciation lift that we got coming into first quarter, that levels out a lot. There\u2019s some growth, call it a couple million dollars a quarter after that, but nowhere near this level, so a lot of the--that\u2019s where you get to what\u2019s the impact of that hundreds of contracts coming out. We\u2019re starting to flatten that depreciation and amortization line which sits within equipment and software, which has been the fastest grower. It\u2019s just reflective that we\u2019ve gotten a lot of work done. Mike Mayo : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Gerard Cassidy from RBC. Please go ahead. Jason Tyler : Morning Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Hi Jason. Coming back to the expense topic and conversation, on the salaries, can you share whether this--the cost of those salaries, is it going more to entry-level folks or is it more your senior people? Then second, are you at risk of losing people, which is why you had to bump up salaries? Maybe a little more detail about just the salary portion. Jason Tyler : Yes, so two very different dynamics happening. The actions we\u2019re taking this year are not across the board, much more targeted than they have been historically and very centered, frankly, around technology and some operations-oriented functions, effectively. That just gives you a sense of where we\u2019re going. Then to why we\u2019ve had some of the increases, some of the salary increase we had last year obviously was an inflation-related higher than average merit increase, but a lot of the growth we had last year was doing off-cycle adjustments to retain talent, specifically in the wealth management business. We think that that\u2019s largely done at this point. You can never claim with certainty that that\u2019s fully over, but that was meaningful. You know how important that franchise is to us and how important that talent base is, and so we were going to defend that base. That episode, that seems to be over at this point and we\u2019re more to a business-as-usual growth rate across the organization, but we\u2019re identifying areas where we can get significant salary run rate savings and getting after those aggressively. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Then as a follow-up, can you share with us on the sale of the fixed income portfolio which resulted in losses that you reported, can you give us some color on what types of securities were sold and the yields of those securities, and then by reinvesting the proceeds from that sale, how long will it take you to earn back that loss that you had to take to exit the portfolios? Jason Tyler : What we looked for were securities that had the combination of a couple things : one, poor RWA treatment, and secondly lower coupon, lower yield, and third that they still had significant time to maturity. That bucket ended up being $2 billion, $2.5 billion. The coupon on those was in the 2% to 2.25% on average, and the reinvestment of those coming in at--you know, think about earnings on reserve balances at the Fed in the 4.5% range at this point. In terms of the payback on that, it\u2019s more like 3.5 years, but remember from a regulatory reporting perspective, we had already stripped out the unrealized loss in that portfolio, and so the drivers of this were very largely around the opportunity to improve capital ratios, not that we needed to improve capital or liquidity - we didn\u2019t, but seeing the opportunity to benefit CET-1 in the form of lower RWA treatment coupled with improved liquidity ratio, and at the same time not hurt the economic value of your earnings stream, was very attractive to go after, and that\u2019s really what led us to do this. Gerard Cassidy : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : Hey, good morning. Gerard actually asked my question, but I did want to clarify one item relating to the securities portfolio repositioning, which is whether you have any appetite to actually engage in further repositioning of the book from here. Jason Tyler : Well, we would have appetite, frankly, because it\u2019s an attractive thing to do, but at the same time, we feel like we\u2019ve harvested just about everything that\u2019s there. I\u2019m glad you asked the follow-up because as soon as I finished, I realized Gerard, and now you might be interested in just a little bit more color - corporate bonds within the $2 billion was about half, munis and mortgage-backed securities were about a quarter each, just so you know. But it\u2019s an attractive time to go after something like that given the yield curve and the ability to change non-HQLA assets to HQLA assets, pick up capital, pick up liquidity and no impact from an economic perspective, and in fact making it positive. Steven Chubak : That\u2019s great. Thanks for taking my follow-up. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll next go to Mike Brown from KBW. Mike Brown : Great. Hey, good morning. I just wanted to follow up on one of the capital and ensure purchase questions from earlier. I looked at your capital ratios - you\u2019re well above your minimums, which is consistent with how you\u2019ve always managed the capital, but you\u2019ve got a number of tailwinds on that front, and Jason, you mentioned that you plan to resume the buybacks at some point. But I guess it seems to me that there\u2019s really no time like the present, so my question is, should we expect the share repurchases to engage in a more meaningful way in the first quarter? When we think about the full year, what are the guardrails we should consider for your capital ratios as we think about modeling capital return from here? Jason Tyler : Sure, so we won\u2019t comment more on timing, and if I get to the guardrails, it\u2019s instructive, I think, to look--and again, none of these are 100% determinative, they\u2019re just part of how we think about it, but these are the factors we think about. Look at the absolute levels, which tells you to look at history, look at where we are relative to peers and then relative to regulatory perspectives - we look at those things. Then the other dynamic is that RWA has been less predictable than pre-COVID, and we used our balance sheet to be there for our clients. We were one of the few institutions that actually let RWA increase over the last several years, and it\u2019s because we wanted--our clients had loan demand and they wanted us to be there in FX activity and set lending, and we did that because we had--it was because we were able to, because we had the capital strength and flexibility to do that. That\u2019s the thing that we\u2019re also looking forward on, to make sure that we\u2019re not missing any significant changes in client demand that might impact our behavior. But you\u2019re right in that sitting at 10 :8, it\u2019s a much better position, and then back to this concept of $1.4 billion in AOCI pulling a par over the next several years, plus the return on equity in the business is still attractive, so we\u2019re still each quarter accreting capital, so no reason we won\u2019t be in the market at some point. Mike Brown : If I can just follow up on that, Jason, the loan balances were down about 2.5% sequentially. It sounds like--I guess, how are you thinking about that loan demand from here? Our view is it sounded like it was kind of softer going forward, but you kind of alluded to the fact that maybe you wanted to be there to meet client demand, so are you expecting that loan demand to pick up here in 2023? Then I guess just one other follow-on on the capital side, how do you think about inorganic actions here in terms of capital allocation? Do you see any other opportunities to change your strategic asset mix and scale so that perhaps that could be another avenue that you\u2019d consider on the capital allocation front? Jason Tyler : Sure, so on loan demand, I always remind people, it\u2019s super spiky. On the base of business we have and the clients that we have that can come with really significant asks, and we\u2019re happy to do it because a lot of times, they\u2019ve got potentially billions of dollars in assets, and then they might have a liquidity need and they don\u2019t want to liquidate the asset, it\u2019s a great opportunity for us to help them at very large dollar amounts, it solidifies relationships well. We just don\u2019t look quarter to quarter at loan volumes as much as I think it\u2019s appropriate to for other institutions. In general, our growth expectations are for more of a business-as-usual growth rate. We do anticipate some growth this year in the business, not a ton but more business-as-usual. Then on capital, there\u2019s no problem we\u2019re trying to fix in mix or scale. Frankly in capability, we\u2019re just thinking opportunistically. If things come up, we\u2019ve got the capital to be able to look at it. We\u2019ve talked about having more of a bias at this point towards wealth management. We\u2019ve done some things from an acquisition perspective in asset servicing over the last several years - they\u2019ve gone well, but we\u2019ve got a whole product circle there that we feel good about than we do in wealth, but the more we can bring on attractive wealth clients that don\u2019t necessarily have the holistic product approach that we can bring, it\u2019s a great opportunity for us to create value, and so that\u2019d be top of the list, but no problems we\u2019re looking to solve from a mix or scale perspective. Mike Brown : Okay, very interesting. Thank you for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you, and we\u2019ll go to our last question from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Great, thanks for taking my follow-up. Maybe to switch gears a little bit, just on the wealth side, to what extent are you seeing any impact from some of your entrepreneur clients that may have had lower valuations in their private businesses, or in their public businesses? Are you seeing any kind of pullback from those clients? Is it significant or is it really just not that big a deal? Michael O\u2019Grady: Brian, it\u2019s Mike. I would say we definitely are seeing a different perspective on the part of the clients that you\u2019re talking about, or prospects, right? I mean, a lot of the activity in 2021, beginning of 2022 was as a result of business owners who were selling their businesses, were monetizing assets, and so that was an uplift for us. With the reduced activity that you\u2019re seeing of IPOs and market activity there, but then also certainly in the private marketplace lower activity there, definitely it\u2019s had an impact for us of just less market opportunity for us. Brian Bedell : Okay, thanks, and then just one more on expenses - a lot\u2019s been asked and answered, but just in terms of the on-boarding for the asset servicing pipeline, should we expect what is typically in the business, where you have some on-boarding expenses ahead of when the contracts are installed and generating revenue? Is that something also that might create some noise for 2023, given the 4Q larger, chunky mandate that I think you\u2019re bringing on? Jason Tyler : Yes, a couple things. One, nothing that we\u2019d call out at this point. If that changes, we\u2019d call it out for you. In some instances, even, some of those expenses are capitalized in long term contracts, and so--but nothing at this point that we\u2019d want you to be thinking ahead on. Brian Bedell : Okay, great. Thank you so much for taking my follow-ups. Operator : We will now turn it back to our speakers for any closing remarks. Jennifer Childe : Thanks very much for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again soon. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today\u2019s conference. We appreciate your participation. Have a wonderful day.",

Let me turn the call over to Mike O\u2019Grady. Michael O\u2019Grady: Thank you, Jennifer. Let me join in welcoming you to our first quarter 2023 earnings call. The recent disruption in the banking sector reminds us of the importance of resiliency to be able to meet the needs of clients in all operating environments. During the past six weeks, much like over the past 130 years, our strong balance sheet and conservative approach to risk management have enabled us to provide the support, liquidity and exceptional service our clients have come to expect from us. Northern Trust continues to be viewed as a source of strength and stability as symbolized by our anchor. During the quarter, we continued to assist our clients manage their liquidity, including deposits, money market funds and short-term treasuries through the transition from a period of quantitative easing and low interest rates to one of rapid tightening and higher rates. Overall, we saw client liquidity increased during the quarter as a decline in deposits was more than offset by increases in higher yielding money market funds. Our results for the first quarter reflect sequential improvement in revenue and expense growth. The sequential growth and trust fees outpaced the slight decrease in net interest income, which still experience healthy year-over-year growth. Expense growth moderated from recent quarters, which was attributable to both our renewed spending discipline and certain timing differences. Within our wealth management business, assets under management grew mid-single digits sequentially, while our trust fees increased modestly. The turmoil in the banking space contributed to a flurry of new business activity later in the quarter. We saw solid new account openings, particularly at the upper end of the wealth market. We took in almost $1 billion in inflows from the $50 million and over segment alone, and discussions are continuing with a solid pipeline of prospective clients. In asset management, we had a strong start to the year with a sequential increase in new business, including large inflows into our institutional money market platform. New product launches focused on alternatives and extending securities lending capabilities in our collective funds space with three new funds launched. Within asset servicing, we saw continued momentum with particularly good traction in Europe. For example, during the quarter, we transitioned in Artemis investment management, a large UK-based investment manager for whom we are providing a full suite of services, including custody, fund administration, investment operations outsourcing and risk and handling services for both their UK and Luxembourg funds. In closing, we are well-positioned to continue to serve our clients and navigate the ongoing economic uncertainty from a position of strength. I'll now turn the call over to Jason. Jason Tyler : Thank you, Mike, and let me join Jennifer and Mike in welcoming you to our first quarter 2023 earnings call. Let's dive into the financial results of the quarter starting on Page 4. This morning, we reported first quarter net income of $334.6 million, earnings per share of $1.51 and our return on average common equity was 12.4%. On a year-over-year basis, currency movements unfavorably impacted our revenue growth by approximately 100 basis points, and favorably impacted our expense growth by approximately 130 basis points. On a sequential basis, currency movements favorably impacted our revenue growth by approximately 70 basis points and unfavorably impacted our expense growth by approximately 90 basis points. Our first quarter results were also impacted by two notable items. One, we recognized a $6.9 million pre-tax gain on the securities repositioning we announced last quarter and executed in January; two, we reported $9.8 million of pre-tax charges associated with various early lease terminations actions taken to further optimize our global real estate footprint. Notable items from previous periods are listed on the slide. Excluding the notable items in all periods, revenue was flat on a sequential quarter basis and up 1% over the prior year. Expenses were flat on a sequential quarter basis and up 6% over the prior year, reflecting an expense to trustee ratio of 120%. Pre-tax income was down 2% sequentially and down 13% over the prior year. Trust, investment and other servicing fees representing the largest component of our revenue totaled $1 billion and we're down 9% from last year, but up 2% sequentially. Excluding notable items, we had year-over-year and sequential declines in all other non-interest income, which is primarily driven by lower foreign exchange trading income. We saw significantly reduced volumes in the first two months of the quarter with a modest pickup in March. Net interest income on an FTE basis, which I'll also discuss in more detail in a few moments, was $544 million, up 40% from a year ago, down 1% sequentially. Our provision for credit losses was $15 million for the first quarter, reflecting growth in the size and duration of the commercial real estate loan portfolio.  Given the increased attention being placed on commercial real estate loans, we want to provide some detail we felt would be of interest. Commercial real estate loans comprise 12% of our total portfolio and commercial office loans comprise 2% of total loans. Approximately 95% of commercial real estate loans are personally guaranteed and approximately 70% have a loan-to-value ratio of less than or equal to 70%. Turning to our asset servicing results on Page 5. Assets under custody and administration for asset servicing clients were $13 trillion at quarter-end, down 9% year-over-year, but up 4% sequentially. Asset servicing fees totaled $603 million, which were also down 9% year-over-year, but up 3% sequentially. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of fees in the business, were $414 million, down 9% year-over-year, but up 2% sequentially. Custody and fund administration fees decreased from prior year quarter, primarily due to unfavorable markets and unfavorable currency translation. The increase sequentially due to favorable markets, favorable currency translation and solid new business activity, particularly later in the quarter. Transactional activity, which comprises approximately 15% of our custody and fund administration fees, was generally weaker due to lower volumes and lower one time fees. Assets under management for asset servicing clients were $962 billion, down 12% year-over-year, but up 7% sequentially. Investment management fees within asset servicing were $126 million, down 14% year-over-year, but up 2% sequentially. Investment management fees decreased from the prior year quarter primarily due to asset outflows and unfavorable markets, partially offset by lower money market fund fee waivers. Investment management fees increased sequentially due to favorable markets and favorable currency translation. Moving to our wealth management business on Page 6. Assets under management for our wealth management clients were $368 billion at quarter-end, down 7% year-over-year, but up 5% on a sequential basis. Trust investment and other servicing fees were $461 million, down 9% compared to the prior year, but up 1% sequentially. Within both the regions and GFO the year-over-year declines were primarily driven by unfavorable market impacts and product level acid outflows partially offset by the elimination of money market fund fee waivers. Sequentially, the increase within the regions and GFO was primarily driven by favorable markets, partially offset by product level asset outflows. The upturn we saw in our AUM occurred later in the quarter was not fully reflected in our trust fees. Importantly, we continue to see modest organic growth in our core advisory fees. Moving to Page 7 in our balance sheet and NII trends. Given the attention being placed on balance sheet trends, we also thought you might be interested in some additional data points this quarter. We think about client liquidity in three categories; deposits, money market funds, and short term treasuries. With that background, we can provide some color and data on what we saw throughout the quarter and through the first few weeks of April. Most importantly, client liquidity was up meaningfully for the quarter in both asset servicing and wealth management. And it's continued to rise during the first three weeks of April. While we saw the kind of deposits for the quarter there was more than offset by increases in money market funds as clients continue to migrate into higher yielding products. Relative to the fourth quarter our money market funds are up $15 billion, or 7%. As mentioned, average deposits were $112 billion down 4% sequentially with wealth management deposits down 7% and institutional down 3%. Approximately three quarters of our average deposits are institutional. Within this segment, approximately 68% are considered operational, the stickiest as clients use these funds to run their ongoing operations. Across the organization, we experienced a $2 billion decline in non-interest bearing deposits as clients shifted to higher yielding alternatives. This reduced the mix of non-interest bearing deposits to 18%. We actively manage our assets and liabilities considering a wide range of possible stress scenarios, including interest rate risks, and how they may affect liquidity and capital. So let's shift to the asset side of the balance sheet to see how investments are allocated. Average cash held at the Fed and other central banks was up 12% to $37 billion. And we had $67 billion of immediately available liquidity reflecting approximately 50% of average earning assets. Loan balances averaged $42 billion and were down 1% sequentially. Our own portfolio is well diversified across geographies, operating segments and loan types. Approximately 75% of the portfolio is floating and the overall duration is less than one year. Securities were down 3% sequentially reflecting the impact of both our repositioning early in the quarter, and the natural run off which we've chosen to reinvest at the short end of the curve. Our $49 billion investment portfolio consists largely of highly liquid U.S. Treasury, agency and sovereign wealth fund bonds. And it's split 50/50 between available for sale and held to maturity. In the aggregate, the securities portfolio has a duration of 2.3 years. The total balance sheet duration is 1.1 year. Net interest income was $544 million for the quarter, up 40% from the prior year and down 1% sequentially. NII reflected the impact of several dynamics many occurring late in the quarter. As mentioned, we saw continued improvement deposits from our balance sheet to money market funds and treasuries. Deposit costs increased with our interest bearing deposit beta during the quarter at 85%. And our cumulative data for the cycle as of March 31 of 65%. And finally, we have the impact from two fewer days in the quarter. Net interest margin was 1.62% in the quarter, up 57 basis points from a year ago and roughly flat with the prior quarter. The sequential results reflect the impact of higher short term market rates offset by higher funding costs. The prior year increases primarily due to higher average interest rates. For the second quarter, our NII will continue to be driven by client demand which is less predictable than it was 90 days ago. Our average client deposits thus far in the quarter are approximately $110 billion and subsequent to tax season, we've observed an incremental typical decline of a few billion dollars. Turning to Page 8. As reported non-interest expenses were $1.3 billion in the first quarter, 7% higher than the prior year but 3% lower sequentially. Excluding charges in both periods is noted on the slide. Expenses in the first quarter were up 6% year-over-year, but flat sequentially. Overall, we're focused on reducing the rate of expense growth and controlling those costs that are most under our control. I'll hit on just a few highlights. Compensation technology expense continued to be the areas of highest spend. Compensation expense excluding charges was up 6% compared to the prior year, and up 7% sequentially. The year-over-year growth largely reflects the annualization of last year's headcount expansion and inflationary wage pressure, partially offset by lower incentives. The sequential increases due to our annual payment of retirement eligible equity incentives in the first quarter. Equipment software, largely reflecting our technology spend was up 20% year-over-year, but up 1% sequentially. More than 50% of our spend is comprised of business driven investment, followed by spending on core infrastructure and modernization and to a lesser extent spending on information security, risk and regulatory areas. Turning to Page 9. Our capital ratios improved in the quarter and continue to be well above our required regulatory minimum. Our common equity tier one ratio under the standardized approach was up 50 basis points from the prior quarter to 11.3% despite resuming common stock repurchases. This reflects 430 basis point buffer above our regulatory requirements. As a reminder, as a category two institution under the Federal Reserve's framework, we already include unrealized losses on our available for sale securities in this calculation. Thus, mark-to-market losses occur immediately in our capital and capital ratios. Our tier one leverage ratio was 7.3% up 20 basis points from the prior quarter. Higher net income, improved accumulated other comprehensive income, the securities repositioning and lower loan balances were the primary factors in this quarters increase in capital ratios. We returned $259 million to common shareholders in the quarter through cash dividends of $159 million and after pausing meaningful share buybacks for the prior five quarters, we've repurchased over $100 million of common stock. And with that, Cynthia, please open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Really great quarter. Thanks for all the detail and the incremental information here. I did just want to understand how you're thinking about managing the balance sheet in an environment where deposits are under pressure, even though it might be modest. I think you indicated that average deposits Q-to-date is around 110, and that's down around 3% from last quarter, I believe. So just wanted to understand how you're thinking about that. Thanks. Michael O\u2019Grady: Sure. The most important thing and you referenced it is that it's just - it's an uncertain environment. And although we've got well over $50 billion in what we refer to as economic liquidity, which is the cash we have on hand at the Fed here and central banks around the world and also the short-term securities we have, so that provides a ton of liquidity, but the environment is just uncertain. And so in some ways, we want to just maintain as much liquidity as possible and not be greedy. And on the other side, the balance sheet is always available for clients particularly from a liquidity perspective. And that means we want to leave plenty of room for clients that either want to deposit with us, or also might need lending from us. And so these uncertain times, just call for maximum patience for us and maximum flexibility, so that we can be available for whatever our clients want. Betsy Graseck : And just as a follow-up to that, could you help us understand how you're thinking about the loan book going forward because to the extent there is demand, it seems like you've got a decent amount of capacity there. Thanks. Michael O\u2019Grady: Sure. Yes, you're right. There\u2019s a \u2013 if you think about this effectively, the securities book at $50 billion acts as the ultimate fulfillment of incompletion mechanism in the balance sheet. We couldn't do all of that with loans, but we certainly have capacity to do a lot more. But it's always going to start from our perspective with maintaining prudent credit quality and approach. And then working, the best thing we can do is work with existing clients on existing types of loans. And so that's why a couple of years ago, you heard us talk about an initiative to do more lending, we did that. That was very largely with existing clients. From here forward, we're not looking to have an any initiatives to dramatically increase the loan book. From our perspective, it's responding to clients as they need in different categories. And - but the turmoil that we're looking at, it does provide opportunities. If you look at the - if you look internally at the opportunities that we have, there's a lot of opportunity. And so we have to be thoughtful about how to grow and with what clients or prospects we want to grow. But this is a period where there are opportunities out there. Betsy Graseck : Thank you. Michael O\u2019Grady: Sure. Thanks, Betsy. Operator : We will take our next question from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Michael O\u2019Grady: Good morning, Alex. Alex Blostein : Good morning. Thank you for the question. So I was hoping we could start with opportunities you guys are seeing in the wealth channel on the back of the dislocation in the banking space. Mike, you mentioned obviously a flurry of activity towards the end of the quarter. So maybe help us frame what that means in terms of maybe revenues. And I guess zooming out a little bit does what has been happening, and I guess continues to happen in the banking world? Does that increase your kind of organic growth prospects and to what extent in the wealth channel? Jason Tyler : Sure, Alex. So as I did mention, there has been a lot of activity. And as we've talked about before, when there's more money in motion, we do have the opportunity to grow a little bit faster. And so we did see that pickup in the first quarter after the back half of last year. We've talked about the fact that there was less activity as a result of the interest rate environment. That said, this is something where the nature of the clients that we serve and that we work with and that we look to bring on Board are pretty meaningful. And so it's a longer-term process. And I would say business building process than what I would call a sales process to do that. I mentioned, some of the momentum that we saw in the upper part of the market above $50 million and the fact that we have a lot of prospects in that area as well. So we see this more as I would say a longer running opportunity rather than a one quarter, two quarter opportunity. And that's how we're approaching it. Alex Blostein : Got it. Great. And then my follow-up just around deposits and talk about this in common. Thanks again, for the extra detail. So, 110, average so far in April, and it sounds like maybe down a little bit more on the back of the tax season where things is tending now. What's the mix, I guess, between interest bearing and non-interest bearing balances as the way you guys see right now in April? And when it comes to the wealth deposits, in particular, sounds like they were down a little bit more than institutional in the quarter. So I guess as you think about a rolling forward, what's their approach to the rate you guys are paying on wealth deposits from here, since it seems like a lot of it is ultimately still sorting into money market funds? Jason Tyler : Sure. So let me give you a couple of incremental data points to work with. One, you're right, we - and it's typical, obviously, as you know well, Alex, for us to see a drop after the peak of tax season. And so it has come down a few in the range of $4 billion or $5 billion since that average relative to that average. And that said, we from a mix perspective, not seeing anything dramatically different early on. And we talked about the fact that the non-interest bearing mix is higher than even if last time rates were up. But as rates flattened out, probably less incremental shift from that mix, and then within wealth in particular, the - Mike mentioned the growth there and you're exactly right and calling out a lot of it going to cash. And I mentioned that there's a lift overall in client liquidity. So of the lift that we've seen in cash, about $5 billion of that was in the wealth channel alone over the quarter. And so and that more than offsets the deposit decline that we saw in that channel. And so you just get a sense that the flows in that business are positive, and give us a sense that there's good activity there. Alex Blostein : Gotcha. Sorry. And just what's the rate on the wealth deposit that you guys are paying right now? Jason Tyler : It's highly dependent. It varies by size, by region, by type. And so it's hard to give a - it's impossible to give a specific number on it. But if you look at the what might be instructive, as you're thinking about it, is more of an overall average cost across the book, which is, call it, 200 to 250 basis points. Michael O\u2019Grady: And Alex, I would just add that there's no question with whatever with everything that's happened here, that the market for deposits is more competitive. So there's more price competition with lots of banks looking to retain or gain deposits, and pricing aggressively to do that. Of course, we have to likewise, price to make them attractive for our clients. But at a certain point, if it's just going to get priced away on price as opposed to relationships, then you're going to see some go away. And just more broadly on deposits, it's just, I think, important to understand the nature of our client base, which well, but just asset owners, asset managers wealth clients, that have different characteristics than a lot of other institutions. Certainly, on the operational side these are deposits that they have as a part of running their operations. And so very sticky in the sense that it's based on transaction flows, rather than necessarily rate per se. And on the other hand these are institutions that are evaluated based on their performance. And so when rates go up as fast as they have here they have to make sure they're earning returns overall. So they're looking to be efficient. And with our wealth clients as well we're working with them to make sure that they get attractive returns overall. So a lot of dynamics at play, and I think it's important understand the characteristics of our client base, relative to others. Alex Blostein : Yes, for sure. And thank you guys, for all the detail. Appreciate it. Jason Tyler : Sure. Thanks Alex. Operator : We'll take our next question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Michael O\u2019Grady: Hi, good morning. Steven Chubak : Good morning. I wanted to start off with a question on the non-comps. Looking at the component pieces you guys made some good progress there. A good amount of the beat was really an outside services. I know that that has a heavy variable or activity link component. Should we expect that to normalize as activity levels pick up consistent with what you saw at the end of March? Just trying to think about what's a reasonable jumping off point for us to be modeling for next quarter? Jason Tyler : Yes. absolutely. You're right. And that line item can move around a lot. So let me give you a short term, and then maybe a longer term dynamic. In the short run, that line item it was impacted by call it two things; one, some timing. So we know that there's some of that improvement will likely come back online in second quarter. And then secondly, we've taken expense actions in that category. And so we've worked really hard to work down consulting, to work down other tech services, sub-custody, negotiating hard on third party advisory fees. And so some of it definitely is related to the expense measures that we talked about broadly related to the productivity office, but there's also some timing there too. And so as you think about second quarter, this is an area where you'll see a meaningful increase, call it $20 million, just quarter-over-quarter going into next year. About $5 million under that is just a movement from on-premise processing that would show up in equipment and software moving up into outside services. But there's also just business growth and timing related there as well. We're obviously not going to see $20 million lifts consistently. But that's one we're likely to see one going into second quarter. Steven Chubak : Got it. And just for my follow up on NII. I know you had alluded to this in some of your commentary. And so I appreciate the additional detail on the deposit side. There's been some debate previously as to whether NII or NIM, had peaked at this juncture, whether it could eclipse level seeing last cycle. I was hoping you could give some perspective just on the NII trajectory, if it's peaked at this juncture, or if there's room for growth, and given the balance sheet repositioning you alluded to in terms of shortening the duration on the asset side, how we should think about the NII trajectory in a Fed easing cycle in particular would be really helpful. Jason Tyler : Sure. So on the first. The reality is even this quarter, you could see there's a new factor introduced into NII which is just client preference. And you can see just how often even this morning on this call, we don't talk about just deposits in isolation. We talk about them in conjunction with money market funds. And a part of that is that culturally, we have an incredibly strong focus just on providing advice to clients across whatever is appropriate for them. And there are advantages to being an in deposits. There are advantages to being in money market funds. There are advantages to being in short term treasuries. And we think about that. We tracked inside the company, that's what we were looking at very, very closely on a very periodic, on a very frequent periodic basis. And so I think that's important for people to understand we're not nudging clients in one direction or the other; just talking to them about the advantages of each. And so the reality is from here NII is going to be based on more than on interest rates. It's going to be based on volumes and volumes last quarter, we were talking about the impact of QT, and we were talking about taxes. Now, this new factor that's been introduced is what is client preference between those three pillars of client liquidity, and we could see that going in either direction. And for us, that's totally fine, as long as we're continuing to grow client liquidity. And so it's hard to model in the short run. But if we think about the traditional factors, Fed rate increases, the institutional business, which is called 70% to 80% of our deposits, we're at about 100% beta there. And that's kind of flattened out. In the wealth channel, the betas are meaningfully lower. They are call it 30% to 40%. And so still with Fed action, because that's all impacted in U.S. dollars, there's benefit from that lift still. And then you've got to introduce the other factors what happens with QT and then what happens with client preference across the pillars. And then from a NIM perspective, just the last comment I'll make is that you saw our leverage ratio is strong, and it's in the mid 7s. And it gives us an opportunity if we want to take advantage if there's a positive carry, to do more leveraging and still maintain great liquidity for our clients. That's helpful to NII. But it's obviously, it brings down NIM. Steven Chubak : Really helpful perspective Jason. Thanks for taking my questions. Jason Tyler : You bet. Thank you, Steven. Operator : We will take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Michael O\u2019Grady: Morning Mike. Mike Mayo : [Mike], you mentioned taking tougher actions on expenses. I think that showed quarter-over-quarter. You mentioned benefits from the industry dislocation. But your expense to fee ratio is still 100, still above your 105% to 110% range quite a bit above. So when do you think you'll get there? Should we look at the quarter-over-quarter progression or should we think about year-over-year, because quarter-over-quarter looks better than year-over-year? Michael O\u2019Grady: Mike, I would say that our perspective is the same in the sense of we're looking I'll call it sequentially and quarter-over-quarter and looking to make improvement in that. And getting they're both on the numerator and the denominator. So holding tight and trying to reduce where we can on the expense side, and then growing the fee side as we go through there. And as you seem if you look at it sequentially there, we kind of bottomed out with the fees in the fourth quarter, and now they're up very, very slightly, but then depending on markets, but then more importantly, how we drive organic growth underneath that. We're looking to increase fees as we go forward on a sequential basis while at the same time having the discipline on the expense side to keep bringing that expense, the trophy ratio down. Operator : We will take our next question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Please go ahead. Jason Tyler : Good morning Glenn. Glenn Schorr : Good morning. Question on the other borrowing side. I think most of that is wholesale funding. And I know it's not a huge number, but it's also grown to be not nothing. It's up 43%. And the rate paid on that is up 450 basis points. So I'm just looking for is that a temporary filling of the gap of the gap down and deposits? How do you think about that line item intermediate term say? I know you got to do what you got to do in the short term? Jason Tyler : Yes. Part of it is the higher bar, but part of it is the entry is doing more in the, I think part of the reason that that the cost of that is elevated is the [thick] is us doing more [thick] repo for clients and just providing more liquidity options for them. And the way the accounting works for that with the netting it just leads to a higher, it makes it look like a higher cost than what it is. And so we're going to talk about whether maybe even break that out separately and provide more detail on the future on it because it's becoming to your exact point, it's just becoming a little bit larger. But that's the reason you see that movement in the short run. Glenn Schorr : Okay. Yes. That'd be helpful. Because then it's actually a distraction for you. Okay. And then maybe, big picture, you talked about capturing client liquidity and you talk about more holistically than you have in the past as money trends to money markets and treasuries. How much of it is it advise versus clients just self selecting in? And are there things that you could that you're tracking to see what you're actually capturing? In other words, is it actually your dollars from deposits going into your money market funds, as opposed to plusses and minuses coming from different directions? Jason Tyler : Yes. Sure. So a couple thoughts. One, we're much more accurate and being able to track the money market fund than we are treasuries. And let me just give an example or two to illustrate why that's the case. We could and we actually did have a small number of very large institutional clients that might say, might have said, a quarter ago, we'd just like to park some money on the balance sheet. We've worked with them on what rate that is. And then they might say for a variety of reasons we want to go to short term treasuries. If they do that they might use if, it's a financial service, that's fine. It could be a hedge fund, it could be an asset manager, if they have a prime broker, they're more likely to use their prime broker to manage that. Is that really us? It's certainly not us losing a lot of net interest income because the pricing on the deposit is going to be really tight, but difficult for us to track and really confirm where that's going. The other end of the spectrum is in wealth management financial advisors are literally calling their clients and saying rates are higher. You're sitting on $750,000 in cash. Let's talk about what you'd like to do with that. Would you like to move that into a money market fund? Would you like to move it into a CD? Would you like to start building out and ladder a treasury portfolio? We can track that much more accurately. And so different components but in general, the statistics that we gave are biased toward the information that we can track and that we know stayed in house. And so if there's an information bias, it's toward us ensuring that the numbers we're telling you are reflective of what stayed here. Glenn Schorr : Okay, appreciate that. Thank you. Michael O\u2019Grady: Sure. Operator : We will take our next question from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Jason Tyler : Good morning Brian. Brian Bedell : Good morning. Maybe a major thing on, my first question, just to stay on the deposit trends. And the question would be as you think about that deposit pricing strategy in the wealth channels, specifically. How do you view raising those deposit rates versus the alternatives? I guess at what point would you be inclined to just let the deposits go into the money funds were into the ladders, or rather, you would raise rates incrementally to sort of keep those wealth deposits on the balance sheet? Michael O\u2019Grady: Sure. So in each of the businesses there are pricing groups that set an overall rate. But there are also leaders within the regions and then down to relationship managers that have the ability to work at individual client levels to do what's right. And so we're always thinking about what is our overall pricing relative to peers, by geographical region within wealth management even. But then there are times when they're very large clients that might come with $50 million, $100 million, $250 million. And that's obviously not going to be priced off of a rate sheet. We're going to talk about that and the overall bias, and we're having conversations with clients, again, when we're talking about what to do. And if they're going to keep a deposit, looking at us versus competition, that just keep it on our platform. And so even though, we've thrown out the beta in that 30% to 40% range, and that may seem like it's we're looking at where the market is and making sure that the balance sheet again is available, and making sure that we're not cannibalizing the whole base of deposits in order to pick up some volume. But obviously, we've talked about it from the beginning, our strategic bias in wealth for deposits is keep the business on our platform. Brian Bedell : Right. That's great color. And then maybe just going back to maybe an early comment that you made mike on the picking up of business, given the banking stress that we seen in March. I think you mentioned a billion of inflows on the wealth platform, but that it was a longer term dynamic. Maybe if you could just sort of describe what you're seeing internally in terms of, I guess thinking about, I guess, maybe the panic environment where clients, were moving assets quickly going to a strong provider like Northern. Are we sort of past that phase? And then what is that next phase of getting those clients because of the dislocation? I guess, what's the sort of either the sales pitch in as we move to the next couple quarters in that dynamic? Michael O\u2019Grady: So Brian, I would start by saying that the way you characterize the first phase, kind of the panic phase is, although we did have caught like, a strong week of inflows around that time period, it really wasn't a panic environment where I people were pushing deposits over the counter so to speak. I think there were different dynamics at play relative to other time periods. And that's why I say what we're seeing is more kind of the longer play out in this I think clients and prospects thinking about who their long term financial partner is, and ensuring that it's somebody that they're comfortable is going to be there and has the strength and stability. And so that's why I say it's less of a blip and more of a long term, I call it trend is the way that we would see it. And for us, without a doubt, it is playing off of our brands. It's playing off of the 130 year history of being around and being a strong partner. That, as you know, has been consistent for a long time. In certain environments, it plays better than others. We think this is an environment going forward where it plays very well. Brian Bedell : Great color. Thank you. Michael O\u2019Grady: Sure. Operator : We will take our next question from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Jason Tyler : Hey Ken. Ken Usdin : Hey, everyone. Thanks. Coming back on the expense question. I know you talked about moving, the trustees ratio is positive from here. The 6% adjusted cost growth rate is the best we've seen in like six or seven quarters. I'm just wondering, just philosophically, are you thinking about managing more towards absolute levels of costs? And is there a way to help us think about like how you're thinking? I know, it's tough to generate operating leverage in this type of environment just given what's happened and what you've walked through. But what's the right way to just think about absolute cost growth and how you're managing that on its own in this environment? Jason Tyler : Sure. It's good to take a step back on this because it is how we've been talking about it internally recently. And one way to frame this Ken is, if you think back to charges, I'm going to because that's just the way we were not ignoring the charges. But the way we've talked about them internally, X charges, we had 9% expense growth last year. And then we don't, that's not acceptable for us. And so we've got to bend that curve aggressively. We know we're carrying part of that forward with what we know about the impact of hiring and merit increase and off cycle adjustments given the labor environment last year. But that said, we're targeting getting two points out of last year's growth rate for the full year of 2023. And in general all the expense areas are going to be addressed collectively to get to that 7% or better expense growth rate. And so you look at a couple of couple that are notable, because they've got big movements to them. One, look at comp and that look good for first quarter. You look into second quarter, we know there's about $40 million coming out, because of the seasonality of the retirement eligible grants and some other dynamics there. But we also know we've got $20 million in merit coming online in second quarter. The incentive accrual is also in that line. And that varies is profitability. And then from there, everything else is going to be driven by what happens in business from hiring and other actions and expense measures and things like that. And then we talked about outside services and how that's got a big step up next quarter. And then maybe the last one, I'll highlight equipment software, even though we've got that move from equipment software into outside services. We've got clear visibility on some incremental depreciation coming online, maybe not in second quarter, but in third. And so you can see a $5 million step up in that line item in second quarter, but then we know we've got $10 million in depreciation coming in third quarter. So those are the big pieces at a super high level and then as well, a couple of the big moves underneath it. Ken Usdin : That's super helpful. And within that seven or better, do you have an, is there an embedded impact on FX currency translation does there? Michael O\u2019Grady: No, not from here. I mean we know we had a lift in this quarter, just an elevation of lift on both revenue expense. So it hurt on the expense side, but not really modeling significant change from here. Ken Usdin : Okay, and if I guess one more kind of bring it all together question. You talked about a lot of balance sheet changes happening towards the end of the quarter. You talked about where deposits are. We can see where the beta is went to do you have a way to help us understand just what range of expectations of what of what you think NI can do in 2Q versus 1Q to help us put that all together? Jason Tyler : We've been given a lot of information. I would hope to give you a really good answer on this one. But I think we got to leave it with where the deposit levels are, where the balances have been, where the deposit levels are. And then it look from there on, there's just so many factors moving around and particularly just client preference, and you were being so emphatic and saying we're not going to try to nudge in any direction just provide good advice there. So it's hard to bind it. I have to say the big factors that we see from here, with volumes being down so far, it's hard, I'm hard pressed to see how we match the 544 of second quarter. And so I am going to say down, but not do too much more than that to give an anticipation just given the volatility in the market about client preference and where deposits are going. Ken Usdin : Okay, that's fair. Totally understood. Thanks, Jason. Jason Tyler : Sure. Thank you, Ken. Operator : We will take our next question from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Please go ahead. Jason Tyler : Hey Jim, good morning. Jim Mitchell : Good morning. Just maybe on the on the buyback any thoughts on with your leverage ratios improving but you did also talk about maybe using some leverage. So how do we think about your thoughts on the buyback from here was a nice uptick from what you've been doing the last five quarters? Michael O\u2019Grady: It was good. And there's no reason we can't continue to be in the market with a couple things working in our favor. One, if we've got good return on equity in this event, it's something like we picked up 35-40 basis points from that income. You give up, maybe half of that in dividends. But we also know that we're getting a lift from over time, the AOCI is going to pull the par and that gives a lift. I think it's also noteworthy the balance sheet repositioning we did. That was a creative to CET1 because it helped reduce our WA. And so those things helped. And so if you think about those dynamics of what is return on equity, where are we from a dividend payout ratio perspective, and then the pulling apart AFCI in general, it gives us some room to buy back stock, while at the same time increasing CET1 to be at levels that are more consistent with if you look at our long term history, we're still a little bit lower than where we were. And you we're always looking at where our peers and where's the where's the competition and making sure we have good buffers, but that's how we're thinking about it nowadays. I'll tell you we do look, every day where we know the impact of rates on AOCI. And so that's a factor you can you should imagine we're thinking about intra quarter. Jim Mitchell : Okay, that's fair. And then maybe just maybe a bigger picture. We've talked a lot about on the fee side. You've had you had good flows at the end of the quarter and two money market funds, which is one of your higher fee rate products. You're talking about perhaps increased flows in the wealth side. How do we think in you had a move in the markets? How do we think about total fee income any puts and takes to think about as we go forward into the next quarter and beyond? Michael O\u2019Grady: Yes. We've talked about the we get a good sense of where we are at the end of the quarter relative to the averages. And so it gives us the launch point, frankly, is positive relative to where we are. And you're right that the money market funds in general, that's an attractive fee business for us. And so all those things playing in our favor, but we also know markets have a really big impact and then also as much as we talk about organic growth in the business. What happens with markets in the short run is often the bigger driver. The last thing I'll mention is that an asset servicing in particular, that pipeline in the short run of one not funded one not onboarded is still above historical levels. And so the short run, it looks positive. We have less visibility out late in the year, but the asset servicing side still is also attractive relative to history. And we gave you even more information, I think, on the wealth management side of the business. Jim Mitchell : Okay, yes. Thanks. Jason Tyler : Sure. Operator : We will take our next question from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Jason Tyler : Good morning Brennan. Brennan Hawken : Hey good morning Jason. Thanks for taking my questions. Just want to try and make sure I understand something on expenses. You had spoken to getting below 7% expense growth. And I believe that was on a number that was X one timers. Do I understand that right? And what is that based on 2022 if we back out the one time was just so I can kind of fully level set and understand how we'd be really thinking about that? Jason Tyler : Yes. Think about it as 4893 to be very, very specific. Brennan Hawken : That certainly is. Thank you. Sure. So one more just clarifying. You had chatted about how there's some noise in that other financing line that we most usually think about as wholesale. So with deposits coming down, I would think that you'd be probably building out the wholesale, at least in the near term given the quarter date decline in the balances. Is that operating assumption fair, and then if we were to strip out some of that fixed financing line what is that core cost to your wholesale just so we can model it appropriately when we're thinking about truing up for the sum of the quarter to date trends you flagged. Thanks. Michael O\u2019Grady: Yes. And in general, it's going to depend on where we go in the market and how we in and what sources of wholesale funding that we use. And so it's FHLB and sometimes we're doing other sources. But in general, it's been in the mid fours this past quarter. And going forward, I think it's just, it's obviously going to be impacted by rates and where and what happens with the Fed. And so but I think the fact that we've gotten two questions this time means we'll probably in the future, try and give you guys a little bit more information on the impact of FICC repo, and how that's impacting the borrowing costs. And there's also impact on the asset side to be fair, as well. So we'll provide some more information on it. Brennan Hawken : Right, thanks. That'd be really helpful. I'd love to just do this. This is a little bit of a ticky tacky, but I'd love to just do one more on expenses, if you don't mind. You spoke to $20 million pickup, quarter-to-quarter it seemed like on non comp, but five of that was just like one going from one bucket to another. So does that mean it's like $15 million quarter-over-quarter or is that mean that $20 million is the total step up, we should think about for non-comp and then underneath the surface of that there's $5 million moving from one bucket to another, just if you could clarify that that be helpful. Michael O\u2019Grady: Yes. I am going to, there's a couple areas where I mentioned 5s and 10s. So let me I'm going to be a little bit repetitive forgive me, but it'll make sure that I was 100% clear on them. Because there's a couple of different areas that you might have been referencing. On comp no movements between buckets. We're thinking take first quarter, reduce it by 40 million for the retirement eligible and some other and some other factors that play into the incentive line. And then add 20 for merit increase. That gives you a decent starting point to say, okay, what's going to happen with the business going forward. Second dynamic that I mentioned does have movement between line items. It's movement between outside services and equipment software. And there's about a $5 million move. That's going to happen second quarter, from equipment and software into outside services. Outside services should be about $20 million higher than first quarter. That $20 million includes the $5 million from equipment and software. On equipment software, still think that line item is going to be up a few million dollars in second quarter. Brennan Hawken : Thanks for walking through that. Michael O\u2019Grady: You bet. Operator : We will take our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. Michael O\u2019Grady: Good morning, Gerard. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning, everyone. This is Thomas Letty calling on behalf of Gerard. Circling back a bit on the fee side and following up a bit on Alex's question earlier. Can you give us some color on the competitive landscape you saw this quarter and any organic growth opportunities you see, as we look further into 2023, on the institutional side. You guys give some good color on the wealth side, but just on the institutional side, any additional color there? Michael O\u2019Grady: Yes Tom. The additional color I give you there is that certainly highly competitive, but there are quite a few opportunities that are out there. So active market, and I would say a lot of what's driving it is with the impact on the markets last year equity markets being down 19%, 20% that put a lot of pressure on asset managers. And as a result, having them look at their operating models, how they can become more efficient, and looking to either outsource activities and or consolidate providers. And so that has increased again the level of opportunities in the marketplace and can cut both ways. I mean situations where they were advantaged, but other situations where I'll say we're more on the defensive because it's an existing client or one of two being an existing client. So very active at this point and obviously trying to win more than our share. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. That's helpful. And then just lastly, high level can you detail for us what an ideal environment would look like for you guys in terms of an interest rate and global markets perspective? Michael O\u2019Grady: Yes. It's interesting. I think Gerard actually might have asked that exact question a few weeks ago, which seems like quarters ago. And my thought on that is that first of all the trajectory, the slope of the curve matters a ton. And having a somewhat steeper yield curve matters a lot. And secondly, you want rates to be above very low. And so when rates are, if I call it 50 days, when Fed funds rates are below 50 basis points or below, it's hard, it's just hard for us to get good return on equity. And we start to play in the fee waiver land, which just is not, it's not that we lose money in money market funds, but that whole business, the economics of it change a lot. But then, lastly, the pace with which you get to any environment matters a lot. And that's why a lot of banks who struggle this time. It's not the yo curve, it's the pace of change. And you'll literally 12 months ago, today, and Fed moving this aggressively in a relatively short period of time, it just creates a, it's very tough to deal with pace. So those would be, those are the three dynamics that are forefront of mind from our lens. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thank you. That's helpful. And thank you guys for taking the questions. Michael O\u2019Grady: You bet. Operator : We will take our next question from Vivek Juneja with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Vivek Juneja : Thank you. Hi, Jason. Hi, Mike. A couple of questions. One is the headcount cuts the severance that you've took in the fourth quarter, have we seen that flow through yet, in terms of the numbers? Michael O\u2019Grady: So we have actually gotten a pretty good head start on those but very little impact already in the numbers. It happened later in the quarter and there's the areas of the business where they happen. We just haven't seen them play through very much yet. Some impact, but light. Vivek Juneja : So in those numbers that you gave us should there be some benefit from that coming through Jason in Q2 or not or 3Q. Any color on that? Jason Tyler : Yes. all along I think we said we think the meaningful impact should be visible by third  quarter. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Michael O\u2019Grady: And then again, remember that, remember, also that we've said this is about getting jobs into the right places. And so in many instances, this is about transitioning jobs from lower costs, from higher cost locations to lower cost locations. And so we'll see some benefit, but it's not the impact of taking the roles that we're exiting times the average cost, there's some exit in some instances. Again, I think just super instructive to focus on what we mentioned earlier, we're thinking about the our target is to try and get that overall expense growth rate into the right level. And we're thinking about all of these different expense categories in aggregate to get there. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Shifting gears completely different one. You talked about the diversity want to separate from that your other borrowings went up from about $3.5 billion a year ago, $8 billion last quarter to now over $11 billion. It doesn't seem like you're making much of a spread on that. Any color on how we should think about that and what's driving that increase? Jason Tyler : Yes. That's also where the FICC repo activity is going to be reflected. But -- Vivek Juneja : I see not just in the repo line, but in on top of that, and the other borrowing line, is it? Jason Tyler : I think in the other borrowingsind you also have some of the Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings, which, during this time period, we term some of those out, which previously was more all overnight and just in this time period, with the uncertainty wanted to add additional liquidity to the balance sheet. Speaker: There was about $3.5 billion in that increase FHLB line item. That's the [indiscernible] that's sequentially not year-over-year. Vivek Juneja : Right. And you're done with Michael, are you still looking to leave some do more there? Michael O\u2019Grady: No, we will, as opportunities come up for us, we're still contemplating it, not necessarily done, I mean, as you know, the spreads not, it's not extremely high there. So there's a combination of liquidity management but also the spread that's available. But moving that from 76 to 114 is a big move. There's also one other dynamic in that line item which is that there was some Euro investment leveraging that had been opt in the non-U.S. Office interest bearing line that has been reclassed into other borrowing. And so that's a little over billion dollars and so it is just another dynamic to the increase that you see there. but back to, we have got capacity for leveraging and we will continue to think about where to use it. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Thank you. Michael O\u2019Grady: Sure. Operator : That will conclude today's question-and-answer session. Ms. Childe I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. Jennifer Childe : Thank you Cynthia and thanks everyone for joining us this morning.

During today's question-and-answer session, please limit your initial query to one question and one related follow-up. This will allow us to move through the queue and enable as many people as possible the opportunity to ask questions as time permits. Thank you again for joining us today. Let me turn the call over to Mike O'Grady. Mike O'Grady: Thank you, Jennifer. Let me join and welcome you to our second quarter 2023 earnings call. Our results for the second quarter reflect solid sequential performance. Trust fees and assets under custody and management increased sequentially, which included positive organic growth in each business. Net interest income was down modestly on a linked quarter basis, reflecting higher funding costs associated with the highly competitive deposit backdrop. Expenses excluding the neutral items are well controlled, reflecting the rigor of our cost discipline, as well as the impact of various productivity initiatives. We reported $64 million in charges in the second quarter associated with these steps. Our wealth management business modestly grew assets under custody and management and trust fees on a sequential basis. We continue to see strength in the higher wealth tiers and within our global family office segment, where we captured several marquee wins. Our industry leadership position also stood out in the quarter. We held our third annual Northern Trust wealth planning symposium, bringing together legal and financial experts to share innovative strategies and insights to shape the future of wealth management. Sessions averaged more than 1000 participants and included attendees from North and South America, Europe, Asia, Africa and the Middle East. We also released the second family office Trends Report co-authored with the Wharton School. Notably, we received a utility patent for cloud based goals driven Wealth Management Technology during the quarter, and we're named best digital Innovator of the Year and Best Private Bank for Digital Wealth Planning by the Financial Times Group. In asset management, we saw strong flows into our institutional money market platform in every captured share. We also won a number of key mandates across products including outsourced investment solutions, tax advantaged equity, and quant active. Our new product launches in the quarter focused on alternatives. Within asset servicing, we continue to have good momentum in core custody and fund administration, particularly with asset managers in Europe and our pipeline remains robust. In the U.K., we are reappointed by Brightwell for middle office services. Brightwell is the primary service provider to British Telecom pension scheme, which has more than 50 billion in assets under management. Among asset owners, we clinched several key multimillion dollar takeaway wins in North America, where our front office solutions, which provides a comprehensive view across public and private assets was cited as a key differentiator. As a testament to our capabilities we are recently awarded three prestigious industry awards, including Best Global custodian for asset owners by Asian Investor. In the second quarter, we launched A-Suite, content community and Collaboration Hub for global asset owners. Within the first few weeks of launch, we've seen significant client engagement. Going forward, we expect this new communications channel to create relationships with key target audiences and further showcase our expertise in the market. In closing, our balance sheet continues to be very strong with ample capital and liquidity. Our new business momentum is gathering steam and our pipeline remains robust. While there's still more work to be done, we're making solid progress following the trajectory of our expense growth. Rationalizing our cost base remains a top priority and the governance and control mechanisms we're putting in place today should drive sustainable improvements for both the near term and for years to come. We head into the second half of the year well positioned to support our clients and generate value for all of our stakeholders. I'll now turn the call over to Jason. Jason Tyler : Thank you, Mike. And let me join Jennifer and Mike in welcoming you to our second quarter 2023 earnings call. Let's dive into the financial results for the quarter starting on page four. This morning, we reported second quarter net income of $332 million earnings per share of $1.56 and our return on average common equity was 12.4%. Currency movements had an immaterial impact on our revenue and expense growth in both periods. Our second quarter results were impacted by two notable items. We recognized a $38.7 million pretax severance charge impacting both our compensation and outside services line items. We recorded a $25.6 million pretax charge associated with the write-off and an COVID investment and a client capability. Notable items from previous periods are listed on the slide. Excluding notable items in all periods, revenue was up 1% on a sequential quarter basis and down 1% over the prior year. Expenses were down 1% on a sequential quarter basis and up 5% over the prior year. This reflects an expense to trust fee ratio of 116% down from 120% in the first quarter, and 122% in the fourth quarter of last year. Pretax income was up 13% sequentially, but down 9% over the prior year. Trust investment and other servicing fees, representing the largest component of our revenue totaled $1.1 billion, which reflected a 3% sequential increase, but a 4% decrease as compared to last year. All other noninterest income was flat sequentially, but down 10% over the prior year. Net interest income on a FTE basis which I'll discuss in more detail in a few moments was $525 million, down 4% sequentially, but up 12% from a year ago. We had a $15 million credit reserve release in the second quarter due to improved credit quality on a small number of larger loans, which is offset in part by expectations for higher future economic stress and the commercial real estate market. Turning to our asset servicing results on page five. Assets under custody and administration for asset servicing clients were $13.5 trillion at quarter end, up 2% sequentially, and up 5% year-over-year. Asset servicing fees totaled $621 million, which are up 3% sequentially, but down 3% year-over-year. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of fees in the business were $427 million, up 3% sequentially, but down 1% year-over-year. Custody and fund administration fees increased on a linked quarter basis for the second consecutive quarter due to solid new business activity, higher transaction activity and favorable markets. They decreased from the prior year quarter primarily due to unfavorable markets. Assets under management for asset servicing clients were $990 billion, up 3% sequentially and up 4% year-over-year. Investment management fees with asset servicing are $134 million, up 6% sequentially, but down 10% year-over-year. Investment management fees increased sequentially, primarily due to asset inflows and favorable markets. They decreased from their prior year quarter primarily due to asset outflows and unfavorable markets. Moving to our wealth management business on page six, assets under management for our wealth management clients were $376 billion at quarter end up 2% sequentially, and up 7% year-over-year. Trust investment and other servicing fees were $475 million, up 3% sequentially, but down 5% compared to the prior year. Sequentially the increase in fees in the regions was driven primarily by favorable markets. Sequentially the increase in GFO fees was driven by net inflows. Relative to the prior year, the decrease in fees in the regions was primarily due to unfavorable markets and product-related asset outflows. Within GFO, the decrease in fees was due largely to unfavorable markets. Moving to page seven, our balance sheet and NII trends. Our average balance sheet decreased 1% on a linked quarter basis, primarily due to lower client deposits partially offset by higher leveraging activity. Earning assets averaged $134 billion in the quarter down to 1% sequentially and down 4% versus the prior year. Money market assets primarily absorbed the decrease. Client liquidity continued to grow during the second quarter. While we saw a decline in average deposits was more than offset by increases in other categories. Relative to the first quarter, our money market funds were up $8 billion or 6% and our CDs were up 29%. Average deposits were $106 billion down $6.6 billion or 6% sequentially but remained consistent with late April levels. We experienced a $2.6 billion sequential decline in noninterest-bearing deposits mostly within the institutional channel as clients continued to shift to higher yielding alternatives. This reduced the mix of noninterest-bearing deposits to 17%. At quarter end operational deposits comprised approximately two thirds of institutional deposits. These tend to be the stickiest deposits, as clients use them to operate their businesses. Approximately three quarters of our average deposits are institutional, with the remainder related to wealth clients including GFO. Shifting to the asset side of the balance sheet, average securities were down 2% sequentially, reflecting the natural runoff which was seen to reinvest at the short end of the curve. Our $50 billion investment portfolio consists largely of highly liquid U.S. Treasury agency and sovereign wealth fund bonds and it's split approximately evenly between available for sale and held to maturity. The duration of securities portfolio continued to edge down in the second quarter to 2.1 years. The total balance sheet duration is now less than a year. Loan balances averaged $42 billion and were up 1% sequentially. Our loan portfolio is well diversified across geographies, operating segments and loan types, approximately 75% of the portfolio is floating and the overall duration is less than one year. Our liquidity remains strong with cash held at the Fed and other central banks up 9% to $43 billion. More than 45% of our overall balance sheet is comprised of cash, money market assets, and available for sale securities. This translates to $73 billion of immediately available liquidity of more than 60% of the total deposit base. Net interest income on an FTE basis was $525 million for the quarter down 4% sequentially, but up 12% from the prior year. NII reflected the impact of several dynamics. We saw continued client migration out of deposits and into higher yielding alternatives. Noninterest-bearing deposits as a percentage of total deposits slid to 17%. And deposit costs increased with our interest-bearing deposit beta during the quarter reaching 88% and our cumulative beta for the cycle at 68%. The net interest margin on an FTE basis was 1.57% for the quarter down 5 basis points sequentially, but up 22 basis points from a year ago. The sequential decline reflects the impact of higher funding costs partially offset by higher short-term market rates. Our NII in the third quarter will continue to be driven by client behavior which has been less predictable given the speed and velocity of the cycles rate hikes. Our average client deposits thus far in the quarter are approximately $106 billion. Deposit outflows are expected to continue in part due to seasonality as August is typically our low point in the year as European activity slows materially. The pace of the outflows is expected to moderate. Turning to page eight. As reported, noninterest expenses were $1.3 billion in the second quarter 4% higher sequentially and 9% higher than the prior year. Excluding charges in both periods is noted on the slide. Expenses in the second quarter were down 1% sequentially, but up 5% year-over-year. I'll hit on just a few highlights. Compensation and technology expense continued to be the areas of highest spend. Compensation expense excluding severance charges was down 5% sequentially but up 4% compared to the prior year, was down sequentially due to the payment of our annual retirement eligible incentives in the first quarter. This is partially offset by the impact of this year's base pay adjustments, which are granted in the second quarter. The year-over-year growth in compensation expense largely reflects the impact from inflationary wage pressures, and last year's employee expansion, partially offset by lower incentives. Excluding charges, non-compensation expense was up 3% sequentially. The primary driver of the increase was growth in the outside services line which is up 9% sequentially. The increase is largely due to timing, as we reported a sequential decline in outside services of 9% in the first quarter, due to delays in technical services projects. We have heightened focus on expense control, we expect our operating expenses to grow more modestly, and our expense to trustee ratio to show further improvement. Turning to page nine. Our capital ratios remain strong in the quarter we continue to be well above our required regulatory minimums. Our common equity Tier-1 ratio under standardized approach was flat to the prior quarter at 11.3% despite continued common stock repurchases. This reflects a 430 basis point buffer above regulatory requirements. Our Tier-1 leverage ratio is 7.4% up slightly from the prior quarter. We returned $257 million to common shareholders in the quarter through cash dividends of $158 million and common stock repurchases of $99 million. And with that, Jenny, please open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And I do have a question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Sharon Leung : Hi, good morning. This is actually Sharon Leung coming in for Steven. Just a question on deposit betas. They came in a little bit better than expected this quarter. Can you help us understand how to think about the incremental betas from here? Jason Tyler : Sure. So betas have continued to increase and from here, I think we still have to separate the institutional client base from the wealth client base. We noted that we're cumulatively across the platform within this quarter in the high 80% range. The institutional channel is likely going to be at 100 at this point. The wealth channel still provides some benefit that there's the betas there are a lot lower. But at this point, we're seeing about 100% in the institutional channel, and still much less than that. And well, both of those trends seem to be continuing as we've seen early signs in the in the quarter. Sharon Leung : Great. And then as a follow up, you noted you're out about 17% noninterest-bearing deposits today. I think you had cost closer to about 15% in the \u201904, \u201906 cycle. Can you help us think through where that potentially goes from here and once that starts to normalize where you see NII exiting the year? Jason Tyler : Well, like you we have looked back a lot where it's troughed. And the data we have showed it a little higher than the 15%. You mentioned, I think it's 16%. But I don't think about that as a floor. There's nothing structural in the base to consider that a floor. Now that said, it has been moderating significantly. And we haven't seen much movement at this point. Obviously, there's a step down this quarter of another percentage point, but it seems to be leveling off at this point. Operator : Next question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Alex Blostein : So a couple of questions around expense trends. I guess, one, a little bit more near term. You guys announced some action, obviously, over the course of the quarter, there's a severance charge. So maybe help us quantify what it means in terms of savings and your just updated views on the overall sort of firm-wide expense growth for the year, I guess excluding the charges occurred in the second quarter. I think last time you talked about bringing that down to below 7%, but maybe an update there would be helpful. And then a bigger picture question. You guys are running at a kind of high 20-ish percent pretax margin that used to be north of 30%. So as you kind of think about the fee environment getting a little bit better with the market, but NII has clearly peaked, as we talked about before. Is there an opportunity to get back to that 30% plus? And how do you see sort of achieving that, if that's the goal? And what's the time frame around that? Jason Tyler : Sure. So let me tackle the expense. The compensation related first. First, I'm sure people are curious, where is the base from here. So let me just provide some background on kind of first quarter to second quarter, second quarter to third quarter. I think from here, we'd say flat to down from second quarter ex the severance charge in the compensation line. So if I go back to last quarter, we explained that the significant movements for second quarter would be the $40 million seasonal decline in equity awards and then the $20 million increase in the base pay coming online. That would have put comp at about 575 for the quarter. And obviously, ex the charge, we ended up about $8 million better than that, including currency. So two factors led to that. First, we pulled a lot of levers in the quarter to flatten compensation, including accelerating and close to completing the actions that we launched in fourth quarter of last year. So in January, we communicated that the projected reduction by late '23 would be about 300 roles. And about $5 million to $7 million in quarterly comp benefit net of reinvestments. So we got a portion of that work done in the first quarter, and we mostly finished it in second quarter and that was a big part of the reason it put us ahead of schedule. Second, as we saw the timing of that first program, accelerating and coming to completion, we launched a new effort during the second quarter, specifically related to what you referenced, Alex, and the severance charge that we announced this morning. We've already gotten some benefit of that within the quarter, and that's reflected in the results. So overall, this new program, to your question, should impact about an incremental 600 roles many of that will be backfilled based on a lens of skills or geography, but same goal, we should be able to get $5 million to $7 million a quarter in run rate savings and a portion of that got embedded in the second quarter. So we've got to remember that we did pull lever hard this quarter, so there's some hiring that's in the queue, but we also pushed a fair amount back. And so that's why with various puts and starts, it's good to think about a flat to down from the comp levels you see in second quarter ex charges going into third quarter. So that's hopefully helpful background there. To get to your questions for the rest of the year, where do we see expenses? At a high level, we've taken about a point out of the curve for the year based on the trajectory that we're on. To your point, if you take out the notable items, this year on a -- each quarter has been under 6, and we think we've taken that point out of the curve at this point and that should continue through the rest of the year. To margins, you're right that we've been in the 30s and now in the 20s. Our target has us one of our key performance indicators is for us to be in the 30s. And no way have we lost sight on that. That is where we're trying to get. That gets impacted largely by what's going to happen in our minds, we can control the expense side. And obviously, we're doing a lot of work there. And we're also getting good benefit because we saw good organic growth in the quarter. And so both levers are working in the right way, but we have definitely not changed our target of being in the 30s from a margin perspective. Alex Blostein : Got it. Thanks. Super comprehensive. Just a quick follow-up around deposits. So good news, you guys were kind of in line with what you updated us on around 105. Sounds like deposits are fairly stable. I think you said 106 right now with a kind of similar noninterest-bearing mix as we saw over the course of the quarter. Can you help just frame the seasonal deposit outflows and any other kind of client conversations you're hearing that could give us a sense where deposits could ultimately trough in the cycle. It sounds like there's a little bit more to go, but just curious to hear what the endpoint might be? Jason Tyler : Yes, you heard right. It's held in quite well so far in July. And we didn't -- June, you see the end of the quarter and there's a spike there. But in general, June and July have been at about this level and have been holding in well. Our client activity is good. We've taken action here to make sure we're talking to clients aggressively and telling them we want to continue providing good liquidity services for them, whether it's lending or holding on to their deposits. We talked last quarter about the fact that we think about liquidity broadly. It's about client liquidity. And it was good to see money market funds up this quarter. That adds to margins really well, too. And even as we think about what clients are holding in brokerage. And so all of the client liquidity seems to be holding in well. On the seasonality dynamic, August is a low point but it's not -- it doesn't go dramatically. We've looked back several years. And so we're feeling that deposits at these levels seems to be holding in okay. So I can even give a little bit of thought from our perspective at this point, based on our outlook. I think it's prudent to think about another decline, even though deposits are holding in pretty well, but we see the competition. And so I think it's prudent to think about another NII decline of about 5% for the quarter. Again, June and July volumes have held in at about $100 billion to $110 billion, but we just have to be conscious of the competitive environment and what the summer tends to hold in terms of volume pressure. Operator : Our next question is going to come from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Maybe just to go back to expenses. I appreciate the color you gave, Jason. Normally start to talk about the seasonal lift that you typically get in the second half in things like equipment and software and outside services. I wonder if you want to comment on any projection there? Jason Tyler : Sure. Well, it's good to call it out. I think in equipment and software, in particular, we were better than what we thought we were going to be, but that was really two factors led to that. One, we did have some delays in projects coming from WIP into being depreciated. Those will come online, so that's more timing. And then secondly, we've been working very aggressively as far as the productivity office to just negotiate on and then try and push inflation down, and we had some good results there, bringing costs down. And so from here, we think third quarter up $5 million to $10 million in that line item. Fourth quarter, we can even tell because some of it's baked an additional $5 million to $10 million lift from that perspective and outside services, no update to make there. Brian Bedell : Okay. Great. And then, Mike, you started off the call talking about the new business wins in asset servicing and wealth management. I guess how should we think about that contributing to organic revenue growth? Maybe just broadly, if we're in a, say, flattish market situation. Would you expect this to have a positive impact in the next couple of quarters and going to '24 on revenue? Mile O'Grady: Yes, Brian. So the answer is yes. And to your point, we only consider it organic growth once it's transitioned and in. And yet we know the pipeline of business or mandates that we've won that have not transitioned in yet. And in each of the businesses, it's a little bit different. There's more of, I'll call it, forward pipeline with asset servicing, but the pipeline looks very good based on recent activity that I mentioned there. Within Wealth Management. There's not as much of a forward pipeline, if you will, but similarly there, I would say very steady, steady activity. And as much as anything with wealth management, keeping in mind that this -- I'll say, company, but also that business has been built on doing what's right for the client. And sometimes, that results in different financial implications for the company, but over time is best for the company and the shareholders. And my point being the discussion around deposits and money market funds and treasuries and managing things like that. They all have different implications for us, but the client activity has been very good. And we're, I would say, optimistic about how some of the shifts with rates will have implications on where those funds get redeployed. So again, positive on the wealth management front in a steady fashion. And then Asset Management, as Jason mentioned, we've seen strong flows into the money market platform there. but that also in some other areas as well. And likewise, I like to see those get redeployed in other ways over time. So good across the board. Brian Bedell : Is it fair to say that revenue growth on the fee side is definitely better than the NII side for the organic growth equation at least now. Mike O'Grady: Yes. No, that's right, Brian. And I view it as you're kind of implying there. On the fee side, it tends to kind of grind up more gradually subject to the markets and NII can be more volatile. And the only other area I would just highlight is around our capital markets activity, FX and brokerage and trading there, which has been relatively subdued during this time period with lower volatilities, lower activity, which that can also change and that has different implications to just meaning those can be more profitable. Operator : [Indiscernible] from Wells Fargo. Unidentified Analyst : I guess the first question is on fee growth kind of more broadly. You sort of indicated that you're the 5% expense growth rate. Does that go down? But do the fees -- where do you see fees growing to get up to that expense level so that you could grow fees faster than expenses? Jason Tyler : Well, I mean, in the short run, I don't think we're still absorbing an inflationary environment from an expense perspective. And so would like to be able to do better even than what we're doing right now in the long run from an expense growth perspective. On the revenue side, as you know, the financial model enables us to have lift from 2 different areas. One is the market left, and that's tended to provide low single-digit growth rates, but it's a very strong component of the financial model. And then, secondly, the organic growth. And if we can have low single-digit growth in wealth management organically and then mid-single-digit growth in asset servicing, that provides a good model for us to get well above the expense rates that we think we can lead to in the long run and provide good operating leverage. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And if I could follow up on wealth. You've improved growth there as well. Are there any differences in the competitive dynamic among the top end and the low end? Are you having more success, like you said, you are having more success in Global Family Office. I guess can you talk about the funnel of new clients sort of in the middle tier and what you're doing to grow that? Jason Tyler : Yes. It's interesting. It's actually not just the family office but the very top end of wealth advisory and those clients can be similar size. They just happen to not have a family office and are leaning more toward us for wealth advice as opposed to the broader set of more operational and reporting services that the Global Family Office provides. We are doing better at the top end and looking at the new business that came on board and at the pipeline, the accounts above $20 million, just that was where there was more velocity. And that's been consistent for a while on that business. And so there is something to that dynamic, we seem to be doing better at the top end. That's where a disproportionate percentage of the growth has come from. Operator : And our next question is going to come from Brennan Hawken from UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : Just a quick clarification point. Jason, you referenced a point of expense benefit. Is it right to interpret that as coming off of your prior 7% or better expectation or was that meant in a different way? Jason Tyler : It is correct to interpret that as saying we don't see 7 at this point. We've said 7 or better. And at this point, we should be doing 6 or better. We've done that first half, and we see a path to that in the second half as well. Brennan Hawken : Perfect. Thank you for clarifying that. And then, you guys had a write-off of a client capability. I don't remember seeing that in the past, just a little confusing to me. So maybe if you can help me understand it. When did you build that capability and then what happened that caused you to write it off? Jason Tyler : Yes, I can give you some thoughts on it. Just from a timing perspective, it's been in the works for many quarters. But one of the pillars of the productivity office is to look at what we refer to as internal investments to ensure that they're on track to meet our hurdle rates or returns and margins. The charge was a project to build out a new client capability in asset servicing, specifically in the asset owners channel. So after working and eventually discussing with different stakeholders, we didn't reach commercial agreement on terms that would meet our hurdles. And so we halted the project. I think it's importantly, I'd presume you'd ask, are there others like this in inventory, absolutely not. This is a large project endeavor that we've been working on and didn't reach resolution that got to our hurdle rates and so stop the project. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Did something happen in the sort of like revenue opportunity that diminished it versus where you planned because I'm sure you guys went through the process before you broke ground, so to speak, at least metaphorically. Or was it that it was really pricey turned out to be more expensive to build. Was it the expense side that hurt the outlook versus plan? Or was it the revenue opportunity? Jason Tyler : Yes. Well, it was more costly to build than we thought, and the revenue dynamics were not at that point, going to get to our hurdle rate. It really is reflective of us taking an extremely disciplined approach on items like this where we're not going to devote resources to areas where we're not going to achieve our hurdle rate. And so well before we talked about this, even internally, one of the pillars that we talked about for the productivity office was looking at our internal investments and this fits squarely in one of those areas. We define that as areas where we're allocating resources, whether it's capital or expense dollars, and we're not at our hurdle rate. And so this is one where we were disciplined in saying we're going to stop now, halt it and not invest more into this. Brennan Hawken : Thanks for explaining that Jason, it's actually a lot more encouraging than that I interpreted it on paper. Jason Tyler : No, thanks for asking. It probably is help for you to clarify. It's helpful to others. So thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Wildhack, Autonomous Research. Go ahead please. Robert Wildhack : Just a bigger picture question on expenses. Where do you want or what's your target, I guess for that expense to trust ratio over the long run? And then, what are the sort of necessary ingredients to get there? Jason Tyler : Yes. If we can be in the 110 range, then -- that's 105 to 110, then we feel like we're in good shape to do well. And we're grinding to get down there. We got down there before. We've been well above it. We got down into that range, in fact, even slightly below it for a quarter or 2. And now all the factors we've talked about, higher inflation, markets coming down, and the effects of NII going up not helping that metric, we're outside that range, but it is an important part of our financial model to be in that range. And so it's the first thing I look at is where are we. And it's good to see us getting back toward the number that the range that we've articulated. It's another one of the key performance indicators that we talk about internally. Robert Wildhack : Got it. Thanks. And just one follow-up on the positive organic growth commentary this morning. If you saw a big acceleration in organic growth or a sustained period of strong organic growth, multiple quarters even several years. How do you think that would impact expense growth, if at all? Mike O'Grady: Yes. So Rob, your two questions relate to each other which is the primary way that we can drive that ratio to the range that Jason talked about is through organic growth on the fee side and then controlling organic expenses, all right? And to your point, if you have higher organic growth, that is going to require more resources. And to the extent that you don't achieve that, then you have to make sure that you're reducing the organic growth on the expense side to get there. But those are the two areas that we control the most. And then you say, okay, but beyond that, as Jason mentioned, on the fee side, it's going to have the impact of markets and sometimes currency. And on the expense side, you're going to have the impact from inflation and to some extent, currency. And so try to focus on what you can control the most, which are those two items, organic growth on fees and organic growth on expenses to ultimately drive it to the target range. Operator : And Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley is next. Please go ahead. Connell Schmitz : This is actually Cornell Schmitz filling in for Betsy. So just one question, a little bit nuanced on the credit portfolio. It seems like a little bit of an outlier. I know it's small, but on the reserve release, it seems like an outlier that there's an improved outlook on your CRE book. Can you just explain what's going on there and where you see this line item from here? Jason Tyler : Yes. So actually, just to clarify, there was the release, the release as a result of some improvements in a small number of borrowers in that book. But that more than offset an actually worsening outlook that we have overall for CRE. And it's not dramatic, but our outlook on that portion of the book actually would have caused an increase in the reserve. Connell Schmitz : Got it. Okay. That makes more sense. I guess one other question on the investment portfolio. You mentioned the duration still sub one year and you're mostly in cash. At what point just given the context of potential future rate hikes, where do you see like this duration heading in the coming months? And how are you planning to mix shift this book in that context to protect NII? Yes. Jason Tyler : Yes, absolutely. So the duration of the securities book is it to one, the duration of the balance sheet is just under one. You're absolutely right to call out that it is an interesting time in what we think was the evolution of the yield curve. And so we've been allowing the maturity of securities to become more liquid as we reinvest them, that's brought down duration at this point with the yield curve, we are talking about where to go from here. That's not indicating it's going to go up. But at this point, we are thinking about where is the yield curve, where is it going? And how does that influence what we want to do as the large securities book continues to mature and provide opportunity for reinvestment. Connell Schmitz : Okay. And then I guess 1 follow-up on that same topic. How should we think about earning asset growth in the context of deposit outflows potentially should those flow out on a one-to-one basis or will you maintain certain balance sheet size or\u2026 Jason Tyler : Yes. As deposits come down, the securities can act to obviously, the funding mechanisms for it. That doesn't move very quickly. And so the deposit size is always going to influence the earning asset size. So what we have to then think about the constraining factor at that point becomes what does leverage look like. And we've got a lot of room from a leverage perspective. And so that's what sometimes will lead us to think about discretionary leveraging just to make sure that we're not missing opportunities to pick up some NII even if it's a very thin NIM based on where the size of the balance sheet is because it doesn't flex super quickly. Operator : And our next question is going to come from Mike Brown from KBW. Please go ahead. Mike Brown : Maybe just actually following up on that question there. We noticed that the complexion of your balance sheet has been shifting on the funding side. naturally, and that makes sense. But your deposits, they declined by 6%, but we saw that the higher cost Fed fund purchased balance actually jumped meaningfully quarter-over-quarter has been growing this year. I guess, why not just let the balance sheet decline more like what's kind of going on there in terms of the mix? And how could that progress from here should -- if the deposits continue to trend down. As you talked about, the Fed funds purchase balance continue to grow as an offset to fund the assets. Jason Tyler : Yes. And part of it is that in this the deposits have just been so volatile and so you don't want to commit to significant movement in shrinking the balance sheet. And we want to be there for our clients. We've got plenty of capital. We've got plenty of room for a leverage perspective. And so just not anxious to quickly do any significant moves. And so to that extent, as deposits come down, you have the opportunity to then say, maybe we want to use some discretionary leveraging, again, we printed a 7.4 Tier 1 leverage, which leaves you a lot of room. And so if we hadn't done leveraging that incremental leveraging would be even higher in the 7s. And at a point, you just have to say it just prudent to make sure you're taking advantage of the opportunities that exist. So. Mike Brown : Okay. Great. Thanks for the color there. And then I guess maybe just following up on that point there on the capital side. You guys increased the share buyback or you bought back about $100 million or so of stock this quarter. Any expectation on how that could progress from here? What should we think about in terms of your capital return. Jason Tyler : Sure. The overall theme of what you saw in this quarter makes sense in the near term, where you'd see us be in the market for share repurchase. The thing that worked against us, the AOCI actually worked slightly against us this quarter, usually, in a neutral rate environment, the pull to par will give us some lift there. but it did in this quarter, that's fine. But even so, the $100 million we did is about -- it's kind of -- that's the model we're thinking about. In the short run, big caveat is that the FDIC special assessment coming online, presumably in third quarter, that would be a similar dollar amount as what we did from a repurchase perspective this quarter. And so you could see us saying hold off for a quarter, get that payment done and then get back to your game plan. Operator : Next question comes from Gerard Cassidy from RBC. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Jason, can you share with us, I think you gave us the cumulative beta through the cycle of 68% and then the incremental beta, of course, is higher. And I think you touched on it this quarter may be 100%. The question is this, how is the beta behaving relative to past tightening cycles? I don't know if 2016 to '18 is cycle that really is that comparable? Maybe I have to go back a little further. And then second, how quickly if the Fed does start cutting rates -- cutting Fed fund rates in 2024 sometime, how quickly can you guys reduce your deposit costs? Jason Tyler : Sure. Well, on the first, just to make sure I said it right earlier, the 100% going forward would be for the institutional side of the business, not for the overall deposit base. And to the question of how does that compare historically, this is higher than it has been historically. And there's different dynamics that you and I could talk about, I think, that are driving that. But there's very strong competition for deposits right now and for various reasons. And so we want to make sure that we're there for our clients. And we've got the ability to do that. And so we want to make sure that we're holding on to our fair share and providing that liquidity capability for clients. I think about reductions, the reductions, they can come quickly. And the way we price, the way we the way our agreements work, we get fast movement on the way down. And so we should be able to get deposit costs down quickly as rates come down. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then as a follow-up, you also touched on the volatility of deposits. Is it more based on your guys' experience at Northern, are you finding that this period's volatility is even greater than past periods? And is it because of quantitative tightening or Fed actions that is causing greater volatility in your guys' estimate? Jason Tyler : Well, it is more volatile, not just over the long run, and we went from 90 to 138 down to 106 but even within the quarters, a lot of volatility. But I think that's driven by some of the macro factors and what we saw in early March spooked a lot of depositors, obviously, and then another trend of debt ceiling and then leading to another trend of deposit competition, all of those things are having -- or driving significant different preferences that clients have, not just between which bank to go to but whether to use banks versus money market funds versus treasuries. I think all of those factors are what's leading to the heightened volatility we're seeing. Operator : Next question comes from Vivek Juneja from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Vivek Juneja : A couple of questions. I'll start with noninterest-bearing deposits. The big outflow you saw in the second quarter, which segment did that come more out of and what are you seeing in that trend? Sorry, if I'm repeating a question, there have been overlapping calls just made it, I hope I'm not doing that. Jason Tyler : The significant movements are almost always going to come, well, almost in this case came from asset servicing. Vivek Juneja : Okay. And the stabilization, where are you seeing more of that, which segment? Jason Tyler : The asset servicing segment is actually overall been relatively stable. We'll see big chunky movements in and out but the overall level has been about the same. The wealth segment is more granular. The GFO client base is much chunkier, but you just think about the amount of clients in the wealth segment, it just makes it more granular. Vivek Juneja : And on the Wealth Management segment, the low single-digit expense growth. Is that because that's where you've done a lot of the headcount cutting that you all talked about? And what are the implications for service there? Jason Tyler : Service has been great. And we didn't provide detail in the expense allocation between the business units. But just in general, you'll note that the headcount is down but no impact to service levels whatsoever. The low single-digit growth I referenced was related to organic growth within Wealth Management. Operator : Next question comes from [indiscernible] from Wells Fargo. Unidentified Analyst : Just a quick follow-up. You mentioned that equipment and software you had some projects being delayed. Does that mean that non-comp expense will see some upward pressure in the second half of the year? Jason Tyler : Yes. In certain categories, it will. And so in equipment and software, we'll see -- in that line item, in particular, we'll see upward pressure, $5 million to $10 million third and fourth quarter. I didn't reference other line items. We mentioned outside services relatively flat. So that's really the only forward-looking information we provided, except for the comp number, which you referenced. Operator : And Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brian Bedell : Just wanted to clarify on the FDIC special assessment, is that included in that expense guide of 6% or better. And I don't know if you're able to frame the size of the essential assessment yet. Jason Tyler : It's not included in the 6%. And we haven't talked publicly about what the number is. Jennifer Childe : Okay. Thank you very much for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again soon.",

Let me turn the call over to Mike O\u2019Grady. Michael O\u2019Grady: Thank you, Jennifer. Let me join in welcoming you to our third quarter 2023 earnings call. Our results for the third quarter reflect solid execution against the challenging phase of this interest rate cycle, particularly as rates appear close to be peaking. Third quarter deposit levels were generally in line with seasonal expectations, but funding costs were significantly higher, putting pressure on net interest income. We're focusing primarily on those areas of the business that are most under our control. Namely trust fees and expenses. In those 2 areas, we're pleased with our performance. Trust fee revenue was up both sequentially and year-over-year. Expenses were well controlled, and we improved our capital position. Our Wealth Management business grew trust fees on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. We saw ongoing strength in the higher wealth tiers and within our Global Family Office segment, where momentum outside the U.S. continues to be brisk. Families with large and complex truck structures continue to be an area where we excel. Activity with business owners also remains robust, helping them optimize their complex personal affairs while they attend to growing their businesses is a consistent theme. We're also seeing early success with various new marketing approaches and referral sources. In particular, during the third quarter, we had healthy new business generation with clients with assets over $50 million. In Asset Management, we saw positive flows into our institutional money market platform for the third consecutive quarter. Relative to benchmarks, our tax-advantaged equity product performance remained strong within the quarter cementing its 1, 3 and 5-year track record of out-performance. Importantly, 2 recent large asset servicing wins contain asset management mandates for index fixed income and outsourced investment solutions. Reinforcing our combined strength as One Northern.  Within Asset Servicing, we had good momentum in core custody and fund administration and our pipeline remains solidly within historical levels. Our front office solutions is resonating particularly well across regions and different client types. One notable front office solutions win in the third quarter was the $32 billion Abu Dhabi Pension Fund. Our ability to provide a comprehensive view across public and private assets was cited as a key differentiator. Importantly, we were also selected to provide global custody, liquidity management, performance in risk analytics and portfolio optimization. We also had good success in the U.S. asset owner space where we continue to take share.  In closing, we entered the fourth quarter on solid footing. Our balance sheet continues to be very strong with ample capital and liquidity, and our credit quality remains excellent. New business momentum is healthy and our pipeline is robust. Expense growth has declined each quarter this year, and I'm confident that we'll continue to build on this discipline. We're well positioned to navigate the current uncertain environment including the proposed regulatory changes related to capital and long-term debt and generate value for our stakeholders. I'll now turn the call over to Jason. Jason Tyler : Thank you, Mike, and let me join Jennifer and Mike in welcoming you to our third quarter 2023 earnings call. Let's dive into the financial results of the quarter, starting on Page 4. This morning, we reported third quarter net income of $328 million. Earnings per share of $1.49, and our return on average common equity was 11.6%.  Our assets under custody/administration and assets under management were down modestly on a sequential basis but up sharply on a year-over-year basis. Unfavorable markets and currency movements more than offset positive asset inflows relative to the prior period. Year-over-year levels benefited from favorable markets, currency improvements and asset inflows. On a year-over-year basis, currency movements had an approximate 90 basis point favorable impact on revenue growth, largely within our Asset Services division and a 100 basis point unfavorable impact on expenses. On a sequential basis, currency impacts were immaterial. Excluding notable items in all periods, revenue was down 2% on both a sequential quarter and year-over-year basis. Expenses were up 1% sequentially and up 5% over the prior year. This reflects an expense to trust fee ratio of 115%, down from 116% in the second quarter but higher than the 112% we posted in the third quarter of last year. Pre-tax income was up 1% sequentially, but down 20% over the prior year. Trust, investment and other servicing fees, representing the largest component of our revenue, totaled $1.1 billion, a 1% sequential increase and a 3% increase compared to last year. All other noninterest income was up 6% sequentially, but down 3% over the prior year. Net interest income on an FTE basis was $469 million. Down 10% sequentially and down 11% from a year ago. Our provision for credit losses was $14 million in the third quarter. Overall, our credit quality remains very strong. We had small net recoveries for the quarter, and there was a modest increase in nonperforming loans.  Turning to our asset servicing results on Page 5. Assets under custody and administration for asset servicing clients were $13.2 trillion at quarter end, down 2% sequentially but up 10% year-over-year. Asset servicing fees totaled $626 million. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of fees in the business were $428 million. Sequential performance reflects favorable markets and new business activity, offset by weaker transaction volume. The year-over-year strength was due to solid new business activity and favorable market and currency impacts. That were partially offset by lower transaction volume. Assets under management for asset servicing clients were $963 billion, down 3% sequentially, but up 10% year-over-year. Similarly, because a significant portion of our fees are billed on a lagged basis, the sequential decline in AUM will impact our fourth quarter trust fees. Investment management fees within asset servicing were $137 million. Moving to our Wealth Management business on Page 6. Assets under management for our wealth management clients were $370 billion. Trust administration and other servicing fees for wealth management clients were $486 million. Our average balance sheet decreased 4% on a linked quarter basis, primarily due to lower client deposits. Client liquidity was essentially flat during third quarter. Average deposits were $102 billion, down $4 billion or 4% sequentially, in line with our expectations for this seasonably weaker quarter. The decline was seen largely in the interest-bearing channel as clients continue to reallocate cash position. Noninterest-bearing deposits remained stable, down less than $1 billion sequentially, and the mix held steady at 17%. At quarter end, operational deposits remained at approximately 2/3 of institutional deposits and institutional deposits comprised 75% to 80% of the total mix. Shifting to the asset side of the balance sheet. The duration of the securities portfolio reduced slightly to 1.9 years. The total balance sheet duration continues to be less than a year. Loan balances averaged $42 billion and were flat sequentially. Our loan portfolio is well diversified across geographies, operating segments and loan types. Approximately 70% of the loan portfolio is floating and the overall duration is below one year. Our liquidity remains strong. Cash held at the Fed and other central banks was down reflecting the absorption of the deposit decreases, but highly liquid assets comprise more than 55% of our deposits and nearly 50% of total earning assets. Net interest income on an FTE basis was $469 million for the quarter, down 10% sequentially and down 11% from the prior year. NII reflected the impact of several dynamics. We saw some continued client migration into higher-yielding cash alternatives, but the pace moderated as we expected. Deposit cost increases were a slightly bigger factor with funding costs up 46 basis points over the second quarter. Due to the competitive environment, we repriced a small number of meaningful products to ensure we're protecting deposit volumes. We're not price leaders, but we're vigorously defending our deposits with an eye toward playing the long game. We expect to benefit from this strategy when rates decline.  Client engagement also led to a combination of specific repricing on existing accounts and a shift to higher paying term deposits. There's no question that clients want to remain on our balance sheet. But sensing that the rate cycle is close to peaking. They've begun to stretch for duration. Our NII in the fourth quarter will continue to be driven by client behavior, which has been less predictable given the speed and extent of this cycle's rate hikes. Our average client deposits thus far in the quarter are $100 billion. Modest outflows are expected to continue, due in part to client efforts to optimize returns and to some known outflows related to M&A activity and other corporate needs. Pricing should remain under pressure with further NIM compression possible. We currently expect fourth quarter NII to be in the range of $430 million to $440 million. Factors that could swing the outcome include the pace of further deposit outflows, the level of price pressure, the extent to which we see -- we continue to see deposit mix shift and the offsetting impact from the repricing of the securities portfolio. As we look out to 2024, there are a wide range of scenarios under which net interest income could trend. Deposit pricing pressure, our securities maturity schedule, investment outlook and other factors provide upside that's not reflected in the current quarter. Turning to Page 8. As reported, noninterest expenses were $1.3 billion in the third quarter, down 4% sequentially but up 4% as compared to the prior year. Excluding unusual items in both periods, including those noted on the slide, expenses in the third quarter were up 1% sequentially and up over 5% year-over-year.  I'll hit on just a few highlights. Excluding unusual items, compensation expense was down 2% sequentially. This reflected reductions in incentive compensation and head count actions taken year-to-date. The increase over the last year reflects 2023 base pay adjustments. Excluding unusual items in all periods, non-compensation expense was up 3% sequentially. Our expense-to-trust fee ratio improved 100 basis points sequentially to 115%, but remains higher than our targeted range of 105% to 110%. As a reminder, we began the year expecting to take at least 200 basis points off of our 2022 adjusted expense growth rate of 9%. Our first quarter adjusted results were meaningfully better, up 5.8% year-over-year. Our second quarter adjusted results were even better up 5.3% year-over-year. And our third quarter results were in the same range despite unfavorable currency impacts.  For the fourth quarter, we expect continued improvement. Compensation expense is expected to be up $5 million. Benefits expense should be our normal fourth quarter lift of $3 million to $5 million. Outside services likely to be up approximately $10 million. Equipment and software should be up approximately $10 million relative to adjusted third quarter levels. And occupancy is expected to increase a few million dollars above adjusted third quarter levels. Other operating expense has many components, including market-driven categories that are not predictable, but it has tended to increase in the fourth quarter. All in, this would put our full year adjusted expense growth rate at approximately 5% or roughly 400 basis points lower than 2022 levels. Our financial model is based upon mid-single-digit trustee growth from a combination of organic growth and market appreciation. Against this backdrop, we hope to generate 100 to 200 basis points in trust fee operating leverage in normal macro environments. Our capital levels and ratios remained strong in the quarter. We continue to operate at levels well above our required regulatory minimum. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio under the standardized approach was up slightly from the prior quarter to 11.4% as capital accretion more than offset the unfavorable impact from higher rates on our securities portfolio. This reflects a 440 basis point buffer above our regulatory requirements. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 7.9%, up 50 basis points from the prior quarter. At quarter end, our AOCI was a negative $1.4 billion, a slight improvement over second quarter levels. We returned $159 million to common shareholders through cash dividends of $158 million and common stock repurchases of $1 million. We slowed our buyback activity in order to reserve for the anticipated FDIC special assessment. We're well positioned to meet the proposed regulatory requirements, that Mike referenced without significant changes to our operating model.  And with that, Melissa, please open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we can go with our first question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr : That was like the price is right. I like it. Okay. So I appreciate the range of outcomes for NII next year that you can control. So I'll leave that aside for a second. But you mentioned your expense-to-trust fee ratio, your target and what you can do in terms of operating leverage in a better environment or normalize. I'm curious just what's the overall approach towards expenses as you enter budget season next year within that mindset of what your goals are? And how do you approach it with that much uncertainty around things that you can't control? Jason Tyler : Yes. Well, as we enter, this is the time of year where we're thinking -- trying to get a sense of where the launch points will be. And I walked through a little bit of a financial model for you guys to think about. That if we're -- over time, we'll get lift from the equity markets and we should also have low to mid-single-digit organic growth. If we can get 100 to 200 basis points in fee operating leverage, that sets us up really well based on where our pretax margin is for good EPS growth over time. And so that's the goal that we -- it's one of the metrics that we look at really closely. And we're still in an inflationary environment where it's harder to get that that operating leverage if you're just looking at fees because the expenses are elevated and you don't get the benefit from higher rates on the trust fee line. But you can tell that we've spent an incredible amount of effort this year working the year-over-year expense growth rates down. And you go back to 2022 and printing a 9% growth. Coming into this year, we knew we had to do better than that, and we've been grinding that down each quarter, quarter after quarter. We first tackled it with working hard on labor. And you can see that's the biggest cost that we have. So we have to get that right. Headcount is down, and then another key element is technology. That shows up in equipment, software and outside services. That's still elevated above the rest of the company in terms of growth rate, but we've had a lot of accomplishments there, too. and expecting to have that growth rate be lower next year than it has historically. And so we think we can have another year next year that's similar to what we did in this year, which is to work that -- could continue to work that year-over-year growth rate down. Glenn Schorr : Exactly what I look for. You have tons of capital and you generate plenty also. But I'm curious, some of the big banks have articulated what they thought as is the RWA impact or all-in impact might be. I'm curious at your first glance -- what type of impact are we talking? I know that you mentioned it doesn't disrupt your model, and I agree. I'm just curious if you can help us box it in, in terms of [indiscernible] impact, if as is? Jason Tyler : Sure. Yes, I'm going to give you a wide range of like 5% to 15% in RWA, and that will -- that's going to be impacted by a few different things. But one of the benefits that we have is the diversification of the business model. And so we've got -- obviously, the custody business comes with a lot of operational risk. That's really the most significant driver but we'll actually get some benefit from an RWA perspective in some of the loan treatments. Just given the nature of our underlying loans. And then there are some other dynamics that we have that should help on RWA as well on a relative basis. But it's -- we're thinking about it at this point, it could be anywhere from 5% to 15%. As we mentioned earlier, we feel really comfortable, and we see where our CET1 levels are and see where our liquidity is. And so we'll keep an eye on where our peers are. We'll keep an eye on what the business is doing, but we've got flexibility in other ways to manage that dynamic as well. Operator : We can take our next question from Michael Brown with KBW. Michael Brown : Good morning, everyone. So I guess I wanted to start on the custody and fund admin fees. They were essentially flat quarter-over-quarter, I guess, a little bit softer than we expected. What are some of the key drivers that played out this quarter. And as you noted, the lower market levels present a bit of a headwind here for the fourth quarter, but you did talk about some positive dynamics on the new business front. So what are the puts and takes that we should think about over the fourth quarter and then heading into next year? Jason Tyler : Sure. So first of all, the -- if you just look at the custody and fund admin line, and split it we talked about the fact that currency on a sequential basis was effectively a push year-over-year. It helped more than that roughly in the neighborhood of 1.5% to 2%. But if we just go back and look sequentially at how the quarter looked, the net new business was in Custody & Fund Admin Fees was a positive. It was low single digits, very low single digits, but positive. And then transaction volumes continue to be light. And we're starting to talk about that dynamic as something that might be more long term, just as our clients move more toward more indexing as opposed to active management. There's less trading activity, there's less reporting. There's less transitions. And so we did -- we're continuing to see a lower level of transaction-related activity. But the overall business is strong, again, net positive from an overall net new business perspective. And the pipeline, as Mike mentioned, looks strong. Michael Brown : Okay. And then if we just change gears to the deposit side, it sounds like the pressure there still remains. Could you just maybe unpack some of those underlying dynamics by client type and maybe just touch on where the pressure is perhaps the greatest and maybe where there's a bit less of a challenge. And are you seeing some elements of the deposit base that are seeing stabilization here? Or is it really kind of across the board? Jason Tyler : Definitely feel it's stabilized in a lot of ways. It's hard to predict where it's going to go because obviously, it's been a volatile cycle and clients are clearly trying to figure out what to do from here. There's a lot of clients that are terming out their deposits. We saw in the wealth side, just to get at your question of how it's separated by channel, the wealth side, we saw a significant increase in term deposits. So clients are saying this is an opportunity to move out of checking and into CDs. And a part of that is the nature of our clients where they have large amounts of deposits. And so they can take a component of their deposits and think about that more strategically and less about the need to maintain that liquidity just for day-to-day payments. And then in the institute but -- interestingly on the wealth side, deposits are actually up if you think -- if you look 630 to 930, they're up somewhat. And so it gives us an indication that the pricing actions we took were worked really well. Clients are -- they continue to see the strength of the balance sheet. They like to deposit on Northern Trust's balance sheet. So that increase was meaningful. On -- in the institutional side, that's what drove the period-to-period and most of the average decline -- and that comes to a lot of clients is moving to different types of either longer duration or higher-yielding liquidity types. Overall, liquidity across the company was flat. Across the channels cumulatively. And so clients clearly are just saying Northern is the right place to be. They're moving from one overall liquidity mechanism to another. And as we look out, I think it's interesting to see that the balance is thus far in the quarter have held in just over $100 billion. And frankly, that's higher, and it's still early in the quarter, but that's higher than what we would have anticipated at this point. And the $430 million to $440 million, just to give some context there. that assumes that net interest margin would be relatively flat, up a couple to a few basis points, but deposits would have to come down an average in the $93 billion to $95 billion for us to get down to that $430 million to $440 million. And so at this point, thus far, again, it's varied -- we're 2 weeks into a 13-week quarter, the deposit levels are holding in higher than that. Operator : And our next question will come from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : So just another one around deposits. you guys seem to have been a bit surprised, I guess, by this latest move in terms of kind of the catch up that you played there you articulated at the conference in September and obviously today. Do you feel like you caught up to where institutional pricing is? Or do you still think there might be incremental migration or kind of the need to increase price more? And then again, on the institutional side of things, is there a particular client base or channel internationally that's driving this pickup? Or is that fairly broad-based? Because your competitor set there is fairly limited, right? I mean we know there is 3 or 4. And at the end of the day, that's where you compete with on the custody side. So I'm just kind of curious where we are in that process? Jason Tyler : It seems like we caught up. And we made -- if we get to what we thought we were going to be down about 5% in NII. We ended up down 10%. We saw that mid-quarter and hit right on the number what happened in the -- call it, the August time frame, we clearly saw that in general, the market was taking deposit pricing up. And we reacted to that. We're not again, we're not price makers. We're price takers. And so we reacted to that and it seems to very much have leveled out the deposit activity. And that's why you see things very kind of flattish. And then also into this quarter, stabilizing at levels we thought would be even higher. And so I think the big takeaway is it seems like the pricing is where it needs to be for clients to level things out. And the pricing actions that we took were in pretty small number but of big accounts. And you asked about geography, the bigger actions we took were in the U.S. custody book on the institutional side of the business and then in wealth, it was in MMDA. And so we took a targeted approach to increase those pricings in early early reactions look like we got it, we hit the mark well. Alex Blostein : Got it. All right. Shifting gears a little bit, pretty constructive comments from you guys on the new business. We've heard that for the last couple of quarters. As you know, converting net to fees is always a little hard, and it's a bit opaque. So -- any way you can frame maybe the fee backlog and as we sort of work that through into revenues over the next, call it, 12 months, do you feel like you have enough scale in the business to onboard, especially some of these larger mandates a material pickup in expenses. So in other words, to Glenn's point, it sounds like you guys are aiming for, I don't know, 3% to 4% expense growth in '24. Is that doable with potentially more net new business? Jason Tyler : It is. And we didn't give a number on the expense growth, just that we want to do better than what we did this year. And so with that backdrop, the growth in the asset servicing business, in particular, it's come with expenses. It's a less scalable business relative to wealth, which is obviously highly, highly scalable. That said, we were focused, as you can tell from what we've done this year, not just on top line growth but on managing the type of business that comes in. And so head count was such an incredible focus for us this year, the compensation line, an incredible focus, and so as we look at what business to bring on board, there's going to be a very strong scrutiny on looking at what expenses come along with it. The business is committed to do that. They're -- it's they're leading that effort saying that they're going to be very diligent about identifying what business to bring on. Michael O\u2019Grady: Yes. And Alex, I would just add to what Jason is saying there is that's why we're driving so hard on productivity as well is because we have to have the capacity to invest in the foundation of the business and what we're building out, the investments we need to make. But then also, to your point, if you're going to bring on new business that has resources, you have to be able to offset a portion of that as well. Alex Blostein : Got it. Okay. That all makes sense. And so I mean to put words in your mouth on the 3% to 4%. It just sounds like less than 5%. So maybe you\u2019re thinking, okay. Operator : Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : I would love to unpack a little bit because -- you walked through some of the -- it sounds like you walked through some of the underlying assumptions behind the $430 million to $440 million expectation for 4Q. It sounded like you were saying that it predicated a deposit base of 93% to 95% and NIM flat. Did I interpret that correctly? And does that suggest that you're sort of girding for further deposit declines even though they've been stable quarter-to-date? Jason Tyler : Just to tweak the words. I mentioned that implies NIM would be up a few basis points, but the deposit levels you mentioned, are accurate. And so coming last quarter, we came into it thinking we were going to be down 5%, the market ended up being more competitive. And again, we've got we've got to react to what the market is doing. We don't set it. And so coming into this quarter, we just -- we did prepare for a further decline in deposits. And that could easily still happen. So not walking that back, which is saying that early stages of the quarter are indicating the deposit levels are higher than that. And we've also got -- even as we look out to next year, we don't think about this $430 million to $440 million as the run rate of there's reasons for us to believe that NII is going to go up from there. And just if you look at the runoff in the securities portfolio, and we're still trading securities that are yielding to and reinvesting at 5% and security is yielding in the 2s and reinvesting it above that. And so without taking more risk or duration. And so there are things that we can continue to do. We've also had the balance sheet positioned very defensively. We saw the decline in deposits that was happening and frankly, the stress in the banking industry in the spring and in the summer, and we positioned very defensively. We wanted to -- we have the ability to do that based on the strength of the balance sheet. We can stay short, we cannot stretch for NII. But as we feel more confident about the stability of deposits, the stability of the industry, we can use non-HQLA capacity. And so there's multiple levers we have to work on NII. So although we're trying to give you as much color as we can about fourth quarter, the interpretation shouldn't be that that's necessarily something that you should annualize thinking about 2024. Brennan Hawken : Okay. All that's fair. I guess the 2024 will depend on the competition for deposits. So we'll see how that goes. One follow-up here. You guys made reference -- and I apologize if you said it in the prepared remarks, the couple of overlapping calls here this morning. You laid out a Visa gain in the press release, but I didn't hear it quantified in the commentary. Is it possible to quantify that impact? Jason Tyler : Yes. It's up $10 million to $15 million relative to second quarter. Second quarter was a slight loss. This was a slight gain. And that -- just a little bit of color the -- that relates to a derivative that we have associated with part of our Visa position. And as the -- our view of the length of that swap, extends or reduces that has an impact to the mark-to-market. And as there was news that was proposed by -- a news it was put out this quarter of Visa saying that they have a shareholder proposal to release half the shares. It reduces the amount of time in that swap. And so therefore, it changed the mark from what it normally -- what it otherwise would be. Operator : And our next question comes from Ryan Kenny with Morgan Stanley. Ryan Kenny : So just in thinking through the puts and takes to NII, you mentioned taking securities yielding to and reinvesting at $5 million here's update us on how much AFS and HTM roll-off you're expecting per quarter going forward. And as those securities mature, are you mostly reinvesting that into cash? Jason Tyler : I want to make sure I got the question fully. Can you repeat it for me? You just can't throw a little soft. I want to make sure I got it. Ryan Kenny : Yes. So as you as you're reinvesting securities from 2 into 5, could you let us know just how much AFS and HTM roll off you're expecting per quarter? And are you reinvesting that into cash? Jason Tyler : Sure. A lot of the reinvestment recently has been in cash. And -- but again, as I mentioned just a few minutes ago, that's not necessarily where we'll be reinvesting it before. And as we look at the schedule, it probably averages the runoff averages about 2%, particularly let's just take the U.S. dollar-denominated amounts. And then overall, there's about close to a little over $1 billion a quarter across all the currencies that's maturing, that's reinvesting. Operator : And moving on to our next question from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Just one clarification on the other investment in -- or the other income that $68 million this quarter versus $55 million in the second quarter. Should we take that $55 million and think of that as a more normalized run rate given the noise on the Visa swap gain? Jason Tyler : Yes, I think Visa is going to -- at some point in time, I think the noise in that line item will just go away. And there's Visa did announce that they didn't make this announcement. And so that should have an impact on the swap at some point. And so I think it shouldn't be -- again, it has tended to be a negative, that negative will go away. And so the prior run rates are probably too low and the current run rate might be too high. The best way to think about it. Brian Bedell : Okay. Okay. Fair enough on that. And then just on the NII guide, just to clarify also the $430 million to $440 million. Is that FTE? And then -- well, let me just ask that first. That's FTE, correct? Jason Tyler : Yes. Brian Bedell : Okay. Okay. Great. And then just as we move into '24, some of the elements, obviously, a lot of ranges of what can potentially happen. But on the competition front, it sounded like that was fairly episodic this third quarter, it got resolved. And just sort of, I guess, your view on whether you think that might reemerge, of course, it's always tough to predict. But just in terms of the fact that you're able to defend it, higher rates but keep those deposits, would that seemingly be a disincentive for other providers to try to grab those deposits and not actually get them. And then what would you think of -- maybe this is tough to answer to you, but what level of deposits is at risk of that competition within the custody and the wealth business? Jason Tyler : In the institutional business, let's start there. The -- a lot of those deposits are there for clients to be processing payments. And they not only have the end-of-day deposit needs, but intra-day needs as they have they can have intraday overdrafts. And so they've got to think about their liquidity, not just in today, but intraday. And we process a tremendous amount of payments across the system. And so that's why we always are talking about not just the traditional operational component, but the amount of dollars and velocity that we have in the asset servicing business, which is very high. The amounts that are more sensitive to rates tend to be very large clients that are making a decision on where to park large amounts of dollars and those tend to be negotiated. And that's kind of the top end, but that's also where there's lighter spread. In the wealth side of the business, clients are making decisions more from a product perspective, and they're moving between term treasuries, money market funds and traditional checking accounts. And we've seen increases in all non-checking account areas over this cycle. And we've seen CDs go from less than $1 billion to close to $4 billion. And that obviously has a really big impact when you think that, that's coming from a traditional checking account into a market rate CD there's hundreds of basis points of difference. And so if it gives you a little bit of a sense of -- on the wealth side, we've talked about 75% of the deposits overall that we have are in wealth, and -- I'm sorry, are in institutional and 25% in wealth. And so -- and then you see the type of movement that can happen if we're talking about $2 billion, $3 billion, $4 billion of movement of that of that $20 billion to $30 billion base, it's pretty meaningful. And but it's -- the good news, it has stayed with us, and we've done a good job of holding on to the deposits. Again, it's been deposits up this past quarter and overall client for the business flat from one quarter to another. Operator : Our next question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Mike Mayo : Yes, I'm a little confused on the NII guidance. So you're looking to be down 6% to 8% in the fourth quarter to $430 million to $440 million -- and -- but you said don't take that as a run rate. And so what kind of run rate do you think you'll have? Because I guess you're guiding down NII 20% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. So how much of that do you think you get back as you take those 2% securities and invest them in 5% and take all your other actions? And do you think the fourth quarter will be the low point or the NII inflection comes later? Or just A little bit more color on that, if you could? Jason Tyler : Sure. Now, fourth quarter could be -- it could definitely be a low point and particularly thinking about some of the things that we mentioned, but just taking the securities runoff alone, the math gets to -- you get to over, call it, $10 million, $12 million, $13 million lift per quarter. Calling just from securities from just the securities maturing and reinvesting again in similar duration, similar credit profile and that's without us taking these other actions. And just as our clients are thinking about where are we in the yield in the overall rate cycle, we think about that as well. And we've -- again, we position we've had the balance sheet positioned in a pretty defensive manner. And this provides us an opportunity to start thinking about what do we do differently. But just the maturity schedule alone has kind of a, call it, a $50 million annualized lift to it. And that's just one of the levers that we have that we'll be working from. Mike Mayo : In light of just more headwinds, though, than you had expected? I know you said no more expense plans, but -- and you have kind of bent the cost curve, which is the expression, I guess, of the year. Any thoughts up tightening up expenses even more than you've already done? Jason Tyler : Yes. The productivity office, we launched just in this year from kind of a standing start, and we're going to get over $100 million within this $100 million of savings in this year, most of those are on a recurring basis. And so you see a lot of that reflected in the actions we took from a compensation perspective, but negotiations with consulting firms, how we're looking at demand for technology consumption, how we're managing real estate, and so we've pulled a lot of levers there and it couldn't have a higher sense of urgency on what we're thinking about from a productivity perspective. but we should be getting above 2% a year in help from productivity. And not going to stop uncovering opportunities and having difficult conversations about what we can stop doing or how we can be thinking about things differently. Michael O\u2019Grady: My definitely continued focus on productivity, as Jason is saying. So I just want to emphasize that point. There are still plenty of opportunities to functionalize, automate, centralize a number of different, I'll call it, more fundamental structural things that we're doing already, but just have longer time frames to implement them. in order to get those savings longer term and a lot around technology that enables that. So it absolutely has been a focus, but will continue to be a focus. Particularly as the environment is so uncertain and not necessarily knowing what the direction of whether it's rates or markets are going to be. Operator : And our next question will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Can you guys -- can we take a step back, we're obviously on the weeds in the quarter-to-quarter stuff for all of the banks, understandably so. But when you step back if we're now after one that\u2019s since the financial crisis, let's call it 14 years of incredibly low interest rate environment with a little blip up in 2018, of course. But if we're now in a new environment for the next 3 to 5 years where the short end of the curve stays above 3% or 4%, maybe even 5% for nobody knows for sure. How does that maybe alter the way you guys have been running the business for the last 10 years in a 0% rate environment, to one now that is going to be 300 to 400 basis points higher at the front end of the curve? Or does it alter the way you run the business? Michael O\u2019Grady: Gerard, it's Mike. I appreciate the question. And the answer is yes. It does alter the way that we have to look at the business. And just starting with some of your comments there just around low interest rate environment, higher interest rate environment, what aspects of that are cyclical versus maybe permanent changes. Jason mentioned some of the shifts in the way institutional investors invest and the implications on transaction volumes that may come with that. And as a result, beyond looking at the productivity of the business, which I think we've emphasized here, we also have to look at the pricing side of the business. to ensure that we are being appropriately compensated for all the high value-added services that we're providing, I'll take it to all our clients because it really isn't specific to just institutional clients or wealth clients. But if there was an expectation that you were managing a certain level of deposits as a part of an overall relationship, that was a part of the value you were receiving for all the services you're providing. If that's going to be different for some time period, then you have to be compensated in different ways. Now you know our model well enough to know it's not a consumer product or something where you change the pricing daily or even monthly. So it's something that you have to work through the longer-term way that your services are priced and the way relationships work. I mean we're always looking to retain relationships, but also very focused on expanding them. And the more we can do with the clients, the better the overall economics. So my point, which I think you're on to it is we do and have been looking at this holistically, both on the revenue side and on the expense side so that we can continue to look at meeting the financial targets that we have. Gerard Cassidy : Very good -- and then as a follow-up, Jason, talking about, obviously, you're approaching your budgeting season, and I'm not asking you to obviously tell us what's going on yet. But can you frame out for us a year ago this time, when you were doing the budgeting for 2023 and you've -- as you pointed out, you guys have made progress in reducing the expense rate of growth. But can you frame out for us the outside factors that you were dealing with last year at this time, whether it's wage inflation or just inflation in general versus today, is it a little easier today or not just as tough the outside factors haven't really changed, and it's going to be a tough environment to put together a budget? Jason Tyler : Last year, we were in a heavy, heavy inflationary environment that was hitting us in not just our labor costs, but also we were defending we were defending from others trying to take our talent a lot was one of the talking points that we had at the time. That had implications and we were just spending time on that as well. And then we were seeing inflation come in technology costs in a lot of different ways. So every budget year is really, really difficult. I have to say that the macro headwinds last year, I feel we're heavier than they are this year. Operator : It appears there are no further questions at this time. Ms. Childe at this time, I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. Jennifer Childe : Thanks, Melissa. We'd like to thank everyone for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you again soon. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jennifer Childe, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jennifer Childe : Thank you, Ruth, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to Northern Trust Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on our call this morning is Mike O\u2019Grady, our Chairman and CEO; Jason Tyler, our Chief Financial Officer; John Landers, our controller; and Grace Higgins from our Investor Relations team. Our fourth quarter earnings press release and financial trends report are both available on our website at northerntrust.com. Also on our website, you will find our quarterly earnings review presentation, which we will use to guide today's conference call. This January 18 call is being webcast live on northerntrust.com. The only authorized rebroadcast of this call is the replay that will be made available on our website through February 18. Northern Trust disclaims any continuing accuracy of the information provided in this call after today. Please refer to our safe harbor statement regarding forward-looking statements on Page 12 of the accompanying presentation, which will apply to our commentary on this call. During today's question-and-answer session, please limit your initial query to one question and one related follow-up. This will allow us to move through the queue and enable as many people as possible the opportunity to ask questions as time permits. Thank you again for joining us today. Let me turn the call over to Mike O\u2019Grady. Michael O\u2019Grady: Thank you, Jennifer. Let me join in welcoming you to our fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. Similar to the last few years, 2023 presented a challenging operating environment. We experienced a combination of geopolitical instability, highly visible bank failures and elevated inflation and interest rates. I would like to thank our teams across the company for their tireless efforts to serve our clients under these difficult circumstances. Turning to our numbers, our fourth quarter results capped off a solid year of progress toward driving improved long-term financial performance. On a year-over-year basis reported fourth quarter revenue was $1.6 billion, expenses were $1.4 billion and earnings per share were $0.52. Our performance in the quarter included the impact of $261 million in notable items. Adjusting for the notable items in both periods, fourth quarter revenue on a year-over-year basis was flat, with trust fees up 5% and expenses up 3%. We focused much of our efforts in 2023 on expense control, making various structural and governance changes to enable sustained long-term productivity improvements. Actions included disciplined headcount management, vendor consolidation, rationalization of our real estate footprint, and process automation. Although we brought our year-over-year expense growth down in each quarter this year, our expense growth in 2023 was still too high relative to our trust fee and revenue growth levels in recent years. As such, lowering the trajectory of our expense growth further remains a top priority this year as well. Turning to the businesses, our organic growth continued to be below historical levels, although we saw improvement throughout the year. Within wealth management, for the fourth quarter in the year, solid growth and client advisory fees was largely offset by product-level asset outflows. We continue to see ongoing strength in the higher wealth tiers above $50 million in client assets where our expertise, track record, and industry leadership are significant differentiators. Our ability to harness the data and analytics from serving the wealthiest people in the world for more than 130 years, coupled with our holistic, advice-driven culture, sets us apart in the marketplace and will continue to be an important driver of our success. Drawing from our experience working with some of the most sophisticated families around the globe, next month, the Northern Trust Institute will publish its first book, Secrets of Enterprising Families. The book will provide a window into what works for ultra-high net worth families who have succeeded generation after generation and what doesn't to help other families gain important insights and unlock value. The book will be launched with a series of client and prospect events around the country, giving us a new channel to establish relationships and develop business. Finally, as a testament to our exceptional client service and expertise, in 2023 we were named best private bank for family offices in the US and best private bank for succession planning in the U.S. by the Financial Times Group. Asset servicing generated solid new business growth in both the fourth quarter and full year, but this was largely offset by continuing asset outflows at the client level and generally lower transaction volumes and capital markets activities. We performed particularly well with asset owners in the Americas in the fourth quarter. Notable wins included the state of Nebraska Investment Council pension plan and Costco\u2019s retirement plan. We were also reappointed as asset servicing provider for the health care of Ontario pension plan. Throughout the year, we also generated healthy momentum with asset managers in the UK and EMEA regions where our solutions for alternatives and private credit were particularly well received. We recently finalized terms with one of the world's largest private market firms, which will add significant scale to our alternatives division. This appointment is a testament to our ability to successfully compete with some of the largest and most complex mandates. Our asset servicing business received numerous awards in 2023 for its innovation and industry leadership, including best outsourcing provider by [Waters] (ph), European transfer agent of the year and administrator of the year by Funds Europe, best global custodian for asset owners by Asian Investor. In asset management following several quarters of client outflows we generated positive overall inflows in the fourth quarter including healthy growth and index equity and our fourth consecutive quarter of positive liquidity inflows. We've seen particularly good momentum in our high yield complex with 93% of our taxable active funds outperforming their one-year benchmarks. Our alternatives funds have also continued to generate solid growth and remain an important driver of our fee revenue. As a result, our product launches during the year focus largely on alternatives capabilities. In closing, we enter 2024 with positive momentum, well positioned to navigate the ongoing macroeconomic and market uncertainty. Our focus is squarely on accelerating profitable organic growth, maintaining our expense discipline and driving greater resiliency and efficiency in our operating model. With that, I'll turn it over to Jason to review our financial performance. Jason? Jason Tyler : Thank you, Mike. Let me joint Jennifer and Mike in welcoming you to our fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. Let\u2019s dive into the financial results of the quarter, starting on Page 4. This morning we reported GAAP fourth quarter net income of $113 million. Earnings per share of $0.52 and our return on average common equity was 4%. As noted on the slide, our reported results included $176 million loss on the sale of securities related to a repositioning of the portfolio that we completed in November. They also included an $85 million FDIC special assessment. Our assets under custody/administration and assets under management were up sharply on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. Strong equity and fixed income markets coupled with favorable currency movements drove most of the improvement in both periods, offset slightly by asset outflows in both periods. Given the intra-period market movements and lag effects of our fee arrangement markets had an unfavourable impact on sequential trust fee growth and a favourable on year-over-year trust fee growth. On a year-over-year basis, currency movements had an approximate 90 basis point favorable impact on revenue growth, largely within our Asset Servicing segment, and 110 basis point unfavorable impact on expenses. On a sequential basis, currency impacts were immaterial. Excluding notable items in all periods, revenue is flat on both a sequential quarter and a year-over-year basis. Expenses were well-controlled, up 1.9% sequentially and up 2.6% over the prior year. Trust, investment and other servicing fees totalled $1.1 billion, a 2% sequential decrease and a 5% increase compared to last year. All other non-interest income on a FTE basis was down 6% sequentially and down 5% over the prior year. Net interest income on an FTE basis was $501 million, up 7% sequentially and down 9% from a year ago. Our provision for credit losses was $11 million in the fourth quarter. Overall, our credit quality remains very strong. Net charge-offs during the quarter were $2 million. Non-performing loan levels decreased to $64 million from $69 million in the prior period, and non-performing loans as a percentage of total loans remains stable. Turning to our asset servicing results on Page 5. Assets under custody/administration for asset servicing clients were $14 trillion at quarter end. Asset servicing fees totaled $612 million. Custody and fund administration fees were $420 million. Assets under management for asset servicing clients were $1 trillion. And asset management fees within asset servicing were $131 million. Moving to our wealth management business on Page 6. Assets under management for our wealth management clients were $423 [million] (ph). Assets and trust investment and other servicing fees for wealth management clients were $478 million. Moving to Page 7 and our balance sheet and net interest income trends. Our average balance sheet decreased 3% on a linked quarter basis, primarily due to lower borrowing activity. It declined 8% compared to the prior year due to lower client deposits. Average deposits were $102 billion, essentially flat with the prior quarter and meaningfully better than our expectations. We experienced a stronger than anticipated increase in deposits late in the quarter, ending the year at $116 billion. At quarter end, operational deposits comprised approximately two-thirds of institutional deposits and institutional deposits comprise 75% to 80% of the total mix. Despite significant leverage capacity, we reduced our average borrowings by $4 billion, relative to the third quarter or nearly 4%, reducing both our FHLB advances and Fed funds purchased. Shifting to the asset side of the balance sheet, $3.2 billion securities repositioning we completed in November involved the sale of both high-quality liquid assets and non-high-quality liquid assets available for sale securities with a weighted average maturity of two to three years. Earlier this week, we completed another $2.1 billion repositioning, which enhances our flexibility given the dynamic rate environment. We'll record an associated loss in the first quarter of approximately $200 million. The proceeds of both sales were invested in short floating rate securities, further reducing the duration of the portfolio, which is now 1.8 years. Average loan balances were $42 billion, flat both sequentially and relative to the prior year. Our end of period loan balances were up $4 billion or 9% over the third quarter, reflecting an increase in overdrafts related to higher levels of year-end trading and settlement activity. Our loans have since returned to $42 billion. The heightened activity at the end of the quarter did not have a material impact on net interest income in either the fourth quarter or first quarter. As a reminder, approximately 75% of the loan portfolio is floating. The total balance sheet duration continues to be less than a year. Our average liquidity levels remain strong. Cash held at the Federal Reserve and other central banks was down, reflecting the decrease in borrowings. But high-quality liquid assets comprise more than 50% of our deposits and more than 40% of total earning assets on average. Our net interest income in 2024 will continue to be driven largely by client deposit behavior, which has been less predictable given the unique aspects of this rate cycle. We expect the November and January securities repositioning to provide an incremental $30 million in net interest income per quarter in 2024 relative to fourth quarter levels. We currently expect first quarter net interest income to be in the range of $480 million to $500 million. This assumes deposits remain stable, but deposit pricing continues to be under some pressure. With further NIM compression possible, as long as quantitative tightening persists and the deposit environment stays highly competitive. Turning to Page 8. As reported, noninterest expenses were $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter, up 9% sequentially and up 5% as compared to the prior year. Excluding notable items in both periods, as listed on the slide, expenses in the fourth quarter were up just under 2% sequentially and under 3% year-over-year. I'll hit on just a few highlights. Excluding all notable items, compensation expense was up 2% year-over-year. This reflected the impact from 2023 base pay adjustments, partially offset by reductions in incentive compensation and headcount actions taken year-to-date. Full-time equivalent headcount was down 200 or 1% sequentially and down 500 or 2% over the prior year. Excluding notable items in all periods, non-compensation expense was up 3% year-over-year. Equipment and software expense was up 10% year-over-year, largely due to increased amortization expense. Recall, that as much as two-thirds of this line item is comprised of depreciation and amortization expense. And finally, we realized 200 basis points of trust fee operating leverage in the quarter. Turning to the full year results on Page 9. Trust fees were down 2% in 2023, largely due to asset outflows and weaker transaction volume, partially offset by the elimination of rate-driven fee waivers and new business generation. Excluding the impact of the two securities repositioning, other non-interest income was down 9%, reflecting weakness in foreign exchange trading and other capital markets activities. Net interest income was up over $100 million or 6%, which largely offset the decline in the other non-interest income categories. This translated to flat total revenue growth. Reported expenses were up 6% for the full year to $5.3 billion. Excluding notable items in both periods as listed on the slide, the expenses were $5.1 billion in 2023, up 4.8%, which compares favorably to 2022. As we've noticed previously, we expect to bring the expense growth rate down further in 2024. We have clear line of sight to two key areas of increase. Base pay adjustments within compensation expense and depreciation and amortization increases within equipment and software. On a blended rate, we expect to provide base pay adjustments of approximately $65 million in 2024, which will hit our compensation line beginning in the second quarter. This compares to base pay adjustments of $80 million in 2023. Within equipment and software expense, we expect a $65 million or 10% increase in 2024. Combined, these two-line items will drive approximately 3% increase in operating expenses above 2023 levels alone. That said, we expect to continue to generate meaningful efficiency gains from our productivity office and have identified further opportunities for improvement. As we look out to the first-quarter, we expect the following : first-quarter compensation expense will include our annual equity incentive payments, including those for retirement-eligible employees, along with modest employee headcount growth associated with growth in the underlying businesses. This should translate to a sequential increase of $50 million to $55 million. Employee benefits expense is expected to increase by approximately $10 million due to seasonally higher payroll taxes. Turning to Page 10. Capital levels and regulatory ratios remained strong in the quarter. We continue to operate at levels well above our required regulatory minimums. Our common equity Tier 1ratio under the standardized approach was flat with the prior quarter at 11.4%, as capital accretion offset a modest increase in risk-weighted asset levels. This reflects a 440 basis point buffer above our regulatory requirements. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 8.1%, up 20 basis-points from the prior quarter. At quarter-end, our unrealized pretax loss on available-for-sale securities was $924 million. We've returned over $300 million to common shareholders in the quarter through cash dividends of $156 million in common stock repurchases of $146 million. For the full-year, we returned approximately $980 million to common stockholders, including common stock repurchases of approximately $350 million. And with that, Ruth, please open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Michael O'Grady: Good morning, Glenn. Glenn Schorr : Good morning. So I appreciate all the numbers you helped us, but I\u2019ll try to peak a little bit more under the covers. So deposits stable, heard your thoughts on 1Q NII on the further deposit pricing pressure. So the question is, as we go throughout the year do you have any window into that stability and deposits sticking around? And then with the combination of 75% floating-rate loan book and still pressure on deposits is it reasonable to assume that NII might go down in second quarter forward before stabilizing later in the year and rising. I know that's a little bit further look into the future, but\u2026 Michael O\u2019Grady: Yes. But it\u2019s -- I think it\u2019s a very reasonable way to frame looking out further into the year. And you're right, for us to say full year numbers at this point, it's just too early, but it is good to think about how the assets and liabilities are going to react with looming rate cuts. And I think it's helpful to think back on how the impact in NIM occurred with rates rising. Initially it was very different than what happened eventually when betas were much higher. And I think on the way down, we might have a similar situation where the first cuts may be different than the later ones. And two things jump out in my mind. One is, we have never tried to be a price setter in deposits. Our goal has always been keep the deposits in the house, and we were very aggressive at following what we saw market pricing was. And the second thing is that, as we get these initial cuts, I could -- we could see the market reacting in a way to keep deposit costs, deposit yields for clients higher to hold onto deposits. And so, I think initially it might be tougher than what happens eventually. Now, all that said, volumes matter a lot, and it's obviously been extremely hard for us to predict where volumes were going to go. And we saw October better than we anticipated, November was better than October, December was better than November. And so, volumes are going to be critical in what happens in the first half of the year. And it's just super hard to predict. Glenn Schorr : I definitely appreciate that. This one might be a little bit easier, the follow-up on fee operating leverage. I mean, just by means of pricing alone, or the markets alone, the markets had a strong end to the fourth quarter, so your fee run rate should probably be a lot better going into the first quarter, and with your comments on even more sharper discipline on expenses, do you expect to make some meaningful progress early on in the year in this fee to expense ratio? Jason Tyler : Yes, you're right to call out that there is a lift, the launch point is higher coming into the year. And I don't know if I'd say meaningful, but it's definitely higher. And the lag effects will help us as we walk into the year. And so, that's the math of it. But then more strategically, we do feel positive about the pipeline in both asset servicing and in wealth management. And underneath both businesses, our asset management business is incredibly important. And as Mike mentioned in his commentary, there's some early signs of flows back in. And we always think just as we do on deposits, just keep the money in the house, keep the client assets in the house, but if our asset management business does better, then, that helps as well. And so I think the strategic component is also we're feeling early signs of some positive movement from an organic perspective. Operator : We'll go next to Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research -- Research. Excuse me. Michael O\u2019Grady: Good morning, Steven. Steven Chubak : Hi. Good morning. So, I was hoping to maybe just unpack, like, the deposit discussion a bit further and specifically just get a sense as to how you're thinking through the impact of ongoing Fed QT. It does feel like a lot of the liquidity in the system has come out of RRP that's provided a bit of stability or at least has helped drive better deposit resiliency over the last six months. But with the RRP expected to be exhausted over the next, call it, three to four months, just want to get a sense, once that happens, how you expect deposit flows to ultimately trend. Jason Tyler : Yes, I'll start and Mike may have thoughts too, because we talk about this a lot and it's more predictive than it is quantitatively spitting out results, frankly. But you're right that -- my sense is that, the RRP program had a really significant impact on deposits. And it was effectively competing with banks for deposits, and now that it's come down, I do think that that's been a help. Now, from here is different, and I think we have to think about the fact that rate movements are going to also have an impact on how clients think about deposits. And with the deposit cost having gone up so much in the second half of the year, again, that had a big impact on deposit costs and client behavior. Could see that having an impact this year is rates come down. And so, I think it's not just the RRP program but how clients think about instead of 5% rates how they think about 3% rates and comparing that to maybe more of a risk on trade. And so, I think we've got to think both about the program and the rate environment. Michael O\u2019Grady: I would agree with what Jason said there and just as there was a transition on the way up with QE, there's going to be a transition on the way down. Unchartered territory for everyone on QT and how they go about that and when they might stop, more aggressively seeing their portfolio come down. So I think that the timing of that will matter. And then also we saw with client behavior that -- as rates went up, more of the liquidity moved into treasury and that had an impact on it and as we come down, I think over time a lot of the fund that moved into treasuries will start to move into other alternative. And as Jason said, our objective is to work with the client and really try to meet any of those needs and keep the dollars in the house. Steven Chubak : That's great. And just for my follow-up, the duration on the asset side of the balance sheet admittedly has been a little bit more volatile, especially given some of the repositioning actions you talked about. The asset betas with rate hikes were quite elevated for you guys and some of your trust peers as well. Just wanted to get a sense as to what percentage of the asset side of the balance sheet, if we took a snapshot today, is sensitive to movement in short rates as we do prepare for eventual rate cuts. Michael O\u2019Grady: We do it in three buckets, and if you just take cash, obviously, 100% of that, the second loans in roughly three quarters are rate sensitive. And you think about the securities portfolio, and I'll give you two numbers to play with. One is, the duration is meaningful at now about [18] (ph), but also just the weighted average maturity of the portfolio, I think, is also helpful, which is a little under four years. And we quote this balance -- the duration of the balance sheet, that's just us doing a weighted average across those effectively just to give a sense of the impact of the large size of the cash component and the large floating component of the loan book. Steven Chubak : And Jason, can we just clarify what percentage of the securities book today is floating? Jason Tyler : Yes, it's about a third of the book is floating. Operator : We'll go next to Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Michael O\u2019Grady: Hey, Alex. Alex Blostein : Hey, Jason. Hey, Mike. Good morning, everybody. Just building on Steven's questions for a second. I guess, given the fact that rates are expected to come down and you guys have actually been, I guess, shifting the balance sheet to be maybe a little bit more floating for the right reason and obviously been a good trade for NII for last quarter, this quarter. Any expectations to actually start locking in higher yields going forward and maybe extending duration a little bit? I know this is pretty quick. You guys have just kind of gone the other way, but the balance sheet effectively became a little more floating as rates are about to come down, so just curious how you're thinking about that? Michael O\u2019Grady: Yes, it's on our mind a lot and as we're talking about it and we have brought the duration down. And one of the benefits of that is that, it does make it just a lot more flexible, because the markets have been really dynamic. And so, there will come a time when I -- I anticipate where we would say it's time to step out a little bit, our bias over the last year has obviously been to go shorter, and that's played out. I think rates have -- the way rates have played out, we had a view, and not materially, but it worked in our favor. But from here, I think we do have to think about. And it's not locking in as much as just taking the downside risk off the table of a dramatic reduction in rates. And so, there's some component there that we'd say we can naturally hedge against. Alex Blostein : I got it. Makes sense. I wanted to follow-up for my second one just around the expense outlook. 2023 was super noisy, there's a bunch of one-timers, obviously. So just want to clarify a couple of things. So, I guess, the ultimate message is that, 2024 expense growth is expected to be lower than 2023. I think the core expense growth in 2023 was about 5%, so just want to confirm that? And then the core base you're speaking to, is it still kind of $5.1 billion to maybe $5.2 billion in sort of core expense base, off of which we should think about 2024? Jason Tyler : So confirm, the 2024 -- the 2023 number we think of is 5%, just a little bit less than that, right at about 4.8%. And we are working from a base in 2023 of 5.1%. And probably worthwhile to invest a minute and just explain, because you're right, there have been a few things. So if you walk the reported [52.84] (ph) and then you take out in the year severance-related charges with two occupancy charges that totaled about 13. There was that client capability write-off we mentioned in second quarter, 26, FDIC Special Assessment 85, and then there is a small equipment credit of $4 million in the third quarter that we mentioned as well. And the severance-related charge in Q2 is $39 million, just to make sure I give you the numbers on everything. And so, let's work with -- that tells us we'd work from a base of 5.1%. Operator : We'll go next to Brennan Hawken with UBS. Michael O\u2019Grady: Hey, Brennan. Brennan Hawken : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Would love to follow up on that last question actually. So thanks for clarifying the base. That's helpful. Number one, just to confirm, you did mention that I think it would be inclusive of adjusting for the write-off of the client capability. I just want to confirm that. And just to clarify the message on the investing, super clear that you're looking to drive expense growth lower than you saw in 2023, but you also laid out an uplift of 3% from base paying software. So does that represent like a floor to growth or do you have sufficient levers to offset at least some of that? Jason Tyler : It's not a floor, but it does give you a sense of what's already in the 2024 base from which we're working. And so, we've got to use productivity to get aggressively at that. Some of our productivity work is already reflected in that, but we've got to do more this year. And I just want -- we wanted to be super transparent in the things that we already know that are in the 2024 increase, so that you guys can predict what that level is. Brennan Hawken : Okay. And is the write-off of the capability that was in other operating expense part of the adjustments, too? Sorry if I missed that. Jason Tyler : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Brown with KBW. Michael O\u2019Grady: Hi, Mike. Michael Brown : Hi. Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. The sequential increase in the noninterest-bearing, that was a positive to see this quarter. Could you just touch on maybe some of the key drivers there? Was this supported by some of the new business activity that you referenced in the prepared remarks? And then, I appreciate the comments on the deposits and the potential for the stability here near term, but I guess focusing on the NIBs, can they stabilize at this level, either in terms of like an absolute dollar basis or as a percentage of the total deposits? Jason Tyler : My observation in looking at it is that, it's less percentage driven and more what is that base. And the reason I mention that was, a lot of that NIB, it comes from one of the channels in our institutional business. And it actually performed better than the rest of the institutional business in looking at it over the last few weeks. And so, it just tells me that that client, that sub-client channel behaves on its own. And it looks like that has flattened out somewhat, not necessarily calling it a plateau at this point, but it certainly behaved a little bit better than the rest of the institutional book. And another component is the wealth book which -- that deposit base increased in the quarter, it was not dramatically, but it was nice to see that up on average And, obviously, we saw overall the whole deposit book very flat, but nice to see that the wealth book doing well. Because even though the non-interest bearing is obviously highly attractive economically, the wealth deposits are very attractive as well. Not at zero, but they're very attractive and that component did well on the quarter. Michael Brown : Okay, great. Thank you for those thoughts, Jason. I guess on the servicing side of the business, I was hoping you could maybe just touch on the competitive landscape and the alternative asset side of the business. How do you think about maybe that opportunity for Northern Trust? And how are you -- if you could just talk about your capabilities today and maybe where you're investing to take some share in that space? Michael O\u2019Grady: Yeah, Mike, so I'll address that. We believe that the alternative space, or broadly speaking, just private markets, is a major opportunity for us on the asset servicing side and that largely follows with what's happening in the marketplace from an investor perspective. And so, we expect that market to grow and we think we have the value proposition that is compelling within that. You heard in my comments earlier that we recently won a very large mandate with one of the large private market firms and it was after an exhaustive process that we went through to win that business. Very capabilities oriented, very global as to the capabilities necessary and the footprint necessary to do it. So again, it's an area of focus for us and one where we think we're going to be able to continue to grow as the market grows and as we're able to take share. Michael Brown : Thanks, Mike. I appreciate the commentary there. Michael O\u2019Grady: Sure. Operator : We'll go next to Ryan Kenny with Morgan Stanley. Ryan Kenny : Hi, good morning. I have a question on capital. So your CET1 ratio of 11.4%, it's well above the regulatory minimum, well above last year's level. And then we got the comment letter from Basel Endgame a couple of days ago, and there's clearly a lot of industry pushback there. Your earnings generation from NII looks a little bit higher than consensus expected. So putting that all together, how should we think about how Northern's approaching buybacks this year and this quarter, is there any room to maybe lean in a little bit there? Jason Tyler : Sure. So you're right in the tee-up of the numbers, there's obviously room. We did a fair amount of buybacks in the quarter, a little bit more than we do on average, and we're always looking at that relative to other opportunities we have to invest capital. And so, in the near term, we're thinking about does it make more sense to invest in RWA effectively to say we could grow the loan book more, we could do more in FX, we could do more in sec lending or do we want to reposition the -- take a different repositioning in the securities portfolio. The repositioning to be did this year were all helpful to capital, because in going shorter we -- and out of non-HQLA into HQLA on that, those are all helpful to capital. But you also know how closely we look at peers and we take pride in the capital levels we have. We think it's part of our financial model and our business model and talking to clients and being able to evidence to them how strong the capital base is. And so, there's definitely room, but we also got to have in mind that Basel Endgame, which you referenced briefly, it's still unclear. We did do a comment letter, which you referenced, but it's unclear what the impacts are going to be. We think we're in good position relative to peers, but want to keep an eye on that. But we'll also think about additional stock repurchases as we always do, given alternatives we have. Ryan Kenny : Okay, great. And can you also update us on your expectations regarding ability and timing to dispose of the Class B visa shares and would that potentially have any impact on capital and buybacks outlook? Jason Tyler : Yes, so just for people who don't follow it as closely, we own just over 4 million Visa B shares, and the current exchange rate show that translates to about $1.7 billion. And there's a proposal that it can be voted on next week I think that would enable the B shareholders to monetize half of the holdings. So what are we planning to do? One, at this point, there's nothing to do. The proposal is still outstanding, and we've got to wait and see what the shareholder vote looks like. Even assuming it passes, there are timing restrictions to it. But that said, this is not a strategic asset for Northern Trust. And so, you should read into that. It's not something that we're saying we're going to hold on to beyond what the restrictions would enable us to do. And we're discussing all the options. There's likely going to be a combination of a few tools that we'll take, but early to give details on that at this point. Operator : We'll go next to Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Michael O\u2019Grady: Hey, Brian. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks. Hey, good morning. If I could just clarify, Jason, a couple things you gave guidance on earlier, just to make sure I heard it right. The incremental NII from the two portfolio security sales is $30 million annualized, and that comparison period is 1Q versus 4Q. Is that correct? Jason Tyler : Yes, so you broke up a tiny bit, but I think I'm following where you are, but don't hesitate to tell me if I miss it. So the November repositioning helped in the quarter by, call it, $6 million, but that should be helpful going forward to the tune of -- in the neighborhood of $15 million a quarter. The January repositioning, which we mentioned for the first time a little while ago, that should help in the quarter about 15 -- round number is about $15 million a quarter. Brian Bedell : $15 million per quarter, okay. And then on the expense side, maybe just I\u2019m try to get some more clarity on the total expense growth. I think you said comp expense being up $50 million to $55 million in 1Q versus 4Q because of the retirement eligible option. And then employee benefits up $10 million versus 4Q. So correct me if I'm wrong on that. And then just translating that into expense growth through the year. Obviously, there's lots of different levers. But is the idea to try to improve on the 3% expense contribution from that, from a total growth perspective, or should we be thinking of expense growth, say, better than 5%, lower than 5%, but potentially higher than 3%? Can you improve that trust -- expense to trust fee ratio in 2024 from 2023? Jason Tyler : Yeah. So a couple things. One, confirm your numbers are right on first quarter and the step up. Remember, both of those are fully seasonal, Brian, so the step up in first quarter just because that's when -- that's the booking of our retirement eligible equity grants. And so that in and of itself is represents the vast majority of that step up and then similarly we've got a higher payroll tax in first quarter, just as we hit the caps on that level. But both of those numbers come back down for second, third, fourth quarter. That said, second quarter, got to build in the base pay adjustments that we referenced, which is that $65 million, that will be second, third, fourth quarter. So all that said, the goal is to do better than roughly 5% we did this year. The 3% was not seen as the -- again, back to, it's not seen as a floor, but also that's a big difference to go from 5% down to 3%. And so we're using the productivity to do everything we can to get materially better than the 5%, but the fact that we're walking in with 3% already in the base is just going to make it difficult. And so, I think it's the -- And the last thing I'll mention is, for us, we're anticipating organic growth. We target -- we have organic growth targets for each of the three businesses. And we want to continue to be a growth company. That is important. And that drives some expenses in addition to expectation of what we're doing from a revenue perspective. And so it's hard to fine tune much to say is it between 3% and 5%. If we're not doing as well from an organic perspective, we're going to be working really hard to say what else do we do to make sure we're doing the right thing and we get positive operating -- fee operating leverage. Operator : We'll go next to Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Michael O\u2019Grady: Good morning, Jim. Jim Mitchell : Hey, good morning. Maybe just follow up on that last comment, just maybe a little more detail. It seems like organic growth in 2023, it's a tough environment, a little mixed. So it seems like you're more optimistic across the board. So you can kind of just give us a little more thoughts, detail on the organic growth prospects this year. Michael O\u2019Grady: Sure, Jim, it's Mike. I'll start off here. You're absolutely right. We've gone through, I would say, a time period where the organic growth is definitely been strained and lower than our historical levels and there's a number of factors behind that that we've talked about over the proceeding earnings calls. That relate to client activity, that relate to some of the outflows that we had in the asset management business which obviously impact then wealth management and asset servicing and the reason why we're so positive going forward here on organic growth, some of those trends as we talked about have turned around. And so we see good inflows into asset management. So that aspect of it is a lift going forward to our organic growth, but then also the strategies that we have in place to drive profitable organic growth. Where we've been focused as a company is in a couple areas. There are a few areas. One is, really looking at the portfolio of our growth. So historically, asset servicing has been the majority of the organic growth. And looking forward, we're looking to shift that more towards the more scalable parts of our business. So wealth management and asset management. That doesn't mean that the asset servicing business will not be growing. It's just -- we're very focused within that business to the areas that scale the most. So if you think about the nature of all the things we do for clients on that front, some of those activities are more scalable, more profitable than others. And so we'll lean towards those areas I mentioned. The success we've had with asset owners in the Americas, a lot of that is custody and related services on that front. That's some of the more scalable services that we have. And it's, again, not to say that we won't be doing the business with the asset managers, so fund services, but some of those areas are more resource intensive. And so, we're going to be really disciplined about the types of business that we take in that require hiring more people, investing more, in particular, technologies around that. And then the last thing I would say just around the organic growth and why we're optimistic on it is, the businesses are working, I would say, much more closely together in how we go to market. So as we would call it here, one Northern Trust is our approach to the marketplace. So it's not separate businesses, but rather to the extent that we're going to approach a client or a prospect to work with them, it's going to include multiple offering from across the businesses, particularly asset management with asset servicing on the front end as part of a bundle that were offering to the clients. And then certainly with wealth management as well. You heard in some of our earlier comments here the advisory fee component of wealth management has been growing nicely through the year. We think that it can grow at a higher rate, but importantly the more that we can do on the product side with those clients as well. So as we talk about the transitioning with quantitative tightening for example and the move out of short-term treasury to the extent that we can help those clients move into fixed income funds for example. That's a real opportunity for us. So a number of things that we're doing to proactively try to drive that organic growth. Jim Mitchell : That's really great color Mike. And maybe just a quick follow-up on deposit pricing. Jason, you talked about still some pressure on overall deposit cost. Is that lags still on pricing or is that an assumption of a negative mix shift out of NIBs? What's kind of driving further pricing pressure and deposits? Jason Tyler : It's lags and we actually in the end fourth quarter made some agreements on pricing that will come into play in first quarter more than they did in fourth quarter and didn't drive deposit volumes higher in fourth quarter, but it is something that as we try to do more fine-tune predictions of what first quarter would look like, it's something that we factored in. We think that cost could be -- cost will be higher. And that's part of the reason why even though we ended it at $501 million and I indicated that December was better than November and October, we think we're still going to be flat to down a little bit in first quarter, largely because of that pricing element. And in general, we do -- our view is that as the Fed does reduce rates, we're going to have client conversations about it. And again, we're not a price setter, but highly committed to making sure our clients leave their deposits here. Operator : We'll go next to Robert Wildhack with Autonomous Research. Michael O\u2019Grady: Hi, Rob. Robert Wildhack : Good morning, guys. One more question on expenses. I'm curious how you would approach a hypothetical year where revenue growth comes in a lot better than expected and what that might mean for expense growth? I guess the core question is, what takes precedent, your expense to fee ratio or the absolute level of expense growth this year? Jason Tyler : I'll start. Mike may want to add to it. Historically, we'd say, well, we want to grow, but we have talked about ensuring that we were committed to more than absolute number in terms of the expenses and we've also committed to more scalable growth. And so we're already having conversations internally about ensuring that we\u2019re highly disciplined on bringing on business that is scalable. And so, I think that is a change relative to how we've thought about it before where there was more of a desire to bring on business, always at attractive margin, but our commitment to scalable growth is going to be, is higher at this point. And that means that the expenses shouldn't be as volatile with anticipation or even line of sight on new business coming on that brings with it high degree of expense. Michael O\u2019Grady: So I agree with Jason said. Just to add to your point, we\u2019re outside of our range on expense to trust fee ratio. So we're trying to drive that into the range. And so, as Jason is indicating, we're leaning towards trying to get into that range sooner rather than later. Robert Wildhack : Okay, thanks. And then on NII, I would just love to get your thoughts on the sensitivity there as it relates to different scenarios from the Fed. What's the impact of, say, one or two Fed cuts this year as opposed to, say, six Fed cuts? Jason Tyler : Yes, those are the scenarios we're looking at, but I come back to this theme, it's just going to depend on how well we're able to hang on to spread. And there's just been highly variable, and I think our ability to predict it just over the last couple quarters has been really hard. But I feel I feel really good about the volume that stayed in place. And so I think our approach has worked, but it makes -- it's going to make it less predictable. It's the opposite of what we just talked about on the expense side, ironically, where we're saying, we want to be more predictable in the expenses to try and get that expense to trustee ratio where we want it to be. On the deposit side, there's more flexibility and more willingness to follow where the market goes to make sure we're holding onto client assets. Operator : We'll go next to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Michael O\u2019Grady: Good morning, Mike. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, good morning. This is [Rob Ruschow] (ph) for Mike. Just wanted to follow up on the custody commentary a little bit more. As we calculated your fees that's under custody were down about 5% year-over-year. You mentioned client outflow. So, how much of that is kind of risk off versus actual pricing pressure. What is -- what was the new business this year and what's the outlook for pricing pressure versus new business as we look into 2024? Michael O\u2019Grady: Yes, I'll start and then Jason, you can fill it out. But first of all, I just think you need to take into account that we are compensated sometimes on the asset level sometimes on the transaction levels and transaction volumes were lower during the year, so that drove some of the weakness in the custody fees there. From a pricing perspective I would say nothing in particular as far as the competitive environment that is driving custody pricing to much lower levels if you will, I would say, it's relatively stable on the pricing front there. Jason Tyler : And as I look at just the underlying details of how we did, I think you're leaning more toward the asset servicing business. The net new business for the year was positive. And I'm just thinking year-over-year for the quarter. And asset servicing hit its mark on net new business. The issue with the company is some of the other things happening as we get into transactions and then what we referenced earlier in our clients going through their asset levels declining. But much less of a repricing story relative to prior years and the business is winning. If we just look at their win rate in the market, it is strong. So a lot of this year the impact came from these other dynamics of lower transaction volumes and same number of clients, but less assets. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, thanks. And if I could follow up on wealth, I guess, can you talk about the competitive dynamic there, and especially in global family office, you saw a little bit of deceleration in the growth rate. Any changes or any areas that you're looking to grow, either inside the US or out? Michael O\u2019Grady: You're right to call it, GFO had a lower -- much lower growth rate than it has over the last couple of years. It's been -- the last couple of years have been excellent for that business. And this year was weaker, but we always talk about the fact that is the spikiest business that we have. Very small number of client activity can lead to meaningful change and it's also one of the businesses where what happens underneath from an investment management perspective can have a meaningful impact on how the business is doing. But we've actually invested heavily in that business. They've got a lot of accomplishments in technology and some of the things that they have done with their wealth passport, their overall technology platform, we feel is industry leading. It is industry leading just the way that they are now interacting with clients from that platform perspective, what clients are able to do with multiple accounts and reporting and client asset movement, all coming in -- a lot of -- and it's all cloud enabled, is what we've done recently. And so, this highly -- at the market leading from our view in terms of what we're doing. And we're continuing to invest in that business from a technology perspective. So there's more coming, which makes us feel very optimistic about what that business is going to do over the next couple of years. Operator : This does conclude the question-and-answer portion of today's call. I would like to turn the call back over to Jennifer Childe for any closing comments. Jennifer Childe : Thanks, Ruth.

Let me turn the call over to Mike O'Grady. Mike O'Grady: Thank you, Jennifer. Let me join in welcoming you to our first quarter 2024 earnings call. We're off to a good start for the year. Our results for the quarter reflect both strength in underlying equity markets and the solid progress we're making against our strategic priorities of optimizing growth, driving productivity, and strengthening resiliency. We generated organic growth relative to both the prior period and prior year and saw healthy momentum inflows across our businesses. Within Wealth Management, we continue to see solid growth in client advisory fees and product level fees increase due to favorable markets. Our Global Family Office performed particularly well in the first quarter, adding several high-profile client relationships. The launch of our book, Secrets of Enterprising Families and the nationwide events created around it have generated significant client engagement and proven to be an attractive source of new lead flow. Asset Servicing generated solid new business growth at attractive margins in the first quarter. As we've discussed, our goal is to generate new business that is scalable. This means, a greater proportion of new mandates that require lower levels of incremental costs. There were several notable wins in the quarter. Northern Trust was appointed to provide a full suite of asset servicing solutions to True Potential, a rapidly growing UK-based wealth management firm, supporting approximately $33 billion in assets under management. Our open architecture approach, derivatives expertise, and consultative manner were key factors in helping us secure this win. We were also appointed as the sole asset servicing provider for Sanlam Asset Management's $9 billion of funds domiciled in Ireland. The award builds upon an existing relationship with Sanlam Investments UK, an integrated trading solutions client. This win shows how increasingly our capital market solutions are becoming leading products for us, bringing new clients to the firm whose relationships then expand into core asset servicing and other ancillary products. The progress we're making and success we're seeing from our One Northern Trust strategy is most evident within asset management. By both enabling and encouraging teams to work in tight coordination, we're delivering clients the solutions and capabilities of the entire firm. More joint meetings between our asset management and asset servicing businesses is leading to more new business opportunities and wins. Asset management has also bolstered the internal team that coordinates with our wealth management business and recently completed a national roadshow meeting with wealth clients and advisors in 29 markets. This provided increased visibility into NTAM\u2019s product leadership and performance, which should lead to increased flows from wealth clients over time. And in the first quarter, asset management also launched several new laddered muni products geared towards wealth clients and a proprietary offshore money market fund for Japanese institutional clients. Overall, asset management generated positive liquidity flows for the fifth consecutive quarter and continued to generate strong momentum within active fixed income and alternatives. In closing, we entered the second quarter with strong market tailwinds and positive new business momentum and are well-positioned to navigate the ongoing macroeconomic and market uncertainty. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jason to review our financial performance. Jason? Jason Tyler : Thank you, Mike. And let me join Jennifer and Mike in welcoming you to our first quarter 2024 earnings call. Let's dive into the financial results of the quarter starting on Page 4. This morning, we reported first-quarter net income of $215 million, earnings per share of $0.96, and our return on average common equity was 7.3%. As noted on the slide, our reports -- our reported results included a $189 million loss on the sale of securities related to a repositioning of the portfolio we completed in January. They also included a $12.5 million FDIC special assessment, which is in addition to the $85 million we recognized in the fourth quarter. Our assets under custody and administration and assets under management were up sharply on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. Strong equity markets coupled with favorable client flows drove most of the improvement in both periods. Excluding notable items in all periods, revenue was up 6% on a sequential quarter basis and 5% on a year-over-year basis. Expenses were up 4% sequentially and up 6% over the prior year. Trust, investment and other servicing fees totaled $1.1 billion, a 5% sequential increase and a 7% increase compared to last year. Excludable note -- excluding notables in both periods, all other non-interest income on an FTE basis was up 11% sequentially and up 16% over the prior year. We experienced good momentum in our capital markets businesses, particularly FX trading where we saw strong client volume levels. Bond underwriting referral fees were also unusually strong, recognized within securities commission and trading income. Net interest income on an FTE basis was $535 million, up 7% sequentially and down 2% from a year ago. Overall, credit quality remains very strong. Our allowance for credit losses declined 9%, reflecting a reserve release of $8.5 million and the impact of a $10 million charge-off during the quarter, largely due to a large commercial loan. Non-performing loan levels decreased from $64 million to $37 million, the lowest level since 2008. The non-performing loans as a percentage of total loans remain stable at 8 basis points. Turning to our asset servicing results on Page 5. Assets under custody and administration for asset servicing clients were $15.4 trillion at quarter end. Asset servicing fees totaled $640 million. Custody and fund administration fees were $437 million, up 6% year-over-year, reflecting the impact from strong underlying equity markets and new business activities. Other fees were up $6 million sequentially due to seasonally higher fees for benefit payment services and other year-end activities. Assets under management for asset servicing clients were $1.1 trillion. Investment management fees within asset servicing were $140 million, up a strong 11% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Moving to our wealth management business on Page 6. Assets under management for our wealth management clients were $421 billion. Trust, investment and other servicing fees for wealth management clients were $503 million and up 9% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. Growth within our GFO business is particularly strong, up 11% year-over-year and 9% sequentially. Moving to Page 7, and our balance sheet and net interest income trends. Our average balance sheet increased 6% on a linked quarter basis, primarily due to higher deposit levels. It declined 2% compared to the prior year due to lower borrowings. Average deposits were $112 billion, up nearly $11 billion, or 11% from the fourth quarter, and were meaningfully better than our expectations. We experienced a stronger-than-expected surge in deposits late in the quarter, with an ending balance up $8 billion or 7%, to $124 billion. Despite significant leverage capacity, we reduced our average short-term borrowings by 11% relative to the fourth quarter and total borrowings by 6%. This translated to $535 million in net interest income and a net interest margin of 1.61%. Moving to the asset side of the balance sheet, following the securities sales completed in November and January related to our portfolio repositionings and the increase in deposits, average cash on our balance sheet increased by nearly $10 billion or 38%. The duration of our securities portfolio is now 1.7 years. Average loan balances were just below $42 billion, down 1% both sequentially and relative to the prior year. Our end-of-period loan balances were again elevated at $47 billion, reflected -- reflecting market timing dynamics. Our loans have since returned to approximately $41 billion. The heightened activity at the end of the quarter did not have a material impact on net interest income in either the first or second quarters. The total balance sheet duration continues to be less than one year. Our average liquidity levels remain very strong, with highly liquid assets comprising 58% of our deposits and nearly 50% of total earning assets on average. Our net interest income is highly sensitive to deposit levels and will continue to be driven largely by client deposit behavior. Assuming a stable rate environment, minimal incremental pricing pressure and some variability in deposit volume, we currently expect a 3% to 5% sequential decline in NII. Turning to Page 8. As reported, non-interest expenses were $1.4 billion in the first quarter, down 2% sequentially and up 6% as compared to the prior year. Excluding notable items in both periods as listed on the slide, expenses in the first quarter were up 4% sequentially and up 6% year-over-year, translates to 145 basis points of year-over-year trust fee operating leverage in the quarter. Our expense to trust fee ratio, however, remained elevated at 118%. I'll hit on just a few highlights which exclude all notable items. Compensation expense was up a little over 5% versus the prior year and up 11% sequentially. The sequential increase reflected approximately $45 million in seasonal equity incentive payments and the impact of current-year incentives from higher profitability. Full-time equivalent headcount was essentially flat sequentially and down 800 or 3% over the prior year. Non-compensation expense was up 7% year-over-year, mostly due to increased depreciation and amortization expense within equipment and software as new projects continue to be put into service and growth in tech spend and other consulting areas within outside services. Market-related expenses such as market data, third-party advisory fees and costs associated with our supplemental pension plans, which are sensitive to underlying equity and fixed income movements were also up $13 million year-over-year, which added 100 basis points to our expense growth. Finally, we experienced favorability in the occupancy line, reflecting actions we took last year to rationalize our footprint. As we look out into the second quarter, I'll touch on our largest expense categories. Compensation expense will no longer contain the seasonal equity incentives from Q1, but will include the impact from last year's base pay adjustments of $65 million in the aggregate spread over the second, third, and fourth quarters. It also reflects modest employee headcount growth associated with growth in the underlying businesses. All in, this should translate to a sequential decrease of $35 million to $40 million. Within outside services, we could see as much as a $10 million to $15 million sequential lift, reflecting ongoing technology, including costs related to cybersecurity and other resiliency expenditures. We also expect to incur the lagged impact from various market-related fees. Within equipment and software, we also expect to see a $10 million to $15 million sequential increase, of which roughly half is incremental depreciation and amortization. Sequentially, growth was flat in the first quarter, so there's some timing-related impact, but we don't expect to see the same step up in the second half of the year. Our capital levels and regulatory ratios remain strong in the quarter, and we continue to operate at levels well above our required regulatory minimums. Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio under the standardized approach was flat with the prior quarter at 11.4% as capital accretion offset a modest increase in risk-weighted asset levels. This reflects a 440 basis point buffer above our regulatory requirements. Tier 1 leverage ratio was 7.8%, down 30 basis points from the prior quarter. In quarter end, our unrealized pretax loss on available-for-sale securities was $710 million. Overall, we returned $285 million to common shareholders in the quarter through cash dividends of $153 million and common stock repurchases of $132 million. And with that, Maddie, please open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Mike O\u2019Grady: Good morning, Alex. Alex Blostein : Hey, good morning, Jason, Mike, [John and everybody] (ph). So I wanted to start maybe with NII guidance down 3% to 5% for the second quarter. Sounds like the biggest driver there is your assumptions around deposits. So maybe give us a sense of kind of where deposits stand today, perhaps what was the source of upside that you saw over the course of the quarter? And then just curious on within that guide, do you guys assume any benefits from the Visa proceeds that I'm guessing is going to be at least temporarily parked in cash? Jason Tyler : Yep. So, I'll go through a couple of dynamics there. One, just going back to first quarter and what happened that we saw really nice improvement in deposit levels, and it was across both asset servicing and wealth management. And the overall base increased nicely, but that end of quarter level of $124 billion, there's some very chunky large clients that we always have in place and that sometimes can have -- lead to significant increases. That was definitely the case at the end. So we have seen deposits come down, and in the first couple of weeks of the quarter. And -- but that said, the run-up we had at the end of the quarter, that wasn't really the driver of the average. It happened very late in the quarter. So the end of first quarter in general was good. As we look out into second quarter, we've got to remember that things like the buildup that we have in April for tax payments. which, frankly, was part of the dynamic of where we ended the quarter, that starts to go away as tax payments get made and so deposits come down. That's one of the factors. And so we could even at this point, be at a peak for the quarter. And then you asked about Visa. No significant lift from that in the quarter. You're right, it's going to be parked at least in the short run. We've got ideas on what to do there. But in the very short run, would be parked in cash but not a significant lift. The impact is more from a capital and leverage perspective more than NII in the short run. And just in general, you got to remember, this has just been -- it has been very hard to predict deposit levels. And it's not us driving it. We're -- we did a lot of work with clients to make sure they know that we want deposits and feel like we did a really good job on that. But this has been the most difficult area of the income statement to predict. Alex Blostein : I got you. Yeah, and all makes sense. I guess as a follow-up to that, so we'll stick with the NII related questions. You guys saw a pretty meaningful pickup in cash as you highlighted, so $10-ish billion sequentially. How are you guys thinking about redeploying that over time? Should we generally expect the cash balances on the asset side of the balance sheet to remain fairly elevated, especially given the sort of uncertain rates backdrop and perhaps higher for longer or at what point do you feel comfortable extending that into securities? Jason Tyler : Yeah. It's another dynamic that feeds into your first question, actually. We brought duration [on] (ph) the securities portfolio. And more importantly, which feeds into your question, the duration of the balance sheet is very short right now. That was strategic. We felt like that was the right thing to do. That's a big part of why we did the repositioning of the balance sheet. But at a point, we also might take the opportunity to extend a little bit. Usually, the rate curve means that, that would be helpful. But in this rate curve environment, you might end up giving a little bit -- giving up a little bit on NIM. And so you're right that cash, very elevated part of that is because of the chunky nature of some of the deposits. And you just want to stay very short there. And -- but part of it has been strategic as we've let a lot of maturities just roll and then obviously, the repositioning was done intending to come to the shorter part of the yield curve. But where we are now and our anticipation of -- our view of the yield curve, we're more at a neutral point right now. And depending on what we see in the economy might take an opportunity to step out. Alex Blostein : I got you. All makes sense. Thanks very much, Jason. Jason Tyler : Sure. Thanks. Operator : We will take our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala. Jason Tyler : Good morning, Ebrahim. How are you? Ebrahim Poonawala : Good morning, Jason. How are you? So I guess maybe moving on expenses. I just want to make sure we heard you right. Comp expense is down about 35% to 40% sequentially. And then I think you counted services and equipment and software both up 10% to 15% quarter-over-quarter? Jason Tyler : That's right. Ebrahim Poonawala : So does that imply relatively flat expenses in 2Q? And I guess the question is, just give us some visibility around -- you've talked previously about the focus in terms of flexing expenses lower, bringing the expense growth below last year's 4.8%. Just give us a sense of the work that's being done, your level of confidence in terms of hitting some of those targets around the expense to trust fee asset ratio? Jason Tyler : Yeah. So first of all, that goal of 5% or below, that is still the goal. And secondly, it's early in the year. And we got through first quarter and a little bit above that. But at the same time, we're still working very hard to get expenses down. And the numbers that we gave in the opening give a sense of some of the bigger line items. But there are other areas where we're continuing to push and even on those items, we're continuing to push hard. We're constantly trying to find opportunities to get expenses down. Enormous focus inside the company. And you're right to confirm the numbers that we had there in things like outside services where we've got tech services and even cloud migration and consulting, those are all areas where we've seen some elevation, all for strategic reasons, but we've got to find productivity and make sure we're finding efficiencies to get expenses where we want them to be early in the year, and we're still pushing for that 5% or better. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. And just I guess one follow-up to... Jason Tyler : Yeah, one thing, just sorry to interrupt, Ebrahim. Yeah, I think as we think about the first quarter of the year, I think people should also appreciate how much the lift in markets had an impact on our expenses. And so when you think about things anywhere from market data to third-party advisory fees to sub-custody and referenced it quickly earlier on, but even something like the market's impact on our supplemental benefit plans has significant impact on expenses. But for that supplemental benefit plan expense, there's an offsetting increase in revenues. There's no impact to profitability. So we got to put that aside a little bit. And -- but the lift in markets definitely has an impact. And so a lot of the work that we've done in the first quarter and over the last year, it masked a little bit, but that's just something we should all keep in mind as we've gone through this period of the S&P being up 25% year-over-year, 10% to 12% on a sequential quarter basis. That plays into expenses as well. Ebrahim Poonawala : That's helpful. Thanks for that. And just one quick follow-up. I appreciate that it's very hard to sort of handicap deposit behavior, but just give us a sense of pricing competitively? Have things stabilized, gotten better today versus three or six months ago? Thank you. Jason Tyler : Pricing specifically and [what\u2019s here] (ph) in deposits. Yeah. We did see -- one of the biggest benefits we had in the quarter was that pricing came through better than we anticipated. We actually were up a couple of basis points in NIM and had anticipated that to go in the opposite direction. And so -- and we've been a broken record saying we're not a price maker or a price taker in this, but I think a lot of the work that we did, communicating with clients and bringing on high-quality deposits, it helped. And so it appears that, that pricing pressure that we were experiencing very significantly in third quarter in particular, it has abated things, less pressure on that dynamic right now. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. Thank you. Jason Tyler : You bet. Operator : We will take our next question from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Jason Tyler : Good morning, Ken. How are you doing? Ken, if you are talking, you are muted. Mokshith Reddy : Hey guys, this is Mokshith on behalf of Ken. Could you just talk about your servicing pipelines and just your wealth management growth? Just some more color on that would be fantastic. Jason Tyler : Sure. Mike O\u2019Grady: Sure. I'll start off with wealth management. So we did see nice organic growth in the first quarter, and we expect that to continue as we go forward. As was mentioned in the commentary there, I continue to see it on the advisory fee side of the equation. And also, we've gone through a number of quarters where the product level fees in wealth management have been more of a headwind just related to flows in some of the specific asset categories, and we saw that subside in the first quarter. So we expect that to also be a positive going forward. And you heard our family office business growing at a higher rate in the first quarter, also seeing strength in ultra-high net worth, which -- those are the two segments that we're primarily focused on. And I would say in asset servicing, the growth has been relatively broad-based, certainly seeing strength with asset owners in North America, but also in Europe as well. So that has been a positive. And we're seeing it outside of, I'll say, core asset servicing with the capital markets area being an area where with integrated trading solutions, we're seeing that as a, I'll say, an increasingly utilized area for us to generate new relationships and then broaden them out from there. So I feel good about the breadth of the organic growth in that business as well. Mokshith Reddy : Got it. Just another question on just flow of client assets between cash and fee generating and where that stands? Jason Tyler : Yeah. So the -- overall, the cash has been obviously a positive story, not just in deposits, but also in our money market mutual fund complex, which is up meaningfully sequentially and year-over-year. And that complex is very important to us. It's highly profitable. it's large. So our most sophisticated clients see it as a good opportunity to invest there with good yield with the benefits of being in a collective fund but at the same time, not having significant concentration. And so the overall liquidity and cash in the investment management business, but also in the broader financial model has played very significantly into the strength of the quarter. Mokshith Reddy : Thanks for taking my questions. Jason Tyler : Of course. Operator : We will take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Jason Tyler : Good morning, Betsy. Nice to hear you. Welcome back. Betsy Graseck : Good, thanks. Just wanted to make sure you could hear me. So I guess two questions. One on capital. And I realize that your business model is one that is capital rich. And just wanted to understand how you think about capital -- levels of capital accretion and when is the right time to start leaning in more to buybacks given the excess capital that you have. Jason Tyler : So the -- you're right that the capital levels are strong. And even with where we are right now at 11.4% in CET1, I'd argue that that's a little artificially low right now. We talked about the fact that loans were elevated because of the operational dynamics at the end of the quarter. And so we expect -- RWA is already down as a result of loan volumes, which we mentioned earlier coming back more to normal levels. Plus, we've got $700 million in AOCI, pulling the par, plus we've got Visa, and plus we're still returning on an operating basis at a good level. And so those are all good. They're also -- and you're right to note that we like having strong capital levels and still able to develop good returns at these levels. And we also are always looking at where our peers are to make sure that when we say strong, it's not just absolute, but relative. Now all that said, particularly with Visa coming online, you can imagine likely going to have an upward impact on the trajectory of share repurchase. It's not like we're going to do something enormous right away, but it goes into our capital framework and with capital levels being higher as a result of that and even in anticipation of it, it obviously will have an upward lift, all other things equal. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Great. And then, separate question just on -- I think you mentioned earlier about opportunities to extend duration in the book -- in the securities book at some point, and maybe you could just give us some context and color as to how you're thinking about that, given the fact that typically you have a very, very short duration. So when you say longer duration, what are you thinking about in terms of how long is long? Thanks. Jason Tyler : Yeah. That\u2019s a good focus and everything is relative. So we had gotten out to about two years on the securities portfolio a couple of years ago and now being meaningfully under one year, it gives you at least some sense of range. But I also think it's important to note everybody should take a lesson from what we've seen in the markets over the last couple -- in banking over the last year that deposits have a shorter duration than anybody anticipated. And so on bias, we're going to be shorter relative to history than what we have been before but we're quite short right now. And particularly as deposits seem to be leveling off in general and a little bit more predictable, it gives us an opportunity and more confidence and then we have to test, do we see the investment opportunities? And does the yield curve indicate to us that it makes sense to go out. And that's part of the reason that we've been shorter. We felt like it was -- that it was going to be better to be at the short end of the curve over the last year that led to that repositioning work that we did. And so it's not going to be dramatic, but given the way the shape of the yield curve is right now, any step-out protects us nicely from significant declines in short-term rates, but it gives up a little bit in short-term NII. Betsy Graseck : Yeah, got it. Okay. Thank you. That's very clear. Jason Tyler : Great. Operator : We will take our next question from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Jason Tyler : Good morning, Brennan. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Hey, how are you, Jason? Got a couple of follow-ups. One on the deposit front. Jason, you commented how deposits have declined, but it seemed like you were commenting more on an EOP basis than versus the average. We saw the average balances of above that $100 million to $110 million range that you had previously talked about, we saw some stability in noninterest bearing. So when we think about the go forward on an average basis, have we hit a level where now things should be relatively stable comparing it to where we were on an average basis? I appreciate that you said this is the hardest part of the balance sheet to predict. So I recognize I'm asking a challenging question. Jason Tyler : Yeah. I think I said our overall financial results to predict. It's been really hard. That's -- you're right to point out that the comments I made were relative to the $124 million. We have seen, obviously, balances come down. We naturally do the first couple of weeks of the quarter. But this dynamic of tax payments is one that can have an impact. And also just the fact that clients may be doing exactly what we were talking about a minute ago with Betsy's question of thinking about redeploying out of cash into different types of securities and maybe buying treasuries, that has a dynamic as well or maybe moving into money market funds to pick up, even if it's not six months or two years of duration, taking up 45 days. And so, all those dynamics have a downward impact on average deposits. And we just want to make sure we're prepared for that as we think about the scenarios. We're trying to give you guys a reasonable estimate of the upside downside that we feel. And -- but that -- having deposits down meaningfully in the quarter, that's inside our expectation of what could happen. Mike O\u2019Grady: And, Brennan, it's Mike. Just to add at a very macro level, if you just look at deposits starting back pre-pandemic and then quantitative easing obviously had a very meaningful impact on those deposit levels going up. And then we saw the reverse with quantitative tightening. And so some of this will depend on just the broader macro impact of tightening and when the Fed and other central banks decide to stop bringing down the size of their balance sheet. And I think then we'll reach a new level of normalization of deposit levels. And right now, we're, I would say, well above the pre-pandemic quantitative easing levels. So to the extent that we're closer to the end of quantitative tightening, the expectation would be that we start to settle out somewhere in this neighborhood. Operator : We will take our next question from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Jason Tyler : Good morning, Brian. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks. Good morning, good morning. If I can ask my first question on NII. So just looking at the second half and of course, everything is difficult to predict with deposits and everything. But if you can just talk about how Visa might work its way, I think there's a couple of stages of deployment, so it's more of a 3Q and 4Q lift versus 2Q. I think you said it was pretty minimal for the 2Q guide. Maybe just talk about the timing of that? And then I guess, do you see a scenario in which you might actually have positive net interest revenue growth in '24 versus '23 given the really strong start to the year? Jason Tyler : Sure. So just on timing of Visa, you're right. We'll be able to get a portion of it done here in the second quarter, but some of it will bleed over into third quarter. And if you're just correlating to what's the impact on NII, obviously, that -- it doesn't have that much lift just because we're not getting as much timing from it. But you're right, there will be some lift. But I\u2019ll come back to the -- the biggest benefit of Visa is more on its capital and our liquidity. If you think about the most simplest component of putting those dollars at the Fed at IOER or IORB, then you don't get a dramatic lift beyond what would happen with a $0.5 billion or $700 million deposit coming in. And so at no cost, but it's not that dramatic of an impact. And so the real help is a little bit longer term and us being able to think about strategic ways to deploy that and ensuring that we get a good return on it. So we're trying to keep a lot of different paths open. But -- and again, this is also half of the position that we're talking about this year. there's still another half to come, hopefully, next year and some of that may bleed further. Brian Bedell : And then on the possibility for NII growth in '24, given the start? Jason Tyler : Yeah. I think it's -- you started with it. It's so early in the year to predict that and to predict where things go. We're still getting some lift from different components of maturities coming in and other elements. And so there are some tailwinds that we have, but it's very difficult to predict that far out. Brian Bedell : Yep. And then just on expenses, the second quarter, the numbers you gave, obviously, there was just the biggest categories that looks to me like that [Technical Difficulty] guidance that you gave, not including other things. Just I guess if you can confirm if that's accurate. And then based on your comments of working harder on expenses and getting some of this -- looks to be some of that seasonal lift in the second half, kind of getting pulled forward, should we maybe less expense build in the second half versus the second quarter that we typically see on the seasonal lift? And then putting that all together is -- I know you're targeting obviously positive operating leverage on fees. But if you actually have a good NII backdrop, maybe we actually potentially see positive operating leverage inclusive of NII, so on total revenue. Jason Tyler : Yeah. So I'm going to hit the second and third parts of that. You broke up on the first. I'm going to ask you to repeat it when I go through part of it. On the second half lift in expenses, absolutely right. Second quarter is a big step-up. It's a big step-up in both outside services and equipment and software, not seeing those types of increases in the second half at all. Not saying they're going to be flat, but definitely not -- that's not the trajectory that we will be on. And we're working very hard to find productivity and a lot of that can be inside this year. And so still work to be done there. And then as we think about fee operating leverage, that's what we focus a lot on. I mean the NII is unpredictable, and it's less correlated from a management perspective to expenses. And so the real focus is on fee operating leverage. And so -- and that's how we think about the financial model and ensuring that we're being disciplined about the expenses relative to what we're bringing on. Mike talked about bringing on more scalable business that has -- that improves our chances of getting good fee operating leverage, but I wouldn't comment on overall operating leverage given the volatility and lack of controllability in NII. But tell me what we missed on the first part of your question. Brian Bedell : It was just a technical on the guidance you gave for 2Q. I think it implies expenses down like $10 million to $15 million versus 1Q, just on at least the categories that you talked about and the three different ranges that you put out there. I just want to make sure that was -- I want to confirm that was accurate. Jason Tyler : Yeah. Let me -- I can go through the chunks that we talked about really quickly. So the implication would be that compensation would be down $35 million to $40 million and equipment, software and outside services each up $10 million to $15 million. Brian Bedell : Yep. Okay, great. Thank you very much. Jason Tyler : You bet. Operator : We will take the next question from David Smith with Autonomous Research. Jason Tyler : Hey, David. David Smith : Good morning. Just speaking a bit more about balance sheet positioning, setting aside the somewhat artificial nature of the 10-K asset sensitivity disclosures everyone has, can you give us your best real-world guess right now for the incremental NII impact of more versus fewer Fed cuts, putting both pricing and balance sheet volume dynamics together? Jason Tyler : Yeah. It's assuming -- you're right to point to the supplemental disclosures have the sensitivities to it. But if you're thinking more about -- those are more stressed, up 100 basis points, 200 basis points and more. If you're thinking more about single or double rate cuts, then it's difficult to -- it's actually difficult to tell. And you can see just assuming what's more likely of a 25 basis points or 50 basis point decline. We're going to be following the market and what happens there. And there are scenarios in which you could see banks trying to hold on to deposits and others saying that they want to hold on to margin. And so even on the way up, it was not a linear exercise for us. The betas were very low at the beginning of the increase. And then at the end of the increasing cycle, the betas were very, very high, in some instances, over 100%. And so it's just difficult to predict right now. There's no science. We debate internally even what the most likely impact is for these first couple of cuts on the way down. David Smith : Okay. And then one other NII follow-up. Do you think you're done with securities repositions at this point? Or could we see another one later in the year? Jason Tyler : Unlikely we'll see another one. We got a lot of the -- a lot of what we did, a lot of the very low-yielding securities. And remember, there's real benefit from a capital perspective as well and being able to take some of the securities that had negative RWA treatment and reinvest those in cash at a point in the yield curve where we felt that's where we wanted to be incrementally from a strategic perspective, from an investment perspective and also have improvement from the capital perspective. That trade, each time we've done it, that component of the repositioning has lessened an impact. And so it is much less likely, but that's just given the current state of the yield curve and how we feel about the economic environment. David Smith : And lastly, anything you can do to help us think about using the Visa proceeds for organic versus inorganic investment opportunities? Jason Tyler : Yeah. It's -- we're obviously looking really hard at ways internally to make sure we're investing anywhere we can to grow at attractive capital levels. Our return on capital is -- targets are 10% to 15%, and we're putting that same type of framework in place as this capital comes in. And to the extent, the best thing we can do is grow with our existing types of businesses and with our existing clients. That said, we have not been short capital before. And so it's not like there are things we could do, but we couldn't afford it from a capital perspective. And so it's -- it's not like there's a laundry list of things we can say, now we can go get this done. And so we're going to be prudent and patient, but at the same time, not hesitate to reflect our capital framework, which at this point would indicate, all other things equal, a little bit bias heavier on share repurchase. David Smith : That's helpful. Thank you. Jason Tyler : Sure. Operator : We will take our next question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Sharon Leung : Hey, good morning. This is actually Sharon Leung filling in for Steven this morning. Just a quick follow-up on non-interest bearing deposits. They seem to have stabilized this quarter and are now about 15% of the total. Do you think that this is kind of like a good trough level, even if you see continued deposit pressures related to QT, et cetera? Jason Tyler : They -- it's definitely flattened out in terms of even the percentage decline despite the fact that we had an overall increase in deposits. And so non-interest bearing deposits performed well relative to what we would have expected and definitely seemed to have flattened out. Didn't grow as much as the rest of the base, but performed well in the period. So not predicting a significant movement down at this point. Sharon Leung : Okay, great. And then just to follow up on AUM and AUC growth, saw healthy expansion, but can you talk about what maybe drove some of the pressure on fee rates across your business this quarter? Jason Tyler : Yeah, the fee rates, I think, is -- I always caution to focus on that when we apply it to our asset levels, whether it's on assets under management or assets under custody, because only a portion of the business, roughly half is even tied to asset levels and then a lot of the contracts that we have get to transaction volumes and then there's significant mix shift. Areas like our family office business are going to have a lower overall yield on assets relative to the regions in wealth management, for example. And then there's other components in asset servicing that are very similar. And so we actually don't do a lot of analysis on -- as we're unpacking the quarter or the year, we're not looking at those rate changes as the biggest indicators of what's happening in the business. We're looking more granularly at what's happening with our clients, the mix within different products and what's happening in the regions and family office, et cetera. Sharon Leung : Great. Thank you. Jason Tyler : Sure. Operator : We do not have any further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Jennifer Childe for closing remarks. Jennifer Childe : Thanks, operator, and thanks everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again in the future. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

This will allow us to move through the queue, and enable as many people as possible the opportunity to ask questions as time permits. Thank you, again for joining us today. Let me turn the call over to Mike O'Grady. Mike O'Grady: Thank you, Jennifer. Let me join in welcoming you to our second quarter 2024 earnings call. Our results for the quarter reflect continued progress executing against our strategic priorities, boosted by strong underlying equity markets and favorable client activity levels. Trust fees were up a solid 6% over the prior year. Deposit levels proved resilient and our capital levels reached a multi-year high. In the quarter, we participated in the Visa Class B common stock exchange offer, positioning us to monetize 50% of our long-held stake in Visa. As a result, we recognized a pre-tax gain of nearly $900 million with another 50% of shares still to be monetized. We intend to use the Visa proceeds to fund additional share repurchases, contribute to our charitable foundation and make investments in the resiliency of our business. Reported results also included approximately $200 million in restructuring charges and other notable items, reflecting our continued efforts to optimize our cost base, drive efficiencies and effect change within the organization. Jason will discuss the details in a few minutes. Turning to the performance of the business units. Wealth Management generated 9% year-over-year trust fee growth and our new business momentum remains strong. We're continuing to generate interest from our Secrets of Enterprising Families national book tour, and we're seeing solid success from digital marketing initiatives. In May, we hosted our Annual Northern Trust Institute Symposium, attracting more than 1,500 influential estate planning attorneys, trust practitioners and other wealth industry specialists who serve as key referral sources. We also celebrated the opening of our new office in New York City. Asset Management generated positive liquidity flows for the sixth consecutive quarter and delivered strong performance within active fixed income. We raised assets in the private equity space in the quarter, although index flows have otherwise been soft. NTAM continued to leverage our One Northern Trust strategy delivering clients the solutions and capabilities of the entire firm. Joint meetings between our asset management and asset servicing businesses accelerated in the second quarter, leading to more than 100 new business opportunities and 15 wins year-to-date. NTAM also launched seven new funds in the second quarter, expanding our global liquidity business and adding to our fixed-income solutions. Our asset servicing business performed well in the quarter. Transaction volumes were healthy, capital markets activities were up 16% and new business growth continues to be booked at attractive margins. As we discussed, our goal was to generate new business that is scalable. We've shifted our sales focus to opportunities that require lower levels of incremental costs while emphasizing approaches with multiple points of connectivity. In addition to the bundled sales generated with NTAM, more than 140 existing asset servicing clients have expanded their relationships with us by adding services such as capital markets and data analytics. We're being disciplined on pricing and bidding on fewer opportunities. In spite of our new focused approach, asset servicing continues to realize momentum, particularly among asset owners. In the second quarter, Northern Trust was appointed as the new custodian and asset servicing provider for Nest Invest, the United Kingdom's largest workplace pension scheme. Initially an NTAM client, Nest supports 13 million members and has AUM of approximately $45 billion. Our ability to manage sophisticated strategies and the flexibility of our open architecture approach were the key factors that helped secure this highly competitive win. In North America, we've achieved more than 30 new wins year-to-date among asset owners. We entered the second half of the year with strong market tailwinds and good new business momentum, well-positioned to navigate the current macroeconomic environment and generate value for our stakeholders. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jason to review our financial performance for the quarter. Jason? Jason Tyler : Thank you, Mike. And let me join Jennifer and Mike in welcoming you to our second quarter 2024 earnings call. Let's dive into the financial results of the quarter, starting on Page 4. This morning, we reported second quarter net income of $896 million, earnings per share of $4.34 and our return on average common equity was 31.2%. Our reported results included an $878 million net pre-tax gain related to Visa and $196 million of restructuring charges and other notable items, which I'll discuss in more detail shortly. Our assets under custody and administration and assets under management were up modestly on a sequential basis and up sharply on a year-over-year basis. Strong equity markets drove the year-over-year improvement. Excluding notable items in all periods, revenue was up 5% on a year-over-year basis and 1% sequentially. Expenses were up 6.6% over the prior year and essentially flat sequentially. Trust, investment and other servicing fees totaled $1.2 billion, a 2% sequential increase and a 6% increase compared to last year. Excluding notables in both periods, all other non-interest income on an FTE basis was down 2% sequentially and up 9% over the prior year. We experienced good momentum in our FX trading business, where we saw another strong quarter of client volume. Net interest income on an FTE basis was $530 million, down 1% sequentially and up 1% from a year ago. Our credit quality remains very strong with no net charge-offs and non-performing loans representing 9 basis points of total loans. Turning to our asset servicing results on Page 5. Assets under custody and administration for asset servicing clients were $15.5 trillion at quarter-end, with asset servicing fees totaling $651 million. Custody and fund administration fees were $446 million, up 4% year-over-year, driven by both strong underlying equity markets and new business activities. Assets under management for asset servicing clients were $1.1 trillion. Investment management fees within asset servicing were $146 million, up 9% year-over-year due to favorable markets and strong flows into our institutional liquidity funds. Moving to our wealth management business on Page 6. Assets under management for our wealth management clients were $419 billion at quarter-end. Trust, investment and other servicing fees for wealth management clients of $516 million, up 8% year-over-year due primarily to strong equity markets and asset inflows within Global Family Office. Turning to Page 7 and our balance sheet and net interest income trends. Average deposits were $113 billion, up $1 billion or 1% from the first quarter, modestly better than our expectations. Deposit costs increased slightly due to a handful of large thinly priced deposits. Shifting to the asset side of the balance sheet, our average earning assets increased 1% on a linked-quarter basis, primarily due to higher deposit levels and the proceeds from the partial sale of our Visa shares. Our average liquidity levels remain very strong with highly-liquid assets equal to 60% of our deposits and more than 50% of total earning assets on average. The duration of our securities portfolio is 1.7 years and the total balance sheet duration continues to be less than 1 year. Net interest income was $530 million and our net interest margin was 1.57%. Turning to Page 8. As reported, non-interest expense was $1.5 billion in the second quarter up 12% sequentially and up 15% as compared to the prior year. Excluding notable items in both periods as listed on the slide, expenses in the second quarter were flat sequentially. Now let's take a step back and discuss how we're approaching the Visa stake. This is an asset we held on the balance sheet at zero value since Visa went public over 15 years ago. Entering the quarter, the position was approximately $1.8 billion in value on a pre-tax basis. With the ability in the second quarter to liquidate half of our position at full value, the Visa transaction provides an opportunity to return more capital to shareholders, while accelerating certain strategic priorities. With this first conversion of shares, we're taking the following steps, as Mike highlighted. First, a meaningful portion of the proceeds will be used to increase pacing in our share repurchases. We began that process within the second quarter and will continue elevated levels over the next several quarters. Second, approximately 10% of the after-tax proceeds being contributed to our foundation. This pre-fund some of our community giving. That contribution is fully accounted for in the second quarter. Third, the Visa share conversion enables us to accelerate strategic investments over the next several quarters to modernize our technology infrastructure and enhance our resiliencies. This includes investments in refreshing our tech infrastructure, automating manual processes, enhancing risk management systems, reducing end-of-life platforms, strengthening our cyber defenses and accelerating cloud migration. These investments will further strengthen service levels and enhance the client experience while reducing risk and generating efficiencies. This incremental modernization and resiliency spend is visible this quarter in the outside services line. We'll continue to update you on our progress. Separately, we also announced nearly $200 million in restructuring charges and notable expenses. The larger items included severance expense of $85 million associated with a significant reduction in force split between both compensation and outside services expense, various software write-downs and accelerations and the $70 million contribution to our foundation, I mentioned earlier. Now, let's go back and review our core expenses from the quarter, which exclude all notable items. Compensation expense was up a little less than 3% versus the prior year, moderately better than we anticipated. As some anticipated hiring was shifted into third-party consulting work in conjunction with the incremental modernization and resiliency spend visible within the outside services line. Full-time equivalent headcount was down 500 or 2% over the prior year and essentially flat sequentially. Outside services expense increased by 12% relative to the prior period, the bulk of which reflects the incremental modernization and resiliency spend. Equipment and software expense increased by 3% sequentially, slightly better than anticipated, reflecting higher software consumption and amortization from projects coming online. Excluding notables, our expense to trust fee ratio improved 200 basis points on a sequential quarter basis to 116%. As we look out to the third quarter, we expect our sequential expense growth adjusted for notable items to be up approximately 1%. Equipment and software expenses are expected to range between $270 million to $275 million, largely reflecting investments in technology and systems upgrades associated with the modernization and resiliency initiatives. We do not expect a material increase in outside services in the third quarter from the current elevated level. Turning to Page 9. Our capital levels and regulatory ratios remain strong in the quarter, and we continue to operate at levels well above our required regulatory minimums. Based on the 2024 CCAR results, our stress capital buffer will remain at the 2.5% minimum requirement. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio under the standardized approach increased 120 basis points to 12.6%. The decrease in RWA levels, the Visa transaction and capital accretion drove the improvement. This reflects the 560 basis point buffer above our regulatory requirements. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 8%, up 20 basis points from the prior quarter. At quarter-end, our unrealized pre-tax loss on available-for-sale securities was $667 million. We generated $607 million in the quarter from the sale of Visa shares and expect to generate another $300 million in proceeds in early August. We returned $405 million to common shareholders in the quarter through cash dividends of $154 million and common stock repurchases of $251 million. And with that, Jessica, please open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Excellent. Thanks so much. Okay. Yeah, sure. Two-part question. First is just on the remaining embedded gains in the Visa that you still have. I know you mentioned that there's -- it is still some realization to come. Are you talking about the piece -- the one-third piece that's coming in the third quarter? Is that what you're referencing? Or are you referencing the broader point that you still have more Visa shares and the next time this is able to get done, you'll have access there? Jason Tyler : Yes. Yes, it's both. So if you just -- you're close to it, but for people that may not be that this first tranche that first enable us to monetize half, but enable us to convert half. But that's split into actually selling it in three pieces as you're referencing. Two of those pieces are done, one is still yet to come in August. When that's done, we'll still have half of the entire pool left to at some point in the future to convert and monetize. Betsy Graseck : Right. And that's a function of the Visa side and the B shares being opened up to monetize. That's there. It's not only your decision to do that? Jason Tyler : Yes, correct, not at all. And as soon as -- and we've said all along, Visa is not a strategic asset for us. And so we haven't wanted to monetize more at a meaningful discount in the private markets. And so, we've waited to be able to do it in the public markets. This enabled us to do it with no discount and we'll likely pursue a similar path when the remaining shares are opened up for conversion. Betsy Graseck : And then just a separate part is on the resiliency investments that you're making. What's your sense of the timeframe for the investments? I would think it's a multi-year timeframe, but be helpful to understand your point of view on that. Thank you. Jason Tyler : Sure. So I think about it in two pieces. One is that there's elevated spending right now as we get the project accelerated. That's why it's showing up more in outside services. And as we get some of the technology spend there and some third-party outside help on getting some things executed, that will -- that should last in that line item at about this current level for the next few quarters. Eventually, that's going to decline as some of that, that initial project work is done. But at the same time, we'll over time see an increase in compensation as some of the work continues in more of a persistent environment by actual FTE but not likely at the same elevated level of where we are today. So that's the overall view of how it should work. Operator : We'll go next to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Mokshith Reddy : Hey, it's Mokshith on for Ken. Just wanted to ask about just NII cadence for the rest of the year. What are you assuming on deposit levels, deposit rates and where we can see that going forward? I just wanted some color on that. Jason Tyler : Sure. Yes. So balances are much more stable than they were last year, obviously and our client engagements worked well. At this point, the bigger factor definitely appears to be rates. So there's no estimate for us to share for third quarter. But in that period, we do tend to see a slight seasonal decline in balances. And so there's a couple of puts and takes to keep in mind. One, the seasonal decline in balances, but then that could be offset by the fact that we still have positive impact of reinvestment spread day count improvement and then some other factors. Mokshith Reddy : Okay, fantastic. Just more on just servicing. What are you seeing out there in terms of pipelines and anything on wealth management, whether -- how the flows are there of client assets? Jason Tyler : Sure. I'll start and Mike may jump in. So on asset servicing, we -- Mike and I both referenced it briefly, the overall activity in the business from a net new business perspective is, I think very positive. The impact in this quarter comes from the fact that we've got one client exit that we've known about for a long time. The big exits we have with -- we can -- we have longer line of sight on and that finally took place within the quarter, which reduced our trust fees by a few million dollars in the quarter. I should also note, we also have line of sight to another similar dollar amount impact in next -- in third quarter that will come in but overall the volume of activity is good and pipeline is strong within the business. Mike? Mike O'Grady: Yes. The only thing I would add is as I mentioned, we've really focused our strategy on the opportunities that we think are most attractive for our value proposition. So those opportunities where we can be compensated for what we believe to be as a higher service level for the clients that has meant being more disciplined around pricing. As I mentioned, in certain cases, it means not bidding on it if we believe it's going to be something that's low-cost-driven. And so far that hasn't really, I would say, reduced the overall momentum in the business and what we're seeing and the opportunities. And frankly, it's resulting in higher margins for the business that we are winning. So it's a more selective approach to it, but one so far I would say is going well. Jason Tyler : And then I'll offers two headlines on wealth and then if Mike might add more. One is the regions, the net new businesses was relatively soft, but GFO in general continues to do well, bringing on new business from existing clients and then also some nice external names. There the connectivity they have with the largest asset owners is outstanding. And that -- so that business continued to do well and a lot of initiatives inside the more wealth advisory space, the regions. The second dynamic I'll mention within the business of different view is what our clients utilizing us for both the advisory fee, the advisory component of what our clients are doing with us is doing well. It's positive both in the regions and in GFO, what -- but that's being offset by lower product utilization that tends to ebb and flow and we look more closely at the advisory component. It's more of an indication of the base of business and that's trending positively in both businesses. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will move next to Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Hey, how are you? Good morning, Jason. I was curious to know and I couldn't find a specific disclosure on this. So apologies if you have disclosed it separately, but could you tell me what percentage of your wealth management client assets are in advisory accounts? And if you know, what are the deposit costs for those accounts? Jason Tyler : I got most of that. I just want to clarify the last sentence I -- how much of it is what? Brennan Hawken : What the deposit costs on those accounts would be? Jason Tyler : Got it. I'm glad I asked because I did not hear that well. So on the first component, we actually have not historically disclosed the breakdown of our fees that come from product versus from advisory. But almost -- just at a high level, virtually all of our wealth is particularly in the regions, virtually all of those relationships have an advisory fee associated with them and the vast majority have product fees associated with them. And then in terms of deposit costs, we haven't talked about deposit costs for that group specifically, but I think where you're going with it is accurate, the deposit costs in that client base are significantly lower than on the institutional side in general. Now the GFO business, family office has some clients that are equal in size to some of our largest asset servicing clients, but the bulk of that book is priced much more with lower deposit costs relative to the institutional side. Brennan Hawken : So I don't know if you had -- were aware of this or saw this, but in the last week, at this point, three of the warehouses have come out and said that they are bringing up the deposit costs on advisory relationships up to equivalent to money fund levels. Wells and BofA did that in the second quarter. During the second quarter, Morgan Stanley just yesterday announced that they intend to do it in the third. Given that this is the direction some of the largest providers in the industry are going this direction, what are your thoughts and plans around making sure or aligning with this practice? And if you don't plan to, how do you intend to manage any legal or loss at risk on fiduciary issues? Mike O'Grady: Yeah, Brennan, it's Mike. Within the business, it's true of all of our businesses, but just to be clear, within wealth management as well, it's a competitive marketplace for all the products that we offer. And so to your point, if other competitors or service providers in the space change their pricing on anything, frankly, but to your point on deposit levels, then we absolutely have to react to that. And so that's the first point. And it's dynamic. The second, I would say is that it's also based on the holistic relationship that we have and the entirety of what we're offering for the client and as a result, the different needs that they may have. Point being, say, not every deposit is created equally. Almost as simple as just start with a checking account is different than a savings account and the terms and the nature and characteristics are different. And so the actual deposit cost, if you will, is going to be different based on that as well. But needless to say, if others are doing things in the market, we have to be able to respond in kind. Brennan Hawken : Yeah. Sure. Fair enough. Jason Tyler : One other dynamic is our suite clients within the wealth business, they already have the option to sweep on to our money market platform. Brennan Hawken : That's a feature within the system where the advisor team or whatever could just adjust the sweep default and go into the money fund rather than deposits. Mike O'Grady: And to be clear, the client has the option to select what they would like to do. Brennan Hawken : Right. Well, in an advisory relationship, there's a little bit of a different dynamic. But I got it. Okay. Just given the focus on this, it might be helpful to consider disclosing some of these details going forward, just -- I know you said you didn't have them today, but might be helpful going forward. Appreciate that. Operator : We'll go next to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Mike Mayo : Hi. Jason, you mentioned the $200 million restructuring charge, part of that is severance. What were the underlying drivers for that charge? What might cause you to do that again? And what sort of future expense saves do you expect from that, including for OpEx? Jason Tyler : Sure. So drivers really comes down to productivity, Mike. And you've heard us talk about it a lot and we've got to continually look at the activities across the business and determine, do we have the right skills? Do we have the right people? Are we in the right geographies? And importantly also, we've got to look at the span of control and the amount of layers we have in the organization. And all of those different analyses led us to the conclusion that we could -- we should take some actions here. And so we'll -- obviously even with an example like spans and layers, you might do eliminations, but then you might also replace with -- eventually with a different skill set or a different span from a leadership perspective. And so we won't get 100% savings of these salaries, but we should get at least 50%. And in general, it anticipates about half of the severance to impact our decline in the ongoing salary run rate. Now, obviously, we're growing in other areas of the company. We're growing headcount and wealth management to grow that business. We're obviously investing in resiliency. But for these areas that are affected here, we should see that type of impact in the salary line. Mike Mayo : So a permanent reduction in salary equal to about half the severance, was some of that reinvested back in the firm where you're hiring elsewhere. Is that correct? Jason Tyler : Now let me clarify. So it would be -- the total amount of impacted salary would be close to the amount of the severance line but we would reinvest about half of it. And so we should get an improvement from these areas of about in the neighborhood of $40 million run rate on the salary line. Mike Mayo : And then just more generally, maybe Mike, you talked about productivity and the custody business. And it seems like you're committed in the custody business but not just for growth but for more profitable growth. You say, you're bidding less, you're being more selective, you're picking your spot. So how would you describe Northern's positioning in the custody business today versus the past? Mike O'Grady: So a couple of points to it, Mike. One is within, broadly speaking, asset servicing at a high level, you have the services that we provide to asset owners and then the services we provide to asset managers. Now there's a lot of hybrids within that as well and crossover of services. But largely speaking, those are the kind of two big groups of clients and within the asset owner part of the space, the nature of what we're doing there is more scalable in the sense of to your point custody where adding on a new client requires less in the way of headcount addition and technology spend if you will to customize for what they're doing. Now, you've also heard us talk about certain things like front office solutions. That's a case where with an asset owner client, that we're looking to provide a higher differentiated level of capability for them and then correspondingly have a -- the associated fee that goes with providing that. So that's how I would say in the positioning there, we're trying to differentiate what we're doing, combination of capabilities like front office solutions, and with a higher level of service that is consistent I would say with our brand, with our culture and the way that we approach the client across the company. And then I would say on the asset manager side, the asset manager services that we provide to them that has been a stronger source of growth for us over the last many years but it is more resource intensive. So when you look at the headcount growth that we've had over time, a lot of that is because it's supporting bringing on new business there that does require additional partners meaning employees for us to provide that. And that's an area where I'd say we're trying to be much more selective about those relationships and the opportunities that we pursue there. So you heard me also talk about connectivity points. And the point on that, Mike, is that with an asset manager client, for example, if we're only going to do one thing for them, it's probably not going to be attractive for us whereas if we can do a number of different things across the spectrum, that's where that type of client relationship provides the level of profitability that we're looking for. So that's where I would say that the focus is when you look at the business overall but then within the segments. Operator : We'll go next to Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Maybe just one on the net interest revenue. Maybe, Jason, just your view on deposit betas across your franchise on the downside when the Fed cuts and if you could just differentiate between wealth and asset servicing? And I did see the interest-bearing deposit line on the average balance sheet. It's a smaller category, but that seemed to go down a lot. I just was wondering what was driving that. I think that's a 253 bps from 315 bps sequentially? Jason Tyler : I want to make sure I get the last -- what were you -- Brian Bedell : It's just on the average balance sheet, I think just the interest-bearing deposit with banks on the asset side, what seems to go down a lot. I didn't know if that's just noise or on the rate on that. Jason Tyler : It might be. That might be thick repo. Brian Bedell : Okay. Jason Tyler : Oh, yes, the due from banks, and we can come back to you. I think that's just noise in the reporting on a small denominator. But in general, on the betas, the -- I mean, you saw the ECB reduction, we got effectively 100% beta on that. And so we've -- at this point with rates at these levels, the betas are going to be very high. And so we -- in that example, both the standard rate card and the negotiated rates both came down in conjunction with the Central Bank change and even the negotiated rates tend to be on a spread to Central Bank rates. And so we feel like, again, in this zone of where rates are, the spread shouldn't change material. Brian Bedell : And just differentiating between wealth and the asset servicing business in terms of those deposit betas. Jason Tyler : Yes, the -- it's similar. The institutional business sometimes will have again very large and -- very large deposits. And so that won't change -- that will have more of what we should think of as a mix impact, more than an impact coming from the rate changes from Central Banks. So we gave an example even earlier in the very small number of very large deposits that can come on at tight spreads to Central Banks. And so that will tighten spreads, but that doesn't -- that's not correlated to the actual Central Bank movements, which is really more of the sphere of your question from what I'm understanding. Brian Bedell : So on the wealth, just a hammer the helmets. On the wealth side, do you -- across your franchise, do you -- Jason Tyler : The wealth side is even a higher percentage of deposits on standard rates, which again with rates at this elevated level are -- we'll be able to move in conjunction with Central Bank movements. Brian Bedell : And then just on expenses, can you -- can comment at all about the full year or are you still targeting 5% or better full-year than guess [Technical Difficulty] I guess you'd have to have a downtick in 4Q. Oh, sorry, can you hear me? No, no. Sorry, can you hear me? Can you hear me now? Jason Tyler : That's better. Brian Bedell : Okay. Thanks. I have my handset. Expense is for the full year. So I know the 1% up in 3Q. Are you still targeting the 5% or better expense growth for the full year and which would imply, I guess, a downtick in 4Q? And are you still also targeting positive fee operating leverage and maybe might that even be possible if net interest revenue continues to hold up? Might it be possible to generate operating leverage on total revenue for 2024? Jason Tyler : Yes. So on the expense -- just expense year-over-year, we -- 5% is going to be really hard. I mean, we're in the 6s first-half of the year and we -- and it's largely because of two factors. One, the markets elevated really quickly at the beginning of the year and that drove just in the first quarter alone, it drove $10 million to $15 million in lift, which is over 100 basis points year-over-year. And then in conjunction with us deciding to accelerate the resiliency work that adds in another layer. And so it's going to be hard this year and unlikely this year, but it does not -- are still our long-term target is 5% or less, and there's no reason for us to change that long-term target, just two dynamics this year. One is frankly a good one because we get positive operating leverage out of the markets being higher and another one is us positioning ourselves for lower expense growth rate in the future as a result of what we're doing on resiliency. On the operating leverage side, we on -- from a fee operating leverage side, we should get fee operating leverage in the second half of the year and we're -- the fee rates are higher, revenue is higher. And so that puts us in a good position from a total operating leverage perspective, little harder in third quarter, just based on where markets are at this point, hard to tell, but fourth quarter from what we can see at this point would be much more likely to have total operating leverage there. Operator : We'll move next to Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : Hi, hey, Jason, Mike, good morning, everybody. So I wanted to follow-up on the questions Brennan was asking earlier just as far as the wealth dynamics go? And just I guess, a couple of questions around that. I guess, one, it sounds like you're evaluating still what the competitors have done. So is it just kind of a matter of time before you guys decide to kind of go through the same process? Or I guess if you choose not to and outside of competitive pressures, pressures, are there any other ramifications that might kind of force you and the industry to go down the same path? So like in other words, are you hearing anything from the regulators? Are you hearing anything from potential risk of litigation that could sort of ultimately force the industry to go in this direction? So that's the first question. Jason Tyler : And you're talking specifically on deposits, Alex? Alex Blostein : Yes. So the wealth deposits with advisory relationship where the firm has a fiduciary duty. Jason Tyler : Yes. I just wanted to be clear -- to clarify. So in that space, we already have -- our reach has already hit the market. And clients and advisor work together to determine what they want to select from a suite perspective and they can elect suite into money market mutual funds or on to our balance sheet but the dynamics that we've read about it doesn\u2019t -- it's not reflective of our client base than of our platform. Alex Blostein : Sorry, but I guess if the industry goes to 5% and you're saying you're at market, but the market is at 5% on deposits, does that mean you guys would have to go to the market rate at 5%? Jason Tyler : No, we're closer to 5% now. Alex Blostein : And then in terms of the sizing, I think in the past, you talked about I think about a quarter of the deposit base was wealth and the other 75% was institutional. So the quarter that is wealth, can you delineate like kind of what the U.S. deposit base is? Jason Tyler : What the realized deposit space? Well, the quarter is -- the 25% is roughly right. It's a little bit less than that, but that's a ballpark. And what else are you trying to get? Alex Blostein : Just like what's the U.S. piece of that is? Is there a way to delineate that? Jason Tyler : The U.S. piece? Yes, that's virtually all of it. Alex Blostein : Okay. Jason Tyler : And then the Family Office business might have some that's -- that's non-U.S., but the vast majority of deposits on the wealth side are U.S. denominated. Alex Blostein : And then just my follow-up question is around expenses. So you guys are implementing incremental savings initiatives, so it kind of makes sense and that's causing maybe incremental technology spend this year. As you sort of think about long term and we've talked about expenses to fee ratio for many years now, but given that it's still proven to be pretty sticky at this kind of 100% and sort of 15%-ish range. What's the goalpost as you kind of put this all through and maybe takes a year, two years, three years, but what are you driving towards and how long do you think it will take you to get there? Jason Tyler : Yes, Mike, what do you want to -- Mike O'Grady: The goalposts haven't changed, Alex. I mean that when I say the timing, not even saying like how far out it is per se, but just as you know, the components of that calculation are going to move at different rates for different reasons, meaning markets and organic growth on the fee side. And then likewise, you're going to have time periods where the expense growth can be a little bit higher or a little bit lower on that part of the equation. And so the goalpost is still getting that to that 105% to 110%. We think that's our target operating range for that ratio. And as you've seen, we brought that down. Would we like it to go faster? Yes. But again, it's balancing off the things that we need to do in order to drive organic growth so that you get it the benefit of that on the ratio. And then as Jason is saying, you make certain investments that you absolutely are looking to get greater efficiencies as a result of those going forward. So we have a lot of manual processes, for example, that we're automating across not only the operations of our business, but also across other parts of the business that have to do with our risk and control. So a lot of opportunities there to, yes, improve the resiliency as we've mentioned a number of times, but also get efficiency out of it. Operator : We'll go next to Vivek Juneja with JP Morgan. Vivek Juneja : Hi, thanks. A couple of questions. Just want to understand Mike and Jason, the severance charges you're taking, it's a much larger severance charge than we've seen you've taken many years. I guess the Visa gain gives you that opportunity. When do you expect to start to sort of have that show-up in the compensation line and over what period? Jason Tyler : So we mentioned that a lot of the -- many of the actions have already been taken. And at the same time, the program that we instituted this time is more over 18 months. And so it will bleed in over -- it will get embedded over that timeframe. Vivek Juneja : But you've taken the charge right up front. Okay. Okay. All right. And when you -- so when you talk about the under 5%, I tell Mike, you said, Jason, that it's a unlikely this year. So should this make it much more likely next year? Where do you -- given especially the severance benefit that bleeds in over the next 18 months? Jason Tyler : It puts us in a -- it does put us in a better position next year. And the spirit of what we're doing, particularly with the resiliency spend is to accelerate some of the spend that we've had on our roadmap over the next several years. So that helps. And also the actions we're taking around productivity help a lot as well. And so it definitely puts us in a better position. But we're -- it's early July and it's still early to talk about what next year looks like. But from what we see right now, there's -- the things that are predictable at this point, there's no -- there's nothing that tells us we shouldn't have that 5% or better outlook for next year, and we feel like we're well-positioned for it at this point given some of the things that we talked about. Vivek Juneja : And again, related to the Visa, pardon me if I missed some -- anything because it's -- there's a lot of earnings going on this morning, but buybacks, you did some over what period should we see the rest given that you've used about a couple of hundred million. Now I know that's all pre-tax. But how much more should we expect to see and how soon? Jason Tyler : Yes, so the Visa situation is very helpful and it puts several hundred million dollars and call it, half of the after-tax proceeds in our minds available for buyback, particularly if you look at where our capital ratios -- capital levels are right now, there's no race for us to do that. And so we can do it over-time, we can do it deliberately. We also have to keep an eye on what's happening from a regulatory environment and what Basel requirements might be from a capital perspective, but we're obviously positioned very well to continue to have elevated levels of buyback. Operator : We'll go next to Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : Hi, good morning and thank you. And I'm sorry, Jason, if I'm being repetitive, I just wanted to make sure we heard you correctly. The stock was down about 8% at one point, still down a lot. I just wanted to make sure that your messaging on NII is essentially saying you expect third quarter NII to be relatively flat given the decline in balances should be offset by the investment yields? Am I hearing that correctly? And you're not really seeing any impact from these sweep deposits that have impacted some of the other banks given where you already priced deposits for your customers. Jason Tyler : Correct. We see third quarter NII at this point flat. Ebrahim Poonawala : And from there on rate cuts if we get them in September should be a positive for the NII or negative? Jason Tyler : Unlikely to -- less likely to be positive but we don't see as long as rates are at these levels and just take US, just take the fed being in the fives at this high level of rates on an absolute basis, getting 25 basis point, 50 basis point reductions at this point should not have material spread degradation. Ebrahim Poonawala : That's helpful and clear. And on the fee revenue side, apologies if you missed this. I think you mentioned, you lost a client that's going to have a few million dollars impact. I'm just trying to get a sense of what your expectations are for fee revenue all else equal as you think about the third quarter. Jason Tyler : Nothing to provide in terms of an estimate. And I mean, if you think about it, the few million dollars this quarter, a few million dollars next quarter, cumulatively, that's a reduction of $10 million round number on -- even within asset servicing on a quarterly trust fee base of over $600 million. And so we're just trying to -- once we start talking about growth in the business and about overall net new business activity that number has more of an impact but it doesn't have as much of an impact on the overall amount of fees in the business. And so that's why we called it out. It's just in the context of thinking about new business activity and organic growth where it has more of an impact on a percentage basis. But in general, the business is doing well and the activity levels, the pipeline and what we see on the horizon, still good. Just important to call out those two items. Ebrahim Poonawala : And if I can sneak in one quick follow up on expenses, the actions you took this quarter, my take -- you're not guiding for this. My takeaway is it probably sets up for an even better or lower expense growth for 2025. Is that the right way to interpret that relative to whatever you do in '24? Jason Tyler : Yes, it is. There's no doubt that as some of the expenses that we put on now, again, it's an acceleration of what we planned and some of it we do believe will come down next year. I talked about the offset as we do some hiring in some of these spaces, but we also came into this year feeling very good about the 5%, but the markets moved early and so it does give an indication that when markets move and it can impact the expenses. Again, we have positive operating leverage in that. But at this point of mid-July, I'm hesitant to talk in too much detail about 2025. We'll certainly give an update later in the year. But the spirit of your question is right in that some of the spending now positions us for even better expense trajectory management going into next year. Operator : We'll return to Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Hi, thanks for taking my follow-up. I just wanted to draw a specific understanding because it was a little unclear with Alex's follow-up to the question on the wealth deposits. Did you say that the advisory wealth deposits are currently priced at 5% or they have the option to elect for money funds that could yield 5%? I'm just trying to square all the commentary. Jason Tyler : Sure. So it's the latter. They have the ability to sweep into our money fund complex, which already is priced in the fives. And so they have the ability -- our clients have the ability to elect for that deposit mechanism now when to the extent that they -- to the extent that they are sweeping. Brennan Hawken : So just to further add a little color to my question that the option to move into money funds was available at most of the wire houses too, and they made this move. Then my understanding, due to concerns about fiduciary obligation and whether or not just basically paying out that level would be just necessary from a legal perspective. So it sounds like from your answer, you guys don't have any plans to make any change at this stage although as you said depending on competitive pressures, you may seek to make adjustments going forward. Jason Tyler : I think that's a good summary. Brennan Hawken : Excellent. Thanks very much. Jason Tyler : You bet. Operator : And we'll return to Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Vivek Juneja : Thanks. Just wanted to clarify, Jason, a comment you made which was rate cut, 25 basis points to 50 basis points should not have material spread degradations. So does that mean if we do have rate cuts, those would be hurt -- that would hurt your NIM and NII, that you are asset sensitive? Jason Tyler : No, I'm saying that as we have rate cuts at this point, we -- that the -- we should be able to pass along those declines in the form of lower deposit yields to clients in our standard rate cards and in our negotiated rates. Vivek Juneja : What did you see with the ECB 25 basis point rate cut that has come through? Have you cut those deposit rates by 25 basis points? Jason Tyler : Yes, and I did comment on that really specifically earlier. We did see aligned reductions in deposit costs on the ECB change. Vivek Juneja : So that means you passed on the full 25 bps. Jason Tyler : Yes. Vivek Juneja : Sorry, just as I said, there are too many earnings calls today and you were overlapping with others. So that makes it hard to keep up with all of them. Operator : Thank you. And I will now turn the conference back to Jennifer Childe for any additional or closing remarks. Jennifer Childe : We'd like to thank everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again soon. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's earnings release. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your phone line at this time.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Northern Trust Corporation's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Ms. Jennifer Childe, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am. Jennifer Childe : Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Northern Trust Corporation's third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Joining me on our call this morning is Mike O'Grady, our Chairman and CEO; Jason Tyler, our new President of Wealth Management and Former Chief Financial Officer; Dave Fox, our new Chief Financial Officer; John Landers, our Controller; and Grace Higgins from our Investor Relations team. Our third quarter earnings press release and financial trends report are both available on our website at northerntrust.com. Also on our website, you will find our quarterly earnings review presentation, which we will use to guide today's conference call. This October 23 call is being webcast live on northerntrust.com. The only authorized rebroadcast of this call is the replay that will be made available on our website through November 23. Northern Trust disclaims any continuing accuracy of the information provided in this call today. Please refer to our safe harbor statement regarding forward-looking statements on Page 12 of the accompanying presentation, which will apply to our commentary on this call. During today\u2019s question-and-answer session, please limit your initial query to one question and one related follow-up. This will allow us to move through the queue and enable as many people as possible, the opportunity to ask questions as time permits. Thank you again for joining us today. Let me turn the call over to Mike O'Grady. Michael O\u2019Grady: Thank you, Jennifer. Let me join in welcoming you to our third quarter 2024 earnings call. As Jennifer mentioned, Dave Fox became our CFO on October 1, when Jason became President of our Wealth Management business. Jason will review our financial performance for the third quarter in a few minutes, and he and I will take your questions. Dave will take Jason's place on our fourth quarter earnings call, and many of you will have the opportunity to meet Dave in the coming weeks. We're grateful to Jason for his considerable contributions over the past five years as CFO, including successfully managing our balance sheet through a number of challenging events, including the COVID pandemic and the collapse of several financial institutions last year. I'm confident that Jason has the right skills, understanding of the business and vision to lead Wealth Management into its next chapter of growth. I also want to welcome Dave to the CFO Chair. Dave have a long track record of success in leading businesses and driving financial performance. Most recently, Dave ran our Global Family Office business. Under his tenure, GFO trust fees grew at a compound annual rate of 10%. Dave also served as Head of Asset Servicing for the Americas. Dave is a highly respected leader whose deep industry knowledge and strong financial acumen make him the right choice to serve as Northern's next CFO. Turning to our third quarter performance. Our results benefited from strong market performance, but also reflect continued positive momentum across our businesses. Relative to the prior year, Trust fees were up 8%, net interest income grew 21% and excluding notables, earnings per share grew 36%. Importantly, we generated positive Trust fee and total operating leverage, while continuing to make significant investments in our business and infrastructure. We also returned $453 million to shareholders. Within Wealth Management, we generated strong year-over-year Trust fee growth of 9% and reached record AUM levels. Our new business momentum improved, reflecting the maturation of a number of initiatives started over the past 12 months to 18 months. Global Family Office performed particularly well, generating mid-single digit organic growth, both in the third quarter and year-to-date. International relationships, which have been an area of focus in recent years, drove a healthy portion of this growth, including a marquee win sourced through collaboration with asset servicing, demonstrating the power of our One Northern Trust strategy. Asset Management generated positive liquidity flows for the seventh consecutive quarter and positive flows in tax advantaged equities, active fixed income and alternatives. This translated into healthy organic AUM growth despite continued pressure on index products. Continued strong investment performance is supporting our organic growth, with active fixed income outperforming benchmarks over one, three and five year time frames. NTAM's performance is also attributable to leveraging our One Northern Trust strategy to deliver clients to solutions and capabilities of the entire firm. Year-to-date, NTAM has launched 13 new products, including a treasury only money market fund that has generated nearly $2 billion in flows in less than six months, largely from GFO clients. Our Asset Servicing business performed well in the quarter. Transaction volumes were healthy, capital markets activities were up double-digits for the second quarter, and new business growth continues to be booked at attractive margins. As we discussed, our goal is to generate new business that is scalable. We've shifted our focus to opportunities that require lower levels of incremental costs and to cross-selling products and services to existing clients. As an example, this week, we announced an expansion of our relationship with Artemis, a leading U.K. based asset manager with more than $33 billion in AUM, wherein all trading activity for Artemis' equity funds and all OTC and exchange traded derivatives will be outsourced to Northern. We will now support the complete life cycle of these investments from execution to custody, including fund administration, depository, global custody and transfer agency services for its U.K. and Luxembourg domiciled funds. While it will take time to realize the whole benefits of the pivot in our strategy, it should lead to more profitable growth as our business mix shifts. During the third quarter, we proudly celebrated our company's 135th anniversary, the core principles of service, expertise and integrity, upon which our company was founded, still guide us today. As we look forward, we\u2019re taking steps to strengthen the foundation, position the firm for higher underlying growth and enhance our operational efficiency, all while continuing to invest to meet the evolving needs of our clients and to create value for all our stakeholders for years to come. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jason to review our financial performance for the quarter. Jason? Jason Tyler : Thank you, Mike. And let me join Jennifer and Mike, and welcome you to our third quarter 2024 earnings call. Let's dive into the financial results of the quarter starting on Page 4. This morning, we reported third quarter net income of $465 million, earnings per share of $2.22 and our return on average common equity was 15.4%. Our reported results included a $68 million pretax gain on an equity investment, and a $13 million escrow payment associated with our existing Visa swap agreements. Together, these two notable items boosted other operating income by $55 million pretax and $40 million after tax. Trust, investment and other servicing fees totaled $1.2 billion, a 3% sequential increase and an 8% increase compared to last year. Net interest income on an FTE basis was a record $569 million, up 7% sequentially and up 21% from a year ago. Our assets under custody and administration were up 5% sequentially and 23% as compared to the prior year. Our assets under management were up 6% sequentially and 22% year-over-year. And overall, our credit quality remains very strong. Excluding notable items in all periods, Other non-interest income was down 5% sequentially and down 3% for the prior year. Revenue was up 3% sequentially and up 10% on a year-over-year basis. Expenses were up slightly less than 1% sequentially and up 6% over the prior year and earnings per share grew 36%. Turning to our asset servicing results on Page 5. Assets under custody and administration for asset servicing clients were $16.3 trillion at quarter end, reflecting a 23% year-over-year increase. Asset servicing fees totaled $667 million. Custody and fund administration fees were $453 million, up 6% year-over-year, reflecting the impact from strong underlying equity markets and a weaker U.S. dollar. Both comparisons were dampened by the client exits we discussed last quarter, which are now fully reflected in our run rate. Assets under management for asset servicing clients were $1.2 trillion, up 22% over the prior year. Investment management fees within asset servicing were $153 million, up a strong 11% year-over-year due to favorable markets and, to a lesser extent, new business activities. Moving to our Wealth Management business on Page 6. Assets under management for our Wealth Management clients were $444 billion at quarter end, up 20% year-over-year. Trust, investment and other servicing fees for wealth management clients were $530 million, up 9% year-over-year due primarily to strong equity markets. Moving to Page 7 and our balance sheet and net interest income trends. Our average earning assets were flat on a linked quarter basis as a decrease in loans was offset by an increase in securities. Our average liquidity levels remain strong with highly liquid assets comprising 62% of our deposits and more than 50% of total earning assets on average. The duration of our securities portfolio is 1.6 years, and the total balance sheet duration continues to be less than one year. Net interest income was $569 million and our net interest margin was 1.68%. The strength was attributable to several factors : First, deposits came in modestly better than our expectations. Average deposits were $113 billion, down less than 1% from second quarter levels and non-interest-bearing deposits remained stable at 15% of the mix. Second, deposit pricing improved. We had several large client deposits with very thin spreads roll off, and they were replaced by a similar level of more attractively priced deposits. And as expected, we realized a very strong deposit beta on institutional accounts relative to the recent rate cuts. And third, given especially conducive market conditions, we saw higher-than-average quarterly contributions from transactional and other items. In the aggregate, these items elevated third quarter NII by approximately $10 million to $15 million. Turning to Page 8. As reported, non-interest expense was approximately $1.4 billion in the third quarter, down 11% sequentially and up 6% as compared to the prior year. Excluding notable items in both previous periods, as listed on the slide, expenses in the third quarter were up approximately 1% sequentially and 6% year-over-year. Now, let's go back and review our core expenses from the quarter, which exclude all notable items. Compensation expense was up 5% over the prior year, reflecting the impact of this year's base pay adjustments, modest levels of hiring associated with our modernization initiative and underlying growth in the business and unfavorable currency movements. Compensation expense was flat sequentially. Outside services expense increased 12% relative to the prior year period, largely due to incremental modernization and resiliency spend. It was also flat sequentially. Equipment and software expense increased 14% year-over-year, mostly related to higher depreciation and amortization expenses. Sequentially, it was up 4%. Excluding notables, we generated over 100 basis points of Trust fee operating leverage, over 150 basis points of overall operating leverage and our expense to trust fee ratio improved by 200 basis points on a linked quarter basis. As we look out to the fourth quarter, we expect our total operating expenses to be up approximately 2% relative to the third quarter. Turning to Page 9. Our capital levels and regulatory ratios remained strong in the quarter, and we continue to operate at levels well above our required regulatory minimum. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio under the standardized approach remained flat at 12.6%, and its capital accretion was offset by a slight increase in RWA levels. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 8.1%, up 10 basis points from the prior quarter. At quarter end, our unrealized pretax loss on available for sale securities was $603 million. We returned $453 million to common shareholders in the quarter through cash dividends of $152 million and common stock repurchases of $301 million. Now before starting the Q&A portion of the call, on a personal note, I want to offer a quick thank you. It has been a joy and an honor to serve as CFO for Northern for the last five years. It's been a pleasure to work with the analyst community and the world class investors we have as shareholders. I wish Dave Fox the very best as he takes on the new role. I worked closely with Dave since he joined Northern 12 years ago. He's a strategic forward-thinking executive, and he's going to play a critical role in driving impactful change within the company and ensuring that it's positioned for long-term success. And with that, please open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Unidentified Participant : Hi. Good morning. This is Sharon actually filling in for Steven this morning. Jason, earlier this year, you had talked about the asset sensitivity across the different categories on the balance sheet. So cash 100% sensitive to short rates, loans and securities, about a third floating. Can you give us a quick update on the floating rate mix just given that you've done a couple of securities repositioning actions since the last time we updated? Jason Tyler : I'm sorry. I didn't catch on. Can you -- I just want to make sure I answer your question really precisely. Can you do it again a little louder? Unidentified Participant : Yeah. Sure. Sorry. So earlier this year, you talked about the asset sensitivity across the different balance sheet categories, cash 100% sensitive to short rates and loans as well and securities book about a third floating. Just given some of the securities repositioning actions you've taken since that update, can you give us like a quick mark-to-market on the floating rate mix? Jason Tyler : Yes. Floating is about 50% at this point. Unidentified Participant : Okay. Great. And then, as we look at our expense forecast beyond '24, can you just frame how much of this year's expense growth was inflated by investments in resiliency? When those investments should be completed and whether we should expect those investment dollars to fall to the bottom line or get redeployed elsewhere in the franchise? Jason Tyler : Yeah. And just to clarify, you're asking about the expense investments in modernization and resiliency and how that's going to trend over time? Unidentified Participant : Yeah. Jason Tyler : Yeah. So we do expect that, that will continue for the next at least two, three quarters. But at some point, likely late next year, we\u2019ll start to see it decline. We don\u2019t have any plans to dollar for dollar thematically redeploy that somewhere else. This is more of a distinct effort to try and address our desires to improve modernization and some other technology and automation efforts in the business. Unidentified Participant : Great. Thank you very much. Jason Tyler : Sure. Operator : We will take our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : Hey, good morning. Jason Tyler : Good morning, Ebrahim. How are you? Ebrahim Poonawala : Good and congrats, Jason and David on your new roles. Just maybe following up on expense and more broadly, going back to the leadership changes that were announced back in September. Maybe Mike, Jason, give us a perspective of, I think, I hear frustration from investors from time-to-time around just the focus on operational efficiency kind of not translating into bottom line results. What -- should we read into these changes, realignment is something a little bit out of the ordinary in terms of what it means for operational efficiency going forward? Would love any perspective there. And how we should think about incremental expense spend? I heard what you responded to Jason. But I'm just wondering, is all of this baked into the expense base as we come out of the fourth quarter or will there be more additional expenses and investments tied to resiliency? Thank you. Michael O\u2019Grady: Sure, Ebrahim. It's Mike. I'll start off. So I would say, we believe in structure following strategy. And so, the organizational changes that we announced in September reflect the strategy that we've put in place going back over a year ago, and we've tried to keep very straightforward, which is focused on strengthening the foundation, optimizing our growth and driving productivity. And we already mentioned the changes with Jason and Dave. But importantly, one of the other big changes was creating the role of a COO, Chief Operating Officer, which Pete Cherecwich will be the COO or is the COO company. And with Pete's decades of experience in managing both complex client relationships, but also global operations, he's really well positioned to drive operational excellence, resiliency and also scalable growth. So to your point, we are very much trying to align the organization in such a way that we can get greater scale and operating efficiencies and resiliency out of the company on that front. Teresa Parker took over the role of President of Asset Servicing for Pete, to work through that organizational transition to ensure that we do it in a way that we continue to be client focused and differentiate ourselves in that way. And likewise, Steve Fradkin is a Vice Chair and importantly is focused on the One Northern Trust strategy and operationalizing all the things that we do on that front. So I feel very good about the organizational changes to help us drive the strategy. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. And I guess, so if I may follow up on just the NII question, Jason, for you. It was a positive surprise this quarter, when we look at that $569 million in NII this quarter. If we get some gradual rate cuts, given the positioning of the balance sheet, if the deposit backdrop is stabilizing, should we expect NII continues to grow from the third quarter levels? Jason Tyler : We're -- there's some good news in the NII results for sure. And even though it looks like deposits were just flat. Underneath that, we had meaningful exits of some very thinly large deposits. And we knew that coming into -- that those were going to leave coming into the quarter, that's part of the reason we anticipated deposits being down. But we were pleasantly surprised by the fact that in other areas of the organization, that level of deposit was replaced with much more attractively priced deposits. You add on to that, we didn't see the typical seasonal decline that we go through in August, in particular. And so, it's not just the deposit levels holding in, but the underlying nature of the deposits and where they are now is much better. That said, if you look into the fourth quarter, we're anticipating rate cuts. And as much as we feel good about the strength of the book -- the deposit book right now, it's hard to offset the deposits fully. And so an increase from here would have to call it unlikely as possible. But that's why we think that -- in general, we're looking at a 550 (ph) to 560 (ph) level for fourth quarter in NII, which is still good, still very strong, but would be slightly down. Ebrahim Poonawala : Thank you. Jason Tyler : Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Michael O\u2019Grady: Hey, Alex. Alex Blostein : Hey. Good morning, everybody and congrats to the whole team on various moves. Just to level set the NII discussion, just one more time. So Jason, it sounds like Q3 had $10 million to $15 million of sort of elevated transactional activity. Do you expect that to basically fall off in Q4, and that's what's partially driving the kind of the sequential decline and maybe expand on kind of what those were? And on deposits, this is the right jumping off to use as far as cost of deposits go, right? And then obviously, deposit betas are likely to be fairly high from there, but I'm just kind of trying to level set on the go-forward potentially beyond the fourth quarter guidance that you have you highlighted. Jason Tyler : Sure. So let me try and go in reverse order. On deposits on the launch point, I feel like this is a good level. And then if I come back to the third quarter items, there's the core asset and liability pricing, but there's also another element of FX swap activity, FHLB dividends, premium AM. FTE adjustments, repo activity, leveraging the whole basket of other things. It doesn't add up to a lot. But -- and there's -- usually there's put takes in that. Most of those went in our direction this quarter. And so that's that $10 million to $15 million elevation. But the way you ask the question is thoughtful because we actually don't expect all those to just go away into the next quarter. It's just -- part of it is the environment the way it is right now with the way rates are. It gives us more of an opportunity to do more FX swaps and to have other activity that adds to NII. And so we don't expect it to fully -- that lift to fully come down. It was more of an explanation of why we saw the elevation going from second to third quarter. And so that 550 to 560 (ph) largely is a reflection of some of those items going to more normalized levels, but also impact of rate actions with different central banks that are going to have a drag on the 569 (ph). Alex Blostein : Got it. All right. Thank you for clarifying that. And then a question on expenses for you guys just with respect to maybe longer-term expense growth algorithm. And Mike, I heard your answer to the previous questions around the organizational changes that you guys have made, which are obviously substantially and hopefully can, further align the growth in the business with the expense structure. But I guess in the past, you talked about maybe this 5%-ish bogey for expense growth over time, hoping to be below that. This year is obviously shaking out to be north of 6, and there are some market-related items and stronger revenues to come along with that. So it's good news. But maybe help us sort of summarize, given these changes where you expect the firm's kind of longer-term expense growth to be over the next kind of couple of years? Michael O\u2019Grady: So Alex, we're continuing to be focused on driving positive fee operating leverage and positive operating leverage with the level of our expense-to-trust fee ratio at this point for this quarter, year-to-date, it's still above our target range of 105% to 110%. So we want to continue to grind that down into that target range. And likewise, from a margin perspective, pretax margin, want to be in the low 30s as a target area as well. So -- that's the first driving goal. And then to accomplish that, we've had strong revenues this year, which has enabled us to achieve the leverage that we have. That said, can't always count on the strength in the market and a rate environment that may drive that. So we need to bring the absolute expense growth rate down further. And so that will be the objective as we go into 2025 is to achieve that operating leverage and also increase the probability of hitting it by driving down our expense growth rate below the level that it's been. Alex Blostein : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you, guys. Michael O\u2019Grady: Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hey, good morning. How are you doing? Michael O\u2019Grady: Yeah. How are you? Betsy Graseck : Okay. So a couple of questions here. One on -- Mike, you mentioned the deepening of relationships as a key focus for growth going forward. Could you help us understand how that pivot is affected? Is there -- is that different from what you're doing before? Is it more -- just to key off the last conversation, is it more resources to hire or is it more products to deliver? And then how should we be thinking about where in the organization you have the most opportunity? Is this asset servicing, asset management, is it investment management? Is it the wealth platform? Help us understand how you're thinking about where the pockets of opportunity are richest for those deepening of relationships? Michael O\u2019Grady: Sure. So Betsy, to your point, that is our One Northern Trust strategy, which is to ensure that all of the businesses and all of the groups within the company are working together to produce the best outcomes for our clients and likewise for other stakeholders. And from a client perspective, it is a combination of a number of things. So first, it is the businesses working more closely right from the beginning, if you will. So going to market and opportunities. So for example, with asset servicing and asset management providing an overall solution for clients as opposed to necessarily starting with one and then trying to cross-sell, if you will, the second opportunity on that front. As far as where the opportunities are? Definitely between asset servicing and asset management, but I would also highlight with Wealth Management as well. A lot of work has been done to ensure that the linkages between those two businesses are very strong and that we are thinking about the needs of our Wealth Management clients as we produce new investment management products. As I mentioned, we launched a number of new funds this year that were really off of the back of, I'll say, research that was done for some of the needs of our specific client base. We'll continue to do that in order to provide the right solutions for them. Also as far as the types of capabilities that we have to deliver, to your point, it is new products or new services. So I mentioned the Artemis, example, that's just the latest client where we're providing a new capability to them of outsourced trading or what we call integrated trading solutions, which we launched a number of years ago, and we've built that business up and taken this to a level where that capability works for clients of size like Artemis. So a lot of opportunity on that front as well. So as you can see -- go ahead. Betsy Graseck : No, you finish up, sorry. Michael O\u2019Grady: No. Go ahead, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Thanks very much for those examples. That was very useful. I just wonder, holistically then as we're thinking about not just the expense line, but just the overall impact on profitability. When you think about what you're looking to accomplish and opportunities you see in this pivot, how should -- how do you think that's going to translate into return on tangible or return on common equity? Michael O\u2019Grady: Yeah. So there's no question that to the extent we already have the client relationship that the incremental services that we provide to them are more scalable for us. And so that's where it translates into more profitability overall. The second thing I would mention, Betsy, on that front is in thinking about the type of business that we're pursuing the most. As we say, we want more scalable growth on that front. And what we really mean on that front is focusing on new opportunities that require less in the way of new resources. So to the extent that we can win the business that is, again, more scalable for us, areas where we\u2019ve had a lot of success, for example, this year with asset owners in America, but also in Europe, where we\u2019re providing custody to them in a way that the incremental resources required, both in people but also in technology, are less than if we are adding other services or to other segments that would require that. That translates into a higher level of profitability overall. So that\u2019s the objective on that front. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thanks so much. Really appreciate it. Operator : We will take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Michael O\u2019Grady: Good morning, Mike. Michael Mayo : Good. I see 135 years best-in-class private banking relationships, all the One Northern Trust initiative and everything else happening. And then I see a stock price that has lost is premium versus the Trust bank peers and even trade 3 point below Morgan Stanley or something. So I'm just wondering how much -- and maybe this is an opportunity and if it is, let us know why. But how much of this is business mix? How much of this is the environment and how much of this is execution? And I hear what you have to say, strategy drive structure, drives execution should drive results. I guess that would drive the stock price. But I'm just trying to wonder how or why the same cast of characters can generate better organic growth in their new roles? And when I saw the press release come out with the CFO and COO and Head of Wealth and Head of Asset Servicing and Head of Family, of all changing at the same time. I just haven't seen something like that or I don't recall something like that. So Mike, you have a big perspective on that. But if you give that perspective on why you think this will change things? Thanks. Michael O\u2019Grady: Sure. So Mike, it's a combination of both putting people into the new roles where we can leverage their experience, but also we brought in talent from the outside. So just over about a year ago, 1.5 years ago, we brought in Daniel Gamba to run Asset Management. And so we want to have both the benefit of people who really understand everything you talked about as far as Northern Trust and how we're client focused, but also new blood and new ideas from the outside. And we'll continue to do that as we go forward. Also to drive it, it does come back to execution. I mean to where we're focused, and so that's what we're trying to drive, that's where we spend our time on that front. And that will then ultimately drive not only the earnings but also the multiple for the stock. I think that another big part of this is the strategy around where that growth comes from. So that's why when we talk about the One Northern Trust aspect of it and the type of growth, that also affects the stability and growth rate of the earnings as well. So it's not just the earnings themselves, but it's the quality, as you know. So that's what it's all directed at the ultimately create value through the earnings and the multiple to drive the stock price. Michael Mayo : And then maybe just as one follow-up. So the incremental extra that we might be able to expect by that fresh perspective by the managers bring in their new roles. Maybe Dave, as it relates to the CFO function, or Jason is right next to you. But incrementally, what would you like to emphasize a little bit more, maybe it's already started. And Jason, would you like to emphasize a little bit more and well to take it to the next level? Thanks. Michael O\u2019Grady: Yeah. So what I would emphasize with those two, and then I do think it's a good opportunity for Jason just to give his initial thoughts here. But it is around the more scalable parts of our company overall. So not just products or service but company. And that is our Wealth Management business and our Asset Management business. So we are trying to grow those businesses organically faster than we have in the past. And so that's the tilt or the push, Mike, on that front. And I think with Dave, you and others will quickly get comfortable with. His deep understanding of the business and the strategic approach to it and also understanding of value creation. But Jason, do you want to talk just a little bit about just some of your initial views. Jason Tyler : Yeah. Sure, Mike. So obviously, I've already been on the road a lot, and I know the business reasonably well and spent time just in the last few weeks, L.A., New York, Texas, I'm going to a really good client event tonight in San Francisco. And I -- but I do think there's opportunity for us to do more. And a framework to think about, Mike, is one way you can think about the business, the markets that we're in, the segments that we're in, which gets to where do we have specialization that we can deepen and hope to leverage more and then different solutions for our clients. And you know really well, we have a phenomenal client base and great talent across the organization. And so I think it\u2019s very clear that there is more that we can do. And using that framework is a way that I think we can talk about it in the future where we\u2019re putting the initiatives in each of those different dimensions to try to grow the business faster. Michael Mayo : All right. Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Jason Tyler : Good morning, Brennan. How are you? Brennan Hawken : I\u2019m good. Thanks for taking my question. So I actually wanted to circle back on expenses. And totally appreciate the commitment that was made operating leverage and driving down expenses to fees. But based on the fourth quarter guide, I think my quick math suggested that we're going to be north of 6% on expense growth in 2024. And Jason, as you're sort of last act as at least CFO in name, right before the press release went out, you had said that you made another commitment to keep 2025 sub-5%. And so -- Dave is an internal candidate. So does that 2025 commitment hold with a new CFO? How should we think about it? And how -- like importantly, I understand operating leverage matters and whatnot, but expense growth has really been an issue. It's gotten more elevated here recently in recent years compounded a bit with inflation, but it's not a new issue for Northern. How is it that you guys can get this under control to a point where you can have a more steady cadence of operating leverage without having the bar quite high? Michael O\u2019Grady: Yeah. So Brennan, part of it is the organizational change. So just fundamentally, that will involve centralizing a number of operations that are now more distributed. And so it's more than just, I'll say, committing to it. It's actually making changes to do that. The other part of it is you have to make the investments, where they're required and when they're required. That's part of managing this for the long term. And in the environment that we've been in as far as just the, I'll call it, the level of volatility and risk that's in the broader environment, we felt that making these investments in the foundation is the right thing to do longer term. Now that does require or create some level of variability in what those are. But when we think about what we're doing on the technology front, for example, the modernization that Jason has mentioned, where it's quickly trying to move off of end-of-life platforms. Transitioning to the cloud, which definitely requires investment to do, increasing the automation of the changes we make within technology, ensuring we have redundancy to the extent that there are incidents. Doing more testing of all of those platforms to ensure that we have the stability on that front. Making sure that when we are working with third-party providers that we understand their resiliency as well. So there's a number of things that we've done and are doing to kind of harden and solidify that core because we think that's a good investment for us, not just from a, I'll say, risk and resiliency perspective but also from a client experience perspective and also from an efficient perspective. So that's why we've tried to be very clear on what we're doing and why we're doing it and why we think ultimately, not only is that good for the clients, but it's good for shareholders as well. It's going to drive high-quality growth as we go forward, and that's the plan. Brennan Hawken : Okay. I look forward to getting some meat on those bones in the coming quarter. So that's great. If I could transition into the balance sheet, it looks like loans pulled back a decent amount this quarter. I don't think you touched on it. What caused that and how should we be thinking about loan growth or the outlook for growth or further decline in balances from here? Jason Tyler : Sure. I've noted before, the loans and deposits can be very spiky. And the headline is there's nothing strategic or creating a trend that we see in what we experienced in the quarter. And then in terms of growth going forward, we've had initiatives in the past to specifically grow the loan book. We don't have that initiative right now. We're not trying to shrink it. And so you should think about growth in the loan book coming alongside growth in the overall client franchise. A lot of our lending, ironically, the deposits are more on the institutional side. The lending is on the wealth side of the business. And so the correlation will be more tied to growth in the Wealth business. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Thanks for that. Jason Tyler : Sure. Operator : We will take our next question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Jason Tyler : Good morning. Glenn Schorr : Yeah. Maybe another question on the Wealth side. Like, we always want to grow Wealth. It's a great business, and you're great at it. You talked about the concept, maybe drill down a little bit more because I think you've been making some investments in people, products and new geographies. Maybe talk a little bit about that and include maybe a comment about the Hamilton Lane collaboration that you had a press release on yesterday. Thanks so much. Jason Tyler : Yeah. So I'll start. So I think what you should see is, us investing even more aggressively at the upper end. We do really well at the high end of the market. And you see it very early in what Dave has been able to do with the GFO business because that's the -- on average, those are our larger clients, and that's been growing faster than the rest of Wealth. If you were to look beneath you'd be able to see that even within the regions, we're doing better at the higher end. That's where our franchise, and that's where our value proposition holds well. And we feel great about that. We can invest even more heavily there in revenue generating and client-generating professionals and in the town supports those clients from an experience perspective. So a lot of RIAs brag about having one or maybe two app tech fellows. And those respected people and Trust in a state point, Northern has 15 or 20. And so when clients are trying to go deeper in their state work, more complicated planning, we've got the professionals to do that. And that's part of the reason why just in that area, we do well, but also the same thing in investment advising and in banking. And so the more we invest at the upper end of the market, that's where we feel we're going to have a better return. So we announced an ultra -- a distinct ultra-high net worth group just this past quarter, and we're dedicating professionals to just that area where they're going to be dealing with clients at the very upper end of Wealth advisory. And working closely with the family office business to bring those capabilities into the more traditional Wealth space for us. And so there's a lot of things we're excited about that where we feel we're planting seeds for growth. And then I also look at just the talent we're being -- we're able to bring on board. Really exciting hires across the franchise that we think are going to be helpful to growing the business, growing the client franchise. Michael O\u2019Grady: Okay. And Glenn, on Hamilton Lane, that is a partnership that we\u2019re excited about, which is with our asset sourcing business to provide even better data and analytics on the private investments of our large institutional clients. As you know, as their asset allocators portfolios have moved more and more to private markets and alternatives, the capabilities required to due diligence them, analyze them has gone up. And we\u2019ve had or offering front office solutions, which looks across the entire portfolio that we\u2019ve been very successful with. And this is an addition to that will provide even better, as I said, data analytics to it. So very positive and promising. Glenn Schorr : All right. Thanks so much for all that. Jason Tyler : Sure. Operator : We will take our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Jason Tyler : Hey, Gerard. How are you? Gerard Cassidy : Good. How are you? Congratulations, Jason. Mike, you touched on Northern One a number of times in your prepared remarks as well as your answers to questions. As outsiders, investors, how should we measure the success of what you're trying to achieve? Your peers are using similar types of programs as well or strategies. I was wondering if you could somehow point us to some metrics that we can review regularly just to measure your success in pursuing this strategy? Michael O\u2019Grady: Sure, Gerard. So to your point, using One is not unique. The fact that it's One Northern Trust is, what is unique about it because it's our business that we're focused on with it. And it's something that, Gerard, is really important, I'll say, within the company, but also in the marketplace. Within the company, we want to make sure that we're breaking down silos and that everybody across the company, regardless of what business or group you're in are working together, in order to get the right outcomes. And that can be, certainly, as we've talked about on the client front, it can also be in ensuring that we're getting the right efficiencies across the businesses, so that cuts across that way. And then as I mentioned, certainly going to market and with the client, we're stronger as Northern Trust than we are as any one of our businesses alone. So that's what's behind it. To your point on measuring it, the way that we're doing it is, we start with the specific objectives of what we're trying to do. So thinking about specifically, I mentioned, okay, how many times did we go to market with a new opportunity where it involved two or all three of our businesses to do that. That's something that we can measure, granted it's an internal measurement or metric, but it has to start there if it's going to flow through to the KPIs that the key performance indicators that we're then looking at, which really then it's going to be in our organic growth rate. And so that's what we're trying to drive is a higher organic growth rate. And so to do that, we need to see that collaboration between the businesses. That then flows into our financial performance overall when you add into it, the markets and the impact from that. So ultimately, you're going to see it in the financial performance. And we can provide, I'll say, some KPIs as we go forward here, that's part of what I mentioned with Steve Franken, who as you know, has worked across all of these businesses in one way or another over his career. And that's why we're looking to not just say One Northern Trust, but actually ensure that we're doing it by operationalizing a lot of those activities. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And I apologize screwing up the name Northern One -- One Northern Trust, but thank you. Jason, coming back, I know you touched on the net interest income expectations for the fourth quarter. And with the balance sheet duration, I think you said the entire balance sheet is about a year in securities portfolio is a little longer than that. If the forward curve is correct, and we do see a Fed funds rate by the end of next year in that 3.5% range, let's call it, in the long end of the curve stays incur above 4%. So we get a positive slope in the curve. I'm not asking for a guidance number on '25 NII. But generally, is that a favorable net interest income environment for you folks or can you share some color there? Jason Tyler : Well, for various reasons, we came shorter on the securities portfolio. And so the rest of the balance sheet is pretty stable. The cash is what it is. And the loan book, we haven't done anything to strategically change the duration of that effectively. So the duration of the balance sheet and NII moves largely with what we do with the securities portfolio. And we did come shorter, that played out well for us. We did it for a variety of reasons. One was a view of the yield curve. And again, that played out well for us. At this point, if we look at what the yield curve is telling us, it's obviously going to be more of a headwind going into next year. So especially, if we see five, six, seven rate cuts, there's -- we're not going to change our risk tolerances, our philosophy, our approach on how we manage the balance sheet. So that's going to be a headwind. That said, there are some offsets to it that are occurring just in how we normally manage the portfolio. For example, one, we are feeling better the stability of the deposit level. So that gives us the ability to consider using more non-HQLA. Second, if we did see arise effectively in the base of the deposit book. And so we think deposit levels are positive. And then there's still a slight benefit into next year from the reinvestment of securities that are maturing, not as much as we would have seen before, but there is some. And so -- those are just some of the puts and takes. And you're right, it's too early for us to give a guidance, but I did want to make sure people realize all the different factors that are playing into it. There are some puts as well as the takes. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And is it fair to say that I think you pointed out to us in your Q, when you give us the interest sensitivity table that you guys are asset-sensitive presently at the end of the third quarter. Is that a fair statement? Jason Tyler : Yeah, and thanks for clarifying that. I should have mentioned that in my summary of where we are, Gerard. So there is slight asset sensitivity at this point, just largely coming from the actions we\u2019ve taken in the balance sheet over the last couple of years. Gerard Cassidy : Appreciate it. Thank you so much. Jason Tyler : You bet. Operator : We will take our next from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks. Good morning and congrats to you and everyone else on the organizational changes. Maybe a question for you, Jason, and Mike could chime in too maybe. But just going back to the organic growth comments, I appreciate all of the comments you've talked -- you've discussed in Q&A. In the Wealth segment, first and foremost, at focusing on organic revenue growth as opposed to asset growth. So I just want to confirm that. And do you see more of that organic growth coming internally? So from, let's say, selling more or providing more Northern Trust investment managed product, doing more potentially within the Wealth segment. Other things that you can do internally as opposed to getting new customers. So would we see more of the organic growth -- revenue growth coming from that? And if you could just think about maybe just what type of target organic growth rate are you looking for in Wealth over time? Jason Tyler : Yeah. So let me start with the end. We're -- we have talked about somewhere around a 3% level of organic growth for the business overall. We've historically said that we'd like to see that we should expect a higher amount coming from asset servicing and a little bit lower amount from Wealth. I think we should try to be more -- have more of an expectation that, that's balanced. And so I think in the medium term, a 2.5% to 3% number for Wealth is reasonable. If we start to break it down with where that's come from, it's got to be a combination of both, new clients and doing more with existing clients. But within the existing client base, there's a lot of different categories that people should think about, and I want to try and focus on a couple to give a sense of where we're focusing because it's less for us about thinking about more product utilization. We've talked about that, but it's not something that we would aggressively target. And even more lending, if that comes organically, within our philosophy and risk tolerances, great. But not an area where we see we're going to be pushing the envelope and changing our risk tolerances. And so it's more thinking about our wallet share with clients, thinking about different solutions we can do with them. And also at the upper end of the market, to the extent that our overall client base shifts that way, those clients are still in a mode of -- they still gain Wealth. And so their growth becomes our growth. And our view is that, that's organic as well if they're putting more flows into our business, not just not their market growth, which we don't think of as organic, but there are new flows coming into the company. Then you couple that with what we should be able to do from a new client perspective and that's how we're thinking about getting to that organic growth target level. Brian Bedell : Super helpful. And then maybe just a couple of cleanup questions. Just one on loan pricing. It looks like the yields went up. Is that a factor of the lag? I think you've got about -- correct me if I'm wrong, but I think a three quarters of the book prices within three months, that's variable rate and then there's a portion that prices over a longer time period. So just maybe if you can talk about the pricing relative to rates in that book? And then just one on expenses, and thanks for all the commentary on expenses, it's great. Just one question there would be that expense growth, which looks like 6% this year. You're targeting to bring that down if you have a really strong revenue year and you're generating operating -- positive operating leverage on total revenue, and your expense Trust fee is moving towards your goal. Is it possible that you'd still have expense growth that could be 6% or higher in that scenario? Jason Tyler : Well, first, on the lags, you got them right in terms of the month lag. But just keep in mind, there's a small portion in both business that is daily as well, that's tied more to the extent that clients have more mutual funds. But that's a very -- that's a small dynamic. But you're right, in general, on the month lag. And then on the expense growth, and Mike likely want to comment on it here. One of the things we talked about last year was that we want to try to decouple this concept of, if we have a strong revenue growth, that should lead to a higher expense growth. Now some of that is inevitable because if we're growing the business, there are some expenses that are going to come along with it. We've talked about the impact of markets on expenses. But in general, we shouldn't -- we're trying to get away from that dynamic of projecting higher revenue growth. And therefore, tolerating higher expense growth. It has to be more of an absolute. And so we -- that's why next year, we came into this year with good confidence about being able to do 5% or less. Come into next year, confidence level is even higher. Brian Bedell : Agreed. Michael O\u2019Grady: Again, same framework that we've talked about, Brian. Brian Bedell : Yeah. Thank you for that. Just on the pricing, I was talking about the loans, the variable rate loans on that, not the market. So -- was -- is it a three quarters of the book, I think was -- of the loans were variable rate and reset within three months in the quarter resets. So the lag is what drove the yield up this quarter? Jason Tyler : No, it would over draft a little bit higher -- we're a little bit higher. That's what drove the yield up. Thanks. I really appreciate you clarifying that. But \u2013 and it is about \u2013 it\u2019s like 70% to 80% that\u2019s floating in the loan book. Brian Bedell : Got it. Thank you so much. Jason Tyler : Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. James Mitchell : Hey, good morning. Jason Tyler : Good morning. James Mitchell : Yeah. Jason, -- yeah. Good morning. Just maybe on the capital return. You guys have been stepping up the buybacks capital ratios are pretty high, as you pointed out, still well above the minimum. So is this something we should expect this level for the intermediate term as profitability improves and rates are pretty stable? OCI looks good. Can you keep this level up or is this is sort of a high watermark on the buyback side? Jason Tyler : It's not -- it's maybe neither. And so, it is elevated, but it should stay -- it could stay elevated for a while. And if I walk through the pieces, if you think about -- we have about of third of net income going to dividends at this point. We talk about it being 30% to 50% over time, and it's right at about a third right now. If you take out the -- or even including the equity investment and the Visa dynamic. And -- but us being at 12.5% or 12.6%, that's the upper end of where we've been in CET1. And we've been at that level before, and so we're comfortable at that level, but it's the upper end. But Visa monetizing that obviously put a lot of liquidity available for share repurchase and so we are deploying that over time. And we could continue to do that and still be at approximately this 12.5% level, maybe it comes down a little bit. And the reason we tolerate that is we know at this point, we still have other Visa tranches coming over the next year or two. And so it will be another roughly equivalent benefit. And so would be okay for us to CET1 come down from this 12.6% a little bit. But we'll -- we're thinking about it working through it and not trying to be overly aggressive at any point in time trying to take more of a thoughtful approach over several quarters, not trying to do anything too aggressively. James Mitchell : Right. Great. And then when you think about the monetization of the second half, of the Visa shares, that's obviously a tailwind. Do you contemplate maybe longer term, intermediate term of a lower than 12.5% CET1 given the exit I have? Can you take it to 12% or lower? Jason Tyler : I should -- we're talking that far in the future, I should let Mike or\u2026 Michael O\u2019Grady: As Jason is saying, 12.6% is a very strong level of capital, and that's fine, given the, I'll say, the broader environment and yet at the same time, yeah, absolutely are comfortable at lower levels as well. So we feel very good about the capital position and the higher level of repurchases that we had in this quarter and as we move into next year. James Mitchell : Okay. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Michael O\u2019Grady: Thanks, Jim. Operator : We will take our next question from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Vivek Juneja : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. A couple of questions. Firstly, Mike, Jason, you all mentioned the incremental spending for resilience, modernization, etc., that's what's driven your expense growth to the 6% level. How much has that added would you say, a couple of hundred basis points to the growth rate this year? And if that goes away in three quarters, what would that -- does that bring you down to -- since you won't need to fund that -- 4% or below in the second half of next year? Any clarification on that? Any more color on that? Michael O\u2019Grady: Yeah. So Vivek, I think it's difficult to, I'll say, do an attribution on the 6% and then project that all going forward. I do think that one indication of the growth in the areas that I talked about there, you see it in the higher growth rate that we have in equipment and services. So that's where you'll see most of that technology spend come through. But it's not the -- that doesn't make up 6%, if you will. As Jason has broken it down before, there are other components that drive overall, including the fact that we are levered to market, both on the revenue side and on the expense side. So that's an aspect of what drove that -- the rate to 6% this year. As we go forward, as we've talked about, Vivek, certainly looking to bring that down. But we'll make the investments we need in technology and just more broadly to be able to accomplish what we want to overall. Vivek Juneja : Separate question for you, Mike. There was a question earlier about the organizational changes. Why don't you use this opportunity where you're making such a lot of changes at one shot to bring in some more talent from the outside? Michael O\u2019Grady: Yeah. Over time, Vivek, we continue to do a combination of both. And so there are a number of roles some of which we talked about here but other roles which we will go to market and bring in external talent. For some time period, that has been the strategy on management. I mean, as you know as much as you might say, Jason or Dave or myself have been at Northern for some time period, but we\u2019d actually been in other places longer than we\u2019ve been at Northern. So it\u2019s a mix between promoting talent within because we think we have strong talent that we develop and having a strong talent development program, if you will, is a big part of what we want to do and at the same time, bringing in talent from the outside. So there will be plenty of opportunities to be able to do that. Vivek Juneja : Thank you. Michael O\u2019Grady: Sure. Operator : We will take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Michael Mayo : Hi. Thanks for my follow-up. So did I hear you right because you're targeting organic growth and Wealth 2.5% to 3%. How does that compare to the last few years? And when you benchmark that versus peers, how does that stack up when you see growth in the off state private equity, some other brokers just seems like it's more than that, and maybe it's just the Sandbox where you compete? Thanks. Jason Tyler : Sure. So a couple of things. One, it's -- that would be higher than what it's been over the last couple of years. It's been lower than that over the last couple of years. Before that, we had been at -- within that target range. And so we've done it before, and that's why we feel confident we can do it again. And then from comparative purposes, it's other -- there are some firms that are doing better than that and some that are doing worse. We want to be a winner. We want to be at the top end of that range. And I also think it's very hard to compare. Some firms include banking, some firms don't, some firms include their product fees, some firms don't. Some -- and our model also is from a profitability perspective because of our financial model that we can do better from an earnings perspective, if relative to our peers, if we do same amount of growth. That's our -- the profitability and the incremental profitability of our Wealth business is very strong. That's why that's part of the reason it's such a good business. The clients are embedded and they\u2019re institutionalized. And it makes it so that our growth leads to better economics for shareholders. And so we feel good about that target and what it would mean for shareholders. Michael Mayo : Thank you. Jason Tyler : Thank you. Operator : We do not have any further questions. I would like to turn the call back to Jennifer Childe for closing remarks. Jennifer Childe : Thanks for your participation on today's call. We look forward to speak with you again in the near future. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Let me turn the call over to Mike O'Grady. Michael O\u2019Grady: Thank you, Jennifer. Let me join in welcoming you to our fourth quarter 2024 earnings call. Our fourth quarter results kept off a solid year of progress executing against our strategic priorities. Relative to the prior year, fourth quarter trust fees were up 12% and net interest income grew 15%. Excluding notables in the prior year, revenue was up 13% and earnings per share grew by more than 50%. Importantly, we generated positive trust fee and total operating leverage for the second consecutive quarter, while continuing to make significant investments in our business and infrastructure. For the full-year, excluding notables, revenue was up 8% and we generated positive trust fee operating leverage and total operating leverage in excess of two points, which translated into EPS growth of 24%. We also returned more than $400 million to shareholders in the fourth quarter and $1.5 billion for the full-year, reflecting a five-year high. Our results benefited from strong market performance, but also reflect continued progress implementing our One Northern Trust strategy. Turning to Slide 4. At the beginning of last year, we launched our One Northern Trust strategy, which serves as our roadmap to becoming a consistently high performing company and producing meaningful value for all stakeholders. Our strategy is underpinned by three pillars : optimizing growth, strengthening resiliency and managing risk and driving productivity. Turning to Slide 5, we made significant progress across all three pillars in 2024. Let's begin with optimizing growth. Our organic growth trajectory improved across all three businesses with good momentum exiting 2024. Our One Northern Trust strategy places an emphasis on enhancing the client experience while driving sustainable, scalable organic growth. Leveraging the capabilities of the entire firm, we deepened existing client relationships, adding products and services to meet their increasingly complex needs. We also embraced a more intentionally united focus for servicing our global client franchise, executing a joint calling program, which resulted in over 140 new business opportunities. As an example, NTAM, our asset management business, worked in close partnership with our global family office and asset servicing businesses to develop a money market solution for a client seeking greater tax efficiency for its sizable cash investments. This turned out to be highly-attractive to a number of our clients and we experienced one of the fastest fundraises in NTAM history, raising nearly $3 billion over the course of six months with participation from 18 clients. As we enter 2025, we will further institutionalize these approaches through enterprise-wide initiatives aligning with meeting our clients' greatest needs and key industry trends, such as alternative investment solutions, family office services and liquidity solutions. We will also continue to prioritize growth in wealth and asset management and foster stronger collaboration between both businesses. Relative to strengthening resiliency and managing risk, critical to maintaining our reputation for strength and stability for clients, regulators and the markets. Last year, we designed and launched a multi-year effort to uplift our risk and control system and added new capabilities to strengthen resiliency. We invested in technology to eliminate legacy software applications, mature our cloud environment and bolster our cyber defenses. We also made steady progress automating processes and adopting additional artificial intelligence tools, thereby reducing the number of manual processes meaningfully. In support of these initiatives, we created a new operating model and made a number of strategic hires. In 2025, we will continue to prioritize investments to further strengthen our resiliency, including modernizing our core platforms, accelerating our cloud adoption and pursuing additional opportunities to automate and deploy AI. We made meaningful progress driving productivity in 2024 and laid the groundwork to generate efficiencies in the coming years. We focused on key cross functional areas in 2024, such as workforce and vendors, ending the year with headcount 1% lower than two years ago, despite launching a number of growth initiatives and adding resources to support our resiliency efforts. Within asset servicing, we've reduced headcount for seven consecutive quarters, translating to a more than 7% decrease relative to peak staffing levels. And importantly, many of the resiliency initiatives have also resulted in significant savings, particularly from automation and digitization. Going forward, we will continue to enhance our productivity efforts, including leveraging the office of the Chief Operating Officer to implement more structural change to further centralize, standardize and automate operations and processes. Turning to our business unit level performance, beginning with wealth management on Slide 6. In 2024, we made foundational investments to deliver higher levels of organic growth on a more consistent basis. We grew our sales talent by nearly 20%, enhanced our lead flow channels and grew our prospect pipeline materially. More recently, we transitioned our executive leadership and made important strategic hires across various markets and functions. As a result of these efforts, we saw steady improvement throughout the year in our organic growth trajectory with particular strength in GFO. We also increased wealth deposits by 9% and expanded our segment pre-tax margin by nearly 400 basis points relative to the prior year. And as a testament to the value proposition we provide to clients, we were awarded Best Private Bank in the US for the 13th time in the past 16 years by the Financial Times Group. In 2025, wealth management will continue to maintain and strengthen our lead position in the upper wealth tiers. Within our global family office business, we will continue to optimize existing client relationships, bolster investment advisory capabilities and expand into new markets, including international areas with significant potential. By establishing a separate ultra-high net-worth practice, we will leverage our world class family office platform to better serve wealthy families with more than $100 million in net worth whose needs differ from those of our core wealth clients. We also plan to deepen our penetration of select target markets in the US that have significant wealth and where we have an opportunity to increase our market share. To capitalize, we will add talent, invest in brand awareness and pursue market specific growth opportunities. We will also expand our suite of alternative investment solutions for wealth clients. Turning to asset management on Slide 7. We refreshed our strategy in 2023 following the hiring of Daniel Gomba, our Asset Management President. This included focusing on products where we have the clear right to win and more fully leveraging the full capabilities of the firm. We made meaningful progress in 2024 through investing in our platform and in core products. We refined our go-to-market partnership with asset servicing, creating more comprehensive solutions for clients and prospects, which resulted in more than 35 new client wins. Leveraging the success, we launched multiple products specifically geared toward the needs of our asset servicing, GFO and ultra-high net-worth wealth segments. As a result, we realized positive net flows for the year, including 13% growth in liquidity, which surpassed $300 billion in AUM and generated positive long-term flows in the second-half of the year. We also improved the trajectory of our organic fee growth meaningfully, all while delivering investment performance above our benchmarks. We aim to carry this momentum into 2025 by investing in areas of growth that are both aligned with secular trends in the industry and where we have the right to win. These include expanding our alternatives offerings, capturing growth in custom SMAs and broadening our ETF presence while simultaneously maintaining our focus on core strengths in liquidity solutions, indexing, quant and fixed income. Turning to asset servicing on Slide 8. Last year, we began to pivot the focus of our asset servicing business to pursue scalable growth in the core business, leveraging existing capabilities rather than bespoke build-outs to generate positive operating leverage and maximize our value to both clients and shareholders. And to support this effort, we implemented disciplined criteria for new business generation to ensure that it is accretive both at inception and on an ongoing basis. As a result, we bid on fewer opportunities in 2024, yet saw no meaningful degradation to our win rate. We also prioritize growth within our highly scalable capital markets business, which grew 17% in 2024 with roughly 50% of this growth coming from new clients. These new clients in-turn became prospects for our core custody and fund administration services. As a result, we finished the year with improved organic growth and profitability and a solid pipeline of business to onboard. In 2025, we will continue the momentum, investing in areas to support our clients' evolving needs and to capitalize on industry changes and asset flow trends. This includes sharpening our focus on global private markets and targeted asset owner clients and accelerating the growth of our banking and capital markets business. I hope these additional slides have given you a deeper understanding of our business and strategic objectives. Let's turn to our medium term financial targets on Slide 9. By focusing on driving organic growth and generating positive fee and total operating leverage, our medium term targets are to achieve an expense to trust fee ratio of 105% to 110%, pre-tax margins above 30% and an ROE at the upper half of our range of 10% to 15%, along with double digit EPS growth and meaningful capital return to shareholders. In conclusion, we're confident in our One Northern Trust strategy and determined to execute with discipline to be a consistently high-performing company for all our stakeholders. Our success couldn't be possible without the unwavering efforts of our more than 23,000 global partners. I'd like to thank them for their ongoing support of our clients with service, expertise and integrity, the enduring principles that underlie all that we do. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dave to review the financials. Dave? David Fox : Thanks, Mike. Let me join Jennifer and Mike in welcoming you to our fourth quarter 2024 earnings call. Let's discuss the financial results of the quarter starting on Page 11. This morning, we reported fourth quarter net income of $455 million, earnings per share of $2.26 and our return on average common equity was 15.3%. Excluding notables relative to the prior year, the stronger US dollar was immaterial to revenue growth, but favorably impacted our expense growth by approximately 50 basis-points. Excluding notables, relative to the prior quarter, currency impacts unfavorably impacted our fourth quarter revenue growth by approximately 50 basis-points, largely within our Asset servicing, custody and fund administration segment and favorably impacted our expense growth also by an approximately 50 basis-points. Trust, investment and other servicing fees totaled $1.2 billion, a 2% sequential increase and a 12% increase compared to last year. Net interest income on an FTE basis was $574 million, a new record, up 1% sequentially and up 15% from a year-ago. Our assets under custody and administration were down 4% sequentially, but up 9% as compared to the prior year. Our assets under management were down 1% sequentially, but up 12% year-over-year. And overall, our credit quality remains very strong. Excluding notable items in all periods, other non-interest income was up 13% sequentially and up 17% over the prior year. Revenue was up 3% sequentially and up 13% on a year-over-year basis. Expenses were up 1.2% sequentially and up 5.5% over the prior year, and earnings per share increased by more than 50% as compared to the prior year. Turning to our asset servicing results on Page 12. Our asset servicing business performed well in the quarter. Transaction volumes were healthy, capital markets activities were up 20% and new business growth continues to be booked at attractive margins. Assets under custody and administration for asset servicing clients were $15.6 trillion at quarter-end, reflecting a 9% year-over-year increase due to strong market levels and client inflows, partially offset by unfavorable currency movements. They were down sequentially due to unfavorable currency movements and weaker markets, particularly bonds. Asset servicing fees totaled $676 million. Custody and fund administration fees were $457 million, up 9% year-over-year, largely reflecting the impact from strong underlying equity markets and new business generation. Both year-over-year and sequential comparisons were dampened by the client exits we discussed in the second-quarter, which are now fully reflected in our run-rate. Assets under management for asset servicing clients were $1.2 trillion, up 12% over the prior year. Investment management fees within Asset Servicing were $157 million, up a strong 20% year-over-year due to favorable markets and new and new business activities. Moving to our wealth management business on Page 13. Wealth Management also had a healthy quarter with particular strength in GFO. Assets under management for our wealth management clients were $451 billion at quarter-end, up 12% year-over-year, including 5% growth in the global family office AUM. Trust investment and other servicing fees for wealth management clients were $547 million, up 14% year-over-year due to strong equity markets and modestly higher flows. Moving to Page 14 and our balance sheet net interest income trends. Our average earning assets were down 1% on a linked-quarter basis as an increase in loans and securities was offset by a decline in cash held at the Fed and other central banks. The duration of our securities portfolio is 1.6 years and the total balance sheet duration continues to be less than one year. Net interest income on an FTE basis was $574 million, up 1% relative to the 3rd-quarter and our net interest margin was 1.71%. The strength was attributable to several factors. First, the deposit mix came in modestly better than our expectations. Average deposits were $113 billion, flat with third quarter levels, but non-interest-bearing deposits increased 7% on a linked-quarter basis and increased 100 basis-points as a percentage of the total mix to 15.5%. Second, deposit pricing improved. As part of our focus on client liquidity management, we made certain pricing adjustments to be more aligned with current market conditions. And as expected, we continue to realize a very strong deposit beta on institutional accounts relative to fourth quarter rate cuts. And third, we saw a pickup in loan activity. And fourth, we continue to have higher than trend quarterly contributions from transactional and other items, although not as strong as what we observed in the 3rd-quarter. Turning to our expenses on Page 15. Non-interest expense was approximately $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter, up 1% sequentially, but down 1% as compared to the prior year. Excluding notable items in the prior-period as listed on the slide, expenses in the fourth quarter were up 1.2% sequentially and up 5.5% year-over-year. Let's now go back and review our core expenses from the quarter. Compensation expense was up 5.5% over the prior year, reflecting the impact of this year's base pay adjustments, modest levels of hiring associated with our modernization initiative and underlying growth in the business. And outside services expenses increased 7% relative to the prior year period, largely due to incremental modernization and resiliency spend. It was down 2% sequentially as we started to see some consulting expense shift into compensation expense as we made permanent hires to replace consultants. Equipment and software expense increased 9% year-over-year, mostly related to higher depreciation and amortization expense and costs associated with our cloud journey. We generated over 600 basis-points of trust fee operating leverage, nearly 800 basis-points overall operating leverage and our expense to trust fee ratio improved by 100 basis-points on a linked-quarter basis to 113%. Turning to the full year's results on Page 16, trust fees were up 8% in 2024 due to both strong underlying markets and solid new business generation. We generated record NII, up 8% for the year, driven by sharply increasing deposits at the beginning of the year and stability over the remainder of the year, a healthy loan book and the multiple securities repositioning trades we completed. Total revenue on an FTE basis was up 22% for the full-year and excluding notables, it was up 8%. Reported expenses were up 6.6% for the full-year. Excluding notables, they were up 6.1%, which includes the impact from our mid-year decision to accelerate certain modernization and resiliency expenditures to offset a portion of the gains we realized from the Visa monetization. Turning to Page 17. Our capital levels and regulatory ratios remained strong in the quarter, and we continue to operate at levels well-above our required regulatory minima. Our common equity Tier-1 ratio under the standardized approach declined 20 basis-points on a linked quarter basis to 12.4% as capital accretion was offset by a slight increase in RWA. Our Tier-1 leverage ratio was 8.1%, flat with the prior quarter. At quarter end, our unrealized pre-tax loss on available-for-sale securities was $598 million. We returned $403 million to common shareholders in the quarter through cash dividends of $149 million and common stock repurchases of $254 million. And for the full-year, we returned over $1.5 billion, reflecting a payout ratio of 78%, including share repurchases of $938 million, our highest-level in five years. We continue to expect our total operating expense growth to be at or below 5% for the full-year, excluding notable items in both periods. Turning to NII, for the first-quarter, we expect NII to be approximately $555 million to $575 million. This assumes the current market implied forward curve, a flattish balance sheet on a dollar-adjusted basis with stable deposit levels, a relatively stable deposit mix, stable pricing and modest currency headwinds. For the full-year, again, assuming the market implied forward curve, we're expecting NII to increase by low-single digits on a percentage basis. And with that, operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instruction] And our first question today comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks very much. A quick follow-up on -- and thank you for the NII guide. I'm just curious on the durability of some of the underlying trends, meaning, the 7% growth in non-interest-bearing deposits in the quarter. Like, was there some parking of cash by clients that naturally flows out? And then, if you could just clarify, when you talked about made pricing decisions in-line with market conditions, is that just rates came down and you lowered some deposit pricing on clients? Thanks. David Fox : Yes, thanks for that question. I think non-interest-bearing deposits were up over $1 billion. I think that's probably higher than other quarters and my guess would be that there's some seasonality to that number. And certainly, we welcome it, but ultimately, it's not out of step with what we've seen in the past. In terms of the pricing adjustments and we've talked about this before, we really have put a lot of effort behind our overall liquidity management and balance sheet management as it relates to deposits. And so, when we think about our pricing adjustments, it's more than just a normal-course of business type of pricing adjustment. It's really taking a look at all the multiple currencies that we do manage on our deposit base and having a much more fulsome review of everything we're doing and making sure those betas are consistent with what we think they should be. Glenn Schorr : Okay. I appreciate it. The other one I want to talk on is, alternatives were a big part of your objectives across each of the wealth asset management and asset servicing objectives. So my question is, A, are things accelerating? And then maybe you could talk about what is already built, what needs to-be-built? And then I think we're all curious on some specifics, like what product, what asset classes are seeing the most demand in? Thanks very much. Michael O\u2019Grady: So, Glenn, I'll take that. And you're right that alternative investment solutions is something that cuts across each of the three businesses. And I think the way to think about it is instead of necessarily the businesses, but think about the solutions that we're providing. So from an investor perspective, whether that's our wealth clients and the segments within that or institutional clients, can we bring a broader set of solutions to them on this front for private market solutions? And so right now, we offer that through 50 South Capital, which is a part of our asset management business and that's in a largely a fund-to-fund structure. We've seen great success with that. We raised over $1 billion that we closed on this year for that. So that's one of the solutions for a subset of the investors. But in addition to that, we also have a platform that has another -- other private capital managers on it. So different funds. And at this point, to your point, it's built-out, if you will, but we think that we can offer more options on that platform. So that's another way to build it out. And also when you talk about what needs to be done. We want to make sure that all of our portfolio managers are fully versed in the various types of private capital alternatives. And so you have, I'll call it, that education and training part of it to make sure that is in-place. And then as I mentioned, institutional as well with our asset servicing business, not only can we offer it through the vehicles that I talked about there like 50 South, but also we can offer it in an advisory capacity. And so, working with larger institutions that will then want us to provide advisory services on their -- the portion of their portfolio that's in alternatives. So that's on the investor side. When you think about the private capital firms on that front, there's a lot that we can provide to them as well. Certainly capital call facilities, but also banking solutions for the entities themselves. And then very much so on the administration front. And there, I would say, if you think about specific areas in Europe, for example, where semi-liquids are growing at a very-high rate, whether that's the structures that are in the UK, like the long-term asset funds or LTAS or in Europe with a similar type structure. They're growing at a high-rate and we have a very strong position in that. So providing services to the firms. And then finally, I would say also to the principles of these firms. If we're working with them on the two fronts that I talked about there, we want to make them wealth management clients as well and have done that, but look to grow that part of the business as well. Glenn Schorr : I appreciate all that. Thank you. Operator : And the next question will come from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I'd love to start out maybe a bit granular. In the past, you guys have spoken to targeting keeping the expense growth in 2025 at 5% or better. Dave, you had some comments that you made in a December industry conference where it seemed as though there was a little bit of uncertainty around that. Could you maybe clarify, is that a reasonable level to expect for 2025? And if not, what are the variables that we should watch? David Fox : Yes. Thanks for that question. I was in the chair maybe a month and a half or two months when I was asked that question. And now that I've been in the chair for four months and have gone through our planning period for 2025. I have very strong conviction around a 5% or below number. So, we can take that issue off the table, if you will. And obviously, what we try to do is in putting that number out, we don't put it out in isolation. So, our North Star is, obviously, what Mike talked about earlier, which is positive operating leverage. But at the end-of-the day, we know that we -- the markets were pretty buoyant in 2024 and we want to prepare ourselves to have a resilient business model. And the only way to do that is to keep driving expense curve down. Brennan Hawken : Got it. That's very clear. Thanks, Dave. And then just taking a step-back, you guys provided some good details here in your strategic update laying out the progress. But I'd like to lay out a question that I get from investors a lot, which is the ROE targets. Do you think that the ROE targets are ambitious enough? The lower-end of the range doesn't really suggest a ton of improvement from recent levels. And why is it that we haven't seen those ROE targets move higher, particularly as we've seen maybe some of the growth rates begin to slow. Michael O\u2019Grady: So we've had, to your point, the 10% to 15% range for some time and that does cover different market environments and also different capital requirements as those regulations have changed overtime. And we've seen even in the, I'll call it, past couple of years here where there was the expectation there was going to be more capital. Now we may be in a different environment where those requirements are not going to be as high. So that's what it would take into account. To your question of, why not higher per se, certainly, we're driving to higher returns on capital, but we're also trying to drive to growth. And so if you just said, could you hit a ROE, you could, but you might be detracting from your ability to grow the business, which we think it's the combination that you want overtime. And as I mentioned in my comments earlier, Brennan, we're certainly shooting for the top half of that range. And in fact, in this quarter, as you saw, we were over the top end of the range. So it's not to say we're trying to constrict the other returns. It's just saying we want the optimal combination between growth and returns. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Thanks for that color. Operator : And moving on to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Michael O\u2019Grady: Good morning. Betsy Graseck : During the prepared remarks, you were talking about how you've been able to get some of the expense improvements from asset servicing business line in addition to others, obviously, but in the asset servicing piece, with some headcount reduction, if I heard you correctly. And the reason I'm asking the question is, Northern Trust has a long history of excellent quality service, right? Service quality is the other north star that you've got for yourself. If I could borrow that phrase. And I'm wondering, how have you been able to reduce headcount and keep that service quality high? In the past, it's been this friction point that's kept I think the organization from executing the kind of efficiencies that you're seeing now? And could you help us understand what is it that you're doing differently that's enabling this headcount reduction while maintaining the service quality? Is it something to do with where technology is today? Is it the AI? Is it something totally different, how you're organized? Thank you. Michael O\u2019Grady: Let me start and then Dave may want to add. But Betsy, you're right and you can say that service quality is another north star, if you will for us, because it is something that we look to differentiate ourselves. And to your point, what we're trying to do is maintain that, but also gain much greater efficiency in how we provide those services. And so, just one thing I would say that we've done that's fundamentally different here is how we've organized our activities, how we've organized the company. And going back to kind of little past midway in 2024, where we created the Chief Operating Officer role with Pete Cherwich and move the operations into that group. That's so that we can gain much greater efficiency out-of-the operational aspect of that business. So we can get greater centralization, standardization, automation. And when we do that, our view is that will make those services better that we'll get greater resiliency from doing that, but also just ease-of-use. And a lot of that it does come with investments in technology to be able to do that, but we believe that it makes the business more scalable as well. So that's the way we can, I believe, maintain both. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And how do you see the forward-look here? How many more years of this do you feel that you have to be able to leverage this new structure? Michael O\u2019Grady: Yes. I would say that I -- it does take some time to gain the full benefits of what we're talking about here. So the way we've looked at some of the things we're doing here is, these are, we say, multi-year, but that means kind of two to three years where you're really getting, I'll say, the greatest benefit. But then importantly, we're trying to set it up in such a way that it's sustainable as well. And so you continue to get additional benefits overtime. But you're right, you're going to capture more in the first kind of two to three years of it before it reaches that level. Betsy Graseck : Thanks so much. Operator : And the next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawalla with Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : Good morning. Michael O\u2019Grady: Good morning. Ebrahim Poonawala : I just wanted to follow-up on the global family office piece. Looking at the Slide 13, just talk to us, it was a priority in 2024, I'm assuming remains a big area of focus. When we think about the revenue growth, whether or not that should be sort of leading the way going-forward. On a year-over-year basis, pretty strong growth in revenues within the GFO segment. It sort of plateaued out over the last few quarters. If you can talk to how we should think about revenue growth within GFO, given the investments you've made, given just the secular growth in that segment would be helpful. David Fox : Sure. I'm happy to do that. What I would say is GFO probably had its strongest year than it's ever had in terms of organic growth. It was exceptional, very high single digit organic growth. And we've also been reaching out more to international markets as well. And so, from that perspective, it was a great year. Also keep in mind that our assets under management in the fourth quarter were up 5%. And I think there is a lag effect there, right? So depending on when you bring that business in, you'll see it in your numbers. And so there's that issue as well. So I wouldn't say that it actually has plateaued. What I would tell you is the pipeline looks -- the GFO pipeline actually looks more robust going into 2025 than it did in 2024. Ebrahim Poonawala : Understood. And maybe just a separate question. So heard you on the NII guide. How should we think about the gearing of the balance sheet? One, do you think that we are at a point where if the Fed were not to do anything, rates stay more or less the same, NII and deposit balances should grow from here, all else equal? David Fox : Yes. I mean, we're still anticipating a certain number of rate cuts at least a couple this year in the US. And then globally, there's a lot of other potential rate cuts that are in our numbers as well. Keep in mind, our deposits aren't all-in dollars. So, we obviously did some pricing adjustments, which help on the NII front as well. We also have a pickup in loan activity, which we think could continue into next year. So there's a lot of different puts and takes when you get into the NII number apart from just the various cuts in interest-rate cycles. Ebrahim Poonawala : Yes. But rate cuts alone, would that be incrementally positive or negative given the balance sheet mix. David Fox : No, we think obviously, if there are less rate cuts, that's better. Ebrahim Poonawala : Okay. Got it. Thank you. Operator : And moving on to Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : Hey, Mike. Good morning, everybody. I wanted to ask you guys a question around expenses again. So I heard you loud and clear on the at or below the 5% number. I guess in the past, the revenue base or rather the expense base, sorry, used to flex a little bit more up and down with revenues. So I just want to understand a little better, has that changed at all, meaning that if you are in a sort of better fee environment in 2025 versus what you're contemplating, are you still kind of committing to the 5% as the upper-end of that? And maybe a better way to ultimately calibrate this is to talk about the expense to fee ratio that you expect for the full-year 2025. Michael O\u2019Grady: So I'll start on that, Alex. And to your point, there's always going to be a relationship between the expenses and the revenues, even with the market impact or rate impact, I'll call it, on NII and even the capital markets activities. So just take capital markets as an example, because we don't talk about that as much. And we had a lot of success with capital markets this year and saw double-digit growth on the revenue side. There are certain expenses that come with that. If you think about just clearing expenses and things like that. The same thing with asset management, where depending on how the asset management products are distributed, there are some costs that go with that as well. And so, we had, again, successful year with asset management, capital markets, both of those very scalable products for us, which is good, but there is going to be some expense that comes with the additional growth. So that's just then, I'll call it, the relationships that there. That said, we believe that we're trying to get less of that flex, if you will. And so if you look at the fourth quarter here, obviously, strong revenues and expenses still at a level that's higher than we think it should be and that what we're aiming for, but it created a significant amount of operating leverage on that front. Now as the revenue growth goes down, that's where we have to push that down faster and harder. So we're trying to hold it down even when revenues are more robust. And then when it's much tighter, ensuring that we keep them much more under control. Alex Blostein : Got you. Yes, I know that all makes sense. Like obviously, ultimately higher revenue comes with higher expenses and that's a high-cost problem. But I guess as you think about the expense to fee ratio, which would kind of normalize for that flex, so to speak, what do you guys are aiming for 2025? Michael O\u2019Grady: Okay. Yes. So without putting a pin in on a number for 2025, definitely looking for positive fee operating leverage, which would drive that down. We're at 115 for the year. We're at 113 for the quarter. So you can see the trajectory. And the reason why we use that ratio, as you know, Alex, is because that essentially is trying to say how do we take some of that flex out of the financial model, if you will. And so we've identified the 105 to 110 as a level that says -- that's the right level of efficiency that we're able to maintain in providing those services and having them at the right level of service, but also to the extent that you do see revenues come down, your expenses are not too high, if you will, and therefore, you've essentially taken some of that, again, flex out of it on the downside. So no specific target for this year other than continued progress into that range. Alex Blostein : Got it. Okay. That's perfect. Thanks you guys. Operator : And our next question comes from David Smith with Truist Securities. Please go ahead. David Smith : Good morning. Your capital levels are still pretty elevated versus your closest peers at 12.4% CET1. Can you talk about how you expect to use your capital in the near-term and where you might want to bring your capital levels to over the next year or so? Michael O\u2019Grady: Sure. So I would agree. We have very strong capital levels right now and that's a result of both the strong income generation, but also the benefit of the Visa gain that we had earlier this year. That's enabled us to repurchase stock at a higher level and that's how we think about that lever is the share repurchases can flex up and down depending on our capital levels. So we would expect as we go into 2025 to continue at this pace. We're, as I mentioned, very comfortable at the current capital levels, but also would be comfortable moving them down somewhat. We have a target range to be above some of our closest peers when it comes to capital, but the level that we're at right now is very comfortable and gives us the room to be able to do more. Dave mentioned for this year, if you exclude the notables, our total payout ratio is in the area of about 78%. We would expect to be at that level or higher as we go into 2025. David Smith : Thank you. And then separately on NII, if I just take the midpoints of your 1Q and full-year NII guides, it would suggest NII staying pretty consistent throughout the year, at least on average. Is there anything that we should be considering in terms of the cadence there across the cuts in the forward curve as well as your expectations for loan growth or balance sheet shifts. David Fox : Yes. I mean, one thing to keep in mind with us as it relates to NII is that, we are a very liability driven institution. And so -- and that's why to Mike's points about capital, that's why we keep this excess capital. And so, for example, we saw a very large pickup in our loan activity over the last quarter. And so, we want to make sure our balance sheet is there for our clients. We can't always predict when that's going to be, when they're going to want to put deposits on or take loans out or things of that nature. So we've guided still for deposit -- for the NII to be up over the course of the entire year by low-single digits. But at the end of the day, trying to land on the head of a pin as to exactly when that's going to happen quarter-by-quarter is going to be difficult to do for the entire year. David Smith : Understood. Thanks. Operator : And we'll take a question from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Hi, good morning, folks. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just to stick along the NII line and then correlate that with expenses, because clearly what you can manage more -- with more certainty is the expense to trust fee ratio. I guess the question is to the extent NII oscillates around that target range, let's say, if it's lower, are you still keeping a target of generating total operating total operating leverage on total revenue, not just fees, but combined with NII or would you just really just focus on the fee side? Michael O\u2019Grady: Yes. So here's what I would say. So we're trying to build a sustainable financial model that can last through all cycles. So at the end of the day the cost curve has to go down regardless of markets, right? We can't rely on things we don't control. And so, when you look at what we're trying to do overtime is really get that expense line to stand-up and not be dependent on a particular market dynamic. And so, as to the earlier comments that we made around the growth in expenses. That's market driven. That doesn't mean that all the other expenses, if we have a great year in NII are going to go up sequentially, right? We've got to keep a lid on all the other stuff that's not market driven. And that's a -- that's going to remain a goal regardless of the NII number. Brian Bedell : Yes, that's good color. And then maybe just shifting over to the wealth management business and the sort of the mission of improving the penetration within that channel for Northern Trust managed products and good success last couple of quarters with the cash product that you mentioned, Mike, which we can see in the results. How are you envisioning that over the next year, one to two years in longer-term product back several years ago, you -- I think the mix of NTAM product within the channel was in the north of 40%. It's in the high-30s now. Do you see that getting back to the mid, say low to mid mid-40s over-time? And then how do you think about the incremental revenue pickup from doing that or is that kind of neutral? Michael O\u2019Grady: No, we see it as a positive. And we say that in the sense that we really have the asset management business and wealth management business working closely together. We made some fundamental organizational changes going back over a year-ago to better align that, I'll call it, the coverage of wealth management by asset management, the wealth client group. And in the past year, we've seen the benefits. It's still, I would say, in the early days as to how that will flow through. But the idea is by better covering them, if you will, understanding what the needs are of wealth management, we can provide a broader set of alternatives that are aligned with what the needs are of our wealth management clients. So that's been a real positive. In addition, I would say what we've seen is the opportunity to further segment the solutions that we're providing on behalf of NTAM to the wealth management business. So my point being the needs of our GFO clients from an asset management perspective are different than those for, let's say, our core wealth group. And so how do we differentiate that offering? And then importantly, when we talk about the ultra-high net-worth segment, so think about $100 million-plus, but not full family office, that's where we see further opportunity to tailor what we're providing to them. Some of that will be through alternatives, which I talked about earlier, but it's a broader set of capabilities as well. You heard about ETFs, for example, we're going to look to provide more ETFs that fit with the core needs of the wealth client base. So we see opportunity with the businesses working closely together going forward. Brian Bedell : Great. Thank you. Operator : And moving on to Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities. Jim Mitchell : Hey, good morning. Maybe just on asset servicing. I see you guys obviously have narrowed your focus to more back office custody. So it seems like the pipeline is still pretty solid. But how do you think about the organic growth from here, the trade-off between that and the improving incremental margins? And then secondly, how do you think of -- it sounds like a lot of your larger peers are attempting the same strategy. So have you seen pricing pressure or competition increase for pure custody deals. Thanks. Michael O\u2019Grady: Sure. So our balance -- our business at this point is relatively balanced in -- between what we do for asset owners globally and what we do for asset managers. So we feel-good about that mix. And so going forward, we would look for the growth rates to be similar, the organic growth rates. That has not necessarily been the case over the last five, 10 plus years where we were growing out the asset manager side of the business. And by its nature and what we do on that front, the asset-owner side is a more scalable business for us. So by having that balance, that's why when we talk about optimized growth and scalable growth in this business, it aligns with bringing on new business that is less, I'll say, resource intensive, but not to say that in any way we're carving back or pulling back from a particular market or service that we're providing. And to your point, as we go-forward here, we see strong business on both fronts. And frankly, improvements in, I'll say the pricing conditions in the market is very favorable and whether it's favorable for ourselves and our competitors, that's fine as well. In 2024, there are a number of situations where we declined to participate in providing a bid or participating in the RFPs because we didn't see pricing that reflected what we're trying to do for the business overall. We'll see how that plays out this year. But I think to the extent that it's favorable conditions, it certainly benefits us. Jim Mitchell : Okay. Just to clarify, so pricing, you feel has been better as companies just focus more on margins. Is that the takeaway? Michael O\u2019Grady: Yes. I think I can only speak specifically for us, but I would say absolutely. We've already seen that in the, I'll call it, the portfolio of new business for 2024, which again transitions over essentially the next kind of 12 to 18 months, but it is higher-margin business for us because we are very intentional about that. Jim Mitchell : Right. Great. Thanks for that. Operator : And our next question will come from Steven with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : Hi, good morning. So I wanted to start-off with a question of just given the strong performance and better organic growth that was cited for wealth and asset servicing, looking -- given the favorable trends that were cited, I was hoping you could just speak to what drove the more subdued AUM and AUC growth relative to peers in 4Q? And are there any future plans to maybe include organic fee or asset growth targets in addition to the medium term targets that you just unveiled? Michael O\u2019Grady: Yes. Thanks for that question. Looking at asset servicing, in particular, just take one issue off the table, it was not a result of any client losses. Our client activity was very good in the quarter. Yes, it's important to note that currency movements were about 80% of the sequential decline. We also have a pretty high exposure to certain markets like fixed-income that were lower. And then the broader international markets also had some issues as well. So it was really more that than anything else. Steven Chubak : And regarding any potential plans to include future organic fee or asset growth targets as part of like the range of targets that you guys just revealed? Michael O\u2019Grady: Not at this point. And part of it is just the, I'll call it, the calculation and determination of organic growth does involve an estimate for the impacts of markets and currencies and things like that. So it's a great metric and KPI for us to drive the business at a granular level for us, but it's not, if you will, kind of a reportable number. And therefore, that's why we talk about it in the terms that we do. Steven Chubak : Understood. And if I could just squeeze one more, similar line of questioning to what Brennan asked on the medium term targets, but I actually want to drill down into pre-tax margin target. Given you already achieved a 30% profitability level in the back-half of this year, heard a lot on this call about the commitment to drive better efficiency from here. I was hoping to get some perspective or context as to what informed the decision to set the bar at 30 and not something higher in terms of the longer-term objectives. David Fox : So to your point, we hit 30% for the quarter, but we didn't hit 30% for the year. So we're still working our way into that range, which over-extended time periods, we've been in the 30 plus percent pre-tax margin range. And the rationale is similar to what I mentioned with Brennan's question, which is we're trying to drive the combination of growth and returns. So getting the margin up to some very-high level, if you will, but doing so by essentially cutting off growth is not going to produce the greatest value for shareholders. And so we think that right combination is in that kind of 30-plus range. So if you said low-30s, that's the area we've seen where we can have the -- that best combination of growth and returns. Steven Chubak : Understood. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Operator : And next will be Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Hi, Mike. Hi, Dave. Michael O\u2019Grady: Good morning. Gerard Cassidy : David, when you mentioned in response to one of the questions about your Northerns focused on building a sustainable financial model. Can you -- through the cycles, can you define what that sustainable financial model is from your viewpoint? David Fox : Yes. I mean, obviously, it means you can't rely on factors you don't control, right? So when you think about expenses, that's obviously a huge focus and you think about organic growth. Those are the two things you can spend a lot of your time on making sure you control those elements. And so you're always going to get buffeted by external events. There's nothing you can do about that, but you certainly can't predict it and you definitely don't control it. So the more organic growth you've got built into your model, the more resiliency you've got in your financial model and that's sustainable through time. So that is the overall goal is to get that expense curve down and get the organic growth up so that we can weather the storm if there is one going forward. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Thank you. And then a more macro question for Mike and you, Dave. What are some of the optimism many investors, we all seem to be sharing this optimism about the outlook for your business as well as the markets in general for 2025, the economy. We have a new administration coming in as we all know. What are the risks that you guys keep your eyes on aside from the geopolitical global risks, which we all know about? But when you guys sit around at the end-of-the day and the outlook again appears to be optimistic. But what are the risks that you talk about and always keep your eyes on? Michael O\u2019Grady: Sure. So it's interesting, Gerard, because it's basically, I'll say, the opposite of what Dave just said, right, which is, we focus on the things we can control and then I'll say we worry about all these things that we can't control. And that's the nature of, I'll say, the business we're in for our clients is so that we are resilient, we are trying to look-forward, but also just being a market participant and trying to generate obviously financial returns as well. And so the things that we focus on or are concerned about do relate to the macro-environment and what could happen to the extent that markets are down significantly. How are we prepared for that? And again, not just financially, but also for our clients or to the extent that there are, I'll say like operational risks in the environment that come as a result of greater volatility. How are we prepared for surge volumes in different parts of our business? So it's those types of things that are the greatest concern. And certainly, Central bank activity has a big impact on our business because it can affect the level of liquidity in the markets and it can also affect the rates that are earned and we're carrying obviously a large balance sheet. And when you think about time periods where we've had zero interest rates or negative in parts of the globe, that puts a lot of pressure again, not only on our clients, but on our financial model. And then when you see rates spike up, you get a different impact. So it's those types of things that where it's less about, I'll say, predicting what's going to happen and more about just being prepared for what could happen. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Thank you, Michael. Operator : Thank you. And that does conclude the question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the conference back over to Jennifer Childe, Director of Investor Relations. Jennifer Childe : Thank you, operator, and thanks everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again in the future. Operator : Thank you. And that does conclude today's conference call. We do thank you for your participation. Have an excellent day.",
