Shivangi Tipnis - Global Hunter Securities Joel Tiss - BMO Capital Markets Jim Krapfel - Morningstar Operator : Welcome, and thank you all for standing by. (Operator Instructions) And now I'll hand the call over to your host, Mr. John Brooklier. Sir, you may now begin. John Brooklier : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to ITW's first quarter 2014 conference call. Joining me this morning is our President and CEO, Scott Santi; and our CFO, Michael Larsen. During today's call, Scott, Michael and I will discuss our Q1 financial results as well as provide more detail on the $0.15 EPS raise for our 2014 full year guidance. At the end, we will open the call to your questions, and per our practice, we ask for your ultimate cooperation on our one question and one follow-up question policy. We have scheduled approximately one hour for today's call. Before I continue, let me remind you that this presentation contains our financial forecast for the 2014 second quarter and full year as well as other forward-looking statements identified on this slide. We refer you to the company's 2013 10-K for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from the company's expectations. Also this presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release, which can be found on our website at itw.com. Couple of other housekeeping items. Replay conference call number is 800-841-8616. No passcode is necessary. The playback will be available until 12 midnight of May 6, 2014. Finally, one other note, you'll notice that we have updated the format of the slides, which is intended to provide a more streamlined and concise presentation, while keeping the relevant content intact. We view this as another exercise in 80/20. So with that, I'll turn it over to Scott Santi, who will comment on the quarter. Scott? Scott Santi : Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. On the whole, we've had a good start to 2014 and we continue to be pleased with the progress we are making in executing our enterprise strategy. In the quarter, operating margins of 18.7% were up 180 basis points and adjusted after-tax return on invested capital was up 240 basis points to 17.2%, representing continued solid progress towards our stated goals of 20%-plus for each of these key metrics by 2017. Overall, organic growth was solid at 3.3% in the quarter, which we were able to achieve without any meaningful contribution from our Test and Measurement or Welding segments. Two of our strongest organic growth businesses historically due to a CapEx spending environment, they remain sluggish. An additional note related to the company's organic growth performance in the quarter is that we estimate that the portfolio of actions we have taken over the past two years had roughly a 100 basis point positive impact on the company's overall organic growth rate in Q1. Earnings per share of $1.01 were up 15% versus Q1 of last year, up 22% if you exclude a one-time gain of $0.05 a share in the prior-year quarter related to the acquisition of a majority interest in the joint venture. As a result of our operational execution and the progress we were able to make in Q1 on our stated goal to repurchase 50 million shares to offset the earnings per share dilution associated with the divestiture our industrial packaging segment, we are raising our full year, midpoint guidance by $0.15 to $4.55. The new full year midpoint represents EPS growth of 25% on a year-over-year basis. Michael will provide more detail on our revised Q2 and full year EPS forecast during his comments in a couple of minutes. Before turning the call over to Michael, let me conclude by recognizing and thanking the executive leadership team and all of our ITW colleagues around the world for the great job that they continue to do in serving their customers and executing on our enterprise strategy. Michael? Michael Larsen : Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 2, ITW had a good start to the year, as margin expansion and share repurchases contributed to EPS of $1.01, which was the high-end of our guidance range and a year-over-year increase of 15%. Total revenues were $3.6 billion, up 4.4% versus prior year with organic revenues up 3.3%. International growth was 6.3%, while North America was up 1%. In terms of end-markets, Automotive OEM, Food Equipment and Construction Products, all had good growth in the quarter. As usual, John will provide some more segment detail in a few minutes. Operating income in the quarter was $667 million, an increase of 16%, as margins expanded 180 basis points to 18.7%. Our enterprise initiatives, business structure simplification and strategic sourcing contributed a combined 120 basis points on a year-over-year basis, with strong execution across our businesses, as five out of seven segments expanded operating margins by more than 100 basis points. We were also pleased with 60% incremental margins in the quarter. Free operating cash flow for the quarter was $246 million. The conversion rate in the first quarter was driven by typical seasonality and we expect cash flows to increase from here, and our full year conversion rate should be greater than a 100% of net income. The sale process for the Industrial Packaging business remains on track and we are working towards May 1 closing date. We've accelerated the timing of the IPG-related share repurchase program and bought more than 18 million shares in the first quarter. We now expect to substantially complete the announced 50 million share repurchase program by the end of Q2. We anticipate that the ending diluted share count for 2Q is going to be approximately 400 million shares. We will discuss the positive impact of the lower share count in our updated guidance in a few minutes. So, in summary, a good start to the year, as the team continues to execute well on the enterprise initiatives. On Slide 3, our international organic revenue growth was up 6.3%, outpacing North America up 1% in the quarter and total organic was up 3.3%. We continue to see improvement in Europe up 5% with growth across the board, including Automotive OEM, Food Equipments and Test and Measurement. China and Australia are the key drivers of Asia-Pacific growth, up 7% with double-digit contributions from several businesses, partially offset by declines in Welding. Brazil is still fairly small for ITW, but led the way with an increase of 17%, as our South America organic revenues were up 18%. Finally, North America up 1% in the quarter with continued strength in Automotive and Food Equipment, while our businesses that are more closely linked to the CapEx cycle, such as Welding and Test and Measurement, were essentially flat. Weather had a fairly limited impact on our North American revenues, although sequentially we did see a slightly stronger March and April is off to a decent start. Moving to Slide 4. Solid execution across our segments led to margin expansion in the quarter with operating margins of 18.7%, an increase of 180 basis points from last year. In particular, Automotive OEM, Construction Products, Food Equipment and Polymers and Fluids put up some solid margin expansion numbers. The key drivers of the first quarter margin expansion are listed on the right side of the page. Operating leverage on the topline was 80 basis points and the largest driver of our margin expansion was 120 basis points from the continued progress at our enterprise initiatives. Price cost was 10 basis points and acquisitions are performing well, but reduced margins by 20 basis points. I'll be back in a few minutes to comment on second quarter and 2014 guidance, but let me first turn it over to John for some additional commentary on the quarter. John? John Brooklier : Thanks, Michael. On Slide 5, you'll see the breakdown of total revenues and operating income per segment. Michael noted earlier, Automotive OEM and Food Equipment segments led the way with 13% and 9% total revenue growth, respectively. Operating income for Auto OEM, Food Equipment and Construction Products produced significant year-over-year increases. Now, let me go further into each of our operating segments. Starting with Automotive OEM, this segment once again was ITW's fastest growing segment with organic revenues up 13% and that's outpacing worldwide auto builds by 8 percentage points. By geography, Europe grew 14%, North America 11% and China 28%. In Europe, we outperformed European auto builds by 7 percentage points largely due to our successful fuel release and powertrain product lines. In North America, we outpaced auto builds by 5 percentage point led by fasteners and body components. And in China, we continue to gain share with new and existing products. In sum, this was another very strong quarter of growth and profitability for our Auto OEM business, and the segment's strong operating margin of 23.3% was 350 basis points higher than the year-ago period. One thing I should note is auto builds are forecasted to moderate in the second quarter, but we still expect to maintain good penetration across all geographies. Moving to the next Slide. In our Test and Measurement and Electronic segment, organic revenues were essentially flat in the quarter. On the Test and Measurement side of the business sluggish CapEx spending and order delays resulted in 1% decline in organic revenues. On the Electronic side, revenues were flat in the quarter as our other electronics category, which includes businesses in areas such as contamination control and pressure-sensitive adhesives, they produced organic revenue growth of 4%. This was offset, however, by electronics assembly business, which saw organic revenues decline 7% in the quarter due to weak end-market demand. Looking ahead, we expect our Test and Measurement businesses to benefit from more recovery in end-markets and a push out of Q1 orders into the remainder of the year. Q1 operating margins of 12.2%, down largely as a result of increased restructuring. But I would remind everyone that our core operating margins for this segment, when you adjust for amortization and other cost is still approximately 16%. So the underlying profitability in this segment continues to be good. In Food Equipments, this segment delivered another very strong quarter globally of organic revenue growth, thanks to new product innovation and increased service capabilities. Total organic revenues grew 5% in Q1. In North America, equipment and service-related organic revenues grew 6% and 5% respectively. And internationally equipment produced strong organic revenue growth of 7% and service organic revenues 2%. Both improvements over last quarter are driven by growth in Germany, the U.K. and Switzerland. The segment continues to show strong profitability with operating margins of 18.6% and at the 190 basis points higher than year-ago period. On Slide 7. In our Polymers and Fluids segment, organic revenues were flat, primarily due to ongoing product line simplification, which we refer to as PLS here at ITW and the exiting of some low margin businesses. While growth is still lower than we'd like, the comps are easing, thanks to the work that was done in 2013. Notably, we did see a pickup in organic revenues in worldwide Fluids and Auto aftermarket. I would note that the Polymers category reflects most of our current PLS activity. The segment's profitability continues to improve with operating margin of 16.6% in the quarter and that's an improvement of 200 basis points versus year ago. In Welding, worldwide organic revenues declined 2% due to ongoing portfolio repositioning and slower pipeline activity in China as well as sluggish CapEx spending in North America. International organic revenues decline 10% in the quarter and that's mainly due to previously noted factors in China. And in North America, organic revenues grew only 1% and it was largely the result of weak CapEx spending from key customers and key sectors, such as heavy equipment. However, segment operating margins continue to be very strong at 25.7% and remains our most profitable segment company-wide. Moving to Slide 8. We continue to be very pleased with the topline and profitability progress in our Construction Product segment. Organic revenues grew 5% in Q1 and that was led by Asia-Pacific, where organic revenues were up 14%. This was due to strong new housing, retail and commercial construction in Australia and New Zealand. European revenues grew a modest 1% in the quarter. North America construction organic revenues were flat, as improvement in residential construction were offset by declines in the commercial construction category. Let me make a quick comment on our North American commercial construction business. While there has been talk of industry growth in the sector by both, peers and investors, our Dodge commercial data for Q1 on a square footage basis showed 13% less activity versus the year-ago period. We do, however, think we'll see better commercial construction growth as the year progress, so stay tuned. Profitability continues to improve as we execute our enterprise initiatives across the segment. Q1 operating margin of 14.8% showed an impressive 310 basis point improvement over the year-ago period. And in our final segment, Specialty Product segment, organic revenues grew 2% and was largely due to our consumer packaging businesses. Ground support grew 10% and appliance sector was flat. The segment continues to be very profitable with operating margins of 21.1%, that's 120 basis points higher than year-ago period. Now, let me turn the call back over to Michael, who will update you on our Q2 and full year forecast. Michael? Michael Larsen : Thanks, John. And as a result of our first quarter performance and lower share count, we're raising our full year EPS guidance by $0.15 to a range of $4.45 to $4.65. The midpoint of our updated guidance, the $4.55, represents an increase of 25% versus 2013, and we now expect full year operating margins in the mid-19s. We tighten the range for our full year revenue growth rate assumption and raising the low end from 2% to 3%, and we now expect total revenue growth to be in the 3% to 4% range. The organic revenue growth that goes with this assumption is unchanged at 2% to 3%. Our second quarter guidance, we expect EPS within a range of $1.16 to $1.24, and this assumes total revenue growth of 3% to 5% and 100 basis points of margin expansions on a year-over-year basis from the initiatives. So in summary, a good start to 2014. We're raising our full year EPS guidance by $0.15 to a range of $4.45 to $4.65 and the midpoint being a 25% increase year-over-year. With that, let me turn the call back over to John. John Brooklier : Thank you, Michael. Now, we'll open the call to your questions. And in the interest of giving more people a chance to ask questions, please honor our one question, one follow-up question request. We're targeting to complete this call at the top of the hour. We'll take our first question. Operator : Our first question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz. Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital : Scott, maybe you can step back and talk about your geographic markets from a perspective that in the beginning of the year you said North America could grow in the 3% to 4% range and Europe could grow in the 2% range. 1Q performance was basically the opposite. Should we look for more growth in Europe from you this year and maybe less in North America or do you expect it to normalize over time? I mean we noticed that you said weather wasn't that much of an impact in 1Q. Scott Santi : Well, I would say that based on our first quarter results, relative to our expectations heading into the year, I would say Europe has been a slight upside positive at 5% growth in the quarter, North America certainly at 1% was a lag. I don't know that that completely shifts our expectations for the year. I think we do see, again, based on some modest improvement in March and how April is tracking at North America at 1% probably we wouldn't expect that to be the number for the year. We would expect some incremental improvement in North America from here. And again, I think the overall demand levels out of Europe that we're seeing are pretty broad-based across our businesses and I would consider that to be pretty encouraging at this point. Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital : I think a follow-up to that really is around the construction business overall. Asia really got stronger in the quarter. I think it was 4% year-over-year growth last quarter to 14% this quarter. Is it fair to say that you're actually seeing a nice recovery in Australia now? And you did mention some expected improvement in Q2 in North America and you mentioned that April was starting off well. Are you seeing them improvement as the weather has gotten better here in the U.S. in April? Scott Santi : Yes, to both of your questions. I think Australia and New Zealand, clearly we're seeing some very positive overall demand improvement there. And we have sort of made a commitment not to talk about the weather as part of our results in the quarter, but what I would say is certainly North America for construction, along with the service business and Food Equipment were probably the two areas where it would be hard not to conclude that we had some pretty material weather impact on those businesses. And I think March and what we're seeing in April in construction in North America would suggest things are improving there for sure. Operator : Our next question comes from David Raso. David Raso - ISI Group : On the guidance increase of $0.15, can you quantify the way you're thinking about how much was from repo and how much was from essentially margins? Michael Larsen : So what I'll tell you is, of the $0.15 approximately half is shares and the other half is better operational performance, which you're seeing in the operating margins. And we now expect to be in the mid-19s versus our previous guidance of 19, squiggle 19. So it's about half and actually if you -- well, talk about the first quarter for a second, the performance in the first quarter versus the guidance, the better performance was driven equally about half from shares and the other half from better operations. David Raso - ISI Group : That's what I was thinking as well until you mentioned the more exact target on the margin, saying 19.5%? Scott Santi : We've said mid-19s, yes. David Raso - ISI Group : But before we were thinking 19%, correct? Scott Santi : That's correct. David Raso - ISI Group : Roughly, if you just add the 50 basis points there, I mean basically it looks like that alone at $0.10-plus. So I'm just making sure I'm not doing something wrong here in the sense of the margin improvement plus the repo would actually maybe a little more than $0.15, so I'm just trying to make sure I understand that 19% and 19.5% alone? Scott Santi : I mean I can't really comment on your math. The math we're doing here internally is about half of the improvement here is from margins and the other half is from lower share count. Operator : Next question comes from Rob Wertheimer. Rob Wertheimer - Vertical Research : I had a question about Brazil. There's been some mixed data in the economy and then I guess machinery and markets anyway coming out of there. I was curious where exactly you were strong, if it was content, if it was share, if it was what was going on there? And your thoughts on China as well, you mentioned the Auto, but just generally? Scott Santi : Well, I think our position in Brazil was pretty concentrated in the Polymers and Fluids area and also with Welding and a few other businesses. And so what I would say about our own results in Brazil is it's much less about the overall economy. We are sort of transitioning from a period going back two or three years, where we did a fair amount of acquisition activity there to get ourselves positioned and are now starting to operate -- we're starting to operate these businesses and I think get focused on the areas of opportunity in terms of growth. China for us, I think is right now clearly automotive is the leading business over there. We're seeing, what I would describe is more moderate overall economic activity across the number of our businesses. And the Welding business in the first quarter on a year-on-year basis was, Michael or John talked about it in his comments, a negative, primarily as a result of lower large oil and gas pipeline activity over there versus what was going on there last year. Rob Wertheimer - Vertical Research : If I can ask just one follow-up on Auto you mentioned in China. Can you talk just a bit just in principle about how the design curve works on your content wins? I mean you have done a great job obviously of growing auto markets. Is that something you can see reliably two years out, in three years at more that since your products aren't terribly complex, they can be engineered and faster? I'm just curious about how far out you'll take that? Scott Santi : We talked about that before. This is the one part of the company where we have a fair amount of forward visibility. We are working on things today that are going into model redesigns that are going to be executed three years out typically. Rob Wertheimer - Vertical Research : And you're still seeing content growth throughout that three-year period? Scott Santi : Yes. Operator : Next question comes from Jamie Cook. Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse : A couple of quick questions. Just to clarify, you increased your margin targets to mid-19 or so. Are you still expecting all the segments to show margin improvement in the quarter, because some of the results within the quarter, you know what I mean were mixed with some segments showing very strong improvement and some still showing decline. And then my second question, if you could just give a little more clarity on what you saw in the Test and Measurement on the order trend side, just sort of the trends you're seeing there and when you expect that to pick up and translate into revenue growth? Michael Larsen : Why don't I do the margin expansion questions and then maybe Scott you want to comment on Test and Measurement. So yes, we do expect all of our businesses to expand margins in 2014 versus 2013. And I think you will see that progress again in the second quarter, here we'll continue that. We talk about Test and Measurement, little bit of an outlier, in terms of some increase restructuring spend, but we fully expect that business to be back on track in terms of margin expansion as we move forward from the second quarter and into the rest of the year. So now your second question was on? Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse : Just the second question, because you noted in the slides the order of trends in testing and measurement. It sounds like there were some delays or something like that. Can you just talk about, give a little more clarity there, the more insight as to translate it. Scott Santi : What I would say about that is on the ground we're certainly seeing sort of better overall activity levels in terms of code activity levels, backlog is up. And from the timing and release standpoint, we're still seeing some fairly choppy customer demand from that standpoint. But again, I would say, the people in those business are feeling generally like things are heading in the right direction. The overall conditions are improving. I would say we're not in that mode with Welding at this point. Operator : Next question comes from Ann Duignan. Ann Duignan - JPMorgan: I know there have been a lot of questions about Automotive, but is it the right way to think about that business going forward that you'd be able to sustain growth at roughly the 2.5x to 3x global automotive build. Is that the right way to think about it for the next 12 to 18 months? Scott Santi : 2x to 3x, I don't think so. I think what we would be expecting on a longer term basis would be 300 to 400 basis points of market out performance on an annual basis. Ann Duignan - JPMorgan: And then on the enterprise initiatives, they are at the 120 bps to margins. Can you just break that out sourcing versus product line simplification or the different initiatives that you're undergoing? Scott Santi : They both contributed significantly to the 120 basis points. Ann Duignan - JPMorgan: But equal, equal at this point? Michael Larsen : We have said consistently we're not breaking this out, but to Scott's point they have both contributed significantly. Ann Duignan - JPMorgan: And just on the same follow-up then, price cost added 10 basis points. It added 40 basis points in Q4. Is there anything we should be watching out for on the price cost side or is it just tougher comps? Michael Larsen : No, there's really nothing unusual there. I mean I think the 10 basis points was a little bit lower than our assumptions for the year, which remains at 20 to 30 basis points of improvement. And so there is some timing and some FX headwind, but overall we continue to feel very comfortable about this 20 to 30 basis points for the year. Operator : Next question comes from Deane Dray. Deane Dray - Citigroup: Question for Michael. Post the close on industrial packaging you said, May 1, and you accelerated buybacks. Where do you expect leverage to come out on the second quarter and then the run rate exit for the year? Michael Larsen : You're talking about debt to EBITDA leverage, right? Deane Dray - Citigroup: Yes. Michael Larsen : So we're currently little on the high side, at 2.4x, as we accelerated the repurchase program in part, because we saw the transaction closing sooner. Our target leverage ratio remains in the approximately 2.2x to 2.3x EBITDA on a go forward basis. Deane Dray - Citigroup: And are you at all constrained -- and this is more directed to Scott also, but the idea on M&A, I know there is going to be -- we've shifted two-thirds core revenue growth, one-third M&A. How are you thinking about M&A for the balance of the year or might you be a bit constrained on the balance sheet? Scott Santi : Well, I don't think given the cash flow of the company, the balance sheet isn't really the issue, where I would describe our position near-term is similar to what I've said I think couple of quarters ago on the call, which is given all that we are currently executing inside of the company around these initiatives and also our focus on organic acceleration, M&A isn't our near-term priority for us. But that being said, we did three really nice medium-sized deals last year that were really strong strategic fits and should similar opportunities emerge this year, we would not hesitate to pull the trigger. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Volkmann. Stephen Volkmann - Jefferies: I think you called out some POS headwinds kind of on the topline for both Welding and Polymers and Fluids. I'm curious if you have visibility into sort of how long that lasts and when that's simplification kind of gets anniversaried and the growth rates might start giving a little better? Scott Santi : I don't think we said that was an issue in Welding, in Polymers and Fluids, definitely. And what I would say is we're probably looking at in terms of drag another quarter or two maximum. And John pointed out, as we're seeing in the couple of businesses inside Polymers and Fluids that are coming out at the other end of that, in the Fluids platform that was up 4% organically. John Brooklier : Auto, aftermarket also up. Stephen Volkmann - Jefferies: And on Welding I thought you were sort of trying to get away from shipbuilding or something? Scott Santi : Well, I think that's really more of the portfolio repositioning we've done and that's been going out in the last couple of years there. So that's becoming less and less of the portfolio. I think they think they're going to probably be through most of that by the end of the year. This has been a two-plus year transition in the portfolio. Operator : Our next question comes from Eli Lustgarten. Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research : Can I get a one clarification on share count? You said you're going to finish your program at the end of second quarter, maybe roughly 400 million shares at the end of the quarter. Is that the number we should use for the second half of the year or do you intend to have some more normal share repurchases after that? Scott Santi : The 400 million shares is the projected share count at the end of the second quarter. And so our focus here right now is on completing the IPG-related shares repurchase program, the 50 million shares that we announced back in September. And then we'll kind of reassess where we're at by the end of second quarter and we would be able to give you an update on the next earnings call. But what I will tell you in terms of our capital allocation strategy, it has not changed. And so we remained focused on internal reinvestments in the business for future growth and margin expansion. We will continue the dividend obviously and then we'll balance acquisitions and share repurchases based on the best risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders. And so that hasn't changed. Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research : I was just asking whether the guidance to $4.45, $4.65 assume that the share stay at 400 for the rest of the year? That's what I was just checking on that? Scott Santi : That is correct. Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research : And from an operation, Welding has always been a problem child. Do you have any forecast for any improvement in Welding for the rest of this year or you'll have to wait until 2015? Scott Santi : Well, let me first of all, Eli, disagree with your characterization that Welding is a problem child. Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research : Well, the value topline that I was talking about. Scott Santi : Yes. So those of you that follow the company know that Welding has been historically one of our strongest organic growers, high single-digits through the cycle. The big thing that's going to get, Welding going again is North America honestly that we are still in the midst of a pretty significant contraction in the heavier equipment segments of the market that we serve. In our view, that's not a structural issue, that's a cyclical issue. We expect that to turn around hopefully some time this year. And at least our experience in Welding is once things do turn, we have six, eight quarters that are really solid organic growth. Operator : Next question comes from Andy Casey. Andy Casey - Wells Fargo : Just a couple of clarifications, I guess. On mid-19% operating margin guidance, is there any change in the anticipated restructuring or is that all driven by better operational performance? Scott Santi : That's all better operational performance. So the restructuring for the year at approximately $100 million has not changed. Andy Casey - Wells Fargo : And then back on the sluggish CapEx trends specifically North American Welding. I am just curious -- and Scott, you kind of answered this, but can you comment on whether you saw any month-over-month improvement in that business in quoting or orders during Q1? Scott Santi : Maybe some modest sequential improvement towards March, but nothing that I would say gives us any sort of enthusiasm at this point that we're seeing a real turn there. Andy Casey - Wells Fargo : And that typically how closely in line would that be with an increase in construction activity. I realize heavy equipment can be used in other stuff, but if there is an improvement as John indicated on the Construction Products business in the second half. Would that normally drive up Welding as well? Scott Santi : Commercial construction will have some positive impact. Although the place of real softness again is more ag-equipment, mining equipment, et cetera. Operator : Next question comes from John Inch. John Inch - Deutsche Bank : Mike, what are the expected proceeds, net cash proceeds from the completion of the IP sale is expected to be? Michael Larsen : The gross budget is $3.2 billion and we anticipate that the after-tax will be in the low-2s. John Inch - Deutsche Bank : And then what exactly are you planning to do with the cash, because obviously you've sort of completed this, I realize what you just said that you're going to evaluate share repurchase at the end of the second quarter, but just help me, if there is some obvious earmark for in excess of $2 billion, because in theory, right, you can get your leverage targets simply by growing EBITDA as the outlook for the economy in your businesses continue to improve and you still get benefits of simplification. So I'm just curious on your thoughts toward deployment of the $2 billion? Michael Larsen : So a little bit more than half of that will be utilized for the share repurchase program and get that completed by the end of the second quarter. And the balance will essentially be to reduce our outstanding commercial paper and get our debt to EBITDA leverage back into the 2.25 range that we discussed earlier. John Inch - Deutsche Bank : Are there thoughts then just because interest rates are still very favorable toward -- again, as you grow your EBITDA, right, perhaps some more permanent swap of some of the commercial paper into term debt? Because otherwise you're going to have leverage that's -- financial leverage that's too low, if you continue on this track. So I'm just trying to understand how you're managing the product? Michael Larsen : Right, so I think we've actually been fairly opportunistic here in terms of locking in rates and what we think is an attractive low interest environment and extending the duration of our debt portfolio. And so as I think you maybe aware we issued $2 billion worth of bonds here in the first quarter with an average duration little over six year, then a coupon that's on average in the low-2s. And we have some additional plans here for the rest of the year. I think if you look at kind of a bigger picture, if you take a step back and look at where we were three years ago, so the average rate on our debt is about 200 basis points lower today than it was three years ago. The duration has been extended from fairly short-term in the three to four year range to well north of 10 years. So I think we've been fairly opportunistic in terms of our capital structure and are taking advantage of the current rate environment. John Inch - Deutsche Bank : And then, Scott, if you will just take a look at simplification, enterprise initiatives, clearly this is paying pretty handsome dividends to ITW. Could you just remind us or give us your perspective, which of your segments are ahead of where you would have expected maybe a year ago and which still seem to have work to do? Because I don't think just a print of margins or performance alone gets at the underlying. So I'm very interested in your perspective of which of your segments kind of are ahead and which are behind? Scott Santi : Well, I think where I would start on that is I think the sort of scope of work if you will that we had to do certainly varied at the front-end by segment and I would sort of point to -- if you look at the simplification initiatives as one example within Food Equipment and Welding, which were businesses that were the starting points was at a much larger overall division structure relative to the rest of the company. They had much less work to do. The other end of the spectrum was Polymers and Fluids that was 130-odd divisions. So haven't really thought about it in terms of who's ahead or behind. But what I would say is I think overall the level of progress and execution remains robust and brisk. And there is a fair amount of runway left. This isn't something we're wrapping up in the next couple of quarters, as we've talked before that we've got another couple of years easy of some continued work to do that is both accretive to our overall numbers, you know what our performance goals are and also it's going to result in a company that's much more focused and much more effective in terms of the growth agenda that we have going forward. Michael Larsen : Right, but for instance Polymers and Fluids, I mean obviously it still has issues, but it might actually be ahead, which could in theory gives it a lot of operating leverage as the business starts to see better fundamental topline, for example, or Welding might be a little bit behind, which may help to explain a little bit of the margin. I don't know, I'm just -- is there any other sort of parsing that you might call out, Scott? Scott Santi : I don't know. I was talking about construction before in terms of big margin improvement opportunity there. I think the progress, I think were up 250 basis points. Even the Auto business that I think is, there is sort of templates for kind of organic growth we want to build in all of our businesses has still got a pretty rigorous business structure simplification, an in sourcing agenda in front of it. So a lot of leverage in terms of revenue growth, but margins up in the first quarter year-on-year, significant percentage of that was related to the initiatives as well. So it's hard for me to think in terms of who's ahead and behind. I think because the specific to-do list in each of the segments is pretty unique to those segments. But in general, I don't think we've got anybody dogging it. I think everybody is getting after it pretty good. Operator : Our next question comes from Ajay Kejriwal. Ajay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: So I wanted to drill into the organic growth rate a little bit. Clearly a positive surprise as far as our model is concerned. And Scott, I know you've spent some time talking about China, Brazil and other markets. So the 6%that you're seeing in international markets 1Q, is there anything, as you analyze the performance there that jumps out as either channel related or anything that suggests that 6% may not be sustainable for the year? Scott Santi : Nothing that I can think of Ajay. Ajay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: So international continues at, say, around 6% and maybe better in the North America kind of based on what I heard earlier in the call, takes up, so we could expect growth rate to be better than what you printed in 1Q, right? Scott Santi : I think we've talked about this before. Our forecasting approach in terms of what we're looking is that we're going to use run rates that we're seeing in the businesses today. You are certainly free to analyze the upside and downside opportunities and risks around that. But we've talked before about the fact that in our business model we have no incentive to get ahead of ourselves. We have a very fast reaction, fast cycle time, supply chain and manufacturing approach. And so from our standpoint, the most prudent planning assumptions for us are really deal with what we're seeing on the ground today. Ajay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Of course conservative is better as far as we are concerned, so good organic. Now, maybe on the incremental margins, real nice performance there, talk a little bit about Construction Products, so obviously it was an okay quarter, but margins picking up. How should we think about incrementals in that business as revenue start coming back? Scott Santi : Well, I think the endgame there, as I've talked before, a number of us have talked is in terms of the raw material in that business from a performance standpoint, we expect that business to perform from a margin rate standpoint at or above the company goals on a long-term basis. Given where they are today, despite a significant amount of improvement in the first quarter, as there is still some room to improve further between where they are in that 20%-plus goal. So the answer to your question is incremental margins for the next eight quarters are to be really good and accelerating topline helps us get there faster. Operator : Our next question comes from Shivangi Tipnis. Shivangi Tipnis - Global Hunter Securities : My first question is on pricing. So you commented that it was about 10%. Was it linear across all segments? Michael Larsen : No. The 10% is really an average. Scott Santi : It wasn't 10%. Michael Larsen : The 10 basis points. Shivangi Tipnis - Global Hunter Securities : Yes. Sorry, the 10 basis points. Michael Larsen : So the 10 basis points is really an average, and I wouldn't read too much into it in terms of we have different timing around price increases in the various segments, and we had some FX impact in one business that we didn't see in another businesses. And so I would say we're still holding to the 20 basis points to 30 basis points for the year and we're comfortable with that assumption. Shivangi Tipnis - Global Hunter Securities : But then what was the most pricing pressures and in what segment did you see the most headwinds that contributed to the lower expected EPS form the pricing? I think you were expecting at least 20 basis points even in the first quarter and you got about 10, can you talk about the headwinds? Scott Santi : Yes. Again, I mean there is really nothing unusual in terms of head or tailwinds in the first quarter other than what I described. And so fairly normal quarter, in terms of price cost for us. Shivangi Tipnis - Global Hunter Securities : And one question on the auto build rates, can you talk a little bit about the near-term moderation in the auto build rates that you were talking about? And is this going to be globally, including China? Scott Santi : We expect auto build rates in the second quarter to be in the sort of 1% to 2% range. That's a worldwide number. We would expect that virtually all of the geographies to be down sequentially from where they were in Q1. Into Q2, China looks like it's going to be roughly about the same. I don't think we see much of a change in China, but Europe looks like it's going to have a lower build rate based on the data we're seeing right now. North America looks like it's going to be a lower build rate. But remember, we continue to add our penetration numbers on top of that. Shivangi Tipnis - Global Hunter Securities : So just as a clarification, you mentioned that you would comfortably be able to outperform the auto build rates even with the moderation, is that correct? Scott Santi : That's correct. But I think what we're basically trying to say is don't expect double-digit growth in Auto for next quarter based on a foundation of lower build rates. Operator : Next question comes from Joel Tiss. Joel Tiss - BMO Capital Markets : I have just one quick question. Can you talk about some of the successes and maybe some frustrations on the organic growth and just what you're seeing, like you've done a great job of pointing out the gas cap, not having a gas cap anymore, those sorts of things, but just a little bit of color there? Scott Santi : One of the things I would point out to is I would go back to the comment I made at the outset of the call, which is we've worked very hard on shaping the portfolio, so that we are in a collection of businesses that we have a lot of conviction about their ability to grow at a healthy clip organically. And again, those actions resulted in an overall organic growth rate for the company of a 100 basis points better in Q1 that would have been if we still were in some of the businesses that we have divested. I would say, characterize our progress in organic as frustration at all. I think we're just getting in the position we've talked before about the fact that we've a lot of activity inside the company. We're trying to be very delivered. I'm talking about simplification and sourcing. We're trying to be very delivered about making sure that we're focused on the right things at the right time. This year is a year we expect to turn our attention more to the organic growth agenda. But keep in mind we still have more than a fair amount of activity going on internally. But I think some of the acceleration on organic growth, we talked about Auto, Food Equipment now, Construction, Test and Measurement, it looks like its going to get going and then we've got a couple of other businesses that are not where we wanted them to be. We talked about Welding, that's much more of a situation relative to the current market environment. And Polymers and Fluids, we got to get through this period of sort of reshaping and refocusing, but expect that business to certainly contribute from our organic standpoint. So I think we feel much better about the quality of the portfolio that we are going forward with, in terms of its organic growth potential and certainly expect to continue progress as we move down the road. Operator : Our next question comes from Jim Krapfel. Jim Krapfel - Morningstar: So you're still expecting a run rate of 100 basis points of margin improvements from your initiatives through the rest of 2014. Is that right? Michael Larsen : That's correct. On a year-over-year basis, we expect 100 basis points a quarter from BSS and from sourcing. Jim Krapfel - Morningstar: And then how much do you think you have left in the tank then for 2015? Michael Larsen : Well, I think the way we'd answer that question is similar to what Scott talked about earlier, as we've laid out our goals very clearly for 2017, which is 20%-plus operating margins and 20%-plus return on invested capital on an after-tax basis. And so we're not going to give guidance for 2015 today, but the trajectory and the targets we've laid out as we continue to progress on this enterprise strategy, we're very confident that we will be able to achieve those targets. Operator : Thank you. At this time there are no further questions on queue. John Brooklier : So we thank everybody for joining us on today's call. And we look forward to talking to you again. Have a great day. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, sir. So that concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Welcome, and thank you, all, for joining today's conference. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. And now I'll turn today's conference over to John Brooklier. Thank you, sir. You may begin. John L. Brooklier: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to ITW's Second Quarter 2014 Conference Call. Joining me this morning is our CEO, Scott Santi; and our CFO, Michael Larsen. During today's call, we will discuss our strong Q2 financial results and update you on our earnings forecast. As usual, we will open the call to your questions. [Operator Instructions] We have scheduled 1 hour for today's call. Before we get to the quarterly data, let me remind you that this presentation contains our financial forecast for the 2014 third quarter and full year, as well as other forward-looking statements identified on this slide. We refer you to the company's 2013 10-K for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Also, this presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release. With that housekeeping taking place, I will turn the call over to Scott Santi, who will make some brief overview comments on the quarter. Scott? E. Scott Santi : Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Overall, we were pleased with our performance in the quarter and with the continued progress we are making in executing our enterprise strategy in what continues to be a mixed environment. Our operating margins in the quarter of 20.5% were up 300 basis points, and after-tax return on invested capital was also up 300 basis points to 19.5%, representing continued solid progress towards our enterprise performance goals of 20%-plus for each of these metrics by 2017. 6 of our 7 segments improved operating margins in the quarter, with strong performance across the board as enterprise initiatives contributed 120 basis points to overall margin improvement. The environment continued to be mixed, and overall revenues were up 4% and organic revenue up 1.4%, lower than our Q1 growth rate, primarily due to more challenging comps internationally and lower auto builds. In addition, ongoing product line and customer base simplification associated with the execution of our enterprise strategy reduced our organic growth by approximately 1 percentage point. There were some encouraging signs in North America as our Test & Measurement business and Welding business both grew 4%. For the first half of 2014, total revenues are up 4% and organic up 2.3%, both in line with the top line guidance we've been giving since December. EPS of $1.21 was up 32% versus Q2 of last year, slightly ahead of the midpoint of our guidance. And as a result of performance year-to-date and our confidence in the outlook for the second half of the year, we are narrowing and slightly raising our guidance range today. The new full year midpoint represents a 26% increase on a year-over-year basis. In closing, I'd like to thank the ITW team for the strong performance and continued progress they've delivered in the quarter. In year 2 of our 5-year enterprise strategy, we are pleased with the progress so far and confident in our ability to deliver on our enterprise performance goals. Now let me turn the call over to Michael Larsen, our CFO. Michael? Michael M. Larsen: Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Okay. Let's start with the financial summary on Page 2. Q2 was another quarter of strong operational execution, resulting in EPS of $1.21, an increase of 32% year-on-year. As you may recall, last year had a $0.05 nonrecurring pension settlement charge. So on an adjusted basis, EPS increased 25%. The operating teams continue to execute well on their business structure simplification and sourcing efforts, delivering record operating margins of 20.5%, a 300-basis-points improvement over last year with 120 basis points of margin expansion from the enterprise initiatives. Total revenues were $3.7 billion, up 4% versus prior year, with organic revenues up 1.4%, below our Q1 organic growth rate, primarily as a result of more difficult comps internationally. For the first half of 2014, our total revenues are up 4%, 2.3% organically, in line with the revenue guidance we've been giving since December of last year. In the quarter, we essentially completed the portfolio management element of our 5-year enterprise strategy with the sale of the Industrial Packaging business and we're confident that our current portfolio of differentiated businesses is well positioned for growth with best-in-class margins and return on invested capital. We also completed the share repurchase program related to Industrial Packaging by repurchasing 17 million shares in the quarter, bringing the total share repurchases to 50 million shares since the announcement in September of last year. Our ending diluted share count for Q2 is 400 million shares. And since September, we've spent $4 billion and repurchased 11% of our outstanding shares. Our remaining share repurchase authorization is $2.8 billion, and given the performance of the company and our outlook for 2014 and beyond, we fully expect to repurchase shares opportunistically in the second half of the year. Free operating cash flow for the quarter was $0.5 billion and our conversion rate is tracking to be greater than 100% for the full year, in line with our previous guidance. Finally, as you can see, our return on invested capital on an after-tax basis was 19.5%, an improvement of 300 basis points. In summary, the ITW team continue to make good progress on the enterprise strategy in a mixed environment, and we remain on track for a strong 2014, which I'll discuss in more detail in a few minutes. On Page 3, some more color on the organic growth rate for the quarter, with North America up 1%, with continued strength in Automotive, up 8%, and Food Equipment, up 4%. As Scott said, we were encouraged by our Welding segment and Test & Measurement business in North America, both up 4%. International growth was 2% in the second quarter compared to 6% in the first quarter, primarily due to tougher comps in Europe and South America. Internationally, strength in Automotive and Test & Measurement and Electronics was partially offset by expected declines in Welding. You can see, Europe up 1% in the quarter; South America down 5%; and Asia Pacific up 7%, as China and Australia performed well. In China, Automotive was up 22%, Food Equipment, up 14%; Polymers & Fluids, up 9%. Since we will be mentioning product line and customer base simplification, what we commonly refer to as PLS, a few times today, let me just spend a minute and put this core element of our 80/20 management process in the context of our enterprise strategy. An integral part of our 80/20 process and our enterprise strategy is to focus on quality of revenue and not quantity. And through product line and customer base simplification, our segments are eliminating the complexity and overhead costs associated with smaller product lines and customers and focusing their businesses on supporting and growing with their largest customers and product lines. PLS is a core element of our 80/20 management process and an integral component of our ability to achieve sustainable, best-in-class margins and returns going forward. In year 2 of our enterprise strategy, PLS is a natural and expected outgrowth of our business-structure simplification initiative as we now focus on reapplying ITW's proprietary 80/20 management process to our 90 new larger-scale divisions. We quantified the reduction on organic revenue to be approximately 1 percentage point, and we fully expect that focusing the company on taking full advantage of the considerable growth potential that resides within our largest customers and product lines will achieve improved overall organic growth performance over the medium and long term. The financial impact of product line and customer base simplification continues to be fully captured in our guidance as we continue to expect total year revenues up 3% to 4% and organic revenues up 2% to 3% in what continues to be a mixed environment. Moving on to Slide 4. Operating margins were a highlight this quarter, as solid execution across the board led to operating margins of 20.5%, an increase of 300 basis points from last year. 6 out of 7 segments expanded margins in a big way, many achieving the record levels of profitability, as Construction Products, Automotive OEM, Polymers & Fluids, Specialty Products and Test & Measurement and Electronics all put up solid margin expansion numbers. As you can see, businesses such as Polymers & Fluids and Construction are now approaching sustainable 20%-plus operating margins, levels that, frankly, seemed out of reach just a few years ago. In a sluggish environment, Welding essentially maintained their best-in-class 26% operating margin for the quarter. On the right side of the page, we've listed the drivers, with 120 basis points from the continued progress on our enterprise initiatives, operating leverage of the top line growth was 40 basis points, and price/cost was again a favorable 10 basis points. And with a few exceptions, the material cost environment remains benign. You can see the 130 basis points of margin favorability from other, which includes the nonrecurring pension settlement in the year-ago quarter. With that, I'll be back in a few minutes to discuss the third quarter and updated 2014 guidance. But first, let me turn it over to John for some additional commentary on the segments. John? John L. Brooklier: Thanks, Michael. On Slide 5, you'll see a breakdown of total revenue and operating income per segment. And while Auto OEM and Food Equipment segments led the way in top line growth, 5 of our 7 segments produced double-digit growth and operating income. In particular, and as noted earlier, Construction Products and Auto OEM achieved operating income gains of 32% and 26%, respectively. You'll see further evidence of this as we highlight significant operating margin progress for nearly all of our segments. Now I'll go into further detail on our operating segments. On the right-hand side of the page, in Auto OEM, the segment produced another outstanding quarter on multiple fronts. Organic revenues grew 8%, outpacing worldwide auto builds by 6 percentage points. By geography, organic revenues for Europe grew 9%; North America, 8%; and China was up 22%. Our European businesses outperformed European auto builds by 7 percentage points, largely due to our fuel and powertrain product lines. In North America, we outpaced auto builds by 4 percentage points, thanks to our plastic fastener and powertrain products. And in China, we continued to gain share via multiple product lines outperforming auto builds by 11 percentage points. The drop-through to the bottom line was very strong as segment margins of 23.7% were 310 basis points higher than the year-ago period. Great performance by Auto. In our Test & Measurement and Electronics segment on Slide 6, organic revenues increased 1% in Q2. The good news is that we saw improvement in the Test & Measurement portion of the segment in the quarter. The T&M portion, their organic revenues grew 6%, thanks in large part to the strength from our flagship Instron business, which was up 8% in Q2. We're hopeful that the better performance in T&M and Instron is suggestive of a more sustained pickup of CapEx spending, and we're encouraged by order activity and backlog as we move into the third quarter. In the Electronics piece of the business, organic revenues declined 3%, largely due to comps in the electronics assemblies business. We believe this category will improve as the year progresses. For the segment, operating margins of 15.2% were 150 basis points higher than the year-ago period. Looking at Food Equipment. Segment organic revenue growth was 3% and largely reflected global contributions from its equipment and service businesses. In North America, equipment and service-related organic revenues grew 4% and 5%, respectively. Equipment's organic revenue growth was driven by an increase in the sales of refrigeration and cooking products. Internationally, equipment revenues increased 5%, thanks to a strong warewash and refrigeration sales. International service organic revenues declined 2% due, in part, to some weakness in France. And once again, the segment's operating margins of 19.5% improved with 80 basis points of improvement versus the prior year period. Moving to Slide 7. In our Polymers & Fluids segment, organic revenues declined 3%, and that was largely attributable to our ongoing PLS activity. As Michael noted earlier in his PLS comments, we continue to weed out the less profitable products and customers in this and other segments. As a result, PLS has had the typical impact of decreasing organic revenues but improving margins. All 3 of our platforms, polymers, fluids & hygiene and auto aftermarket, posted declining organic revenues of 6%, 3% and 1%, respectively. The much better news is that segment operating margins moved up significantly to 19.6%, and that was 130 basis points higher than the year-ago period. In the Welding segment, worldwide organic revenues declined 2% but that was largely due to specific international business, as well as some targeted PLS customer back activity. The international organic revenue decline of 15% was due to a convergence of events. In China, we were once again hit by comps related to the completion of the portfolio transition from a shipbuilding to an energy-infrastructure focus. We believe, however, that this comp will ease in the Q3 and beyond. We also experienced some delays in onshore pipeline projects in China. In Europe, we implemented PLS activity in Germany, and our Middle East business was negatively impacted by political events in the region. The much better news came from North America. And as Michael mentioned earlier, organic revenues increased 4% in the quarter. We saw some early signs of strengthening in equipment sales for both the industrial and commercial end markets and continued growth in the welding gun area. We also expect Welding to benefit from easier second half 2014 comps. And we'll remind you that the company-leading operating margins of 26.3%, while they were down 20 basis points, is still a very strong performance. On Slide 8, we continue to be very pleased with the dramatically improving profitability metrics in our Construction Products segment despite some uneven organic revenue performance. Segment top line reflected geographic variability as Asia Pacific's organic revenues grew 8%, thanks to our residential and commercial construction growth in Australia and New Zealand. You'll recall, we also had good performance in Australia and New Zealand in the first quarter. Our North American Construction-related organic revenues declined 2% as our residential business was moderately negative, thanks in part to some ongoing PLS activity, while our renovation and commercial construction business showed modest growth. In Europe, organic revenues declined 4% as commercial construction activity was especially soft in France. As we have consistently communicated with our investors, at this point in time, we are chiefly focused on improving the profit profile of this segment through both business structure simplification and PLS initiatives. We are clearly on the right path as Construction Products' operating margins of 18.2% were 450 basis points higher than the year-ago period. And then finally, in our Specialty Products segment, organic revenues were flat as a pickup in a variety of our consumer packaging businesses, principally our film, gluing systems and apparel-related units, was offset by delays in projects for our warehouse automation products. Our appliance business grew organic revenues 1%, while our ground support organic revenues were flat. Strong segment operating margins of 24.2% were 180 basis points higher than the year-ago period. Now let me turn the call back over to Michael, who will cover our 2014 and third quarter guidance. Michael? Michael M. Larsen: Okay. Thanks, John. Our financial performance in the first half of '14 and the positive momentum on the enterprise initiatives gives us increased confidence in our ability to deliver on our financial commitments for 2014 and beyond. For 2014, we're raising the EPS midpoint slightly and narrowing our full year EPS guidance range to $4.50 to $4.62, which compares to the previous range of $4.45 to $4.65. The new $4.56 midpoint represents an increase of 26% versus 2013 on unchanged total 3% to 4% revenue growth. As you can tell, we're not counting on a second half acceleration of revenues. Our balance sheet and cash position is excellent and we fully expect to repurchase shares opportunistically in the second half of the year. At this point, we can't be more specific in terms of timing or magnitude, and we have not included any impact from lower share count in the updated guidance today. With the month of July, the third quarter is off to a good start and we expect Q3 EPS to be in a range of $1.19 to $1.27, again with 3% to 4% total revenue growth and continued year-over-year margin expansion with approximately 100 basis points coming from our enterprise initiatives. We're pleased with our first half financial performance with total revenues up 4%, operating margins of 19.6%, an improvement of 240 basis points, and EPS up 23%. In addition, following the completion of our portfolio management efforts, we now have 7 highly differentiated segments with significant growth potential going forward. While much work is still ahead of us, 2014, the second year of our 5-year enterprise strategy, is shaping up to be a year of continued progress as the ITW team works hard to further expand margins and returns, and we continue to redeploy our strong cash flows in a disciplined and returns-focused manner. In addition, we believe that many of the efforts that we're undertaking today are positioning the company for stronger organic growth in the future. With that, let me turn the call back over to John. John L. Brooklier: Thanks, Michael. We will now open the call to your questions. [Operator Instructions] We'll take the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question, Andrew Kaplowitz, Barclays. Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Scott, so you've talked in the past about some of the bigger CapEx markets potentially coming back such as Test & Measurement and Welding. In 2Q, you did see some of that improvement. So do you think this is the inflection in sort of these large CapEx markets that we've been waiting for? And you did mention pretty good order visibility into 3Q, and that's despite ag being weak, which we know is part of the Welding business. So maybe you could talk about that. E. Scott Santi : Yes. Andy, I don't think that we've seen enough to say it would be an inflection point by any stretch, particularly given the overall choppiness of the environment. I think we were generally pleased with, certainly, a noticeable pickup in the order rates in both businesses in North America. But I think we'd like to see another quarter or 2 before we call it an inflection, for sure. Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division : And then, Scott, in terms of ag, are you worried about that affecting the Welding business a little more as you go forward in the second half? E. Scott Santi : I don't think so. I think right now, we're -- I don't expect things to get a whole lot worse there. And again, the overall mix, ag represents 10%-ish of our revenues in North America. So I think we've got a nice mix of end-market exposure there that even if it did erode further, I don't think it's going to put us off our plan at all for the year. Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay. And then maybe just another big-picture question. Like business simplification through PLS is -- it's actually slowing down some of your businesses that you just talked about. But you've talked about how it eventually will accelerate organic growth. So the headwind that you mentioned was 1% in the quarter. When do you think that headwind will turn into a tailwind? Is that next year, end of this year? Like how should we look at that? E. Scott Santi : Well, I think it's a little early to tell. I think we'll have a little bit better view for you on '15 as we get to December and we've gone through our planning process. What I would say is it's in our plans for the next 2 quarters. As Michael said earlier, this is -- we are front and center on the reapplication of 80/20 across our 90 scaled-up divisions and it's certainly a normal and expected part of the process. So what I can say for sure is for the next 2 quarters, we expect a similar sort of impact that's fully embedded in our guidance. And I think we need to get through our '15 planning process to have a better view internally and what we can share externally on how that ultimately impacts our overall performance in '15, if at all. Operator : The next question from Deane Dray, Citi. Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : So year 2 enterprise strategy and you're already bumping up on the operating margin, 20%, and the return on invested capital target. So is it time to start setting the bar higher? Should we be going some -- temper expectations for further improvement? But just help put us in context as you get there sooner than you thought. E. Scott Santi : Well, what I would, I guess, sort of offer as a reminder is this is 1 quarter, not a full year. So I think what -- where we are sets us up certainly, for us to be able to at least hit those 2 metrics in '15 given the progress that we're making. And I think what I would say is we still have plenty of work to do across all of these initiatives. We are not done with BSS, not done with sourcing. So we would expect continued progress as we move forward. But it -- but we haven't sort of boxed the upper end at this point and we're really managing the company quarter-by-quarter, and ultimately, we'll talk about where we think we can get in '15 late this year. Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : And Scott, I probably should've added a congratulations within that question because you did get there faster and those are impressive numbers. And then the second question is on capital allocation. So just in terms of how you've couched buybacks to be opportunistic, other uses of cash, maybe the M&A environment, the target has been 1/3 of your revenue growth to come from M&A, but it's been pretty quiet there. So maybe put that in context for us, please. Michael M. Larsen: Yes, Dean, so this is Michael here. So what I would start with is that our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged. As you know, we've been very disciplined and returns-focused. And we generate a significant amount of cash. And priority one is reinvesting in our businesses, whether those are CapEx projects or new products given our innovation efforts, as well as BSS or restructuring efforts. And so all of those projects are fully funded. The second priority is our dividend. We have a -- roughly a 2% dividend yield at this point. And the dividend continues to grow in line with our cash flows as -- and has done so for a little over 50 years. And we certainly view that as an important component of our capital allocation strategy. And so that leaves the balance, approximately 50% of our total cash flows, for we've -- what we've called external investments. And really, that encompasses acquisitions, which, under the right set of conditions and financial criteria, would take priority over share repurchases. Given where we're at in terms of the M&A environment and also given our strong balance sheet and cash position and our view of where the company is going to be, not just in 2014 but really as we continue to execute this 5-year strategy, we have a preference for repurchasing shares. And so that's what we alluded to in the second half of the year, is that we will -- rather than an announced program like the one we just completed for -- associated with the IPG divestiture, is an attempt to be more opportunistic as we go into the balance of the year and also, as we start to think about 2015 and putting together the plans for next year. So that's how I'd position it for you, Deane. Operator : Next question, Jamie Cook, Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Andrew Buscaglia - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : This is actually Andrew on behalf of Jamie. Just a quick question on Construction. So you guys spoke about there's some -- still some uncertainty, I think, and some mixed commentary on housing and commercial construction. Would you guys say you're -- have changed your stance on this segment at all in terms of becoming more cautious of recovery? Or what's your view at this point, as it relates to how it was 6 months ago when the year started? E. Scott Santi : Well, I don't think it's changed at all. I think what we've been saying for the last year for our business in the Construction or in our focus, that we had a business that had the potential to generate a significantly greater level of earnings at the current revenue base than what we have been performing to. So our focus for the last 4 to 6 quarters has largely been on getting our Construction business up to margins and profitability levels that we could see in terms of their potential. And I think that's been the focus. Our -- from the standpoint of top line and the market dynamics, right now, you all read what's going on there. It's pretty up and down. I think on a year-to-date basis, from an overall organic standpoint, we're largely tracking various industry metrics. We're not looking for a lot of out-performance there yet, because we are so focused on driving these internal improvements and we got a lot more work to do there, particularly in Europe, and we're on it. So I don't think our view has changed at all, other than I think we're on track, we're pleased with our progress and clearly, there is no sort of momentum right now on the ground in terms of any significant recovery building, particularly in the housing market in the U.S. Andrew Buscaglia - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay, that's helpful. And then just switching to Food Equipment. Margins there were pretty impressive and are looking pretty good relative to historical levels. How sustainable do you think those are? Are there any initiatives underway? Or that you could talk about that you think you can get those -- you keep those margins at this -- at current levels or even go higher? E. Scott Santi : I think they're very sustainable and would expect that as we continue to grow that business, given historical levels of incremental profitability, that we generate an organic growth, let alone the continued impact of some BSS and sourcing initiatives there, that we'll continue to move those margins up as we go forward. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question, John Inch, Deutsche Bank. Karen K. Lau - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : It's Karen Lau dialing in for John. So could you talk about the progression on the quarter? Some companies called out Europe fading and Latin America seems to be really soft, especially in June. Did you see any of that? And I guess, more importantly, did you see any of those geographic markets improve since the end of the quarter? Michael M. Larsen: We didn't see any unusual trends as we went through the quarter. June was our best month, but it usually is. And so there was really nothing unusual. Europe, as you noted, was -- and South America, which is primarily Brazil for us, was weaker in the quarter. But weakness -- we didn't see increased weakness or strength as we went through the quarter. Like I mentioned, July for us is off to a good start and we feel good about the guidance we've given here for the third quarter and for the total year. Karen K. Lau - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay, got it. And then on price costs, you realized 10 basis points in the first half. I believe you implemented some pricing increase, maybe towards the end of 1Q. Does -- did those price increases stick? And are you still expecting 20 to 30 basis points for the year? Michael M. Larsen: Yes. So we -- as you mentioned, we did increase price in several of our segments and saw positive price in the majority of our segments. The 10 basis points is slightly below the 20 to 30 that we were expecting for the year, and we're probably going to be at the lower end of that range as we look at it today. Nothing structural. There's a little bit of FX impact here. But as I mentioned, the environment, in terms of direct material inflation, remains benign at this point, and the businesses are doing a good job taking advantage of price opportunities as we continue to add value to our customers. So that's how I'd describe it. Operator : Next question, Nigel Coe, Morgan Stanley. Jiayan Zhou - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : This is Jiayan filling in for Nigel. We just want to dig a little bit into SG&A. It has been pretty flat in the range of $680 million to $690 million for the past few quarters. So I wonder whether this is a good run rate going forward. And also, if we look at the sales under the G&A portion, how has the G&A expense been trending over the past few quarters? And what's your expectation there? Michael M. Larsen: Yes. So if you look at SG&A this quarter, it was down $70 million on a year-over-year basis. About half of that is the pension charge that I mentioned in my comments. So approximately $35 million. And we did have slightly lower restructuring costs this quarter versus the same quarter last year. But beyond that, it's really continued good cost controls and discipline in our segments. And so with those caveats I just mentioned, I would think this quarter has a pretty good run rate on a go-forward basis. As a percentage of sales, 18.2%, and so we don't expect it to differ much from those levels. And actually, as we continue to implement our BSS efforts across the company, we should expect to see overheads come down. Like I said, as we exit smaller product lines and discontinuations with customers that -- and take out the overhead associated with that, you should expect to see overheads and SG&A to improve. Jiayan Zhou - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Great, that's really helpful. And another question for the 120 bps contribution from enterprise initiatives. Can you maybe just give us some color, what percentage of this is driven by the PLS and what percentage is driven by the other initiatives? Michael M. Larsen: Yes. So we -- historically, we've not broken out the impact from the enterprise initiatives in much greater detail and we're not going to go down that path. And so the 120 basis points was really strong execution by the operating teams on our BSS efforts, as well as on the sourcing side. Jiayan Zhou - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay. So the PLS benefits, you're already seeing that during this quarter, right? So the -- all the things you are doing, you are already reaping the benefit. It's not like a benefit you're expecting to see in 2015. Michael M. Larsen: Right. I mean, I think the benefit you're seeing now is the lower overhead costs and the improved mix of our product portfolio. What you don't see today is what we've talked about, which is as we focus on the larger product lines and customers, we fully expect that we will take advantage of the full organic growth potential with those customers and product lines. And so what we're doing is positioning the company for accelerated organic growth in the future. And that's -- so obviously, you have not -- in the short term, you're seeing the reduction in the revenues but you're not seeing the long -- medium- to long-term impact yet. Operator : Our next question, Jim Krapfel, MorningStar. James Krapfel - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : So you had a couple of quarters now of 120-basis-point margin benefit from your strategic initiatives. Just wondering what's the run rate of improvement you expect going forward here in the next couple of quarters. And at what point would you expect maybe some strategic sourcing benefits to max out? Would that be in kind -- end of 2015 or '16 period? Michael M. Larsen: So to answer your question, I mean, we are expecting approximately 100 basis points of margin expansion from the initiatives in the third quarter, and again in the fourth quarter. And that's on a year-over-year basis. And that's what I just described as very consistent with the guidance that we've previously provided. And we have -- as we develop the plans for '15 and '16, we don't see any reduction in the sourcing savings. So we really continue those -- expect to see those continue as we go through at least through 2017, which is the fifth year of our enterprise strategy. So we're not seeing a decline in sourcing savings. If anything, we're probably seeing a little more of an improvement this year versus last year in year 2 of our strategic sourcing efforts. Operator : Our next question, Walter Liptak, Global Hunter. Walter S. Liptak - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division : Let me ask about the Welding business, especially North America. The 4% organics looked a little bit better than we were expecting. Can you talk about how the quarter trended? And how things are doing in July? E. Scott Santi : I don't know that we saw any major inflections month by month that was -- the improvement was in the capital equipment area, which, again, we thought was positive development, and also on guns. So it does speak to a little bit more investment by our Welding customers. But as I said earlier, it's basically a 1-quarter trend. So hopefully it will continue. We'll wait and see. Michael M. Larsen: The only thing I'd add is we are -- if you look at the comps on a year-over-year basis, the comps do get easier here in the second half of the year. So on a year-over-year basis, we should be seeing improved growth rates out of the Welding business. John L. Brooklier: Walter, I also add that we've talked about Welding before, and we specifically talked international, that the comps on the international side relative to this portfolio transition in China, we should start to see better comps than that as we move into third quarter and beyond. So I think that'll be helpful to the overall segment performance. Walter S. Liptak - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay, great. That sounds good. And if I can switch over to electronics assembly and the decline there. There are some new mobile devices coming out in the second half and -- despite the decline there, I wonder what the outlook is for your second half. Michael M. Larsen: Yes. So Walter, this is Michael. I mean, we're not expecting significant improvement for the electronics business here for the balance of the year. You are right that there are some encouraging potential order activity going on in that segment, and that would be slight upside to our current expectations for the second half. But again, we're not counting on it at this point. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Next question, Ajay Kejriwal, FBR Capital Markets. Ajay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division : So on PLS, Scott, we've seen actions in a couple of segments here, Polymers & Fluids, Welding, Construction. I guess, the question, is there more opportunity in PLS either within these segments or maybe on the segments where we haven't seen that initiative being played out? So just if you can talk a little bit about what to expect on PLS in the next, say, 12 to 18 months. E. Scott Santi : Yes. I would -- I think the -- we've talked, I think, throughout our description of what this business structure simplification initiative means, is that there's a structural element to it in terms of generating better scale and leverage and focus in terms of the division structure. And the second part of that is then the opportunity to reapply 80/20 to all of those businesses. And so I think what I would say is we've moved -- it's largely a function of who's ready to get to that second stage more so than there's a particular -- there's a differential impact as you go segment by segment. So in the Polymers & Fluids business was -- got to that place earlier than some of the other segments. We're now at a place where pretty much across all 7 segments, it's an active part of, let's call it, Stage 2 of the BSS process. So I think it has just become -- it sort of moved again from a couple of segments to pretty much being implemented across all 7. It's a normal part of the process. Polymers & Fluids is going to get to the end of it sooner than the other segments because they started it first. But I think overall, that opportunity to reapply 80/20 is a real significant and meaningful part of the overall impact on BSS. And it's an impact of that. It's just starting to show up in terms of overall margin and profitability performance. Ajay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division : So I guess, expect more PLS in the other segments where we haven't seen that started yet. E. Scott Santi : Well, it's been started. I think it's, what would you say, pretty much from -- at a minimum the beginning of this year, everybody, I think, across the company's been in a pretty heavy teeing [ph] around, starting to really focus. Getting the structural stuff out of the way and really starting to focus on reapplying 80/20 across the company. As we've said earlier, we've got another couple of quarters where, clearly, it's going to be an active part of what we're up to. And I think we need to get through the planning process and see how much -- what the '15 agenda looks like, business by business, in that regard. Ajay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division : Got it. And then China, we're seeing really good growth in Auto. And then overall, that 8% number, is that reflecting the impact in Welding? Or is there anything else going on in that 8% number? Michael M. Larsen: Yes. That's the largest declines in revenue in China is indeed the Welding segment, as we've talked about, as we exited the shipbuilding market and really have focused on the energy side. And we believe that's where the -- not just the better margins reside, but also the better growth potential. So in the quarter, in China, strong performance in Automotive and Polymers & Fluids and Food Equipment. And then decline's primarily focused just in the Welding segment. Operator : And gentlemen, I am showing no further questions at this time. John L. Brooklier: Okay. Well, we appreciate everybody's participation in the call, and we look forward to talking to you later. Thank you. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference.

Now, I\u2019d like to turn the meeting over to Mr. John Brooklier, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. John Brooklier : Thanks, Diane. Good morning, everyone and welcome to ITW\u2019s Third Quarter 2014 Conference Call. Joining me this morning is our CEO Scott Santi and our CFO, Michael Larsen. We would also like to welcome our Erin Hoffman our new VP of Investor Relations. As you know, Erin joined us in early September and we are working on a smooth transition of the Investor Relations role till I retire in March of 2015. Erin good to have you onboard. During today\u2019s call, we will discuss our outstanding Q3 financial results and update you on our earnings forecast. As usual, we will open the call to your questions. We ask for your cooperation on our one question, one follow up question policy as we have scheduled one hour for today\u2019s call. Before we get to the quarterly data, let me remind you that this presentation contains our financial forecast for the 2014 fourth quarter and full year as well as other forward-looking questions identified on this slide. For a preview of the company\u2019s 2014 Form 10-Q for the second quarter for more details about the important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectation. Also this presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures and a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release. Take care of that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Scott Santi, who will comment on the quarter. Scott? Scott Santi : Thanks, John and good morning everyone. Overall, we were pleased with the performance in the quarter and with the progress that we are continuing to make in executing our strategy. Operating margins in the quarter were a record 20.9% and were 190 basis points higher than in Q3 of last year, with a 120 basis points of that improvement coming directly from enterprise strategy initiatives. After-tax return on invested capital was 20.1%, marking the first time we\u2019ve gotten both of these key metrics above our stated goals of 20% plus in the quarter since the launch of our enterprise strategy in 2012. Operating income of 772 million was the highest quarterly total on the company\u2019s history and free cash flow was very strong at 128% of that income. EPS of $1.28 was up 42% versus the prior year. We were also pleased with our organic growth performance in the quarter as we had four of our seven business segments deliver organic growth of 5% or better. While we are still three or four quarters away from being able to turn the majority of our attention to the growth agenda component of our strategy, it\u2019s encouraging to see some early signs of progress on the organic growth front in a number of our businesses. Product line and customer simplification activities remain an active element of our portfolio management initiative currently, and had a negative impact on the company\u2019s overall organic growth rate of approximately 1 percentage point in the quarter. I expect that these activities will have a similar 1% negative impact on our organic growth rates were up most, if not all, by 2015. However, keep in mind the product line in customer simplification our core components of ITW\u2019s 80-20 business management system and we are in the process of reapplying it to our scale of operating divisions. These activities are a key driver of our ability to continue to improve margins and returns and to accelerate organic growth going forward. Overall, we are pleased with our progress as we approach the end of year two of our five year enterprise strategy. At our upcoming Investor Day in December, we will provide investors with an updated view of our performance targets for 2017, as well as lay out a preliminary line of what we think 2018 and beyond might look like in terms of both strategy and performance. I\u2019d like to close by thanking all of our people around the world for the great job that they continue to do in serving our customers and in executing our strategy. Now I\u2019d like to turn over to Michael. Michael? Michael Larsen : Thank you, Scott and good morning everyone. Okay let\u2019s get started with the financial summary on page two. Third quarter was another quarter with solid execution and high quality of earnings with organic growth of 3.5%, record operating income and record operating margins of 20.9%. EPS of a $1.28 was an increase of 42% versus prior year. Revenues were 3.7 billion, up 3.5% with growth in all major geographies. Four segments automotive, food equipment, test and measurement and electronics and welding stood out with organic growth of 5% or better. As Scott mentioned, consistent with the first half of the year, product line simplification was a 1% drag on our overall organic growth rate. Five of our seven segments expanded margins by more than 200 basis points, with a 120 basis points from enterprise initiatives, which included increased contribution from our strategic sourcing efforts. Incremental margins were 76% and cash generation was solid with free operating cash flow 128%. We spent 500 million on share repurchases and you might recall that we raised a dividend of 15% in the third quarter. Good progress in after-tax return on invested capital with an improvement of 250 basis points. So overall, we were pleased with the strong results in the quarter and the continued positive momentum on our enterprise initiatives. On page three, a few highlights on organic growth for the quarter with North America up 4% as a result of continued strength in automotive up 8%, food equipment up 6%. Also in North America, welding was up 10% and test and measurement and electronics grew 6%, certainly some encouraging progress on organic growth. International growth was also positive up 3% in the quarter with Europe up 3%. Four of our segments were positive in Europe, with automotive up 9% and food equipment up 6%. Asia-Pacific increased 5% driven by Australia up 5% and China up 3%. Automotive OEM and food equipment in China were both up double digits construction in Australia test and measurement and electronics in Asia-Pacific were up high single digits. So in summary, solid organic growth across all major geographies and some encouraging signs in our CapEx driven segments welding and test and measurement, as we continue to apply our 80-20 business system and position our businesses for future organic growth. Moving on to slide four, operating margins were once again a highlight as solid execution on the enterprise initiatives which included greater contributions from the strategic sourcing effort, led to record operating margins of 20.9%, an increase of 190 basis points from last year. As Scott mentioned, the third quarter was the highest ever in terms of operating income at 772 million, which speaks to the quality of the revenues generated by this portfolio of highly differentiated businesses after completing the portfolio management component of our enterprise strategy. This former record was 770 million in the second quarter of 2012, the quarter that had revenues almost 1 billion higher than this quarter. We were pleased to see that all seven segments improved operating margins with five of the seven segments expanding margins by more than 200 basis points, and polymers and fluids exceeding 20% for the first time. At the right side of the page we\u2019ve listed the drivers of the margin expansion, with the largest contribution being 120 basis points from enterprise initiatives. We continue to invest in future margin expansion and spent $28 million on restructuring related to our business structure simplification efforts. So clearly more to come in terms of BSS savings, as we spend approximately $100 million this year. Operating leverage was 80 basis points and price cost was favorable for a total of 190 basis points of margin expansion. So really great progress and lots of positive momentum on the enterprise initiatives. We\u2019ve continued spend on restructuring and higher contributions from sourcing which gives us increased confidence in our ability to expand margins in 2015 and beyond. With that, I\u2019ll be back in a few minutes to go over our updated guidance, but first let me turn it over to John for some additional commentary on the segment. John Brooklier : Thank you Michael. Moving to slide five, you\u2019ll see the breakdown of total revenue and operating income per segment. Six out of our seven segments produced top-line growth in the quarter, while all seven segments demonstrated operating margin expansion. Our auto OEM, food equipment, test and measurement electronics and welding segments led the company\u2019s top line growth and five out of seven segments produced operating margin over 20%. This was an outstanding quarter for the company as our enterprise initiatives contributed to improve our operating margin performance in all of our segments which I will detail now. As I cover our segments, I\u2019ll remind all of you that our organic revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and acquisition activity. Moving to auto OEM, the segment produced another long line of solid quarters. Organic revenue grew 8% compared to worldwide auto builds of 2% and that was due to ITW\u2019s style customer backed innovation and ongoing product penetration. By geography, organic revenue for Europe grew 9% North America increased 8% and China was up 12%. Our European businesses outperformed European auto builds by 10 percentage points due to penetration gains across all platforms. In North America our growth equaled auto builds at 8% however, Detroit where we have significant penetration only grew by 3%. In China, we outperformed auto builds by four percentage points. Profitability remain high with operating margins 23.4% a 230 basis points improvement from last year. Moving to slide six, in our test and measurement electronic segment organic revenues increased 5% in Q3, a solid improvement sequentially over last quarter. Test and measurements organic revenues grew 8% led by strength in our worldwide Instron business with growth of 22% in Q3, and both North America, Asia produced good results. The electronics business increased organic revenues by 3% as the electronic assembly business moved into positive territory with 5% growth in Q3. The remainder of the electronics business grew 1%. For the total segment, Q3 operating margin showed notable improvement at 18.7% that\u2019s 240 basis points higher than the year ago period. The food equipment segments organic growth rate of 5% reflected another quarter of very good growth and showed progress along all major product categories and geographies. In North America, equipment and service related organic related service revenues grew 6% and 4% respectively, thanks to growth in refrigeration and cooking businesses and new product innovation. Internationally equipment revenues increased 8% due to strong warewash and refrigeration sales, while service organic revenues increased 1%. The segment\u2019s operating margin at 23.1% was a robust 320 basis points higher than the prior year period. So again, good progress on the food equipment side. Moving to slide seven, in our polymers and fluids segment organic revenues declined 2% and that\u2019s largely driven by our ongoing product line simplification activity. As we\u2019ve noted in prior quarters, we continue to weed out less profitable products and customers in this segment, which as you know, negatively affect organic revenue but substantially improves profitability. Polymers and fluids and hygiene businesses organic revenues each declined 1%, while automotive aftermarket declined 4%. As the product line simplification activity diminishes, we expect the effects of PLS to have less of an impact on organic revenue in 2015 and beyond. The much better new shorter term is that the segment achieved Q3 operating margin of 20.2%, a 210 basis point improvement over the year ago period. Looking at the welding segment, the worldwide organic revenues grew 5% due to strength in North American equipment sales. North American organic revenues increased 10%, it\u2019s a very good number for them, in the quarter and that was driven by robust growth in both industrial and commercial markets and growth in the oil and gas business. International organic revenue declined 7% due to impact of delayed onshore pipeline projects in China and the Middle East, and also some of the PLS projects in Germany negatively impacted the organic revenue growth in the quarter. All said, the welding segment continues to lead the way with company high operating margins of 26.2% and that\u2019s 80 basis points higher than the year ago period. So a nice quarter from the welding segment. Moving to slide eight the construction product segment produced modest organic revenue growth of 2% in the quarter. Asia-Pacific led the way with 6% organic growth and that was largely driven by growth across all construction sectors in the Australian and New Zealand geographies. In North America, organic revenue was up 2% with a residential and renovation categories up, but commercial construction down. In Europe, organic revenue was down 1% and that was largely due to product simplification and declines of France, offset by strength in the United Kingdom. As noted in the prior quarter the segment\u2019s profitability continues to be our major focus and operating margins of 18.9% were 270 basis points higher than the year ago period. In specialty product segments, organic revenues were flat as modest growth across our consumer packaging business was offset by delays and customer projects and warehouse automation business. In total, our consumer packaging business and appliance was flat while ground support was up 2%. This segment represents a collection of high margin businesses in the total segment operating margins of 21.3%, the 20 basis point higher than the year ago period. So substantially good progress from a lot of our segments. Now let me turn the call over to Michael who will cover our fourth quarter and 2014 full year guidance. Michael? Michael Larsen : Okay, thanks, John. So on page nine let\u2019s start with our guidance for the quarter where we expect 2% to 3% organic revenue growth and 100 basis points of margin expansion from enterprise initiatives. Currency is a 3% headwind on revenues, so total revenues are expected to be about flat. Foreign exchange is a manageable $0.04 headwind to EPS and EPS is expected to be in the $1.07 to $1.15 range midpoint of $1.11, an increase of 21% over last year. For the full year, we are raising our EPS guidance third time this year to $4.57 to $4.65 which compares to $4.50 to $4.62 previously. At the new midpoint of $4.61, EPS is expected to be up 27% over 2013. Our organic revenue growth assumptions for the year remains unchanged at 2% to 3% and we now expect higher operating margins of approximately 20%, roughly 200 basis points of improvement. So in summary, we are pleased with our progress on our enterprise strategy and strong financial results for the quarter and for the year. In a macro environment similar to the one that we\u2019re in today, we have great confidence in our ability to further expand operating margins and deliver differentiated earnings growth in 2015 and beyond as the team continues to execute well in our five year strategy and position ITW for a solid organic growth, with best in class modules in returns. We look forward to sharing more detail with you at our upcoming Investor Day on December 5th. John Brooklier : Thanks, Michael. So now I\u2019ll open the call for your questions so please be brief to allow more people the opportunity to ask a question. Remember one question and one follow up question. We\u2019ll now open the call. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Rob Wertheimer, your line is now open. Robert Wertheimer \u2013 Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Hi. Good morning. So, great results in welding. I was curious if there was what the discrepancy if there is one between welding and construction particularly North America is? Does the strength in welding tend to turn around the construction or you\u2019re turning product lines somewhere there or it\u2019s just not as much overlapping them in the customers I would have guessed? Michael Larsen : I might probably not as much overlap most of the strength in welding was in what I described is more general industrial and oil and gas really end markets, less so in commercial construction. Robert Wertheimer \u2013 Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Perfect. And then just one more in welding may be you don\u2019t want to get in too much detail in the international side, but are you able to say if the pipeline delays are sort of geopolitically related or whether there is any other more economic reason to the delay? Michael Larsen : I\u2019d say it\u2019s hard to say at this point. I think we\u2019re looking at some things that just got pushed back a little bit relative to our earlier expectations on timing. I think we\u2019ll have to wait and see. Robert Wertheimer \u2013 Vertical Research Partners, LLC: So far you don\u2019t think it\u2019s cancelled or gone, it\u2019s just pushed out? Michael Larsen : Yes. Robert Wertheimer \u2013 Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Okay. Great. I think that was my two I guess. Thank you. Michael Larsen : Thanks Rob. Operator : Ann Duignan, your line is now open. Ann Duignan \u2013 JP Morgan : Hi, good morning. Scott Santi : Good morning, Ann. Ann Duignan \u2013 JP Morgan : Can you talk a little bit about what you are weeding out on the businesses that you are weeding out, the lagging businesses. Can you just talk about \u2013 give a little bit more color on which business you are actually divesting up or discontinuing? Scott Santi : Well if you\u2019re referring to the product line simplification work the way I would describe it as sort of the next level down of our portfolio strategy and really what we\u2019re doing there is weeding out relatively small volume product lines that add complexity, but don\u2019t really drive a lot of impact and/or product lines where we don\u2019t have the sort of level of differentiation that we\u2019re ultimately looking to build the company around. So lower profit, certainly lower volume product lines. And that\u2019s going on all over the business. So even automotive that\u2019s got the best growth rate it\u2019s got pretty healthy product line simplification agenda underway. Ann Duignan \u2013 JP Morgan : Okay. So it\u2019s more just 80-20 across the entire business, it\u2019s not related to one specific end market? Scott Santi : Correct. Well said. Ann Duignan \u2013 JP Morgan : That\u2019s helpful to understand. And then my follow up is on food equipment, can you just give us a little bit more color on what\u2019s going on those businesses? And there were some pretty end results just curious to get a bit more color how much is market? How much is market penetration, innovation? If you can just give us a little bit more quantitative analysis around what\u2019s going on there that would be great. Thanks. Scott Santi : Yeah I think what I would say of I think we\u2019re very happy with the equipment sales increases in the quarter. The one in Europe certainly stands out from my standpoint where we\u2019re plus 8% internationally overall, part of that is certainly some progress we\u2019re making around in acquisition because last year on China, but also the core European business was actually relatively healthy given a lot of the gloom and doom in terms of the overall economic situation there. I would say overall, we\u2019re not seeing a ton of market lifts, probably things in North America will get better but largely these numbers are driven by new product activity. Ann Duignan \u2013 JP Morgan : Any products in particular or any categories in particular, particularly in Europe I\u2019m just curious Scott Santi : Yeah warewash which is our commercial dishwashing business and also refrigeration in Europe. Ann Duignan \u2013 JP Morgan : Okay. And you believe those are more market penetration not end market? Scott Santi : Yes. Ann Duignan \u2013 JP Morgan : Okay. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you. Take care. Operator : Andrew Kaplowitz. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, guys good morning. It\u2019s Alan Fleming for Andrew this morning. Michael Larsen : Alan, how are you? Unidentified Analyst : I\u2019m doing well. Just on Europe, you saw some acceleration to plus 3% from I think, plus 1 last quarter. And I know some of this seems to be somewhat specific to ITW with strength in food equipment and auto, but just curious if you guys view is it possible that Europe may be a little more stable than some feared and things have not slowed down as much as it seems may be if you just give a little bit more color on that market. Scott Santi : Yeah sure. Again, we can comment on what we\u2019re seeing in our businesses and we had obviously a good quarter in Europe and a good September when we haven\u2019t seen signs of slowdown in Europe. I mean we were encouraged to see automotive up 9% really continue to build on strong penetration gains in that business. Test and measurement and electronics had a good year all around and were up in Europe. We just talked about food equipment up 6% and then welding, polymers and fluids and construction you\u2019re probably seeing a little bit more product line certification in those businesses but overall Europe for us 3% we\u2019re pleased and we have not seen a slowdown in Europe. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, helpful. And then just on construction North America I know you\u2019re continuing to see some declines on the non-res side is there any kind of reason for hope that you guys are seeing any positive signs in that market? Scott Santi : The way we characterize our construction business North America it\u2019s been bouncing around quarter to quarter it\u2019s up a little down a little and I think we\u2019re still waiting for some traction overall. There is a fair amount of good progress we\u2019re making inside the business on the margin front, but from an overall demand standpoint I think we\u2019re still not seeing any consistent trends whether it\u2019s commercial construction activity. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. All right. Thank you guys. Operator : Jamie Cook. Your line is now open. Jamie Cook \u2013 Credit Suisse : Hi, good morning. I guess just two questions one broader and then one on test and measurement. I guess I\u2019m surprised I mean know you\u2019re having the market healthy something internal issues help your top line, but I\u2019m surprised when I think about the organic growth of 3.5% just given a number of free announcements that we\u2019ve seen across industrials and just broader concerns on the macro. Did any of your businesses see deterioration as we exited the quarter or as we look into October? And to the headlines you\u2019ve read from other companies concern you more as you think about 2015? And then my second question on the positive test and measurement had a very good quarter. Your Instron business was up 22% I\u2019m just wondering if you can give a color there I think last quarter you talked about some confidence may be you could see a pickup in CapEx your thoughts there. Thanks. Scott Santi : Yes. So, on your first question Jamie we didn\u2019t see any of our businesses slow down as we went through the quarter. We are \u2013 if you look at the comps on a year over year basis had that made drive some of would be referring to but generally there was solid strength as we went through the quarter there. Although it\u2019s little early to comment but we haven\u2019t seen anything unusual that\u2019s inconsistent with what we were expecting and what\u2019s including in our guidance today. Now that said, I mean we are obviously we are aware of the headlines and what other companies are reporting so we continue to monitor what\u2019s going inside our businesses and the order rates that we\u2019re seeing. In terms of tests and measurements, they had a good year really if you go back to first quarter second quarter backlog activity particularly in the Instron business has been excellent. And we\u2019re encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing now keep in mind that, that business was up 8% organically in the fourth quarter last year so the comps are going to be a little bit more challenging here in the fourth quarter. But in terms of seeing a sustained pick up in CapEx cycle, probably a little too soon to call that but we say that we\u2019re encouraged but what we saw in the second quarter in test and measurement then obviously we\u2019re not seeing anything that would suggest that there is a slowdown in those businesses. Jamie Cook \u2013 Credit Suisse : Thank you. I\u2019ll get back in queue. Operator : Walter Liptak. Your line is now open. Walter Liptak \u2013 Global Hunter Securities : Hi, thanks. Wanted to go back to the welding segment and I understand your answer that general industry is where you\u2019ve seen the pickup and North America. But I wonder if we saw a slowdown in welding this year and now it seems to be picking up I\u2019m wondering if you can attribute that to anything pent up demand , or any different sectors within welding. John Brooklier : Well I\u2019ll just go back to what I said earlier which is oil and gas North America in the quarter was strong and also the general industrial part of our business and also the commercial part was certainly much stronger year on year than we\u2019ve seen past prior quarters. But I\u2019ll also reference to what Michael just talked about the pickups are largely for us and the equipment area and from the CapEx standpoint I think it\u2019s been a couple of quarters now improving demand rates in the CapEx area but I don\u2019t think that we\u2019re ready to call any big inflexion point we\u2019d like to see it sustain itself around the couple of quarters. Walter Liptak \u2013 Global Hunter Securities : Does it seem like a pickup in the welding distribution channel or is it direct to\u2026 John Brooklier : The commercial business is what we talk about general industrial and commercial we\u2019re talking about sort of about more fragmented part of the market most of that has access through distribution channel. I assume that the pickup in the channel the sales through the channel are function of increased demand from their end customers. Walter Liptak \u2013 Global Hunter Securities : Yeah, of course. Thank you. Operator : Ajay. You line is open. Ajay Kejriwal \u2013 FBR Capital Markets : Thank you and good morning. Scott, congratulations good to see the organic growth rates come through here. So may be talk a little bit about some of work that\u2019s being done, I imagined a lot of it is blocking and packing business by business but then to the extent there are initiatives at the corporate level, be it in terms of what you\u2019re doing with incentive structures and may be other initiatives. So just give us a sense of what to expect and the work that you\u2019re doing to drive organic growth? Scott Santi : Yeah sure. So we are as I said in my comments we are still another three or four quarters away from being able to bring the majority of our focus to the organic growth component of this strategy. We\u2019ve talked I think to significant degree about the past in the end what makes all of this work is the ability to move our organic growth rate up and on an historical basis we\u2019re talking percentage point or so improvement relative to the history. So we\u2019re not talking about it a huge step up but a meaningful one. Right now what we\u2019re doing is trying to manage these internal initiatives related to our structure related to sourcing in a thoughtful way to face the implementations of those in such a way that our business is continued to be able to deliver for their customers and deliver for our investors. We probably got another three to four quarters of pretty significant activity in that regard. So from an organic growth standpoint I think largely what we\u2019ve accomplished to date is I think we\u2019ve got the management team fully aligned around the fact that in this reshaped portfolio we have highly differentiated business that all have significant potential to drive organic growth through innovation and penetration I think that part is very clear across our management team. heading into \u201815 we will be doing some work on incentives to get that sort of further flushed out so in \u201815 and beyond we will continue we\u2019ve already made some adjustments we\u2019ll continue to make some more. But I think this is largely an issue for us of focus and execution with a much higher quality of portfolio that will ultimately add more potential to grow organically. Ajay Kejriwal \u2013 FBR Capital Markets : Good. And then enterprise initiatives obviously very, very impressive margin gains here. And without taking any of that thunder away from the December meeting, may be just talk about which innings you are in terms of savings from BSS and then sourcing? Scott Santi : Well I think the way that I would answer that Ajay is that we\u2019re in the end of year two of five year plan that we\u2019ve set along that we\u2019re expecting fairly comparable improvements year by year as we go through the plan. I think a couple of years in we have some better sort of thoughts and visibility on where we think we\u2019re going to end up on \u201817 and build the December meeting around sharing some views on that with our investors. Ajay Kejriwal \u2013 FBR Capital Markets : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Andy Casey. Your line is open. Andy Casey \u2013 Wells Fargo : Thanks. Good morning everybody. Good morning, Andy. Andy Casey \u2013 Wells Fargo : If we could go back to the enterprise initiative for that last question you\u2019ve increased your 2014 operating margin guidance by about 100 basis points through the year now 20 versus your initial 19 and you\u2019re kind of at the bottom range the longer term 2017 goals. If you\u2019re focusing on returns of the next three to four quarters before you really transition to the organic growth, are we talking about more than 200 basis points left in your view? Michael Larsen : Yeah so I guess. Andy this is Michael. So we\u2019re not ready to go down that path for a number of reasons. One, we\u2019d like to give you the full picture when we get to our Analyst Day on December 5th that you\u2019re of course invited to. The other thing I tell you is this is annual plan season for us right now so all the businesses are working through their plans for next year being able to share a much better view of what this might look like in terms of the landing spot for margins and returns at the end of the five year enterprise strategy as well as provide some detail on 2015. But what I would echo with Scott just said that we expect all our businesses to continue to improve and get a little bit better on every year on operating margins and you should expect us to describe that in more detail when we get to the analyst day on December 5th. Andy Casey \u2013 Wells Fargo : Okay. Thanks. At least the question was good for some laughter in the background. Scott Santi : Thank you for that. Andy Casey \u2013 Wells Fargo : You\u2019re welcome. Regarding to the Q4 organic growth guidance for growth moderation just to clarify that Michael, is that mainly driven by comparisons and not trend deterioration? Michael Larsen : Yes that\u2019s correct. And if you look at the growth rates last year, we were up 3% organically in the fourth quarter we were up 1% up organically in the third quarter. We talked about test and measurement in particular having a more challenging comp and then may be a little bit of a decline auto builds as well. So that\u2019s all factored into our guidance. And like I said we haven\u2019t seen any deterioration in terms of our segments. Andy Casey \u2013 Wells Fargo : Thank you very much. Operator : John Inch. Your line is now open. John Inch \u2013 Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : Thanks. Good morning everyone. So, [inaudible] what was the POS drag in that segment. I forget what you said if you\u2019d actually called that out on the top line. Michael Larsen : About 2 percentage points in that business, so a little bit more than some of the other segments. John Inch \u2013 Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : And Michael you or Scott said that you expected the associated drag to lessen in that 2015. When you think overall, you think POS is going to drag the company is organic, the kind of 1% cadence through 2015 or do you expect the other segments to realize the lessening as well? Michael Larsen : I think a conservative expectation would be a 1% drag all of next year and then largely we will get it behind us. We may get out of it, a quarter or two ahead of that but I think that would be the planning assumption for now. John Inch \u2013 Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : I assume there is a sort of a degree Scott of kind of flex in that as far as naturally it lessens but then you kind of want to keep it at the 1% to sort of accomplish the initiatives, is that the way to think about it? In other words, it might naturally lessen but then you might redouble efforts to bring it back to 1%? Scott Santi : No, I think most of its really I would describe as in terms of impact at this magnitude I would describe it as a onetime event. This is really about reshaping the portfolio. So we did it at the macro level in terms of the divestitures and refocusing the company. What\u2019s going on now is really about driving that same principle down to operating businesses. So it\u2019s existing product lines that don\u2019t carry the level of differentiation that we think are appropriate for a strategy or exiting volume product lines in the scale of divisions. So this is much more of a onetime even over a six or eight quarter period of thoughtful, repositioning and refocusing of our portfolio. We need to go through it. John Inch \u2013 Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : Now that makes sense. Just also the kind of [inaudible] is, in theory you would say POS adds beyond 15 and we get a one point boost, but shouldn\u2019t you in theory get more than one point because less distractions spread over, less robust product lines with the terminology. Scott Santi : I won\u2019t necessarily applied on a percentage basis, but major component of PLS is to get us focused on the stuff that we really have conviction about, being able to grow at the kind of earnings and returns profile we think are appropriate for the company long term. So there is an element of this that\u2019s certainly margin and return related but it\u2019s equally important from the standpoint of the organic growth accelerations we go forward in getting us focused on the major product lines where we have major positions and industries that really think are the right ones for the company. John Inch \u2013 Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : And then Scott, one of the phenomena have been in the quarter just the significant down shipped in the price of barrel of oil. Presumably you\u2019ve looked at this possibly touched a little bit. If oil stays around the $80 $85 mark what do you think the impact ITW really if anything? Scott Santi : I actually can\u2019t answer that. We haven\u2019t spent a lot of time studying that one at this point. If it stays down there for another quarter we will certainly have a more up to date view, a thoughtful view, but right now I think it\u2019s something that\u2019s moving around but not really driving much change in our business underground right now. John Inch \u2013 Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : So if there is a more significant direct impact I presume you would have been studying it by now, without the characterization? Scott Santi : Yes. Operator : [inaudible] Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Good morning everyone and welcome Erin. My first question is, thinking about the enterprise initiatives and the 100 basis points in benefits that you\u2019re expecting to see in the out years. I mean is it fair to say that you\u2019re going to see disproportionate amount from the segments today that are below the 20% threshold because as we exit \u201814, you\u2019re probably going to see at least four of your segments above the 20% range. Just curious how you\u2019re thinking about it. Scott Santi : Like I said, we expect all of our businesses to continue to improve every year and just add to that, that some businesses are little further along than may be others. So if you look at the welding business which was in the enterprise initiatives may be a little bit more for the long run and the enterprise strategy and the ability to now focus on organic growth versus some of the initiatives. But overall, I think we\u2019ve said before that we expect all of our businesses to reach 20% plus over time and like I said, we expect all of our business to continue to improve every quarter, every year. Unidentified Analyst : And I guess may be one follow on is really you guys are nice to have a breaking out where you\u2019re spending your restructuring spending. It looks in the most recent quarters in an auto or food equipment. There has been recently some concerns that the auto market are going to decelerate as we head into next year and clearly that\u2019s been a driver for you guys. So just any commentary around where you\u2019re spending on restructuring and any view on the auto markets would be helpful? Scott Santi : The restructuring basically follows our BSS initiatives which you know particular event based on end market conditions and in terms of we\u2019ve deploying that spending over the last couple of years. From an auto perspective I think we are certainly in a position to absorb some modest slowdown in the end market. We have in terms of the penetration games that we have been delivering for the last 8 to 12 quarters now, one target for business where we have three years of essentially visibility in terms of new programs that we\u2019ve got. We\u2019ve got a pretty good pipeline of new content coming in and certainly tailwind is better than headwind. But can be still operated and generate some organic growth even if the market slows down or flattens out on our site, I think we are in a really good position to do that. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Thanks guys. Operator : Eli Lustgarten. Your line is now open. Eli Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow Research : Good morning, everyone. Scott Santi : Hey, Eli. Eli Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow Research : Can we just follow up your last comment and talk about the automotive. You said three years visibility I mean the gains in your from penetration was absolutely spectacular. Can you give us an idea of what kind of thing that we can expect over the next four to six quarters because you said you had to see for 12. Would it stay at the same rate or can you give us some magnitude, some way of calibrating penetration games that we\u2019ll see for the next Michael Larsen : I think we\u2019ve been running at four to five percentage points over market growth kind of rate and I think good expectation would be for us to be able to continue that. Eli Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow Research : So sustainable at least well till \u201815? Michael Larsen : We believe so. Eli Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow Research : And second point sourcing and better buying a big part and this year everybody\u2019s been blessed with flow of material prices going on. Is there any way if you can give us some idea of the benefit of the actual drop in commodity prices have especially company versus the initiatives we\u2019ll get some idea how we\u2019re leveraging that at all? Michael Larsen : The way we reported externally is we\u2019ll give you the price cost metric and that has been favorable all year, every quarter by 10 basis points, twice ahead of cost. So that continues\u2026I think at this point we still describe the material environment fairly benign. There is a couple of outliers for the overall. I think all businesses are doing a good job offsetting material price inflation with price. On the sourcing side, is the bigger contribution to the over 120 basis points of margin expansion. While we don\u2019t break it out between sourcing, what I\u2019ll tell you is that we were very encouraged by the progress that we\u2019re seeing on the strategic sourcing side and you see in our variable margins or gross margins with 100 basis points improvement that we believe is sustainable. So I think we\u2019d answer your question. Eli Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow Research : And the bulk of it is coming from the sourcing side at this point, would you guess? Michael Larsen : So we don\u2019t break out the 120, so we don\u2019t break it out, but like I said we are very encouraged by the positive momentum on the sourcing side and we expect that to continue. Eli Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow Research : Thank you very much Operator : Joel Tiss. Your line is open. Joel Tiss \u2013 BMO Capital Markets : I didn\u2019t I was going to make it. Thanks. How\u2019s it going? As you guys move through this the 80-20 and the simplification and other things that you are working on, can you just give us a sense of how, I know you are not looking at the acquisition yet, can you talk a little bit about how you are seeing opportunities in that front to fill in different product lines and may be how the philosophy in the future around acquisition would end up changing instead of buying [inaudible] Scott Santi : I think we would plan to spend some time on that in December if we can defer that answer that question of Joel in December. I think as Michael said before we\u2019d like to be able to talk about that with all of you on our investors in a way that\u2019s more comprehensive than a quick answer. Joel Tiss \u2013 BMO Capital Markets : So it\u2019s not too early like that was the other part of the question, it\u2019s not too early for you guys to start thinking of acquisition? There is a lot of stuff on your plate obviously but. Scott Santi : Well I think it\u2019s a matter of where do acquisitions fit in our strategy I think that\u2019s ultimately what we want to talk about and certainly it\u2019s not a matter of where we\u2019re \u2013 from a financial standpoint or it\u2019s not a matter of capability, we know how to acquire companies and ultimately where they fit in our strategy, on a go forward basis is a very different place than where they fit historically in ITW. Joel Tiss \u2013 BMO Capital Markets : And then lastly if there\u2019s no to look at the $500 million of share repurchase in the fourth quarter as a sign that things are slowing down a little bit or if there is any concern in the operations? Michael Larsen : No, I don\u2019t you think how you would draw that conclusion, I mean we said that we were going to be opportunistic in terms of share repurchases in the second half of the year. We started out the third quarter with 500 million and in the fourth quarter we expect to spend at least another 500 million on the share repurchases. So there is no change in terms of our view of how attractive the share repurchases are and therefore we are continuing obviously. Joel Tiss \u2013 BMO Capital Markets : Thanks very much. Operator : Stanley Elliot. Your line is still open. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you guys for putting me in Hate to go back to the welding business because there are so many things to talk about in the quarter but as it relates to the oil piece, could you quantify how big the oil end market is for welding in general? Scott Santi : 20% of our North American business. Unidentified Analyst : It\u2019s fair to say when you talk about the general environment a lot of the growth you are seeing was more industrial production kind of a general fab which is a significantly larger part of the market if I am not mistaken. Is that correct? Scott Santi : Yes. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Steve Fisher. Your line is still open. Steven Fisher \u2013 UBS: Thanks. Good morning, I may have missed this earlier but can you discuss the direction of various components of your business in China how they are moving in different directions or where they\u2019re all up. Basically, we saw the automotive business leaped away up 12%, food equipment also up double digits so we said a lot about the acquisition that we did and how good a job the team has done in terms of integrating that acquisition. So now we are benefiting organic growth rates in food equipment in China of solid double digits. Polymers and fluids had a good quarter, up 5% and then the others are fairly small. The main drag really was what\u2019s got talked about oil and gas pipeline projects been differed in China so that business was down but other than that \u2013 which was on the wielding side. Other than that we had a very good quarter again in China. Steven Fisher \u2013 UBS: Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Sean Wayne. Your line is still open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi good morning. I would want to maybe come back to the food equipment again I mean the incremental margins in that business significant acceleration there. I mean certainly you talked about new products, can you just help me understand how much of the margin expansion was kind of volume related versus new product introductions? And then should we start thinking about this business being kind of a 20% to 25% margin business kind of going forward or was there anything of one timish in that quarter that is unlikely to repeat. Michael Larsen : No, I mean there was nothing unusual in the quarter other than really solid execution and organic grows. To answer your question specifically, if you look at the 270 bases points of margin expansion in food equipment in the quarter, 150 of that came from the initiatives. So the work around at BSS and sourcing and a 120 bases point from the operating leverage on the organic growth. But really I guess Scott described it very well in terms of performance of that business and we think it\u2019s very sustainable on the go forward basis. Unidentified Analyst : All right. Thank you. Just know housekeeping the other income came in I guess quite a bit harder than what I would have expected in giving the run like the last couple of quarters. It means talking of what the variance was there? Michael Larsen : It\u2019s primarily interest income. Unidentified Analyst : Ok perfect. Thank you. Operator : Jim Krapfel. Your line is still open. Jim Krapfel \u2013 Morningstar: Hi good morning. So just on price costs I imagine while your raw material cost have come down recently. I would like to get your comments on the extent of that going forward and then also your ability to hold and increase pricing from here. Michael Larsen : I would expect us to continue to be favorable on the price cost side of things and so saw 10 bases points in this quarter and it\u2019s probably going to be in that range for the fourth quarter but you know as these businesses know are working to become more and more differentiated and in terms of adding value to the customers you obviously going to have more leverage for a pricing standpoint so but I wouldn\u2019t expect that just yet but nothings really change in terms of ability to continue to get price in all of our businesses to offset the cost. Jim Krapfel \u2013 Morningstar: Okay. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. John Inch. Your line is open. John Inch \u2013 Bank of America : Hi so in terms of follow up come more of a big picture question Scott ITW historically has never been managed on a geographic basis now that you\u2019ve been CEO clearly enterprise initiative have a lot of traction and momentum. The company has made a lot of structural changes, are you thinking perhaps any more about sort of managing the company as a bit portfolio in so far as having geographic exposures are concerned. I will give you an example so China you know you have done pretty well, but there seems to be significant sort of, there is an expectation China could slow in the coming years. So I don\u2019t know how that could represent your businesses as may be a pro or con but you know how does it affect kind of corporate in the way you are looking at the world. That\u2019s just one example, there could be lots of others. Scott Santi : I think where we are and we\u2019ve done a lot of thinking about this really the most important decision that we make for the company and our shareholders of what we business we should be in. And geography is in our view kind of second condition to sort of our thinking around what business we should be in. If you look across the portfolio that we\u2019ve assembled we\u2019ve got $2 billion plus businesses highly differentiated in terms of the things they do for their customers. $2 billion business customers. Lots of room to move. Operator : David Raso. Your line is open. David Raso \u2013 ISI Research : Good morning. Just a quick question, thinking about incremental margins next year, I know pensions been a help this year I meant that\u2019s been really more just an absence of some of the curtailments you had last year. Let me just try to think the puts and takes for next year, I know you\u2019re not going to want us to give us too much granularity, but there any items which we talked about enterprise initiatives, pension anything else that we can think about last quarters obviously incremental have been over 75%. So the baseline for next year but just trying to get a feel for the puts and takes. Michael Larsen : I think the way I\u2019d answer your question David is that look at ITW historically excluding initiatives have been in the 30% 35% range. And when we\u2019re done with the initiatives, we\u2019d expect to be at the high end of that if not for better, but we still have a lot of work going on margin expansion to come from these initiatives in \u201816 and beyond. I can\u2019t at this point \u2013 all right I don\u2019t want to give you at this point an incremental margin sums up of 2015 this will be part of when we get all together we\u2019ll be able to give you our best view at that point. David Raso \u2013 ISI Research : Outside of the initiatives, sort of a historical baseline is the way to think about it? I\u2019m sure I\u2019m making sure when I\u2019m listening, some thoughts I already have your pension or just any other company is leave to go. So without getting into these are kind of small pieces of a bigger puzzle. But since you are asking specifically pension has not been a tailwind this year in a significant way and we don\u2019t expect it to be a significant headwind in 2015. The other item that is may be worth talking about is currency, we called $0.04 of headwind here in the fourth quarter which we believe which is every manageable. There could be some headwind in currency in 2015 depending on where rates are at the time and we think that\u2019s very manageable at this point. David Raso \u2013 ISI Research : All right. I appreciate it. Thank you very much. John Brooklier : Thanks everyone for joining us on today\u2019s call and we look forward to talking to all of you again. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. And now, I\u2019d turn today\u2019s meeting over to Aaron Hoffman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you sir, you may begin. Aaron Hoffman : Thank you. Good morning and welcome to ITW\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2014 Conference Call. Joining me this morning on our call our CEO, Scott Santi and Michael Larsen our CFO.  During today\u2019s call, we will discuss our Q4 and full year financial results and update you on our earnings forecast. Before we get to the results let me remind you that this presentation contains our financial forecast for the 2015 first quarter and full year as well as other forward-looking questions identified on this slide. We refer you to the company\u2019s 2014 Form 10-Q for the second quarter for more details about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Also this presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures; a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release. With that, I will turn the call over to Scott. Scott Santi : Thanks, Aaron and good morning. Overall, we were pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year as we continued to execute well on our enterprise strategy. In the fourth quarter, earnings per share came in at $1.18, which was an increase of 28% versus Q4 of last year and $0.07 above the midpoint of our forecast. This above forecast earnings performance was driven primarily by margin performance that came in at the high end of what we expected heading into the quarter. Q4 operating margin improved to 190 basis points year-on-year with a 120 basis points of that improvement coming from enterprise strategy initiatives. Organic revenues in the quarter were up 2.3%, largely in line with our forecast with ongoing product line simplification activities reducing organic growth by roughly 1%. The quarter kept the solid year for ITW. For the full year, earnings per share increased 29%, operating income of 2.9 billion, and operating margin of 19.9% were above all time records for the company. After tax return on invested capital improved 260 basis points to 18.9%. In 2014, we made significant progress on the execution of our strategy as we simplified the company through our business structure simplification initiative and generated cost savings from our strategic sourcing initiative that exceeded our plan. We also completed the heavy lifting with regard to divestitures associated with our portfolio management initiative, while our divisions continued to be very active in refining and narrowing the focus of their business portfolios through the implementation of our product line and customer base simplification initiatives. Free cash flow was strong in 2014 and came in at 110% of adjusted net income through the combination of our strong free cash flow and divestiture proceeds. In 2014, we were able to return a record 5 billion to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases and increased dividends. In summary, ITW's unique and highly differentiated business model is delivering strong results as we continue to execute our strategy. As we enter year three of our five year plan, we are well positioned to deliver another year of solid progress in 2015. I\u2019d like to close by thanking all of our people around the world for the great job that they continue to do in serving our customers and in executing our strategy. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Michael. Michael? Michael Larsen : Thank you Scott and good morning everyone. Starting with the financial summary on page 4, fourth quarter EPS was a $1.18, an increase of 28% versus prior year. The EPS number included $0.04 of currency related headwinds versus prior year. Enterprise initiatives contributed 120 basis points of margin expansion and led to operating margin of 19.6% and operating income of 686 million. Also good progress on the after tax return on invested capital metric with an improvement of 220 basis points to 18.6%. Revenues were 3.5 billion, up 2.3% organically after the expected 1 percentage point impact from product line simplification. Foreign currency translation reduced revenues by 3.5% resulting in total revenues declining 1.4%. Cash generation was as expected with pre-operating cash flow conversion at 124%, and we allocated $800 million to our share repurchase program in the quarter. The ending diluted share count was 386 million. Overall, we\u2019re pleased with the results in the quarter and the positive momentum going into 2015. Turning to revenue by geography, organic revenue was up 2.3% with positive growth in all major geographies. North America up 3% as a result of strength in welding up 10%, food equipment up 5%, and automotive OEM up 4%. International growth was stable up 2% with Europe up 1% driven by automotive OEM up 12% and food equipment up 5%. Asia-Pacific and South America were both up 2% with China up 4% on strength in automotive OEM, food equipment, and Test & Measurement and Electronics all up 10%. So 2.3% organic growth after the ongoing product line simplification activities that reduced organic growth by roughly 1% in the quarter.  On page 6, operating margin exceeded our expectations going into the quarter, had solid execution on the enterprise initiatives led to an operating margin of 19.6%, an increase of 190 basis points from last year. Margin expansion was broad based with six of seven segments expanding margins by more than 100 basis points in the quarter. On the right side, you can see the key drivers of the margin expansion with the largest contribution, 120 basis points from enterprise initiatives. Operating leverage was 60 basis points and price cost was favorable for a total of 190 basis points of margin expansion. So, overall solid progress in operating margin, and we continue to have significant potential to further leverage the enterprise initiatives and expand margin as we move forward. On page seven the 2014 financial summary, just a couple of the highlights to recap the year and set the stage for 2015. Earnings per share of $4.67, increased 29% over 2013 with operating margin and operating income at all-time highs. Operating margin of 19.9% improved 210 basis points with 120 basis points from our enterprise initiatives. Organic revenue growth was 2.6% and in our expected range of 2% to 3%, and throughout the year PLS reduced revenues by about 1 percentage point. Cash flow was strong with 110% cash conversion, and we returned over 5 billion to shareholders, 4.3 billion in buyback and 700 million in dividends across the key financial metrics, solid performance, and positive momentum going into 2015. Turning to the segments, let\u2019s start with the left side with full year segment results for organic revenue growth and operating margin improvement as you can see good progress on margin improvement across the board with more run-way from enterprise initiatives in 2015. In the automotive OEM segment, another good quarter and a solid year. Organic revenue in the quarter grew 7% compared to worldwide auto builds of 1%. By geography, European organic revenues stood out up 12% with new products and strong penetration gains across all platforms. In North America, our growth was in line with auto builds at plus 4% as at Detroit 3 where we have above average content, builds actually declined 4% versus the prior year.  In China, we outperformed auto builds by 4 percentage points. Profitability also improved with operating margin of 22.3%, 190 basis points improvement from last year. We expect automotive OEM to continue to outperform auto builds in a meaningful way and this segment is well positioned for another solid year in 2015. In our test and measurement and electronics segment, organic revenue decreased 1% in the quarter primarily due to challenging comparisons in test and measurement where organic revenue declined 4%. The electronics business increased organic revenue by 5% as the electronic assembly business grew 11% in the quarter. Operating margin declined slightly due to higher restructuring in the quarter. Continuing its strong performance, food equipment\u2019s organic growth rate of 5% was broad based across the major product categories and geographies. In North America, equipment organic revenue grew 6% driven by new products and penetration gains in refrigeration and cooking. Internationally, equipment revenue increased 6% driven by strong warewash and refrigeration sales, our service organic revenues increased 2%. The segment operating margin of 21.7% was 220 basis points higher than the prior year, so a solid year for the food equipment group and significant positive momentum going into 2015. In our polymers and fluids segment, organic revenue increased 1% and operating margin expanded by 150 basis points as this segment continues its progression to 20% plus operating margin. Automotive aftermarket had a good quarter up 2%, polymers was flat. The fluids and hygiene declined 2%. The welding segment had a solid quarter with organic revenue of 4% driven by continued strength in North America where organic revenue increased 10% due to demand in both industrial and commercial end markets. International organic revenue was down as a result of the challenging year ago comparison and continued product line simplification in Europe. Welding delivered another 230 basis points of margin expansion this quarter bringing margin to 25.4%. The construction product segment produced organic revenue growth of 2% in the quarter. Enterprise initiatives drove 190 basis points of margin expansion this quarter. And as you saw on the previous slide, construction is now at 17% for the year, an increase of 310 basis points versus prior year and well on its way to 20% plus on a sustainable basis. North America was up 8% with growth in renovation and commercial offset by decline in residential. Asia-Pacific increased 1% for the quarter and Europe organic revenue was down 4% largely due to continued product line simplification and weakness in France offset by strength in the United Kingdom In the specialty product segment organic revenue was down 3% as a 5% decline in consumer packaging was offset by growth in appliance and ground support equipment. Operating margin of 19% was 110 basis points higher than the year ago period. That wraps up our segment discussion and turning to our guidance for 2015 and the first quarter; our EPS guidance for 2015 has not changed since our December Investor Meeting. We are maintaining our annual EPS guidance of 5.15 to 5.35, an increase of 12% at the midpoint. Let me walk you through some of the key assumptions included in our guidance starting with 2.5% to 3.5% organic revenue growth in line with current run rates and what we communicated in December. As expected, PLS remains at 1 percentage point drag throughout the year. Total revenue is expected to be down 1% to 2% as a result of the impact of foreign currency translation, which creates a 4% headwind at current rates. As for 2015 operating margin, we expect enterprise initiatives to contribute an additional 100 basis points of improvement which will get us to approximately 21% for the full year.  Our guidance today reflects current exchange rates, which creates $0.25 of EPS headwind, up from $0.15 when we met in December. As we sit here today, we expect the positive momentum that we\u2019ve generated with our enterprise strategy to offset this increased headwind. However, exchange rates remain highly volatile and we\u2019re keeping a close eye on the situation.  The other topic likely on your mind is the potential impact of lower oil prices. As discussed at our December meeting, ITW revenues into the oil and gas industry are only in the 2% to 3% range and primarily in the welding segment. We continue to expect that any potential reduction in revenues from oil and gas related end markets will be offset by lower input cost for raw materials such as chemicals and resins as well as lower transportation and freight cost. Overall, we continue to expect that this will be a net neutral for ITW. Couple of housekeeping items includes an expected tax rate of 30% to 31% and restructuring in the range of 70 million to 80 million for the year. Finally, on capital allocation free operating cash flow conversions expected to exceed 100% and we expect to allocate approximately 1.5 billion of our free cash flow to our share repurchase program in 2015.  So for the year maintaining guidance and well positioned to deliver another year of solid progress towards our enterprise price performance goals.  For the first quarter, we expect EPS to be in the range of $1.13 to $1.21 an increase of 16% at the midpoint of $1.17. This includes $0.07 of EPS headwinds from currency at current rates.  Organic revenue growth is expected to be 2% to 3% and our enterprise initiatives are expected to generate about 100 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter.  Finally, share repurchase is expected to at least 500 million in the quarter.  In summary, the positive momentum and strong execution in ITW\u2019s enterprise initiatives puts us in a solid position as we enter 2015. We expect 2015 to be another year of strong progress that keeps us firmly on track to deliver on our 2017 performance goals. With that, let me turn it back over to Aaron. Aaron Hoffman : Thanks Michael. We\u2019ll now open up the call to your questions. Please be brief to allow more people the opportunity to ask a question and remember our policy of one question and one follow up question only. So with that, let\u2019s turn to the questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joel Tiss of BMO. Joel Tiss : Well, I usually barely make it at the end. How are you doing guys? It looks like you\u2019re kind of reaching or you\u2019re moving toward your 2017 goals a little faster than expected, is there more benefit you\u2019re getting from your initiatives or do you think you\u2019re going to finish early or I\u2019m just trying to or you\u2019re going to have to enhance your plans as we go down the road? I\u2019m just trying to understand what\u2019s going on at the operating level? Scott Santi : Well, the way I would characterize it is, I think we\u2019re largely on track. We did update our margin goal in December for 2017 to be in the 23% range, that\u2019s certainly reflective of the progress generated to date and also what we see ahead in terms of additional opportunity around these initiatives, but again I think we\u2019re largely where we expect to be executing and making progress quarter-by-quarter and still remain on track with what we\u2019ve set out to do two years ago. Operator : Thank you, next question is Andy Kaplowitz of Barclays. Andy Kaplowitz : Hey guys, how are you? Nice quarter. So Scott, you talked about welding a bit, you guys talked about oil and gas that is within welding, but it was up very strong 10% and we know oil and gas has been slow, but you\u2019ve also talked in the past about it being more downstream and midstream. So, as we look at welding in 2015, can you give us a little more clarity about what you think the non-oil and gas businesses will do and then maybe have you gotten more color since the December Analyst Day on what you think oil and gas will do in the business? Scott Santi : I would say relative to the second part of your question, we haven\u2019t seen any real noticeable change in terms of buying behavior out the oil and gas segment to date. That certainly doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t expect there to be some impact from that as we go forward. But on the ground in the fourth quarter, we didn\u2019t see any significant change relative to the run rates we had from the oil and gas sector heading into the quarter.  On an overall basis for \u201915, I think what we saw that was encouraging was some noticeable improvement in demand in North America through the back half of the year, given certainly the volatility of the current environment, I don\u2019t know that we have anything that we would say is leading us to believe that that won't continue as we go forward, and so I think we\u2019re pleased with the momentum that\u2019s been building there and expect it to continue at a moderate level through \u201915. Andy Kaplowitz : And Scott let me back up to your last response and just ask you in general, you mentioned the volatility of the market, you can see some of the other guys report on what they\u2019re doing. But you guys have been doing pretty well, it looks like Europe is holding up for you, but it\u2019s pretty heavily weighted towards your auto outperformance and the food equipment. So is there a way to characterize what you see in the different geographies, specifically Europe and U.S., did you see any change in order patterns throughout the end of the year last year and as you started here in January or is it sort of just steady as you go and we can expect the outperformance that we usually get from ITW? Scott Santi : Well, the answer to that is, we really haven\u2019t seen any change I think, from an overall demand standpoint, Q4 I think things held up pretty well right in line with our expectations certainly consistent with Q3 run rate. So, as we\u2019ve talked before, our planning is built on demand that we\u2019re actually seeing on the ground, and as it relates to Q4, things held up pretty well certainly on track again with expectations and consistent with Q3 run rates. Andy Kaplowitz : Okay, and throughout Europe as well and major businesses. Scott Santi : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Jamie Cook : Good morning and nice quarter, I guess a couple of questions, one within the construction products division, the North America up 8% driven by renovation and commercial was encouraging. You guys have been less optimistic on commercial construction. So can you sort of talk about any change in your outlook, does this get you more excited in what you think potentially, the effect of energy is on the construction business?  And then my last question just I am sorry if I missed it, what is your assumption on sort of price cost with -- you talked about some of the tailwinds that you could from resin chemicals, et cetera. Has that changed relative to your December outlook meeting? Thank you. Scott Santi : So let\u2019s start on the construction side. So if you look at the total segment, we were up 2% in line with what we\u2019ve done really throughout 2014. And so, we\u2019ve been growing in the low single digits in the construction segment, and we\u2019re not expecting things to improve much as we go into 2015. Certainly, there are some encouraging headlines but that is -- we're not counting on it as we go into 2015. North America was up 8%, we saw some strength in renovation, some slight growth on the commercial side and then a decline in residential. So, I wouldn\u2019t get too excited about the number of North America 8%. We expect this to continue kind of along with the run rates that we saw in 2014, so low single digit type growth is how we would characterize the construction in North America with some optimism given some of the headlines. On the price cost side, we had 10 points of favorability in 2014. That is still our base assumption for 2015, but clearly as we\u2019ve talked about the impact of lower crude oil prices and what that may mean to our purchase of chemicals, resins, certainly our transportation and freight costs, we would expect as those savings come through to see an improvement in our price cost metric. For now, we are holding on to the base assumption here at 10 basis points favorable and we\u2019ll keep you posted as we go through the quarters. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is Andy Casey of Wells Fargo Securities. Andy Casey : Good morning everybody. A question on -- it\u2019s kind of a specific question, but in North America did you see any benefit in any of your business from the late passage through the Section 179? Scott Santi : No I think as we went through the quarter here really this behaved in line with our expectations. We had a strong finish in December but we always do. And so there was really nothing unusual about the fourth quarter as it unfolded. Andy Casey : Okay, thank you. And then as you look at polymers and fluids going through 2015, are you expecting full year pretty consistent impact from PLS initiatives or does that taper off as you go through the year? Scott Santi : Well, I think that -- as it relates to that segment specifically they have been doing some real heavy lifting with respect to PLS and are getting close to -- getting through the end of that process. So we would expect that to start to dissipate here as we move through \u201915. Operator : Thank you. Next question is Ajay Kejriwal of FBR Capital Markets. Ajay Kejriwal : Thank you. Good morning. Scott just maybe on the enterprise initiatives I know you gave [a lot of] [ph] detail at the December meeting. Maybe an update on BSS in terms of what are some of the major items things that you\u2019ve been looking to achieve in the course of this year?  And then also on sourcing does the recent moves in commodity pricing that has held that how you think about the sourcing gains during the course of this year? Scott Santi : Ajay the connection was a little static so I\u2019m going to -- I think the questions related to some commentary around where we with respect to BSS execution and the second is around sourcing impact relative to lower energy prices and the impact those might have on commodities. Regarding BSS I think we continue to make good progress. I have been very pleased with both the quality and the pace of execution and this is, there has been a lot of moving parts inside the company in support of this initiative and our mantra from day one with our divisions was that we had a lot of important work to do but ultimately we\u2019re going to do that in a way that didn\u2019t impair our ability to serve our customers or deliver for our shareholders throughout and I think we largely been able to sustain that from day one. It is a five year process not a -- and we\u2019re certainly heading into the year three of that. I think organizationally we've got the organizations that we want in place but we\u2019re still doing a lot of work down at the individual division level in terms of plan consolidation, facility consolidations and really getting these businesses in a position to fully operate a single entity global divisions. That work continues. I think we\u2019re well on track but we have a fair load of work still to do in \u201915 and probably a decent amount in \u201916 on that as well. As it relates to on the sourcing side we are -- any energy savings that accrued this year would be and that\u2019s something we would talk about as it relates to our sourcing initiative that would reflected in our price cost reporting. Sourcing initiatives is much more around permanent changes and structural cost as a result of a much more focused 80-20 driven effort around improving the efficiency with through which we source raw materials. So, as Michael talked about earlier there is certainly some potential for some benefit on this on the input cost side related to lower energy prices but that is something that we would not report as part of our sourcing initiative, we would talk about that as a price cost benefit as we moved down the road. Ajay Kejriwal : And then Michael on FX, can you talk about hedging, how do you think about your FX exposures, how much is naturally hedged versus through contracts? Thank you. Michael Larsen : Yes, so Ajay, I just maybe reiterate on the sensitivities around foreign exchange and when we were together in December we gave you a rough rule of thumb, I gave everybody a rough rule of thumb that said a penny change in the euro versus dollar rate equates to a penny of EPS on an annualized basis and obviously since then the euro has weakened versus the dollar to a tune of about $0.10 and so that\u2019s the $0.25 of headwind that we talked about now versus the \u201915 in December and obviously all currencies are moving. So, this is the rough rule of thumb. Well in terms of hedging, we are well hedged naturally, so we\u2019re a company that manufactures in the regions that we sell into and so this is really just the translation impact for ITW, there are no mismatches in terms of revenues and cost, no structural issues to speak of that need to be addressed here and so beyond that we\u2019re all looking at the same currency rates, we told you what the sensitivities are and in terms of operationally our view hasn\u2019t really changed and the way we run the company hasn\u2019t really changed but obviously the way we report our earnings when we consolidate and back into the U.S. are impacted by currency. Ajay Kejriwal : But we\u2019re not a hedger of translation risk. Michael Larsen : That\u2019s correct, yes. Operator : Thank you, our next question is Walter Liptak of Global Hunter. Walter Liptak : Hi, thanks. Good quarter guys. Wanted to ask you about the welding segment and if you could break out the North America and give us some indication of price versus volume. Michael Larsen : We typically do not go into that level of detail for competitive reasons Walter, so we\u2019re not going to go there today I think there is really nothing unusual here. Scott Santi : The plus standard would be largely volume. Michael Larsen : Yes, I mean it\u2019s very similar to what we\u2019ve seen in prior quarters nothing unusual. Walter Liptak : Okay, got it. And then another question, not a follow up but in the electronics segment you had that plus 11% growth and I wonder if we can get some color on that, the products that, that was going into the geographic regions and trying to get an idea if that's sustainable as you go further into 2015? Michael Larsen : I think the increase we were talking about was in the electronic assembly piece primarily sold into Asia, that business can be a little bit lumpy. So, I wouldn\u2019t read too much into one or two quarters here, we\u2019re certainly encouraged by what we saw in the third and the fourth quarter but the long term growth rate here is unfortunately probably a little bit lower than what we saw in the fourth quarter and probably in the low to mid-single digits in that segment. Operator : Thank you, next question is from Rob Wertheimer of Vertical Research Partners. Robert Wertheimer : Hi, not to circle around again but it just seems as though that the risk -- the benefit on the materials cost side and we\u2019ve had a long period of inflation against this kind of flip flop in the last year or so. Have you had more pushback that you\u2019re hearing from your sales staffs on pricing on getting any kind of pricing through that they\u2019re being asked for pass-through or is it really the net risk really does lay your way? Michael Larsen : I mean there\u2019s really been no changes in terms of how we look at price cost inside the company and no increased pushback to your question. Robert Wertheimer : Okay, thanks. And then just real quickly on food service, curious about the general feeling in the market propensity to spend whether you\u2019re seeing people do positive capital decisions or whether doing more replacement. I am just curious about what you feel the rest of the market like? Thanks. Scott Santi : The environment overall is still -- I would certainly not describe it as a market with a lot of tailwind. Lot of what we\u2019re benefiting from right now is at number of meaningful new product launches that are -- certainly given us an extra 2% or 3% of organic growth. I think that\u2019s the best color I can give you on it for now is no big changes in demand over the course of the last year but we\u2019ve seen our own growth rate accelerate as we move through the year largely because of some the product commercializations. Operator : Thank you. Next question is Steven Fisher of UBS. Steven Fisher : The test and measurement segment was down on tougher comps in the quarter. What do you expect there for 2015 and do you have any visibility to that showing some growth next year or this year? Michael Larsen : Yes so if you recall in the fourth quarter \u201913 that business test and measurement was up 8% or 9% organically -- 9% organically. And I think as we look forward into 2015, we expect similar to what we saw in 2014 so in the low to mid-single digits as Scott said earlier and we\u2019ve said many times we in our guidance the way we model this is at current rates. So we expect that test and measurement to be at that low to mid-single digit type growth for 2015. Steven Fisher : Okay, great. And not sure if I missed it but the China 4% growth in the quarter and how you see that playing out in 2015? Michael Larsen : China for us is really primarily driven by the strong performance in our automotive business that continues to outperform in a meaningful way. We also had in the quarter food equipment primarily as a result of an acquisition we did little over year ago. And that\u2019s based strong growth in food equipment and then we talked a little bit about the polymers and fluids business also being positive in China. So the offset here is primarily similar to what we talked about in the third quarter is the welding business where we continue to see some -- two things going on one is product line simplification where we\u2019ve exited some business lines that didn\u2019t meet our threshold from a large end standpoint and then some projects that are still being delayed in China. So I would expect China -- if you look at China for the year we\u2019ve kind of been in that mid-single digit type growth rate and based on the continued outperformance in automotive and food equipment we\u2019d expect that to continue. Operator : Thank you. And at this time we\u2019re showing no further questions. Scott Santi : Thank you everyone for your time today. And we\u2019ll look forward to speaking with you all again very soon. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you for your participation. That does conclude today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect at this time.",

All parties will be on a listen-only mode until the question and answer session of today's conference. [Operator Instructions] The conference is being recorded. And, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Mr. Aaron Hoffman, the Vice President of Investor Relations. Aaron Hoffman : Thanks very much. And good morning and welcome to ITW\u2019s First Quarter 2015 Conference Call. Joining me this morning are our CEO, Scott Santi and our CFO Michael Larsen.  During today\u2019s call, we will discuss our first quarter financial results and update you on our earnings forecast. Before we get to the results let me remind you that this presentation contains our financial forecast for the 2015 second quarter and full year as well as other forward-looking statements identified on the slide. We refer you to the company\u2019s 2014 Form 10-K for more details about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Also this presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures; a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release.  So with that, I will turn at this time over to Scott. Scott Santi : Thanks, Aaron and good morning. Overall, a solid start to the year for the company as we delivered earnings per share at $1.21, an increase of 20% over the last year and $0.04 higher than the midpoint of our forecast. And that was despite an additional $0.03 of currency headwind versus where rates were when we issued our Q1 guidance on January 27. In the quarter we were able to deliver stronger performance despite a challenging macro environment. We continued to focus on executing and the things that are within our control and our business teams around the world continuing to do a very good job of doing just that, as evidenced by the 220 basis point operating margin improvement that they delivered in the quarter.  Q1 operating margin of 20.9% matched the all-time record high for the company set in Q3 of last year. Enterprise strategy initiatives, good tactical cost management and favourable mix as a result of our product line simplification program drove the bulk of the margin increase. Organic revenue growth for the quarter was 2% gross, 1% net including the impact of the product line simplification. This was below our 2% to 3% forecast as weaker capital spending generally and the oil and gas sector specifically resulted in modest year-on-year revenue declines in our welding test and measurement in electronics and specialty product segments. Despite the current macro challenges we are continuing to invest aggressively in support of our strategy to position ITW to deliver solid organic growth with world class margins and returns on capital.  In the quarter we invested more than $150 million in capital expenditures restructuring and innovation programs. As you likely saw on our press release, we are taking our full year EPS forecast down by $0.15 to reflect foreign exchange rates. At the new midpoint of 510, full year EPS growth is 9% despite a translation impact of $0.40 negative. On a constant currency basis 15 EPS gross would be 18%; so overall a strong start for the year in a challenging environment. ITW is well positioned for another year of progress in 2015 and we remain solidly on track. The meter exceed our 2017 performance goals.  I'll now turn the call over to Michael. Michael Larsen : Thank you, Scott and good morning. Starting with the financial summary on page 4 and Scott mentioned first quarter EPS was a $1.21, an increase of 20% versus prior year and $0.04 above the midpoint of our guidance. As expected Enterprise initiatives drove 100 basis points of margin expansion, which contributed to first quarter operating margin of 20.9% and operating income of 697 million. Also, good progress and after tax return on invested capital with an improvement of 210 basis points to 19.3%. Revenues were 3.3 billion, up 1% organically after the expected 1% impact from product line simplification. Foreign currency translation reduced revenues by 7% resulting in total revenues declining 6%. Pre-operating cash flow was strong at 359 million, more than a $100 million higher than last year. Also, during the quarter we were able to efficiently act as about 1.1 billion of cash outside of the U.S., which helped funding buyback of $1.6 billion. Overall; solid execution in a more challenging environment and stronger margin performance offset currency and lower revenues in some of our equipment businesses.  Turning to revenue by geography; organic revenue was up 1% with growth in all major geographies except South America, which as a reminder represents less than 3% of our sales. North America was at 1% as a result of strengthened food equipment of 7% and automotive OEM of 3%. Welding and Test & Measurement and Electronics were flat, while the specialty product was down 7%. International growth was up 1%. Q1 had a tough comparison. You may recall that last year international was up 6% in the first quarter. Europe was up 1% this quarter driven by automotive OEM up 13% partially offset by declines in welding, polymers and fluids and specialty products.  Asia-Pacific was up 1% from strength in automotive OEM and food equipment, both up 5% offset by welding down 7%. China was solid and up 7% in the quarter with automotive food equipment and test and measurement on electronics all growing double digits. Overall, 2% gross organic revenue, 1% net after ongoing product line simplification activities reduced organic growth by 1%, and a mixed demand environment for some of our equipment related businesses.  Margin performance continues to be a highlight, hence the operating margin improved by 220 basis points to 20.9%, which marked a new record for a first quarter and tied for best quarterly operating margin performance ever. The margin expansion as you can see is significant across every segment. On the right side you can see the key drivers of margin expansion this quarter with the largest contribution a 100 basis points from enterprise initiatives. Operating leverage was 20 basis points; price cost was also favorable 20 basis points. Finally, 80 basis points of improvement from cost management and the benefits of product line simplification for a total of 220 basis points.  So in summary significant sustainable progress on operating margin in every segment through the execution of our strategy with more to come as we work towards our 2017 goals. On this page you can see the significant progress all the business teams have made on margin improvement over the first two years of this enterprise strategy. Five segments are now at or above 20% compared to only one segment when we started and overall 400 basis points of improvement, while much work is still ahead of us, significant progress and strong execution on the enterprise strategy so far.  Also keep in mind that the reported margins for test and measurement and electronics and polymers and fluids, each include over 400 basis points of non-cash acquisition related amortization expense that will run its course over time. For your information we have included a schedule with the acquisition related amortization expense for each segment in the appendix. With that, let me provide some additional color about each segments performance in the first quarter. The automotive OEM segment has another really good quarter as organic revenue grew 7% and significantly outperformed worldwide auto builds of 1%. By geography, Europe stood out once again with revenues up 13% driven by new products and strong penetration gains across all platforms. In North America, our growth was slightly above auto builds at plus 3% as at Detroit 3 actually declined slightly versus the prior year. In China, organic revenues grew 14% outperforming auto builds by 8 percentage points. Profitability also improved with operating margin of 25%, 170 basis points higher than last year. In our test and measurement and electronics segments, organic revenue increased 1% in the quarter similar to the growth rate in the fourth quarter. Organic revenues in test and measurement declined 2% due to lower capital spending. And that said the largest division in test and measurement [indiscernible] was up 5% of the quarter. Electronics business was essentially flat with the other electronics platform up 2% offset by a slight decline in the electronic assembly platform.  Operating margin increased 250 basis points to 14.7% in the quarter and I already discussed the significant impact related to acquisitions. Food equipment is up to a good start with organic growth of 4%. In North America equipment was up 10% driven by new products and penetration gains in refrigeration and cooking. Internationally, equipment revenue was flat on a tough comparison. Service grew 4% in North America and 1% internationally. The segment's operating margin of 22.6% was 400 basis points higher than the prior year period driven by solid execution and lower restructuring. In the polymers and fluids segment, organic revenue declined 1% while operating margin expanded by 340 basis points as this segment reached 20% this quarter. Fluids and hygiene organic revenue was down 5% driven primarily by softness in Europe. Polymer was up a solid 4% and automotive, half the market was flat. And as I already mentioned, there is more than 400 basis points of noncash acquisition related intangible amortization impact in these segment's margins. Welding organic revenue was down 3% this quarter as a result of weaker demand in oil and gas related end markets. About 15% of this segment's revenues go into oil and gas and that particular part of the welding business, the oil and gas part, was down 30% globally.  Excluding oil and gas, welding organic revenues would have been up about 3%. North America was flat with growth in commercial welding offsetting declines in oil and gas. International is down 13% driven primarily by oil and gas. Nevertheless, welding delivered 120 basis points of margin expansion as operating margin came in at 26.9%. The construction product segment produced organic revenue growth of 2% in the quarter and margin expanded 118 basis points to 16.6%.  North America was up 5% with growth in renovation and commercial while residential was flat. Asia-Pacific-East increased 1% for the quarter and Europe was up 1% as strength in the United Kingdom was partially offset by continued product line simplification. In specialty products organic revenue was down 6% due to ongoing product line simplification along with weaker equipment sales. North America was down 7 and international down 3. Operating margin improved 150 basis points to 22.6%.  So that wraps up the segment discussion and turning to our guidance for 2015 and the second quarter; we have updated our 2015 full year EPS guidance by $0.15 to reflect current exchange rates. We now expect full year EPS of $5 to $5.20, which is 90% growth at the midpoint or up 18% on the constant currency basis. Full year organic revenue growth is now forecast to be 1% to 2% due to a more challenging capital spending environment. As expected PLS remains at 1 percentage point drag throughout the year. And total revenue is expected to be down 5% to 6% as a result of the negative impact of foreign currency translation, which creates a 7% headwind at current rates.  Given the strong first quarter results and continued positive momentum on margins we now expect that operating margin will exceed 21% for the full year. This includes approximately 100 basis points of margin improvement from enterprise initiatives. On capital allocation for the full year we now expect to allocate approximately $2 billion with share repurchases, while maintaining our target leverage ratio. ITW's board of directors authorized a new $6 billion share repurchase program in the first quarter. For the second quarter, we expect EPS to be in a range of $1.22 to $1.30 with $0.15 of negative impact from currency headwinds, which is $0.05 higher than what we saw in the first quarter. Organic revenue growth should be up 1% to 2% and we expect operating margin of approximately 21% which again includes approximately100 basis point from enterprise initiatives. So that summarizes our guidance and as you can see in a more challenging environment ITW continues to be well positioned to deliver another year of strong progress in 2015.  With that, let me turn it back over to Aaron. Aaron Hoffman : Thanks Michael. We\u2019ll now open up the call to your questions. Please be brief to allow more people the opportunity to ask a question and remember our policy of one question and one follow up question. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. The first question is from John Inch from Deutsche Bank. John Inch : I just want to ask about -- kind of do a fine point on the guide. You basically sort of suggesting that the bulk of the reduction is currency and if you look at the way this sort of plays out that would proportionately hit mostly in the second quarter, but you did take organic growth for the year down and so my question is really if you could parse between what you\u2019re seeing in terms of end markets and the context of reducing guidance second quarter versus the rest of year. Like for instance, why doesn\u2019t the rest of the year come down further if you\u2019re seeing systematic weakness as many companies are, so I\u2019m just trying to understand the moving parts here? Michael Larsen : Yes so John let me try to answer that, so the way we\u2019ve modeled the rest of the year is based on current run-rates. And so based on what we\u2019re seeing in terms of revenues and orders in our businesses today. So we\u2019re not assuming that things improve from here or deteriorate from where we are today. The other point around the guide, the adjustment that we\u2019ve made is $0.15 reduction just for currency. Here we are considering the lower organic growth rate but given the performance in the first quarter and the positive momentum on margins as well as a slight benefit from the lower share count we\u2019re projecting that we\u2019ll be able to offset those lower revenues with better margins, we\u2019re guiding to 21% plus operating margin today which is an improvement from where we were in January and we\u2019re getting a little bit of benefit from the accelerated share repurchase program in the first quarter. John Inch : Okay so better execution really is offsetting the lower organic I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re -- Michael Larsen : Yes. John Inch : I think that's more or less what you\u2019re suggesting. Michael Larsen : That\u2019s correct. John Inch : And then Michael, the share repo for the year had been tagged last quarter to 1.5 billion you actually did 1.6 billion this quarter. So the question is sort of like how are you thinking about share repurchase for the rest of the year? Are you going to be sort of front loading that and then seeing how the rest of the year plays out or would do you think consider raising some financial leverage? I\u2019m just curious, because you obviously want to keep powder dry and I\u2019m just curious how you\u2019re thinking about share repo particularly against the backdrop of what clearly has been some economic softening and that just may present more favorable entry points sort of purchase your shares in future quarters that\u2019s all? Michael Larsen : Yes so John we\u2019re in line with past factors, we\u2019re not going to comment specifically on the timing of these share repurchases, but we\u2019ve said before that our goal is to remain opportunistic as we go forward. I\u2019d say in the first quarter the ability to access the foreign cash to the tune of about 1.1 billion is what helped fund the 1.6 billion of repurchase in the quarter which was essentially the guide that we\u2019d given for the year. We expect to do approximately 2 billion for the year and the balance we\u2019ll be opportunistic and we do not expect to increase leverage from here, certainly not to achieve the $2 billion. But as you know we have a strong balance sheet we generate a lot of cash with the ITW business model and given the diversity of our businesses, and so certainly we are open. But given what we\u2019re seeing today we\u2019re not expecting to increase our target leverage ratio beyond the 2.2 to 2.3 which is where we are right now. And we would like to be more opportunistic as we go forward for the balance of the year on the share repurchases. John Inch : Sorry Michael just as a clarification you took your repo for the year from 1.5 to 2. You\u2019re sort of suggesting based on that was driven by the success [audio-gap] to repatriate 1.1 billion, does that imply that you had thought you\u2019re going to repatriate 600 but you\u2019re able to do 500 or excuse me but you\u2019re able to do 1.1 billion and that\u2019s the difference or is there something else? Michael Larsen : No that\u2019s about right John, that\u2019s about right. John Inch : And did you pay tax on that repatriation? Michael Larsen : So our tax rate for the quarter at 31% as well as for the year we\u2019re still guiding to 30% to 31%, so we were able to do this in an efficient manner from a tax standpoint. Operator : Your next question is from Mig Dobre from Robert Baird. Mig Dobre : Looking maybe for a little more color on your CapEx comments I mean we know that mining and now there is energy CapEx is under a lot of pressure. But how do you think about CapEx trends more broadly outside of these three specific end markets? Michael Larsen : I think we saw certainly soften up a bit in the quarter. I don't think it was anything overly dramatic but if you look at test to measurement and specialty in particular I think welding was largely impacted by oil and gas, there was other two segments. What I would say is in general we saw customers become a little bit more tentative about moving forward on capital expenditures again nothing overly dramatic, nothing that we can't we don't think we can power through, we go through the air, but right now the environment is certainly little choppy than it was as we ended the year. Mig Dobre : Is it fair to say that you are starting to see hesitancy beyond these 3 end markets? Scott Santi : I think actually surely not in for the equipment. So I think it's more for the industrial CapEx the food equipment business is much more tied to the consumer end the economy. They continue they saw there was else in the quarter continue to accelerate. There are also reaching a place from the stand point of their work through the enterprise initiative where they are how we focused on driving organic and I think you are seeing some of that progress show up. So I think we're again talking about test the measurement specialty in terms of more generalized CapEx spending softness and welding in particular which related to oil and gas. Mig Dobre : Alright, that's great and sticking with food equipment here, as I understood from your comments you hint that potentially some share gains in North America any color their and really kind of what drove very good results their this quarter will be helpful. Michael Larsen : We didn't hint in the share gains but sales were up 7% in the quarter in North America through a combination of as I said some continued 7% -- with the equipment are 10. Equipment up 10. overall up 7, thank you Michael and combination of continued mid product pipeline things in the market as well as a reaching the position they said earlier where they are much there in a position that really focus on driving organic. Operator : The next question is from Andy Casey of Wells Fargo Securities. Andy Casey : On the industrial CapEx comments you described what you saw in North America during the quarter outside of the oil & gas sector. Specifically was there any improvement through the quarter or did it just remain choppy? Michael Larsen : I think in general that was pretty flat through the quarter. Actually, no better or no worse in terms of January, February, or March. Right, I think this quarter was pretty\u2014the challenges we are talking about on the capital equipment side in oil & gas showed up fairly early in the quarter and we were able to take some cost actions here as we prepare for not just the quarter but for the rest of year. But you can't certainly the price that didn't accelerate in the quarter and didn't improve in the meaningful way from the run rate that we saw earlier on. Andy Casey : Okay, thank you Michael and then is the same true of Europe and then let in somebody else ask. Michael Larsen : You broke up a little bit. But I think this we saw the same trends essentially in Europe. Europe was a little bit weaker on the equipment side down slightly. But I think again the comps were pretty challenging. Europe was up 5% in the first quarter last year. So would be too much into that at this time. But also Europe, Asia-Pacific was really consistent as we went through the quarter. Andy Casey : Thank you very much. Michael Larsen : Sure. Operator : Next question is from David Raso from ISI Research. David Raso : Hi, good morning. On the second quarter question of the margin and also sales, on the sales it looks that the organic growth you are expecting to accelerate a little bit. I'm just trying to figure out, is that simply because comps get a little bit easier or is there something you are saying to suggest the organic could accelerate a bit? Michael Larsen : We are sequentially, we historically we typically see an increase through the seasonality from Q1 to Q2. If you look year-over-year, we are guiding to 1% to 2% which is a little bit higher than what we saw here in the first quarter, but not significantly higher. Maybe the other way that was kind of what you\u2019re trying to get at is if you look at our EPS for the year this positions us at the first half earnings per share at about 48% of the year and 52% in the back end of the year so not a back-end loaded plan and very consistent with what we\u2019ve been able to deliver historically. So again we\u2019re not counting on acceleration here in terms of organic growth other than what we typically see, we\u2019d love to see one. We\u2019d love to take one, we\u2019d certainly take it, we\u2019re ready if it comes, but typically Q2 represents an improvement from Q1 on the top-line. David Raso : Yes I was referring more to year-over-year and I know it\u2019s modest, but I was just curious\u2026 Scott Santi : And what I would add to that is go back to what Michael said before the comps move around, so we were plus 5 last year in Q1 and plus 1 in Q2. David Raso : Yes I thought that as far as probably little more comp than it is you\u2019re not seeing the acceleration on organic. And then last one on the profitability, the last couple of quarters you have posted negative sales year-over-year but you\u2019re able to grow EBIT year-over-year. The second quarter you\u2019re implying sales down 7.5%, but EBIT does fall at detrimental call it 12%, 13%, 14% which still would be a good performance but just trying to understand what\u2019s the switch from now of sales decline pushes EBIT down when the last two quarters you\u2019re able to grow EBIT on sales decline just if there\u2019s something changed? Michael Larsen : Yes no I think nothing fundamentally is really changing other than this is the toughest quarter from a currency standpoint, so if you look at the impact from currency on revenues and margins as well as EPS, Q2 is the bulk of it. When you translate this into earnings per share we have $0.15 of headwind here in the \u2013 10 in the first quarter, 15 in the second quarter and then the balance 15 remaining for the second half of the year for a total of 40, so that\u2019s really what\u2019s driving the outlook here for the second quarter. Operator : Our next question is from Joel Tiss from BMO. Joel Tiss : A lot have been answered. I just wondered looks like the margin progress in the second quarter that you imply seems to slow down a little bit and I just wondered if you\u2019re seeing any challenges on really driving the kind of margin improvement going forward just because the low hanging fruit has been harvested already or is it more just currency and comparisons and shaky economy? Michael Larsen : Actually on operating margins the things that are within our control I think the teams continue to do a really good job and we expect as we said a 100 basis points from the initiatives in the second quarter which is in line with the first quarter and in line with our expectations for the year if anything on the more technical cost management if you like so responding to what we\u2019re seeing in some of the equipment businesses I think we\u2019re doing a better job maybe on the discretionary cost side but I also think it\u2019s important to point out that we\u2019re not reducing our investment in terms of new products and restructuring and CapEx so we\u2019re continuing to move forward with those investment plans. So it\u2019s really I wouldn\u2019t say that we are performing at any different on the margin side in the second quarter and the balance of the year than we have in the past and certainly if anything the progress we\u2019ve made so far on margin expansion and we showed you the data for the last two years gives us a lot of confidence in our ability to deliver the 23% target for 2017 so continued progress and driven by strong execution by the business teams that are focused on the things that are within our control so\u2026. Operator : The next question is from Andrew Kaplowitz from Barclays. Andrew Kaplowitz : Can you talk about your relatively strong performance in construction you\u2019ve talked about expecting overall low single digit organic growth for the year which you delivered in the quarter but European construction turned positive I think for the first time in the year and U.S. commercial construction seems to be waiting through energy weakness, so can you talk about what you\u2019re seeing in both the U.S. and Europe? Michael Larsen : Yes I think overall this has been certainly what we\u2019re seeing over the last let\u2019s say three quarters or four quarters there\u2019s been kind of an up and down track record both geographically and also in terms of residential versus commercial versus remodel and I think first quarter overall was pretty good. We continue to be very focused on margin improvement in construction but I think what I would say and I swore we won\u2019t going to talk about the weather but given some of the weather in North America I think Q1 was actually a pretty solid quarter for our construction business and hopefully it sets up for some continued progress in terms of overall market demand as we move through the year. Scott Santi : And then I would just add a comment on Europe. I mean I think you\u2019re right we did turned positive in the first quarter and a lot of positive momentum in certain regions particularly in the UK where we have a strong position. And then our upstate as you\u2019d expect by regions in some of the other parts of Europe maybe France, but overall good progress on margins as well on the construction side. Andrew Kaplowitz : And then last quarter you talked about some execution of price cost getting better given lower material and oil cost and price cost did improve by 10 basis points can you talk about your ability to hold price in the current environment and then whether you expect the tailwind from lower raw material cost increase as the year continues? Scott Santi : Yes so I think on price really nothing unusual in terms of our ability to realize price increases as well as announce according to the schedule we\u2019ve set out, so nothing has really changed on the price side. On the potential savings from the lower oil prices on the direct material side and also on the indirect transportation cost I think our business teams are working on it really hard. We saw little bit of benefit here in Q1 particularly in chemicals and resins, but I think it may take a little bit of time to fully play itself out here and so little too early to call what this maybe for the year but we did 20 basis points in the first quarter that\u2019s our assumption for the balance of the year and in line with what we\u2019ve seen over the last three quarters or four quarters or so. So no change, optimistic and we\u2019ll get more on the deflation side, but little too soon to call out a number at this point. Operator : Your next question is from Evelyn Chow from Goldman Sachs. Evelyn Chow : I guess first of all I just wanted to explore further your thoughts on some of the buybacks. I think I understand why you accelerated the share repurchase in 1Q, but looking for the rest of the year beyond what you have in free cash flow, I don\u2019t understand the toggle around the decision to repatriate versus potentially lever out through buybacks? Michael Larsen : Yes so like I said we\u2019re -- given our business model and given our balance sheet and how much cash we generate, the current leverage ratio of about 2.2 times on a gross basis. We enjoy a solid credit rating [indiscernible] A, 2A plus, it gives actually as to credit markets on very favourable terms so we\u2019re very comfortable with our current leverage ratio we\u2019re not looking to go any higher from where we are today.  The decision on what to do with available cash flow is we really go through a thought process that\u2019s in line with the capital allocation framework that we\u2019ve discussed on several occasions, so our number one priority which consumes about 25% of our total cash flow is to invest in the business for organic growth and for productivity so this is new products restructuring CapEx and we spend more than $150 million on that in the first quarter.  We\u2019re committed to [indiscernible] an attractive dividend and so our dividend yield is competitive or in the 2% range at this point, that\u2019s approximately 25% of our total cash flows and so that leaves the balance which is a pretty big number for external investments and there are still acquisitions which we\u2019d love to do under the right conditions. We\u2019ve talked about what those are in the past and or share repurchases and some combination thereof and the decision is really made based on where we can get the best risk adjusted returns. And if you look at our share repurchase program over a long period of time we generate 12% to 13% returns with very low risk and given the visibility that we have into the performance of the company and given what we think overtime, we\u2019ll be able to deliver in terms of total shareholder returns and so that\u2019s really what drives that decision we committed in December to approximately 1.5 billion and we were able to do that a little bit sooner because we were able to access some of this overseas cash and we'll continue to look at opportunities to do that. We are saying approximately 2 billion for the year and let's see how it plays out and we'll keep you posted on the earnings call as we go forward. Evelyn Chow : Okay, understood and then I guess just turning to welding for a second. Drilling down into your performance in the quarter down 3% organically, I think you said oil & gas on 30%, it's easiest comp of the year. Could you just provide maybe a little bit more clarity on your thoughts on the trajectory for the segment for the year? Michael Larsen : Yes, I mean we don't get too fancy in trying to forecast too much. Like we said we were doing current run rate basis and so if in the first quarter we were down 30% we expect that to continue throughout the year, maybe a little bit better in the second half of the year in terms of the declines on the year-over-year basis. But not really counting on things getting a lot better or deteriorating significantly from here, I think the 30% decrease is pretty significant and maybe a little bit of reaction to the changing environment on the oil & gas side and I might just that following a very strong fourth quarter in that business and so fairly maybe a little bit faster we action than what we expected and a little bit more than maybe expected. But this is our assumption for the rest of the year that this run rate will continue. Scott Santi : [indiscernible] businesses up 3 in the quarter. Michael Larsen : Yes, on the commercial side we continue to see solid demand which in North American was enough to offset the decline in oil & gas. Evelyn Chow : Great, thank you so much guys. Operator : The next question is from Rob Wertheimer from Vertical Research. Rob Wertheimer : Hi, good morning. Just a follow up. I wanted to see if I can understand the oil & gas better. Is international down lot more in North America and if you are giving the North American oil & gas number, isn't international more upstream obviously [0:02:24.7] [prices] down just given the mix is in all that upstream, it's a lot bigger than we talk. Michael Larsen : Yes, you are talking about the walling business specifically? Rob Wertheimer : Correct. Michael Larsen : The difference in the percentage is largely because most of our international sales in welding and oil & gas related. They are much more balanced portfolio in terms of their market exposure in North America. Participating in the same parts of the industry overall. Rob Wertheimer : Okay. So the mix international would be most mid stream downstream than upstream? Michael Larsen : Correct. We just like to higher concentration of our international welding in international welding revenues are tied oil & gas. Rob Wertheimer : Perfect and then if I may, is there any risk of an inventory build of the equipment or what not as the oil gas side of welding was down or is it contained with an oil & gas? Michael Larsen : I don't think there is much risk. Our part of let's go to our methodology is for 98% of our loving product portfolio, our customers ordered today and we ship them tomorrow. So in terms of their sort of reaction to the current market environment and the changes that has in terms of the demand back to us, I think it's a pretty efficient system. So I don't think we're seeing much risk around inventory build. Operator : The next question is from Steven Fisher from UBS. Steven Fisher : Thanks, good morning. I'm wondering in which segment you expect to see the biggest impact from the increase internal focus on growth this year and even if that the segment that negative, where do you expect the biggest impact to be? Michael Larsen : I think we are we talked about this before and lot of the work that we've done over the last 2 years plus is really about positioning ourselves internally totally drive and focus in a very efficient way and organic growth. So in terms of the organizational structure of the company in terms of product line simplification work we're doing right now that's largely about cleaning the clutter out and eliminating the distractions associated with product positions that are either not as differentiated as we want to focus on are ultimately too small to matter.  So I would point to automotive and food equipment as the businesses that further down the path. I think the welding business certainly met up some of the current challenges in oil & gas is very well positioned. That's been a business that's growing organically at 9% plus for us since the mid 90's when we got in the business. So certainly we expect that one to start to accelerate as we go forward and then all of the others are at various stages on the path in terms of the [indiscernible] work needed to focus on driving organic. Constructions continue to make progress, build some big restructuring going on in Europe there, polymers and fluids was probably the most fragment that complex structure where I think getting to the back side of what they use to do really get in position to drive organic growth. So I think come a long as we've talked before this is the transition year, 16 to POS impact starts to drop considerably and I think we are in a position to but having in the next year. That's the plan. Steven Fisher : Great and then automotive your business tour you have bit more with this facility and so the 14% growth in China in the quarter. I know you said few times that thinking about the rest of year I knew the run rate. But increase visibility and how do you think that 14% in China and goes rest of the year? Michael Larsen : Hey, Steve. Could you re-ask that question? You dropped out in the middle of it and I just want to make sure we hear your question properly to answer it properly. Steven Fisher : Sure. Sorry about that. I was just saying that your automotive business tends to be one where you have a bit more visibility and the 14% growth in China in quarter and I know you've said a few times today that as you think about the rest of the year for you businesses you tend to sort of just run rate. But because you have that more visibility in automotive and how do you think about that 14% growth in China over the rest of the year? Scott Santi : I think we are well set up there, as you describe that the automotive business. What we are selling today really across the world are is a function of penetration gains that we engineered and invented and sold in going back 2 and 3 years. So I think the run rate is really solid running going through rest of this year, the pipeline is terrific in terms of future years and we continue to be very boyish and what we think we can do with this business long-term. Operator : The next question is form Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse. Jamie Cook : Hi, good morning. Just two quick questions. One, I mean I know the focus largely has been more on internally igniting organic growth and share repurchase. But can you talk it all about just sort of the deal pipeline it all becoming more attractive your interest in larger versus smaller deals and what you are seeing in terms of evaluation and then I'll get back in queue. Michael Larsen : Nothing is really, I think we're pretty clear in our December Investor Day meeting around where we see M&A fitting in terms of our overall enterprise strategy largely focused on building on businesses to our existing segments that we think can either help, support or further accelerate the organic growth rates. No magic from the side standpoint but certainly something that's comfortably in a $100 to $500 million range, in that regard. So ultimately that's opportunistic. We will access those opportunities as we find M&A come available to us. We are certainly focused right now on getting this product to organic growth firmly in place. So from the standpoint of pipeline it's we got a few things out there that are absolutely fits that we are working in terms of both answers to some of our existing businesses. But I don't expect that particularly robust from the standpoint of overall deals done. Jamie Cook : But just to clarify, do you feel anymore I guess pressure look distort you've far exceeded I think everyone's expectations on margins and how successful you've been and the macro obviously has been a bigger head wind to more strong companies and you've done a great job. But do you feel like you could be more opportunistic? I mean to help the organic growth by doing deal at this point. Michael Larsen : I don't think there is any change in past year or aggressive it's ultimately about how does it fit, how does it help us do what I just described and once we really not going to react on a short term basis. This is as we've laid out a 5 year plan to position the company to generate 12% to 14% TSR on a consistent basis and the big [indiscernible] is really driven by an organic finance. So that remains our focus right now. This is also 5 year plan, not a 5 quarter plan. It's all about positioning the company coming out of 2017 could be able to perform like we think again and so we're focused on making that happen and we made a lot of progress and you are kind of note that we've got lot more work to do to get where we think we can get over the next 2.5 years. Operator : The next question is from Ann Duignan from JPMC. Ann Duignan : Hi, good morning. I'm from JP Morgan. Most of my questions have been answered. Maybe just back to your comments on CapEx spending and been kind of whole through the course of the quarter. Are any of your customers and any of the segments growing concerned about the strong dollar and what's that doing to export or do you think it's just general uncertain, any color you could give us will be great? Michael Larsen : I think the impact and export competitiveness is in my view probably driving some of the softness in CapEx particularly obviously in North America. I think there are some shifts and some adjustments that our customers are making around how this change in relative currency rates are impacting their competitiveness from an expert standpoint. So I think if they are sorting out what is likely to happen to whatever business they are exporting from North America given this change in structure geographic competitiveness. I think that's in large part driving some of the softness around CapEx. Ann Duignan : And now you are seeing that any specific segment? Michael Larsen : I think as we go back to TNM probably little bit on the industrial side of welding in our specialty business where which is the equipment that was largely packaging or maybe the packaging equipment. Ann Duignan : Okay, that's helpful. And then just on share repurchase I mean your stock is trading at a significant premium to the S&P and trading inline with the large capital [consumers]. What kind of analysis do you do internally to either decide to accelerate through the purchases or hold under the cash for better opportunity? Michael Larsen : I think I'll go back to what I said earlier is that these are long term decisions that we make and they are really based on highly disciplined approach and being very returns focused. This share repurchase program has been a terrific program for the company and certainly for the shareholders. The alternative which is holding under the cash as you know is not very attractive today and certainly relative to the share repurchase program given our recent performance and given where we believe the company is headed which we've been very public about in terms of the goals and we rate out for 2017 and beyond. We are confident that this continues to be a great way for us to allocate capital and so we're committed to the share repurchase program and we expected to continue be an active program going forward. Scott Santi : I was there that better than the target leverage ratios we talked about earlier there is plenty of flexibility in there, opportunity come along. Michael Larsen : Correct, yes. Ann Duignan : Okay, I guess I was saying the more whichever consider a special dividend rather than share repurchases. Michael Larsen : I think we look at all the options and we have not in the past done special dividends. But we'll certainly continue to look at all the options. Ann Duignan : Okay, thank you. I leave it there. Appreciate it. Operator : The next question is from Steve Volkmann from Jefferies. Stephen Volkmann : Hi, good morning. Just one quick, you guys mentioned that the BSS headwinds should start to go in 2016. But I guess I'm assuming that's not really like a cliff event. So when do we really start to see that phase? Could it be in the second half of this year and then accelerate in '16 or might just being little optimistic there? Michael Larsen : I think the question was wrong and then correct me if I'm wrong. Either BSS or PLS headwinds I'm not, can you just let me\u2026 Stephen Volkmann : Whatever headwinds you got of from and together? Michael Larsen : I think the game plan, there is a lot of planning around this as we've got a full year of TLS activity in 2015, it's going to represent a 1% headwind to our organic growth rate. We are not in the 16 planning but magnitude it probably drops up by half in '16 and then fully done in '17 and beyond. This is a pretty big one time event it really is linked to our portfolio strategy. So we did a lot of work. At the front of the strategy around really building the portfolio that can sort of deliver this organic growth front end that we've talked about. So 30 businesses, the best that we've 3.5 billion of revenue. This is really stage 2 of that which is now working inside all of our divisions to basically take the same approach from a product line standpoint. So we're not pruning product lines that don't need our differentiation standards or that are too small to ultimately matter. So that's this is sort of phase two of portfolio management. But we work really hard on the last year, we can work hard on this year. I think we're going to start to truly get on top of it and it will be a lesser issue certainly in '16 and should be fully completed by '17. Operator : The next question is from Walter Liptak from Global Hunter. Walter Liptak : Hi, thanks and congratulation guys on getting the margin. I've got a couple of follow on, one it is just I want a little clarity on the oil and gas in North America. Basically how much is that down you think you could be down 30%, but doesn't sound like it is and second thing is on pricing. Are the own G customers looking for price declines your margin don't suggest it. But are you trying to help your customers with lower pricing? Michael Larsen : Yeah. Oil and gas in North America was down at the rate we talked about earlier in the 30% range and from a pricing standpoint, we are not really planning that space and that's we're big enough sort of component of what they are having to buy. We're not really seeing a lot of pricing pressure, it's more a big slow down in actually the project work their that's impacting their demand for welding products. Walter Liptak : Okay, got it. And then follow on to the construction question. Is North American construction trending ahead of where you thought it was through the first quarter or is this inline I mean your comments of.... Michael Larsen : Yes, I think largely inline. The business was flat. We'll see how that plays out in the second quarter depending on whether remodel was up 3 and commercial was up 2 to 3 in North America. So reasonable better growth there, but I'll tell you largely inline with expectation. Operator : There are no further questions from the phone. Michael Larsen : Great, thank you all for joining us this morning. We appreciate that very much and we look forward to speak with everyone again soon. Operator : That concludes today's conference.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this point. Now, I will turn the meeting over to your host, Mr. Aaron Hoffman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Aaron H. Hoffman - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great. Thanks, Madison. And good morning. Welcome to ITW's second quarter 2015 conference call. Joining me this morning are our CEO, Scott Santi; and our CFO, Michael Larsen. During today's call, we will discuss our second quarter financial results and update you on our earnings forecast. Before we get to the results, let me remind you that this presentation contains our financial forecast for the 2015 third quarter and full-year as well as other forward-looking statements identified on the slide. We refer you to the company's 2014 Form 10-K and first quarter 2015 Form 10-Q for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Also, this presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott. Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Aaron, and good morning, everyone. In the face of a fairly unprecedented combination of currency translation headwinds and contracting demand in two of the company's highest growth core businesses, ITW delivered another solid quarter of execution with earnings per share of $1.30, an increase of 7% over the last year. Excluding the $0.12 negative impact of currency translation, our earnings per share would have been up 17%. Operating margin in the quarter was up 80 basis points year-on-year, and operating margin of 21.3% was a new all-time record for the company. In addition, after-tax return on invested capital reached our Enterprise Strategy target of 20% plus. Despite the current challenges associated with the external environment, we continue to focus on and invest in our strategy to accelerate organic revenue growth across the company. In the first half of 2015, we invested roughly $300 million in our businesses, as we added capital equipment to expand capacity, launched new products, and continued to simplify our businesses in order to focus them on their largest and most compelling growth opportunities. Our pivot and focus to organic growth is already delivering solid above-market growth in our Automotive OEM and Food Equipment segments, and we saw nice improvement in the organic growth rate in our Construction segment this quarter. As a result, we now have three of our seven segments growing organically in the mid-to-upper single-digit range. Revenues in our Welding segment and Test & Measurement platform were down significantly in Q2, Welding down 6% and Test & Measurement down 7%, as both businesses are seeing contracting demand from the oil and gas sector and the continued soft capital spending environment for industrial equipment more generally. Both of these businesses have traditionally been among ITW's fastest and most consistent organic growers, and we believe that the long-term fundamentals for growth and profitability in both of these businesses remain very strong. As a result, we continue to invest to ensure that they are well positioned to return to their historic growth rates as conditions in their end markets improve. As we wrap up the second quarter of 2015, we are also at the halfway point of our five-year Enterprise Strategy. And while we have a lot of work left to do, we've made substantial progress in executing our strategy to position ITW to deliver solid above-market growth with best-in-class margins and returns on capital. We've divested over 30 businesses including two full segments in conjunction with our portfolio strategy to focus the company exclusively on businesses that have strong and sustainable differentiation attributes. Our business teams are currently executing the product line level component of this strategy through our product line simplification initiative. As a result, ITW today has a much more differentiated set of businesses with better overall earnings quality and significantly higher organic growth potential. As an aside and as an illustration of the significantly higher overall level of quality of the ITW business portfolio, last year, ITW's operating income of $2.9 billion was an all-time record for the company. The prior record of $2.8 billion was set in 2012 when the company's revenues were $3.4 billion higher. So in other words, last year, we made more money than we ever had in the history of the company and revenues that were $3.4 billion lower than the prior record. Our focus now will increasingly turn to leveraging this much higher quality business portfolio into accelerated organic growth. Activities associated with business structure simplification are starting to lessen with significant incremental benefits still to come. Strategic sourcing is now fully embedded in our operations and delivering consistent above-plan benefits. Organizationally, as the effort and attention required to mobilize, execute, and support these initiatives winds down over the next 18 months, we will be increasingly able to shift our focus towards leveraging our much more highly differentiated portfolio and to accelerate organic growth. Since we started executing on the Enterprise Strategy two and a half years ago, we have expanded operating margin and ROIC by more than 500 basis points, and we remain solidly on track to meet or exceed our 2017 performance goals of 23% operating margin, 20% plus after-tax ROIC, and organic growth of 200 basis points above global GDP. I'll now turn the call over to Michael. Michael? Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thank you, Scott, and good morning. Let's get started with the financial summary on page four. EPS for the quarter was $1.30, an increase of 7% versus prior year, and came in at the high end of our guidance range, driven by better margins and favorable currency relative to the exchange rates assumed in the guidance we provided on April 21. On a year-over-year basis, currency was a $0.12 headwind, and on a constant currency basis, EPS growth would have been 10 points higher at 17%. Softness in the capital spending environment in oil and gas end markets in our Welding and Test & Measurement businesses resulted in essentially flat organic revenue, which was offset by record margin performance as Enterprise Initiatives again contributed 100 basis points of operating margin expansion. Revenues were $3.4 billion, up 0.2% organically after the expected 1% impact from product line simplification. Positively, we saw continued strong organic growth performance from our Automotive OEM and Food Equipment segments at plus 6% and plus 4% respectively, and a nice acceleration in our organic growth rate in Construction of plus 6%. I'll cover the segments in a little bit more detail in a few slides. Cash generation continues to be very good, free cash flow at $384 million, 80% of net income, and we remain on track to meet or exceed our target of 100% for the year. On capital allocation, we invested approximately $180 million in share repurchases and are on track for $2 billion for the year. Also really good progress in the after-tax return on invested capital, now solidly above our long-term target of 20% plus. In summary, excellent execution of our Enterprise Initiatives continues to deliver strong financial results in a challenging capital spending environment. Turning to revenue by geography on page five, organic revenue was up slightly in North America and international, and up 1% excluding the impact of product line simplifications. Our businesses in EMEA continued to do well. EMEA was up 2% with another quarter of double-digit growth in Automotive OEM. Asia-Pacific was down 3% due to Welding and Test & Measurement and Electronics partially offset by growth in Construction Products and Polymers & Fluids. China, which represents approximately 5% of total revenues, was down this quarter 2% due to Welding's oil and gas business. Our Automotive OEM business, however, was up 8% and continues to outperform the underlying market. Overall, strong organic growth in three segments with Automotive, Food Equipment and now Construction Products joining the mix, offset by softer demand in our Industrial equipment businesses, Welding and Test & Measurement. On page six, operating margin performance continues to be excellent with 21.3% this quarter being an all-time high for the company and 80 basis points better than last year. Operating margin improved in five of our seven segments with Food Equipment up 250 basis points, Construction up 170 basis points, and Polymers & Fluids up 130 basis points. Welding was down slightly and Specialty was down 70 basis points on a tough comparison versus prior year. On the right side, you can see the key drivers of margin expansion this quarter with Enterprise Initiatives the primary driver with 100 basis points of positive impact as expected. Price/cost was favorable 20 basis points, and other was a slight headwind due to a project in Specialty Products last year that did not repeat this year. As you can see, 150 basis points of margin expansion in the first half as we target to exceed 21% operating margin for the year. Let me just point out that while first half revenues are down more than $500 million, operating income is essentially flat and EPS is up 13%, 23% on a constant currency basis. And so, overall, a lot of good things going on in terms of execution on so-called self-help in an external operating environment that remains challenging and somewhat uncertain. Turning to page seven, we get into the segment results. And on the left side, we listed organic growth by segment for the first half of 2015. You can clearly see the three segments growing solidly at 6%, 4%, and 4% year-over-year, and you see the impact of the soft capital spending environment on our Welding and Test & Measurement and Electronics segments. As Scott said, our Welding and Test & Measurement businesses have historically been strong above-market growth businesses. In fact, from 2010 to 2014, both businesses grew organic revenue at a 6% CAGR. As we've discussed previously, Specialty Products and Polymers & Fluids are still impacted by a significant amount of product line simplification. Now let me give you some additional color by segment starting with Automotive OEM. Automotive OEM continues to leverage ITW's unique approach to innovation and drive product penetration gains for strong organic growth. As you can see, organic revenue in the second quarter was up 6% on flat worldwide auto builds. By geography, Europe continued to outperform with double-digit revenue growth; and in North America, the business was up 5%, again solidly above 2% auto builds. And in China, organic revenues grew 8%, outperforming auto builds also. Operating margin improved 80 basis points to 24.5%. In our Test & Measurement and Electronics segment, organic revenue declined 5% in the quarter. Organic revenue in Test & Measurement declined 7% due to the previously-discussed impact of the softer capital spending environment. And the Electronics business was down slightly at 3%. Operating margin for the segment increased 90 basis points to 16.1% in the quarter or 20.1% excluding the intangible amortization. In the appendix, we included the schedule with a margin impact of amortization expense from acquisition-related intangible assets by segment and in total. Food Equipment organic growth was up 4% with North America Equipment up 9%, driven by new products and penetration gains in warewash, refrigeration, and cooking. Internationally, Equipment revenue was flat on a tough year-over-year comparison. Good performance in Service as revenues grew 5% in North America, 3% internationally. The segment's operating margin of 22% was 250 basis points higher than the prior year period, driven by strong execution of Enterprise Initiatives and growth from new products. In the Polymers & Fluids segment, still a significant amount of product line simplification in the quarter, as organic revenue declined 2% while operating margin expanded by 130 basis points. Polymers was down 3%, Fluids & Hygiene was down 2%, and Automotive Aftermarket was flat. Turning to Welding, this segment is clearly being impacted by softer demand on the equipment side, which represents two-thirds of the business. In addition, there is a fair amount of product line simplification this quarter, and as you can see, organic revenue was down 6%, as operating margin remained essentially flat above 26% and solidly best-in-class. As expected, demand for equipment in oil and gas related end markets remained soft in the quarter, very much in line with Q1 run rates. And in addition, the commercial business and the industrial businesses were impacted by the soft capital spending environment as well. On slide 10, the Construction Products segment exceeded top line growth expectations this quarter with organic revenue growth of 6%, the highest growth rate in four years. North America is about 40% of the segment and led the way, up 15% with growth in all end markets particularly renovation and remodeling. Asia-Pacific increased 3% for the quarter, and Europe was down slightly, as strength in the United Kingdom was offset by softness in Continental Europe. Operating margin came in at 19.9%, an improvement of 170 basis points. In Specialty Products, organic revenue was down 3% due in part to product line simplification. North America was down 5%, and International was down 1%. Operating margin fell slightly, but was still very good at 23.5%. So that wraps up the segment discussion and now I'll turn to the outlook for the balance of the year on slide 11. As you saw this morning given the strong EPS performance in the quarter, we're raising our full-year EPS guidance by $0.05 at the midpoint. We now expect full-year EPS of $5.07 to $5.23, which is 10% growth at the $5.15 midpoint. As a reminder, EPS for the year would be up 18% on a constant currency basis. Based on current demand trends, full-year organic revenue growth is expected to be approximately 1%, up 2% excluding the impact of product line simplification. As you know, PLS remains a 1 percentage point drag throughout 2015 and then moderates starting in 2016. Total revenue is expected to be down 6% as a result of currency, which creates a 7% headwind at current exchange rates. We clearly expect that slightly lower revenues will be offset by record margin performance. Its operating margin remains solidly on track to exceed 21% for the full year, and it's worth pointing out that in spite of a 6% or $850 million revenue decline, we're on track to set a new record for operating income dollars this year. In terms of capital allocation, we continue to invest aggressively for growth, pay an attractive dividend that grows in line with earnings over time, and as I said earlier, we expect to invest approximately $2 billion in share repurchases with $1.8 billion completed to-date. Turning to the third quarter, we expect EPS to be in a range of $1.32 to $1.40, up 6% in the midpoint with $0.11 of negative impact from currency assuming current exchange rates. We expect organic revenue growth to be flat to up 1% and we should achieve record operating margin of approximately 22% as Enterprise Initiatives deliver 100 basis points of margin expansion. So that summarizes the quarter and our guidance for the balance of the year. As you can see, the operating teams continue to execute well in a challenging external operating environment. And we remain solidly on track to meet or exceed our 2015 and 2017 performance goals as we continue to focus on and invest in our strategy to accelerate organic revenue growth across the company. So with that, let me turn it back over to Aaron. Aaron H. Hoffman - Vice President, Investor Relations : Thanks, Michael. We'll now open up the call to your questions. Please be brief so as to allow more people the opportunity to ask a question. And remember one question, one follow-up question. Operator : Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Mr. John Inch with Deutsche Bank. Sir, your lines are open. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning. Can I start with PLS? How, Scott and Michael, do you have confidence that PLS is working and that there is going to \u2013 this is basically going to incite underlying growth, call it starting \u2013 or improved underlying growth starting in 2016? I mean, plus it's a bit of a black box, so could you just tell us, because obviously growth is probably investors' number one concern with you right now, not Enterprise Initiatives that are clearly working. So how does the PLS \u2013 how do you have the confidence PLS as it dissipates will incite better underlying growth? Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, absolutely the elimination of the negative is the obvious first part of that, right. So the whole point of PLS is really around the idea of simplification, and embedded in 80/20 is a real strong discipline around focusing on the relative handful of product lines and customers that really can drive growth. So the PLS that we're doing now is a collection of 15 years of aggressive acquisition. So we're going through now \u2013 50 to 60 deals a year, we're going through now and really simplifying our businesses, consolidating our focus on our best growth opportunities from a product line in an end market and customer standpoint. It's not something that's new to the company but certainly it's something that's new in terms of being done at this level across the company all at once. The end result is that we eliminate the distractions both from the standpoint of operational distraction from the standpoint of distraction to the focus of our sales teams, marketing teams. So the growth agenda and the growth focus becomes very clear. PLS by itself doesn't create growth, but what it does is create a high degree of focus on the best growth opportunities we have, and we still then have to execute on that. But the elimination of that complexity, we have a lot of conviction about the fact that that's a really important step in this process. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Would you expect, Scott, some sort of a multiplier effect? So in other words, if it's dragging by one, you don't simply add one to future growth. The focus allows you to get a little bit better? I'm not trying to be leading, I am just... Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, no. Absolutely. We expect to accelerate organic. We expect to be an above-market grower by 200 basis points across the company. And that's because we are focusing the company on highly differentiated positions in end markets that fundamentally have reasonable growth prospects, but we expect to be able to outperform market level growth because we are focused on driving highly differentiated solutions to end customers that have complex and sophisticated business problems. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Is PLS \u2013 yeah, I was going to ask, is PLS dragging cash flow? Because you mentioned you expect cash to accelerate, I guess, based on it driving toward 100%, if not higher, for the back half. Is it dragging cash, I think, at 80% net income conversion this quarter? Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, no. No, PLS doesn't create a drag on cash flow. I'd say actually quite the opposite over time. The 80% conversion is in line with our typical run rate for the first half. Same as we did last year in the first half of the year. And so we would expect it to accelerate here in the back half and we're confident that we'll be at or above our 100% target for the year. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Just last, China auto, 8% is probably a relief for a lot of folks, but the question is with production rates expected in that country to come down, how are you thinking about your trends juxtaposed against your performance penetration, but then obviously slowing production rates in that market? Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You're talking about just auto, John, or the whole company? John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, just auto in China. Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I think the auto China business, it's largely a penetration story. I think we are at the early stages of sort of moving from the global OEMs \u2013 not moving from but supplementing a very strong position with global OEMs in China with an accelerating level of penetration for the sort of major domestic players over there. So I think there's plenty of runway for us. The build rates or the production rates are certainly going to have some impact overall, but we're still running high-single digits there in a market that last quarter, I think, was \u2013 the build rate was up a couple of percent. So I don't think \u2013 the macro in China is going to have some relative effect, but I don't think it's going to make it impact our overall ability to grow there over the next multiple years. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Well, then second half, is this going to be one for one? So for instance, if builds in China go from plus two to minus five, would that subtract seven points from your trend or do you think you do a little better or is it too granular? Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think it's a little granular. I would say we're running 6 percentage points ahead of market, so figure five to six, I think, would be a good target. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line is now open. Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: So I know the focus is shifting to growth, but let's talk about the margins for a second because they were still really good in basically a no-growth environment. The Enterprise Initiatives are coming through. I'm just curious, as the year progresses, how are you guys thinking about price/cost? And then secondly, can you talk a little bit about that negative 40 basis point impact you saw in the other line item? Is that mostly driven by mix this quarter? Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So let's start with the 40 basis points of other negative impact on margins. And it's very simply \u2013 it was a project that we completed in Specialty Products last year that didn't repeat in this quarter. So that is a... Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: This is a high margin project. Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : That didn't repeat on a year-over-year basis, and so you'd expect that drag to go away for the balance of the year. For the balance of the year, you would also expect it align with our guidance that our Enterprise Initiatives continue to generate 100 basis points of margin expansion. We have a lot of confidence around that number just given the projects underlying that in terms of our sourcing efforts and our business structure simplification projects. Price/cost was favorable again this quarter at 20 basis points, and we expect that to remain at 20 basis points favorability here in the second half of the year. We have not seen any change in the dynamics around our ability to get price. As you know, one of the byproducts of product line simplification is that your portfolio is much more differentiated, and so if anything we should have the ability to maintain our pricing if not do a little bit better. And on the cost side, I'd say on the question we talked about on the last call around material deflation as a result of crude oil and other commodities, we are still working on that. We have not seen it in the numbers yet. I think it would be reasonable to assume that we'll get some favorability in the second half, but again we're not counting on it. So those are soon to call out here and certainly not in our planning assumptions for the second half. Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And I would just add to that, we've got \u2013 given what we have already talked about in terms of our 2017 margin target, we've got 100 basis points of margin improvement from initiatives for another two years after this one, 100 basis points a year. Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Right. Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: No, that's helpful. Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Not just the next two quarters in other words. Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. No, that's helpful. I guess maybe my one follow-up and shifting gears back into the growth side and the CapEx side, can you maybe provide a little bit of color on both Welding and Test & Measurement, and specifically what's happening within oil and gas? I think your expectations last quarter were for oil and gas to be down $30 million (26:44). And then within Test & Measurement, I know it's only about $100 million of that business, but that market was also down significantly this quarter. So any color on the oil and gas and non-oil and gas trends within those two segments would be helpful. Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I think from an oil and gas perspective, I think the first quarter run rates held up. They probably flipped around the percentages maybe a little bit just based on whatever happened last year in terms of seasonality, so no real uptick or further deceleration either way in the oil and gas side. I think on the Welding side, what we saw in the second quarter that we didn't see as much in the first quarter is the softness in Welding expanding beyond oil and gas, and Michael talked about it in his comments that the core industrial equipment business was down 4%, 5% I think in the quarter. And even the commercial business, that has been, which is the lighter duty part of the Welding capital equipment sector, which has been a little bit more robust, was down I think 1% or 2% in the quarter. So beyond oil and gas, at least in terms of the second quarter, the year-on-year trends got incrementally negative. Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Great. And then on Test & Measurement? Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think the core business there just continues to be choppy. I think the year-on-year comps got a little worse. The non-oil and gas related end markets for our Test & Measurement equipment business in terms of second quarter were down probably mid-single-digit year-on-year. And again, no real changes in terms of run rate or demand patterns there, but more of the same. Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. All right. Thank you. Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Things are not getting better yet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Andy Casey from Wells Fargo. Sir, your line is now open. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks a lot. Good morning, everybody. Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Question on the $0.05 increase to the 2015 guidance, could you help us a little bit more with the components that drove that? The organic growth went down a little bit, but everything else on slide 11 stayed reasonably constant with the equivalent slide in the Q1 presentation. Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, so Andy \u2013 so you're right. I mean the revenue assumption is a little bit lower for the back half of the year, but that's offset by the stronger margin performance in the back half. The $0.05 really is the $0.04 of beat in the quarter here, which is a combination of primarily currency favorability relative to our guidance and slightly better margins and so we're carrying that forward. And then as we sit here today, relative to the currency planning assumption we had in April, we have a little bit of favorability. So those things together make up the $0.05 that we raised the guidance for the year. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you, Michael. And then if I look at \u2013 and I'm going to get a little picky here, but if I look at Auto OEM and Food Equipment, the operating margin was still really strong, but it softened a little bit in Q2 versus Q1. Is that a function of the shift to the organic growth acceleration or were there other impacts that caused around a 50 basis point, 60 basis point compression in the quarter? Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : No, Andy (30:24). There's really nothing unusual in terms of the margins. I mean, it can fluctuate a little bit quarter-by-quarter, but I just... Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Based on mix shifts. Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, I just look at the year-over-year performance. I mean, Food 250 basis points. And if you look at the schedule in the appendix, you'll see that was on higher restructuring, so it's actually over 300 basis points excluding that. And then Automotive at 24.5% is still very strong performance. I think if you look at our peers in that space, that's approximately 3x what everybody else does in that space. So I appreciate you being a little picky here, but I really don't \u2013 I don't want to be defensive, but I think we feel very good about the progress on margins. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. David Raso with Evercore ISI. Sir, your line is now open. David Michael Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities : Hi. Good morning. A pretty straightforward question. I'm just curious how July has started organically versus your third quarter guidance and, for that matter, even sort of the implied fourth quarter? The base growth a year ago accelerated a little bit 3Q, 4Q from what you had in 2Q? Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, that's right. The comps are little tougher here, David, in the back half, so third quarter of last year, I think, was up 3.5% organically. As an aside, EPS was up 40% last year. So in July, it's in line with the guidance for the quarter. We said up in that 0% to 1% range, and that's kind of what we're seeing so far. Typically, sequentially the business in total is flat from Q2 to Q3. Auto typically is down a little bit, offset by some of the other businesses. But really nothing unusual as we go into the back half of the year. I'd say the things we just talked about, Scott talked about Welding and Test & Measurement certainly not improving and some tough comps particularly on the equipment side in those businesses. We talked about automotive China. We'll see how that plays out in terms of auto builds, but we'll outperform that market substantially, and everything else is kind of in line with what we've seen so far. And I think, David, just to add on, if you look at our guidance for the year, and the EPS of the first half of the year represents 49% of the total year and the second half is 51%, and so we're exactly in line with where we performed historically and we're not counting on an acceleration or things getting a lot better here in the second half of the year. David Michael Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities : Yeah, I'm not trying to nickel and dime it, but as you said, usually 2Q, 3Q are roughly similar. Things don't seem to be accelerating. But you were willing to put a nickel to actually $0.06 on the midpoint increase into your guidance 2Q to 3Q, which \u2013 I mean, I'll take it, but I was a little surprised that you were willing to guide 3Q where you did, given the trends. There must be some underlying confidence on the margins... Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yes. David Michael Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities : ...maybe July was stronger than we thought, but now it sounds like you're going to have to get that nickel sequentially $0.06 to the midpoint of the guidance really from margins. And maybe if you can help us maybe the share count at the end of the quarter, anything to...? Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : The share count is 368 million. And you're right. The improvement from Q2 to Q3 is all operating margin performance. So like I said, Q3 should be another record for the company at approximately 22%, and we just did 21.3%. And so on the same revenues, I think if you do the math, you'll see that it's a very reasonable assumption. David Michael Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities : Got it. That's helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Joel Tiss with BMO. Sir, your line is now open. Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States): All right. How's it going, guys? Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Good, Joel. Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Is there a less upward margin pressure as the PLS starts to slow down a little bit in 2016? Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Less upward margin pressure? Can you clarify that, Joel? Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States): You're eliminating fewer and fewer negatives, so there's \u2013 it seems logical that there would be a little bit less buoyancy in the margin improvement. Or is that getting so small that it doesn't matter anymore? Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You're talking about a relatively immaterial amount of revenue, so I don't \u2013 the addition by subtraction is not a significant driver of the margin improvement. There're certainly some underlying costs that comes out from an operating perspective as we take the complexity out of a lot of relatively small volume SKUs. That's a normal part of our 80/20 process. So I don't think there's a whole lot of delta in terms of margin momentum around the sort of revenue impact the PLS starting to dissipate here. Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. And I just wondered, Scott, if you could give us a little bit more color on a couple of the drivers of the organic growth. Some new product introductions and some of the capacity that you added, just some kind of real live examples to give us a little bit better flavor. Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I think you're seeing it in places like Food Equipment from an innovation perspective, Automotive OEM. I mean we've talked about it before as these businesses as we have gone through this repositioning around our strategy, our seven businesses were all in a different starting point. The Auto OEM business was the most ready, sort of move through the process of streamlining their structure, developing a sourcing capability, simplifying their product offerings, and you're seeing coming out the other side in their performance. An example of what we think \u2013 to certainly higher or lower percentages overall, the way that we're ultimately positioning the entire company to operate. So in terms of the investments there, we're investing heavily in R&D, we're investing heavily in capacity. This is a business growing high-single digits, so we are investing ahead. It's also a business where we have a three-year out time horizon, so we have a pretty good runway there. So we are investing and supporting that growth rate in terms of capital equipment and what are the next innovation programs beyond the current three-year horizon. Food Equipment is another one that's now starting to come out the other side, 9% equipment growth in North America in the quarter. Service business up mid-single digits worldwide and that's being driven by both focus \u2013 the ability to focus on their best, most competitive positions, most compelling growth opportunities and the amount of investing they're now positioned to support and execute on those growth opportunities. Construction started to come out the other side at least as it relates to North America, so there's no secret in terms of what we're doing here other than we've got some \u2013 we're in some really good industries. We're in product offerings in those industries that are highly differentiated that solve real meaningful problems for customers and we expect the acceleration to come from an ability to really focus on fully leveraging those opportunities, and that focus increases as we're having to spend less time inside those businesses doing things like PLS, developing sourcing, divesting businesses, et cetera. So that's really the glide path we're on. Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. And then just, Mike, real fast, I don't know if you answered why the free cash flow was down $100 million in the quarter, and if you could just give us an update on the timing of reducing debt as the share repurchase starts to get toward the end? Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, I think if you look at Q1, Q2 last year cash flow and this year, there were some movements between Q1 and Q2 related to the IPG divestiture and some of the tax payments associated with that. If you normalize for that, like I said, for the first half of the year, this year we converted 80% of the income to cash, exactly the same number as what we did last year. And so it's really... Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: As we have done for the last (38:58) Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, that's kind of our historical run rate. And then we ramp up from here. And so like I said, we all expect and you should expect us to meet or exceed the 100% target for the year. So nothing unusual really there. In terms of \u2013 so you asked reducing the overall debt, I mean we don't have any plans to change our current target leverage ratio. We're in that 2.2 times, 2.3 times range. That's, for us, the optimal structure at this point given how much cash this business model generates, how much cash we have on hand, net leverage is about 1.5 times. That is what really supports the overall Enterprise Strategy here from a capital allocation standpoint. So there are no plans to materially change our overall debt or leverage ratio target in the near term. Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Thanks guys. Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Just one more comment on the free cash flow. Our second and third quarters going back for a long, long time are higher overall revenue quarters than Qs one and four. So from the standpoint of the seasonal free cash flow, in the second quarter, we're funding additional working capital around those higher elevated seasonal sales to support Q2 and Q3. And then in Q1 and Q4, those numbers come back down. So we always are sort of negative to net income from a free cash flow standpoint in the first half of the year and positive in the second half of the year. And it's just the incremental delta on receivable and inventories to support the seasonal fluctuations in sales. Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is now open. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I think, Michael, you mentioned 3Q, the pickup in the midpoint is driven by the margin. And we don't have a huge amount of seasonal history with this new portfolio, so I'm wondering is that pickup driven by base cost reduction, i.e., initiatives? So is there some mix factor at play here? Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : No. There's probably a little bit of mix. We'll see how it plays out in the quarter. The bulk of the improvement here is driven again by the Enterprise Initiatives. So we will get 100 basis points from Enterprise Initiatives and then sequentially, like I said, revenues are about the same. Year-over-year, we expect revenues to be flat to 1%. And so again, the key driver here is really operating margins in the 22% range. And you know this, Nigel. If you go back historically, same as last year and the years before, the third quarter is usually our highest quarter in terms of operating margin. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah, it's a bit of a different mix too to a lot of (42:02) companies because of the shutdowns in the summer period tend to cause a little bit of operating deleverage. But I noticed last year we had the same dynamic. So I'm wondering with the new portfolio whether there's mix play. But it sounds like there's a bit of mix and a bit of operating cost reduction. And then the second is just what struck me was the geographic trends in international markets, Europe up 2% and Asia-Pac down 3%. And what really struck me was the Welding performance in EMEA, up 5%. So I'm wondering can you maybe just give a little bit of color in terms of what you're seeing in Welding Europe and how sustainable you think that is? Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, so I think Europe, we've talked about before, really for us as a company stabilized back in 2013, and we're quite encouraged by what we've seen and the 2% growth in the region. I think on the Welding side, this was a good quarter in Europe, which was really driven by a one-time order. We hope it's not one-time, but that's what we're hearing. So I wouldn't read too much into that in Europe. It wasn't a specific customer or specific country, so. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Well, thanks for the color. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Sir, your line is now open. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : So halfway through the Enterprise Strategy and, Scott, I recall that the big emphasis was there's going to be this pivot from two-thirds M&A and one-third organic to reverse that to two-thirds organic, one-third M&A. And my question is you really haven't seen M&A getting restarted, and Michael's comments on capital allocation, not one mention of M&A. And so at what point do you start to restart that M&A engine? Or do you want to recast a different percent of organic versus M&A? Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, I don't think \u2013 I think our intentions around this are pretty clear. We talked about it at the Investor Meeting in December in terms of first of all strategically where do we see M&A fitting in terms of the overall company's strategy. The simplified version of that is we would love to bolt great assets onto these seven great businesses that we have. The way I would describe it is we would be delighted to add a great company right now, and that's not new news. That's been true throughout. What I would say the difference is, is we're probably not as actively out in the prospecting mode around the opportunities to do that as we will be, as we get further down the Enterprise Strategy. But from the standpoint of, would we have appetite for a really good bolt-on acquisition tomorrow if we had one become available to us, absolutely we would. But the criteria is pretty strict, and it's pretty clear internally, what fits and what doesn't. Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : And I would just add, Deane, if you look at the transactions that have taken place in our space over the last couple of years, we've got a chance to see them all, and we don't feel like we've missed anything. And as Scott said, given the right set of circumstances, we'd love to bolt something on to one of our seven segments. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : So that two-thirds, one-third is still a healthy target? Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : All right. Good. And then second question would be maybe if you could provide some comments and specifics around that North American Construction number of 15%. A lot of people have been hoping, wishing that the non-res would start gaining traction. So how much of that is on the non-res side, how much is renovation, housing, and so forth? And what's the outlook? Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, so the big improvement, Deane, in the quarter was really on the renovation/remodeling side up \u2013 that drove the bulk of the increase, up 25%, that's what led to North America being up 15%. We did see some slight improvement in residential, up mid-single-digits. Last quarter, we talked about that part of the business being flat. And commercial was about the same, so up low-single-digits in commercial construction. Really the main driver renovation and remodeling, and we feel good about the current trends in the business. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Steven Fisher with UBS. Sir, your line is now open. Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. Good morning. Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC : This may just be rounding small numbers, but if I assume the midpoint of organic growth for Q3, it looks like you're anticipating a bit of acceleration in growth in Q4. Is that the way you're thinking about it? And if so, where might that acceleration come from? Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : It's really back, Steve, to the comps. And so Q3 last year was up 3.5%. Q4 was up a little less than 2.5%. And so it's really the way we model the guidance here is based on current run rates, adjusted for typical seasonality. And so that's really what's driving. It's not an acceleration in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter. It's really the comps year-over-year. Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. That's fine. And then just a follow up on Deane's question on Construction. I know you've been fairly cautious on Construction. Obviously this was your best quarter of growth in a long time. You talked about the North American trends. Is there anything in the business that's making you think just a little more optimistically about the business broadly? And then related to the European construction, you called out some softness in Continental Europe. Was that any particular market, France or Germany or anything else? Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, so on the latter point in Europe, the U.K. and Scandinavia continue to be very good, and then with some challenges in France and Southern Europe as you would expect. I think we feel very good, not just about the current kind of daily order rates in the business but just look at the margin performance and the improvements since we embarked on the Enterprise Strategy. So think about how much more is flowing through the bottom line, given all the work that's been done on the Enterprise Initiatives. And so I think the team has done a really nice job positioning this business for growth, and right now we're taking advantage of some lift seen (49:05) on the end markets and we feel good about the current trends and we'll see how it plays out. Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's feeling a little more like it has some legs than it has in the past, but I say that with a whole bunch of caution. I'm talking about, first of all, just North America, but we've been down this road before a number of times. So I think we'll want to see another quarter or two before we really see it, feel comfortable with the trajectory in terms of underlying end market demand. But it does seem to be a little bit more consistent at least over the next two months or three months than what we've seen historically. So we're hopeful but certainly not ready to call it yet. Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Sorry to harp on the Construction again, but just another follow up question because some other companies cited some weakness in the second quarter on the construction equipment side, in particular May, and it could have been energy, it could have been weather. But I guess within your North American Construction, was the strength that you saw in North America consistent throughout the quarter or was it more, I guess, June weighted? And then I guess my second question is back to sort of capital allocation. I know you've guided for share repurchase for $2 billion in the year, but you bought back $180 million of stock back in the quarter, which is the lowest number we've seen. Given the positive or improving free cash flow generation in the back half of the year and given that there doesn't seem to be a lot on the M&A side, is there upside to the $2 billion in share repurchase if the cash flow generation is there? And if not, what will the cash go towards? Thanks. Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, so let's start with the first question first. So in the second quarter, same as \u2013 and this is true for the enterprise \u2013 very consistent throughout the quarter by month. June was our best month, but it typically is in the quarter. And so I wouldn't read too much into an acceleration in the quarter because we certainly did not see that. This was out of the gate really good growth on the Construction side as we talked about. On capital allocation, as you know, we did $1.6 billion in the first quarter. We did $180 million here in the quarter, so we have a commitment to do approximately $2 billion for the year. Feel very good about that, and if the company continues to perform as well as it is and nothing is going to change in terms of our view longer term of what this Enterprise Strategy will do in terms of the overall financial performance of the company. And so given that and given the alternative of letting the cash sit on the balance sheet, we will repurchase shares as an alternative to that. Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): All righty. Thanks. I'll get back in queue. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ms. Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Ma'am, your line is now open. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Most of my questions have been answered, but maybe you could give us some insight into your forecast for automotive builds by region for the back half? Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, so we're still in the same kind of low-single-digit type global auto builds. I think there's some seasonality here in the third quarter and some discussion around whether there will be shutdowns or not, but I wouldn't really expect much of a change in the second half versus what we have seen in the first half. So overall kind of in that low-single-digit range, which is good enough for us to grow the business in the high-single digits and in some regions like Europe, if you look at flat auto builds, we are growing the business double digits. So that's kind of what \u2013 more of the same in the back half of the year. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. And then on the Food Equipment side, maybe some color on the segments, institutional versus fast casual versus other sectors. What are you seeing in the segment? Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I think institutional, fast casual, which is \u2013 institutional is about 40% of our business. It's still very good. The growth here is not really \u2013 the end markets are not growing at 4%. I mean the outperformance here, I just want to be clear, is really the focus by the team on driving organic growth and it's the new products that are being launched and the Service business side that is performing at a higher level than what we have seen historically. So that's how I would describe it. So that's kind of the landscape there. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And just one philosophical question. One of your competitors is very proud of the fact that they have hired a few ITW folks and that they're now going to become an 80/20 company. Could you just talk a little bit about the barriers to implementing 80/20? I mean, you are unique and you have been doing this for a long time. How easy or how difficult is it going to be for somebody to replicate 80/20? Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I don't know what they're going to do. All I can talk about is our company and we have been applying 80/20 for going back to the mid 1980s. It is something that continually evolves. I'm not sure who you're referring to, but in general, the way we practice it today is pretty unique, and it's very different than we practiced it two years ago even in terms of the way it continues to evolve inside our company. So I guess that's all I can say. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. I'll leave it there. Offline, I'll tell you who it is. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies. Sir, your line is now open. Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Good morning. Just one quick one. I thought the Welding margin was pretty impressive given the organic growth there, and I guess it sounds like, Scott, you're telling us that Welding isn't showing any signs of recovery. So can we assume that these margins can hold in Welding or was that one sort of special item, I think, Michael might have mentioned, did that have a margin impact? Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No. I think one of the things embedded in the 80/20 process and the way we run the company is we have a very flexible cost structure, and I think \u2013 I appreciate you actually pointing that out, because I think our Welding team has done a terrific job of certainly continuing to invest in their long-term growth potential while at the same time on a tactical basis doing some really nice work, minimizing the overall earnings and margin impact on this contraction in sales that they've been seeing over the last couple of quarters. So nothing special about it other than it is core to how we run the railroad here. Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC : Great. Appreciate it. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Eli Lustgarten with Longbow Securities. Sir, your line is now open. Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC : Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone. Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC : Most of the questions obviously have been asked at this point. Can we just step back a moment and see whether you have seen any noticeable change either in segments or regionally that you could identify for the second half of the year lookout (56:56)? I mean, you're pretty much saying everything will continue second half, first half, but is there anything noticeable? Second part to that, I'm sure this is probably because you're not big in Latin America, can you talk about your exposure there and what's going on down in that part of the world, which is (57:11)? Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, we didn't call out Latin America specifically this time. It's less than 3% of our sales. It's down about high-single digits, 9%. And then most of that is driven by as you might imagine the Welding in the oil and gas business in that area. In terms of the second half of the year, anything unusual by segment or geography, I can't really think of anything to be honest with you. I think the second half will look to some extent similar to the first half in terms of top-line growth and then continued progression on the margin front and strong cash flows. And I can't really think of anything that we're different. Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I was just going to add to that, just to reinforce what you said earlier and what we've talked about along is, we're not in the business of trying to forecast economically. So our forecast is basically taking the current run rate. It doesn't mean we're being pessimistic or optimistic. We'd love for things to get better. And when they do, we're in a position to react, but ultimately we have no crystal ball out there embedded in any of our numbers expecting things to go one way or the other. That doesn't mean that we have a particular view on that. It just means that the way we operate the company that there's really no advantage for us doing that. Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC : And as far as this whole chaos in Greece and what's happening on, you haven't seen any real dramatic effect on business conditions across the enterprise for you guys? Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No. Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : No. I think we continue \u2013 look at the performance of the company in Europe, and I think that answers the question. Still very good, so. Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. Thank you very much. Aaron H. Hoffman - Vice President, Investor Relations : And I think that takes us basically to the top of the hour. So that concludes our call. We appreciate everybody's time this morning, and we look forward to talking to you again in about three months. Great day. Operator : Thank you, sir. And that concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",

And now, I will hand the call over to Mr. Aaron Hoffman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Hoffman, you may begin. Aaron H. Hoffman - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Anna. Good morning and welcome to ITW's third quarter 2015 conference call. Joining me this morning are our CEO, Scott Santi; and our CFO, Michael Larsen. During today's call, we will discuss our third quarter financial results, and update you on our earnings forecast. Before we get to the results, let me remind you that this presentation contains our financial forecast for the 2015 fourth quarter and full year, as well as other forward-looking statements identified on this slide. We refer you to the company's 2014 Form 10-K and second quarter 2015 Form 10-Q for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Also, this presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott. Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Aaron and good morning. In Q3, ITW delivered another strong quarter of margin expansion and earnings per share growth. In the quarter, ITW achieved 9% earnings per share growth, operating margin of just under 23%, and after-tax return on invested capital of 21.5%. In addition, free cash flow in the quarter was very strong at 126% of net income. We were able to deliver these results despite the by now well known list of near-term headwinds confronting just about every U.S.-based industrial company : currency, sluggish business investment, and CapEx spending, the slowdown in China, et cetera. The key driver of our performance in the near term continues to be strong execution on the margin and return improvement focused elements of our Enterprise Strategy, which contributed to more than 100 basis points of margin expansion and 140 basis points of ROIC improvement in the quarter. Since we began implementing our current strategy a little over two and a half years ago, we have expanded operating margins by 570 basis points and after-tax return on invested capital by 540 basis points. As we look ahead to 2016 and beyond, activities across the company associated with our Business Structure Simplification initiative are tapering down with significant incremental benefits still to come. Strategic Sourcing is now fully embedded in our operations and is delivering consistent above-plan benefits, and we're in the final stages of the portfolio management component of our Enterprise Strategy as product line simplification activities will start to moderate in 2016. As a result, and as we planned, beginning in 2016 we will be well positioned to shift our focus increasingly toward leveraging our much more differentiated higher quality business portfolio for accelerated organic growth. Similar to the way we implemented these initiatives, we are in the early stages of applying a clearly defined and rigorous two-step growth framework to every one of our 84 (3:26) divisions that is designed to, first, prepare them for accelerated growth and, second, to have them deliver on it in a very focused 80/20-like way. Our Automotive OEM and Food Equipment segments are the farthest along in implementing this framework. Their success in accelerating organic growth through applying our growth framework is encouraging as we look to bring the rest of the company along over the next 12 months to 18 months. We will cover our growth framework and our transition to focus on growth in more detail at our Annual Investor Day in December. Despite the long list of near-term external challenges, we continue to focus on positioning the company to take full advantage of the performance potential that was (4:06) within our highly differentiated business model over the long term. To that end, we have invested approximately $420 million in our businesses thus far in 2015, as we add capital equipment to expand capacity, launch new products, and simplify our businesses in order to focus them on our largest and most compelling growth opportunities. ITW's business model is not capital intensive and, as a result, we have plenty of flexibility that allows us to both make significant investments in our businesses and return a meaningful share of our cash flow to our shareholders. In the third quarter, the board raised the dividend 13.4% and year-to-date we have now repurchased $2 billion of shares. As a reminder, we have more than $5 billion remaining on our share repo authorization. Moving forward, we will continue to be highly disciplined in our approach to allocating capital to both share repurchases and strategic acquisitions. As we move through the back-end of year three of our Enterprise Strategy, we've made substantial progress in executing our strategy to position ITW for solid organic growth with best-in-class margins and returns and we remain solidly on track to meet or exceed our 2017 performance goals. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Michael. Michael? Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everybody. As you saw this morning, ITW delivered another strong quarter. EPS was $1.39, an increase of 9% versus prior year, driven once again by strong execution on Enterprise Initiatives as Business Structure Simplification and Strategic Sourcing exceeded our expectations and contributed to record operating margin performance, and helped offset challenging end market conditions in some of our businesses. Operating margin improved 180 basis points to 22.7%, with 110 basis points of that improvement coming directly from our Enterprise Initiatives. Revenues were down 9%, primarily due to currency headwinds and a 1% decline in organic revenue. Keep in mind that, as expected, the organic decline includes 1 percentage point of PLS. As you may recall, we're comparing against a pretty good organic performance of plus 3.5% in the year ago quarter. When we look at our diverse business portfolio, it's a tale of two economies : industrial and consumer. We continue to see solid organic growth in our consumer-facing businesses, such as Automotive, Food Equipment, and parts of Specialty and Construction, which represents about 60% of our total revenues. In the quarter and year-to-date, these businesses are up 5% organically, so 60% of the company is growing at 5% in a tough environment. On the other hand, our industrial-facing businesses, like Welding, Test & Measurement/Electronics, declined in the high single digits organic. That said, we continue to invest in all of our businesses, including those that serve the industry (7:06) economy, as we're confident that the CapEx cycle will eventually turn in our favor. Strong cash generation is a hallmark of ITW and this quarter was no exception, with free cash flow of $644 million, 126% of net income. We expect a solid fourth quarter and remain firmly on track to meet or exceed our 100% cash conversion target for the year. Good progress on after-tax return on invested capital, now solidly above our long-term target of 20%-plus in the quarter and year-to-date. So in summary, with revenues down 9%, ITW delivered 9% EPS growth along with record operating margin performance, record ROIC and strong cash flows. And just as important, we fully expect this positive momentum from Enterprise Initiatives to continue to contribute about 100 basis points of margin expansion going forward, including in 2016 and 2017, independent of volume growth. Needless to say, this positions ITW very well in the current environment and gives us confidence in meeting or exceeding our 2017 performance goals. Revenue by geography on page five reflects the environment we just talked about. North America was down 2% as declines in Test & Measurement/Electronics and Welding offset strength in Construction, up 7%; Food Equipment, up 6%; and Automotive, up 5%. EMEA was down 1% despite another strong double-digit performance by the Automotive team. Asia Pacific was down 4%, as China, which is less than 5% of revenues, was down 8% this quarter. Declines in Welding, Test & Measurement/Electronics and Automotive were partially offset by solid growth in Construction products. Finally, South America was down 4%, as Brazil, which represents about 2% of total ITW sales, declined 7%. Our emerging market exposure is fairly limited, and while the environment globally is a little more challenging, ITW is well positioned to offset end market conditions with strong margin performance, as you will see on the next page. On page six, operating margin is once again the highlight of the quarter with 22.7% being an all time high for the company. Margin performance was strong across the board, that's four segments improved by 200 basis points or more. Construction was up 420 basis points; Food Equipment, up 320 basis points; Specialty Product, up 270 basis points; and Automotive up 200 basis points. Volume declines in Test & Measurement/Electronics, Welding and Polymers & Fluids led to lower operating margin in those three segments on a year-over-year basis. That said, these businesses are still operating at best in class margins, particularly Welding, which maintained 25% operating margin in the face of significant volume declines. On the right side of the page, the number one driver of margin expansion this quarter was once again Enterprise Initiatives contributing 110 basis points, slightly better than expected. Price/cost was favorable, 20 basis points, and lower restructuring versus prior year drove 70 basis points of the 90 basis points in the other category. As Scott mentioned, the restructuring costs associated with Business Structure Simplification are starting to moderate, and we expect to spend $60 million to $70 million on restructuring this year. So overall, very good progress on sustainable margin improvement so far, and clear line of sight to further incremental margin opportunities going forward. Turning to page seven, on the left side, you can see the operating margin by segment on a year-to-date basis, with 150 basis points of sustainable margin improvement so far this year. For some additional color by segment, let's start with Automotive OEM which had another strong quarter as organic revenue was up 5% on worldwide auto builds that were flat. Europe continued to outperform auto builds with double-digit revenue growth. North America was up 5%, in line with auto builds, but excluding PLS, this region would have outperformed auto builds by approximately 300 basis points. As expected, China was down 5%, as global automotive manufacturers, where ITW has higher content, declined 15%, significantly more than domestic Chinese manufacturers. This implies about 500 basis points of penetration gains, very much in line with our past performance. And operating margin was 25.4%, an increase of 200 basis points. In our Test & Measurement/Electronics segment, organic revenue declined 11% in the quarter in a challenging demand environment for capital equipment and in the face of a good year ago quarter, above 5%. Lower volume caused operating margin for the segment to decrease 210 basis points to 16.6% in the quarter. Adding back the non-cash charges from the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, operating margin is above 20%. Food Equipment, also had a good year ago quarter, but organic growth was still up 3%, as North America led the way with equipment up 8% and service up 4%. The team continues to do a very good job achieving above market growth across the portfolio through customer backed innovation. Internationally, equipment revenue was down 1%, compared to strong 8% growth in the year ago quarter. And record operating margin of 26.3% was up 320 basis points. Polymers & Fluids on page nine was down 3%, with polymers down 8% partly due to a decline in the European offshore wind business. Fluids down 4% due to weak industrial MRO trends, while automotive aftermarket, which is more oriented towards the consumer, was a bright spot of 2% due to successful new product launches. As discussed earlier, a tough quarter on the top line in Welding, down 10% organically, compared to a strong quarter, up 5% in the year ago. Weakness in North America, which represents about 75% of the segment's revenues was broad based, and organic revenue was down 8%. International was down 17%, primarily due to oil and gas and PLS of low margin business in Europe. As you can see from the margin performance, the team continues to do a very good job maintaining best in class margins supported by the 80/20 focus on highly differentiated equipment, which represents approximately two-thirds of the business. On slide 10, Construction Products had another good quarter on the top line with organic revenue growth of 4%. North America, which is about 40% of this segment, was up 7%, due to continued positive momentum in the renovation/remodel hard and, to some extent, commercial. Europe was down 2% as we continue to focus on PLS and restructuring, activities that in the near term position the business for accelerated organic revenue growth with much improved margin performance. Asia Pacific increased 5%, with strong performance once again in Australia. Operating margin came in at a record 23.1%, an impressive 420 basis points of improvement. In Specialty Products, organic revenue was flat with growth in consumer packaging offset by PLS. North America was flat and international was down 1%. And operating margin improved significantly by 270 basis points to 24%. On page 11, let's turn to the guidance. And we've updated the organic outlook for the demand levels that we're seeing in our businesses today. And as a result, we expect the year to be flat to down 1%. Due to the reduced revenue assumption, we're lowering our full year EPS guidance by 1%, or $0.05 at the midpoint, to $5.05 to $5.15, which is 9% year-over-year growth at the midpoint despite the long list of external headwinds we talked about earlier. We also expect record operating margin of 21%-plus, and record after-tax ROIC of 20%-plus. Turning to the fourth quarter, our EPS guidance is in the range of $1.15 to $1.25, which includes $0.08 of negative currency impact. We also saw some (15:29) last year that we don't expect to repeat this year. Based again on current levels of demand, we expect organic revenue growth to be down 1% to 2%. We're confident that the positive momentum on our Enterprise Strategy and our proven operational capabilities position the company for continued strong performance. In fact, looking forward, we have good visibility to a significant portion of our total shareholder return target of 12% to 14%. With about 100 basis points of margin improvement from Enterprise Initiatives in each 2016 and again in 2017, along with disciplined cap allocation behind an attractive dividend and buyback and/or acquisitions, we are more than halfway to our target without the benefit of organic growth. With that, let me turn it back over to Aaron. Aaron H. Hoffman - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Michael. We'll now open the call to your questions. Please be brief so as to allow more people the opportunity to ask a question. And also please remember, one question and one follow-up question only. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. Our first question will be coming from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. (16:55) your line is open. Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Morning. Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, Michael, I like the way you broke out your business, and that 60% of your business was growing at about 5%, and 40% of your business was down about 10%. And clearly from an underlying market standpoint, you guys expect the negative 1% to negative 2% trends to continue. But if we get into 2016 and underlying trends continue to deteriorate, say, your business is down 2% to 3%, can you continue to get 100 basis points in Enterprise Initiatives in 2016? Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, so I think, Joe. So we're not going to get real specific in terms of guidance for 2016 as you would expect. The 100 basis points of margin improvement from Enterprise Initiatives is really independent of volume, so we would expect to get that even if revenues continue to be down in the 2% to 3% range. And I think you saw again this quarter that the decremental margins, which you would apply to those 2% to 3% revenue were once again really good in the quarter in that 30% range, so that's how I would think about it in the scenario you just laid out. Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Now, that's helpful. And I guess maybe just a follow-on question, digging into one of the segments. Auto OEM for example was still really strong this quarter, but also noticed that the outgrowth in builds in North America and China didn't happen as we've seen in prior quarters. Was there any noise in the quarter that maybe drove the outgrowth lower? Or does your view on outgrowth in Auto change at all longer term? Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : No, Joe, our view hasn't changed. I mean, historically, we've outperformed auto build to the tune to 400 basis points to 500 basis points, which we did again at the global level. What you're not seeing in the numbers in North America is that we actually have 300 basis points of product line simplification, so this is revenue that came out. If you add that back in, we outperformed auto builds by 300 basis points in North America. In China, what you're seeing is that about two-thirds of our business in China is with the global auto OEMs, and that's where we have significantly higher content. And their builds were down about 15% in the quarter, but our business was only down 5%. And so we continued to outperform to the tune of about 500 basis points in terms of continued penetration gains in the quarter. Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, and what I would add in terms of just additional color on China is that given the sort of slowdown on build rates, what you see in the quarter is, as the OEMs lower order rates, you see a bit of a elevated level of the brakes coming on, which is sort of flowing through the supply lines and people adjusting to the lower build rate. So all in all, we were pretty happy with how we tracked in auto in the quarter in China, given all that was going on over there. Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. That makes sense. If I could maybe sneak one more in. Scott, just a broader question on... Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: The backdrop just getting a little bit worse here and clearly the next step of the story for ITW is really kind of positioning the portfolio for growth. And so, any additional color that you can give us on the two-step program and your ability to really, from a timing standpoint, start to see some growth in your portfolio in light of a pretty tough economic backdrop? Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, we will spend some more time on that in December, as we talked about, but I think in general, I actually feel really good about \u2013 Michael talked about we have 60% of the company, net of the PLS, is growing 5% this year-to-date, and it's a combination of starting to do the kind of work we're talking about. So, I think it's a real mixed bag, as you look at the diversity of the portfolio right now, primarily because of some real pressure on the CapEx side in Welding and Test & Measurement. I think if you sort of net that away, we're actually throwing up some pretty good progress in terms of organic in the other parts of the company. I think if \u2013 with a view that says oil and gas is probably not going to get a lot worse and may not recover for a while, but the negative goes away next year, we just hold those businesses where we are and we get the rest of the portfolio to continue to grow at the rates we're growing at, it may be accelerating a little bit. I think we're set up to certainly generate some incremental improvement next year. Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : And I would just add, Joe, that the other thing, and Scott talked about this, that we expect our product line simplification activities to moderate, really beginning in 2016. And so, that reduced organic growth rate by 1 percentage point and that will be less of a headwind on organic growth next year. Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, great. Thanks, guys. I'll get back in queue. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Scott, you touched on this in your prepared remarks, but maybe if you can give us a bit more color on these industrial headwinds. And ITW is so broad-based, you do see so many different end markets. People are calling this an industrial recession. You wouldn't see it in your margins, but just in terms of the key verticals, any changes in customer behavior or project pushouts? It would be interesting how you are characterizing the slowdown. Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I actually think \u2013 going back to earlier in the year, I think the underlying demand trends have been pretty steady \u2013 had been down, so again, we're talking about \u2013 in oil and gas piece of it, we're talking about more broadly from the standpoint of what we're experiencing, a slowdown in CapEx investment, generally. I think currency has a lot to do with that, at least in North America. We haven't seen a lot of, let's say, things getting a lot worse over the last two quarters, two and a half quarters. I think things are sort of holding where they are at the bottom. They're certainly down a significant degree. Some of the change in the relative performance is a function more of the comps. We actually had two pretty strong quarters in those businesses in Q3 and (23:31). So we're not seeing a lot of what I would describe as further erosion, but a lot of sluggishness on the CapEx side. Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, I would just add if you look at the revenue numbers and the double-digit declines in Welding and Test & Measurement/Electronics this quarter, I mean, that is typically what we would expect to see in a recessionary environment. So I would just say what Scott said, it's hard to see that we continue to deteriorate much further from where we are right now. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : All right. And then, just to switch gears over on the Construction Products side, and again I will always use your data points and weigh those higher than I would, let's say the ABI [Architecture Billings Index], which was back up over 50, how are you characterizing your opportunities across non-res today? And then, I just have to call out those are very impressive margins for this quarter in that segment. Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, thank you. I mean, I think the Construction team has been working for the last two and a half years on implementing BSS in Sourcing and you're seeing some terrific progress. If you had told that team two years ago margins are going to be solidly in the low to mid 20%s, I think everybody would have signed up for those types of margins. So just on Construction, specifically, what you saw in the quarter, North America, up 7%, really led by renovation/remodel, up double-digit. So again, back to the consumer-oriented, consumer-facing businesses, residential was flat to down slightly in the quarter, and commercial was up slightly; but really the big driver here was on the renovation and remodel side. And just quickly globally, Europe, the focus there is still very much on restructuring; so quite a bit of PLS, again, in the quarter. France was actually positive. You don't hear those two words combined too often, France and growth; but France was positive. And then, in Asia Pacific, Australia, another really solid performance, up 5% in the Construction business. Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: But non-res overall, flat to a little bit better (25:54). Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. Correct. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Mig Dobre of R.W. Baird. Sir, your line is open. Mig Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey, good morning, everyone. Quick question on margin, and I think someone tried to get at this earlier as well. Pretty impressive performance, but what I'm kind of looking is to where margins are expanding, they're in really the segments with pretty strong end markets : Automotive, Food Equipment, Construction, et cetera. As we look forward, what sort of needs to happen in terms of your own internal action in order to drive margin expansion in some of the segments that have been lagging? Are we sort of reliant, still, on these segments that have been driving margin expansion to continue that process into 2016, or can we actually see some of these other segments work as well? Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : I think, Mig, if you go back to the last earnings call, I think we showed the progress on margins since we started the Enterprise Strategy, and there really are no laggards here. I mean, we've made substantial improvement across all of our businesses. What you saw this quarter was a little bit of an anomaly with some volume pressure leading to lower margins in three of our businesses. But if you look at \u2013 underlying that, there's still 100 basis points of margin expansion from the kind of the self-help from the Enterprise Initiatives in those businesses. And we would expect that to continue. Obviously, volume helps, but we're not counting on it and we feel good about still having another 100 basis points of margin expansion across the company in 2016 and 2017. And I'll just point out, this quarter, 180 basis points of margin expansion with more than half, 110 basis points of that, coming from things that are largely within our own control. So we would expect all of our businesses, Mig, to continue to make progress over the next two years here, just the way we had planned it out when we embarked on the Enterprise Strategy three years ago. Mig Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. I appreciate that. And then, maybe sticking with Welding, going to your North American commentary, mentioning broad weakness there. I guess I'm trying to maybe get better clarity in terms of what you're seeing by end market, and also potentially, the cadence, if you can comment on that, in terms of demand or orders through the quarter. Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, so Mig, nothing unusual in terms of the cadence through the quarter. So we didn't see trends deteriorate or improve. I think if you look at Welding down 10% in the quarter, about half of that decline came from oil and gas. About 4 points of that came from the industrial side, so that's where you'll pick up heavy equipment, some of the mining, agriculture. And then the commercial business actually held in there, down 1 percentage point out of the 10%. So nothing surprising and very consistent with what you're hearing across the board. I will just point out that \u2013 and I made the point in the script, that two-thirds of our business is equipment, because that's where 80/20 will tell you, that's where the margins are. It's a much more differentiated product. And so when you are in this part of the CapEx cycle, you will see, at least in the near term, some larger declines on the equipment side than on the consumable side. But I think if you look then at the margin performance of Welding again, in the quarter and year-to-date, it really shows why we're focused on the equipment side. But you will see some different growth trends in consumables versus the equipment side. So I just wanted to point that out. Mig Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Sure. Is there any way you can comment on consumables specifically in terms of volumes there? Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So, it's about a third of the business and consumables were flat in North America, down slightly outside of the U.S. and Asia Pacific and Europe. Mig Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): I appreciate it. Thank you and good luck. Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. You may proceed. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning. And Scott, I think you put it quite well when you mentioned two-speed economy, consumer versus industrial. But I thought your comments about relatively steady trends was interesting, because given that it looked like broader industrial activity stepped down in September versus the trend line for the quarter. So I'm wondering, did you see a significantly weaker September versus what you normally see? And perhaps you could make some comments on what you're seeing so far in October. Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, we did not see any change in order rates in September relative to the overall quarter, and October it's a little too early to tell. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Fair enough. Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Haven't heard anything. If there was something major going on already, we'd have heard about it, but... Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, that's... Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: (31:18) this early in the quarter. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah, sure. I understand that. But it just seems that the trend you're referring to is a little bit different to what we're hearing elsewhere, but understand that. And then, on, obviously, very strong margin, in light of the volumes, so congratulations on that. Just maybe, Michael, on the SG&A. SG&A stepped down quite a bit from 2Q to 3Q, so I'm wondering was there something that drove that? Is that just Enterprise Initiatives kicking in or is there some elements of discretionary savings in this quarter? Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : It's really all of the above. A big part of it is currency, but also a continued impact from Enterprise Initiatives and then just discretionary cost management are the main drivers here. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. I'll leave it there. Thanks, guys. Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Joel Tiss from BMO. You may proceed. Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi, guys, how is it going? Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Morning. Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Good. Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Just two ones quick. I wonder, is less PLS, going forward, is that going to stunt the rate of margin improvement a little bit? Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No. Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Unanimous. No, I mean, I think PLS certainly has contributed in terms of improving the margins of the portfolio... Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: But less in terms of the cost takeout that we get... Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yes. Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: By taking these lower profit product lines. Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Right, right. Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : And we take out the lower margin product lines and all the costs associated with that, so it helped. but as PLS moderates, it doesn't impact margins in a significant way. Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States): And then I guess as you get more organic growth, the incremental margins on that are much higher than other businesses? Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yes, that's correct. Yes. Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Can you also give us a quick comment if you're seeing acquisition prices, are they starting to improve? Is that setting up over the next couple of years to be a more attractive use of capital? Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : I don't know if I could say, Joel, that things have changed in terms of pricing. If I can just make a broader comment on capital allocation, I think as you saw this quarter, this business model generates a significant amount of free cash flow and we have a strong balance sheet and we continue to be very disciplined. Our priority number one is invest in our businesses for growth and productivity, and we're doing that in a significant way. We raised \u2013 the board raised the dividend, 13% this quarter and then the balance, which is a significant number, is available for external investments, acquisitions, and/or share repurchases. And our view of acquisitions has not changed from what we laid out at the investor day a year ago. They still play an important role. I would just make a comment that we're looking at a number of things, nothing imminent on the acquisition front and we'll continue to keep you posted on that as we go forward. Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States): All right. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Andy Casey from Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks a lot. Good morning, everybody. Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Morning. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : First on price/cost, it was in line with your expectations. I'm just wondering within that, is it really as stable as it seems or did you see some price erosion that was offset by lower costs? Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : No, I think, Andy, it really is in terms of our ability to maintain and get price, nothing has changed. I think on the cost side, we're starting to see a little bit of favorability on the material costs side, as well as in resins and in metals. And some of that gets passed on to the customer, but some of that is flowing through. And we've been very steady in terms of 20 basis points, I think, every quarter this year, and we would expect to be able to maintain that going forward. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks a lot, Michael. And then I'd like to ask a little bit of a bigger-picture question here. Welding operating margin performance, even though it's stepped down a little bit on steeper organic decline, it's holding up pretty well. Does that give you any increased confidence that maybe the margin performance for overall ITW might be a little more resilient in the next recession than what occurred in the 2008-2009 with the 400 basis point drop (36:09)? Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, definitely. I mean I think you look at the decremental margins in some of our businesses that were down this quarter, and the really strong performance out of Welding, I think that suggests that as we go through this Enterprise Strategy, we have a really high-quality, highly differentiated, diverse business portfolio, and I would argue we are as well positioned if not better than ever before in the event of a more significant downturn or even a recession. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. I'll pass it on. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. You may proceed. Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi, good morning. Two questions. One on the material cost, back to that, I know you had the 20 bps tailwind which was what you expected, but the price/cost, was it more pronounced, the benefit, was that equally spread across the different segments, or was a couple of the segments more pronounced? Because I look at some of your margins in some of your businesses and they're just like Food having a 26% and change margin. That's just, relative to your peers, it's impressive. And then I guess my second question is more bigger picture, again, you talked about your mix between consumer and industrial, 60%/40%. I guess when you're evaluating acquisitions right now, do you sort of think the consumer/industrial mix is the right mix? And also in your evaluating acquisitions, is there any appetite for acquiring businesses with more of a recurring earning stream, or longer cycle type businesses? Thanks. Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yes, so why don't I do the price/cost and maybe Scott, if you want to comment on the M&A question. I think what we're seeing including in Food Equipment, that a big driver of price here is the ability to launch new products that solve some challenging problems for some pretty sophisticated customers, and I think you're seeing that certainly in Food Equipment. You're seeing it in Welding, you're seeing it in Automotive across the portfolio. So that's really more a driver than anything else. I'd say across the portfolio, really good performance from a price standpoint, and nothing unusual in the quarter. And then maybe, Scott, on the M&A side. Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I think the question relates again to our thinking around portfolio construction. I think the way we think about it is our most important job is to make great choices about owning and investing in businesses where this business model has great potential to generate long-term, sustainable competitive advantage, so we're not trying to think a lot harder beyond that. We own great businesses that really fit our business model. We generate great margins, great returns on capital. Those businesses then, based on the margin profile, are very resilient when they're under pressure. So, we have no targets in terms of industrial versus consumer. The 60/40 mix is today a function of the seven businesses that we obviously went through a very rigorous portfolio review, concluded that those seven are great fits with the portfolio strategy that I just talked about, it's 60/40 today in some respects, because of the declines in those industrial businesses, so that mix is probably more like 50/50 when it's normalized, but that's more a byproduct of the decision-making process than necessarily any specific target. So we're well balanced. I think if you look at the resilience in terms of the overall company and we're still growing earnings through a time when there's some real challenges and pressures out there. So there's some real strength in having the ability to select from a number of different industries that have different attributes. And then on the recurring revenue, I think we're very comfortable in businesses where we have great recurring revenues with the Food Equipment with service and equipment, but we also have other businesses where we're largely playing one side or the other. Automotive is an all consumable business. I think again, it goes back from our standpoint to the margin profile and how differentiated those businesses are, how well they fit our business model. And we have no sort of requirement around trying to mix recurring versus nonrecurring as much. So we want to be in industries where the products we make really do something meaningful for the customer and are areas where we can really do something unique and special for those customers. Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, thanks. I appreciate the color. Congrats on a nice quarter. Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Ann Duignan of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, guys, good morning. Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Morning. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Most of my questions have been answered, but I just wanted to ask you on the Automotive business, your European exposure. Can you talk about who your largest OEMs are there? And do you have any exposure to VW? And what's your outlook or your assessment of what might happen in the automotive sector in Europe going forward? Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, they are \u2013 VW's a customer. It's a nice relationship. It is not a dominant relationship by any stretch, and any share loss there. We're pretty broad based among all the globals, so to the extent they have run into some \u2013 there's some things that happened as a result of what's going on right now, we're certainly well positioned to the extent other OEMs pick up any share that they lose. I think we're pretty agnostic, overall. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then, can you just talk a little bit about Welding and Test & Measurement, your long-term growth targets for those businesses? Are those under review right now? Are you still confident that you can grow those businesses as you thought you could two years or three years ago? Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I think we still like the fundamentals a lot. We've talked about Welding in the past. That's a business that we've grown at right around 9% organic compounded since the early 1990s when we got into the business, and whether from here forward that's 7% instead of 9%, we'll see as we go forward; but I think we have a lot of conviction in the fundamentals there. And likewise on Test & Measurement, there's some positions we have there that are really tied to global manufacturing \u2013 in quality in global manufacturing that on a long-term basis we still believe very much have the potential to generate organic growth at or above the overall Enterprise target. So I think we're still very bullish on the long-term prospects in both. I think this currency \u2013 this short-term change in relative currency rates, as you would expect it, to the extent you're a U.S. manufacturer exporting any meaningful percentage of your output from your plant, either that's gone to Europe or you're worried about it going to Europe. So I think there's a lot of sort of logic around the fact that the spending environment right now is very sluggish. And I think, frankly, on the European side, there's enough surplus capacity over there where you're not seeing that investment pick up, yet, given the kind of recessionary environment they've been in for the last two years or three years. So all that will shake out over the next 12 months or 18 months, and I think we'll be certainly seeing much better performance from those two businesses. Both are \u2013 look at the margin profiles. You can barely differentiate it; great niches in great industries. So we'd love for them to be doing better right now, but we're certainly not any less enthusiastic about their fit and their ability to perform for us at a high level long term. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. I appreciate it. I will turn it over. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of David Raso of Evercore ISI. David Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities : Hi, good morning. Operator : Your line is open. David Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities : Thank you. Just a quick question, trying to think of the parameters around the balance sheet usage in cash flow; obviously been drawing down the shareholder equity a lot the last couple years. It's been cut in half. The net debt is obviously up a bit as well. So I look at net debt to capital of 37%, but that said, your net debt to EBITDA \u2013 trailing EBITDA is only 1.4. When we think about use of balance sheet, maybe even above and beyond, obviously, just using the cash flow, what are the parameters we should be thinking about where you start to get a little uncomfortable with the leverage, either be it debt to cap or trailing EBITDA? Just give us some views around cash flow (45:23) Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, I think, Steve (sic) [Dave], I'll go back to what we said earlier is that, as you pointed out, this is a company and a business model that generates a lot of cash. I think we are very comfortable with our current leverage at 2.3 times debt to EBITDA. It supports a really strong top-tier credit rating; gives us access to credit at very favorable terms under current conditions. And it still gives us some flexibility in terms of being opportunistic around the things we talked about, which is M&A as well as share repurchases, which obviously we've leaned in to quite a bit, as you mentioned. So I think we're certainly not nervous when we run these scenarios in terms of what a recession might look like and the performance of the company. As you know, we generate even more cash flow in a downturn, and so we feel very good about where we're at in any scenario here with our current capital structure. And going forward, as we said earlier, we'll continue to be very disciplined in terms of capital allocation. David Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities : I guess more pointed, though, I'm not necessarily even looking at the downside scenario. I'm just thinking if you're looking to utilize the balance sheet, maybe add a layer to the story here that 2017 on the margin improvement isn't that far away now, right? So (46:51)... Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, okay. I mean, I think, as you see \u2013 what will certainly happen, if you look at our overall debt levels will continue to go up as our EBITDA grows, right, if that's what you're trying to get at. And so, we're very comfortable with that and at this point we don't have any plans to, here in the third quarter, change the way we think about our capital structure and that we're comfortable with the leverage we have on a gross and on a net basis. And we review it frequently and, if things change, we'll certainly keep you updated on that; but for now, I wouldn't expect any significant changes. David Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities : So just think of it as \u2013 and you were using total debt, I was using net debt, but the idea's whatever leverage you have now, just think of that as how you'll look to run the business over the next 12 months to 18 months? Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, I think that's a good way to think about it. Yes. David Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities : That's helpful. Thank you. Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Mr. Steven Fisher of UBS. Your line is open. Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. Good morning. Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Morning. Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC : Scott and Michael, you both mentioned that you're on track to hit your 2017 performance goals. Should we assume that that still includes 200 basis points of organic growth above global GDP? And if so, how much of that outgrowth do you expect to come from your end markets growing faster than GDP versus your internal initiatives? Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, the answer to the first part is yes, and the answer to the second part is it's our business is outgrowing their underlying markets. So we've got, in the markets that we are operating in across all seven of our businesses, in every case, we think the fundamentals in terms of are they at least GDP growers at the market level? Absolutely. Some will certainly grow faster than others. But the real work is on the positioning that we've been doing the last couple of years to get in front of the highly differentiated pieces of these larger global end markets and position ourselves to really leverage these highly differentiated positions with additional penetration. So Auto's a good example, Food Equipment's a good example and also crank up the new product pipeline, which is what we've been in the process of doing for the last 12 months or 18 months. So we're going to generate that result more from us growing faster than the underlying markets that we're in, if that \u2013 hopefully I'm saying that clearly \u2013 than we're trying to pick markets that we think are going to grow faster than GDP. Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah. I was just trying to get a sense of whether you're assuming that you have some sort of confidence that your markets are not going to be declining, that they'll maybe be at least kind of flat; because I would expect (49:45)... Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I think that was a big part of our portfolio review going back to the beginning of this Enterprise Strategy is we wanted to be in \u2013 we didn't want to certainly be investing in markets where there was just fundamental pressure in terms of shrinking \u2013 pressures on the underlying markets. And I think across all seven businesses, we feel really good that we're in industries that have certainly some really solid long-term support in terms of growth rates of at least GDP. Some of them may be a little bit better over time. And then our job is to grow faster than the underlying market growth rates. Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, that's helpful. And then North America has slipped into a decline year-over-year, as you mentioned, due to the industrial side. What indications or signals do you receive from your businesses about the direction of North American demand broadly? I mean, should we be assuming that the industrial side and maybe some tougher comparisons are going to keep North America in negative territory for a few quarters or can that flip back around? Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I don't think so. I think ultimately right now, we're going through the year-on-year comps, the underlying demand rates, if you break it down to kind of daily average order rates, even in the industrial businesses have been relatively steady now for two and a half quarters. So I think, at a minimum, we take \u2013 next year, we take the negative away of the contraction. We're not necessarily seeing anything yet that's saying it's going to start to turn the other way. But certainly the declines this year, and Michael talked about even we're running into some comps in the Q3 and Q4 where we actually had pretty good performance in those businesses last year on a relative basis, that is on a year-on-year percentage comparison probably making it look like it's getting worse, but underlying the demand has been pretty flat. So I think things seem to be holding pretty steady right now, and as we move into next year, the comp issue goes away and if nothing else, if we're flat instead of down 10% in the industrials, obviously that's a net positive and we keep the commercial side going. There's another, as Michael said earlier, 60% of the company growing at right around 5% gross. And then we get at least 0.5 point pickup from the decline in product line simplification. So I think if things hold where they are, we're in a pretty good spot to start to see some positive movement on the top line next year, organically. Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Very helpful. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Walter Liptak of Seaport Global. Your line is open. Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC : Hi. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. My question is in Test & Measurement. I think in your presentation, you called out the purchase accounting charges. I wonder if you can help us quantify those. And do you see any of those recurring in the fourth quarter? Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We had a bit of an industrial accident. Could you repeat the \u2013 we missed the second half of your question. Sorry. Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC : Okay. Yeah. Do you have purchase accounting charges in Test & Measurement? How much were they this quarter, specifically, and next quarter do we get (53:10)? Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah so I think if you go to, well, the last page, the appendix page in the earnings slides, you'll see that we lay it out for each one of our seven businesses, and also at the total ITW level. And so you can see there, Test & Measurement/Electronics, 410 basis points, and then the other significant one due to recent acquisitions is Polymers & Fluids. So if you add that back, that's 490 basis points. And at the ITW level, there's 180 basis points here of non-cash charges included in the operating margin of 22.7%. Over time, as we amortize the intangibles, that will go down. Q4 will be a lot like Q3, but over time, over a longer period of time, you would expect that impact to continue to go down, as it has done this year. So that's a good way of looking at it. Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC : Okay. Okay, great. And then sticking with Test & Measurement, you mentioned that these businesses were part of a global capital spending cycle. I wonder if you could tell us where you think we are? Are we bottoming out now? Or is it similar to some of the other industrial, where \u2013 that you should be steady and easier comps as we head to 2016? Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, I think Scott gave you kind of the broader view of that. I would just \u2013 tying it back to the guidance, I mean, as you know, we assume current demand levels with some adjustment for seasonality, so we're not expecting, in the near term, a pickup in the CapEx cycle. On the other hand, we're also not expecting it to further deteriorate, from \u2013 when we look at current revenue per day inside these businesses, that's what we're using to project forward, so hopefully that answers your question. Now, I will just make the point that since you asked about Test & Measurement, that business was up 5% in the year ago quarter, and the comparisons get a lot easier here in the fourth quarter, so you wouldn't expect as steep a decline in Q4 as you saw in the third quarter for Test & Measurement and Electronics. Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Eli Lustgarten of Longbow. Your line is open. Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC : Thank you very much. A quick question on the guidance change. Can you indicate, when you took down the top line and the earnings of where it's impacting the numbers, I mean can you give an idea what changed to cause you to take down the guidance fourth quarter? I know it's a current business run that's going on, but can you give us some indication of what across the board changed? Or anything specific cause the change? And whether \u2013 if it continues into the first half, are we going to be talking 2016, first half \u2013 second half comparison to the first half will be continuing a weaker run rate and then have some improvements as the comparisons get easier? Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, so the guidance change for Q4 is pretty straightforward. So it's basically when we update the revenue for the current demand levels, that leads to a lower revenue number, and applying a decremental margin to those revenues leads to $0.08 of EPS impact, and so if you look at the... Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC : Where is that? I understand the current run rate, but is that broad based across all the businesses or is there something specific that changed that causes the reduction? Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : No, that's broad based across the business. Every business we look at it the same way and then at the enterprise level, it adds up to a lower organic growth rate, and then with the decremental margin on that, that's the $0.08. So that's really the only change here. As you'll see, currency gets a little bit easier here in Q4 and then hopefully next year, we won't have as much headwind on currency next year. Certainly at current rates, that's the case, and so that will help out next year. But again, we're not ready to talk about demand in 2016 and organic growth in 2016 yet. We'll have to save that for our Analyst Day in December. Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC : I guess what I'm looking at, if you're adjusting the things downward in the fourth quarter, I mean, it's unlikely to have much of a change, at least in the first part of 2016. So I mean the emphasis of growth has to be back-end loaded. That's really what I'm asking for next year. Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Not necessarily. Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC : All right. I look forward to December 4. Anyway, thank you. Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : All right, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Joe O'Dea with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open. Joe J. O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Hi, good morning. First, just on inventory conditions through the channel and general assessment on kind of how lean those inventories may be and whether or not, as destock has been an issue over the course of the year, whether you see that starting to ease or you have line of sight into when that eases. Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, in the business where we go through distribution, we don't have a really good handle on inventory levels across our very fragmented customer base, and so I don't think I have a good answer for you on that one. Joe J. O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. And then maybe I guess shifting over and as you talk about the business on the industrial side and the consumer side, if you can talk about price trends within those kind of two splits of the business. And whether or not maybe the consumer side in holding up, you've seen some pricing there that's been (59:23) offsetting any recent pressure on the industrial side. Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, there's really no significant difference. I mean, again back to what I said earlier with \u2013 the big driver of price here is new products that get launched that solve some pretty challenging problems for sophisticated customers, and then you see that \u2013 Food Equipment's a good example and Automotive and others. That's really the main driver of price here. And it's very similar trends across industrial-facing and consumer-facing businesses as we sit here today. Joe J. O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. Thanks very much. Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Sure. Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Aaron H. Hoffman - Vice President- Investor Relations : Great. And that concludes our time right at the top of the hour today. Thanks everyone for joining us. And we'll look forward to talking to you all real soon. Have a great day. Operator : That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating.

Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC Operator : Welcome and thank you all for standing by. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Questions will be taken at the end of the presentation. Today's conference call is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. And now I will hand the call over to Aaron Hoffman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Hoffman, you may begin. Aaron H. Hoffman - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Anna, and good morning and welcome to ITW's fourth quarter 2015 conference call. Joining me this morning are our CEO, Scott Santi; and our CFO, Michael Larsen. During today's call, we will discuss our fourth quarter and full-year 2015 financial results, update you on our 2016 earnings forecast and discuss the acquisition that we announced on Monday. Before we get to the results, let me remind you that this presentation contains our financial forecast for the 2016 first quarter and full-year, as well as other forward-looking statements identified on this slide. We refer you to the company's 2014 Form 10-K and third quarter 2015 Form 10-Q for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Also, this presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release. With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott. Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Aaron, and good morning. Overall, we were pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter and for the full-year as we continued to execute on our Enterprise Strategy and deliver strong results in a challenging but stable environment. In 2015, ITW grew earnings per share 10%, expanded operating margins by 150 basis points to a record of 21.4% and improved after-tax return on invested capital by 140 basis points to a record 20.4%. Free cash flow was strong in 2015 at a 106% of net income, and we invested roughly $560 million in our businesses for growth and productivity. In addition, we returned more than $2.7 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. In 2015, we continued to make significant progress on the execution of our Enterprise Strategy as evidenced by more than 100 basis points of margin improvement from our self-help enterprise initiatives. As a reminder, we expect an additional incremental 100 basis points of margin expansion from our Business Structure Simplification, Sourcing, and 80/20 Excellence initiatives in each of 2016 and 2017. In 2015, we also began our pivot to focus on our organic growth agenda, and we made meaningful progress with 60% of the company's revenues achieving ready-to-grow status and 45% growing at 6% in 2015. We continue to execute the various elements of our Enterprise Strategy in a well-planned and logical sequence as we position ITW to deliver solid growth with best-in-class margins and returns, and we remain firmly on track to deliver on our end of 2017 enterprise performance goals. I'd like to close by thanking all of our ITW colleagues around the world for the great job that they continue to do in serving our customers and in executing our strategy. I'll now turn the call over to Michael, and then, I'll be back to discuss the acquisition that we announced earlier this week. Michael? Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everybody. As you saw this morning, ITW delivered another strong quarter. EPS of $1.23 increased 4% versus prior year, 11% excluding currency. Our results were driven by strong execution across the board as operating margin improved 110 basis points to 20.7% and our self-help enterprise initiatives contributed 110 basis points of improvement. Organic revenue was modestly better than our guidance with some credit challenging comparisons in a few segments. While demand for capital equipment remains sluggish, underlying demand trends were stable across our business portfolio. Adjusted for seasonality, demand in our industrial businesses improved 4% sequentially in Q4 versus Q3. Free cash flow was very strong at 140% of net income, and, as you can see, we made meaningful progress on our return on invested capital metrics. In summary, stable demand across our business portfolio and solid execution drove strong Q4 performance. Turning to revenue by geography on page five, let me just remind you that the organic revenue number includes a one percentage point impact from Product Line Simplification as organic revenue declined 0.6% with some fairly challenging comparisons in the prior year. By geography, North America was down 1.6% with our consumer facing businesses up 2% and the industrial businesses down 5.6%. International was positive, up 0.6% with Europe, Middle East and Africa up 1.9%. Our consumer businesses grew 4.6% with strength in Automotive OEM up 10% in Europe and Food Equipment. Asia Pacific and China were essentially flat, and it's worth pointing out that China automotive was up 14% in the fourth quarter. So overall, stable end-market conditions across the portfolio and slightly better-than-expected organic revenue performance in the quarter against a fairly challenging comparison. On page six, strong operating margin performance once again in the quarter. Operating margin of 20.7%, improved 110 basis points, and four segments improved between 220 basis points and 420 basis points, driven primarily by our self-help enterprise initiatives and lower restructuring. Pricing was solid in the quarter. Price/cost was favorable, 30 basis points. So strong progress on operating margin, and as Scott said, we're on track to realize additional incremental margin improvement as we go forward. On page seven, we listed full-year 2015 operating margin by segment, and you can see the strong progress since the launch of the Enterprise Strategy. Turning to the segments, starting with Automotive OEM, another strong quarter. Organic revenue up 5% and up 6% for the year, outpacing worldwide builds of 1%. Europe was up 10% organically in the quarter and up 11% for the year. North America was up 4% and China was up 14% in the quarter and up 8% for the year. Consistent with global industry growth rates, our 2016 guidance assumes a 1% increase in global auto builds versus 2015. Solid quarter in Test & Measurement/Electronics as margin improved 300 basis points to a new fourth quarter record of 18.1%. Demand trends in this segment improved in the quarter. Sequentially, from Q3 to Q4, revenues were up 6%, up 2% adjusted for typical seasonality. Also another solid quarter in Food Equipment, up 2% organically, facing some challenging comparisons from last year. You may recall that Equipment was up 6% worldwide in Q4 last year. Operating margin improved 220 basis points to a new fourth quarter record of 23.9%. North America service was up 4% and underlying equipment demand remained solid, particularly in bakery, healthcare and lodging. International equipment was up 4% on continued strong demand in warewash, cooking, and refrigeration. Polymers & Fluids was down 3% due to soft demand related to industrial MRO, with North America down 4%, partially offset by Asia Pacific up 9%. Operating margin expanded by 70 basis points to 18.2%. Welding was down 11% organically in a tough environment and against some challenging comparisons. You may recall that in the fourth quarter last year North America was up 10% and oil and gas was up 20%. The 11% year-over-year decline breaks down as 6 points from oil and gas, 3 points from industrial and 2 points from commercial. North America overall was down 8%, with consumables essentially flat. International, as you can see, was down 20% due to oil and gas, primarily in onshore pipeline and offshore. But as we've talked about on the last earnings calls, the year-over-year numbers can be somewhat misleading in terms of understanding the underlying trends. On a seasonally adjusted basis, the underlying demand trends have actually been fairly stable since the first quarter of 2015. On a seasonally adjusted sequential basis, we saw a significant step-down in demand in Q1 last year followed by slight declines in Q2 and Q3, and then, in this fourth quarter, demand actually improved 2% sequentially from Q3. Consistent with current demand levels, our 2016 guidance assumes a single-digit decline in the Welding segment. On slide 10, Construction Products had another strong quarter on the top line and bottom line. Organic revenue was up 3% and margin was up 420 basis points. North America was up 2% with high-single-digit growth in the renovation and remodel channel. Residential was essentially flat, and commercial was down slightly. Asia Pacific was strong, up 7% due to Australia. In Specialty Products, organic revenue was flat, with solid growth in consumer packaging, offset by the impact of Product Line Simplification. Operating margin improved by 400 basis points, 23%. Turning to slide 11, as you know, one of the core strengths of ITW is our diversified portfolio, and in the current environment, the fact that about 60% of our revenues are consumer facing. As you can see, in a tough environment, our consumer businesses, Automotive OEM, Food Equipment, portions of Specialty Products and Construction, are growing at an organic rate of 3% in the fourth quarter and for the full-year, and the seasonally adjusted sequential trends are stable. Our industrial businesses, Welding, Test & Measurement and Electronics, were down 6% in the quarter, and down 5% for the year. However, if you look at the seasonally adjusted sequential trend from Q3 to Q4 revenues are up 4%. In simple terms, based on typical seasonality, you would expect these businesses to be down 2% sequentially, but they were actually up 2%. It may be too early to call this a trend, but certainly, an encouraging data point as we look ahead. Quickly on 2015, you can see that we continue to make significant progress on all of our financial performance metrics. EPS growth, operating margin improvement, return on capital, and free cash flow all reflect the strength of ITW's differentiated business model and our strong execution in a tough environment. Going back a little bit further to the launch of the Enterprise Strategy on slide 13, the same holds true. More than 500 basis points improvement in margin and returns, 17% EPS CAGR, and solid progress in our pivot to growth. As Scott said, 60% of the company's revenues achieved ready-to-grow status, and 45% grew at 6% in 2015. We fully expect that 85% of the company's revenues will be in ready-to-grow status by the end of 2016. In summary, over the last three years, really good progress, and we've done everything we said we would do. And we're on track to achieve our 2017 performance goals. On slide 14, we are reaffirming the guidance as discussed in New York on December 4. Our organic revenue growth expectation of 1% to 3% is in line with Q4 demand levels, and includes 90 basis points of Product Line Simplification impact (12:55). In 2016, we expect 100 basis points or more of margin improvement from our self-help enterprise initiatives, independent of volume, and operating margin is projected to be a new record of approximately 22.5%, earnings per share in the range of $5.35 to $5.55, and 6% growth at the midpoint, and 10% growth excluding currency. Turning to the first quarter, our EPS guidance is $1.20 to $1.30, and the midpoint of $1.25 represents 23% of our full-year earnings right in line with historical patterns. Again, we expect 100 basis points from our self-help enterprise initiatives, and based on current levels of demand, we expect organic revenue growth to be flat to up 2%. Finally, a quick update on capital allocation, given the two recent developments, and then, I'll hand it over to Scott. Earlier this week, we announced the acquisition of the Engineered Fasteners & Components business from ZF TRW for $450 million. From a capital allocation standpoint, approximately, 70% of the purchase price will be funded with non-U.S. cash. And we expect the acquisition to generate returns on capital in the 16% to 20% range by year seven. In addition, we see significant potential to improve the performance of the EF&C business through the application of ITW's 80/20 business management system, and we expect margins to improve from approximately 10% to 20% by year five. The acquisition is slightly accretive to EPS in the first 12 months, and based on the expected closing date, we expect very little EPS impact in 2016, with accelerating benefits into 2017 and beyond. Finally, we're maintaining our end of 2017 performance goals. Second, based on our ability to tax-efficiently accessed $1.2 billion of non-U.S. cash this month, we're increasing our share repurchase expectation by $1 billion to approximately $2 billion. The associated EPS benefit for 2016 is largely offset by recent currency moves, but this additional $1 billion of share repurchase also positions us very well for earnings growth in 2017 and beyond. With that, I'll turn it Scott. Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Michael and just now a couple of words on the acquisition that we announced earlier this week. On slide 17, let me start in terms of foundation and just talk about the business that we are holding on this acquisition to our Automotive OEM segment. As many of you know, we have a very focused niche strategy in this space. We are essentially a high velocity serial problem solver for OEM and tier suppliers. The segment, in 2015, had $2.5 billion of revenue and an 8% organic growth CAGR since 2012. As we have talked on a number of occasions, we see very attractive long-term growth opportunities in this space within ITW's very focused niche positioning, and have demonstrated some real ability to execute on that strategy over the last four years or five years as we've talked about on a number of occasions. And we've outgrown global auto builds by over 400 basis points on average since 2012. So the addition of the ZF \u2013 the Engineered Fasteners & Components business from ZF TRW essentially gives us some additional leverage on that strategy, broadens our market positions on slide 18. A very complementary business in terms of strategy and focus, this business is a leading global supplier of engineered fastening systems and technical components largely focused on the interior of the car. Business is headquartered in Germany, 13 manufacturing facilities and 3,500 employees globally. Very strong solid business, excellent customer relationships, very capable operating team, and a very strong proven track record around quality and delivery execution throughout their history. On slide 18 (sic) [19], in terms of what does this business do in terms of adding to our current position, a couple of key points in that regard. First of all, it adds several new strategic product platforms that have similar characteristics through the core product platforms that we support today, certainly have very demonstrated track record in terms of innovation. The business is bringing with it over 500 active patents. And from the standpoint of the manufacturing customer support footprint, very tilted towards Asia, so it supplements our position in Asia. The overall business is, standpoint of revenue by geography, is 45% Europe, 20% North America, 35% in Asia Pacific, so very complementary to our geographic footprint, which is a little more weighted towards North America. So it gives us better global balance overall. And certainly, the last point is we see significant potential to leverage our 80/20 business management process in terms of helping the EF&C business continue to improve its operating metrics. Operating margins on the way in (18:52) are about 10%, and as Michael talked about, we think we have line of sight on at least doubling that rate over the first five years of ownership. From the standpoint of the transaction components, purchase price is roughly one times sales. Michael talked about the near-term accretion, certainly, modestly positive in the first 12 months, including all non-cash acquisition accounting related costs, certainly, expect to generate returns on capital well within our target, over the first seven years to 10 years of the acquisition. Michael talked about our ability to fund 70% or so of the purchase price with non-U.S. cash, which is an acquisition from a strategic and operational and return standpoint that we would have done regardless of funding sources, but certainly, the ability to use a significant portion of the purchase cost, the ability to use cash overseas is certainly an added benefit here, but didn't drive the deal. And we expect to close in the second half of \u2013 or this first half of 2016. So with that, I think we're \u2013 that's all for our prepared remarks, and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. Are we going to proceed with the question-and-answer session? Aaron H. Hoffman - Vice President- Investor Relations : Yes, let's begin the question and answer, thank you. Operator : You're welcome. One moment. Our first question will be coming from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line is open. Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Good morning. Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And nice quarter. Maybe starting on the 2016 guide, you maintain the guide, and it seems like you've built some margin of error in the guide also with this $1 billion repatriation. And so, maybe talk a little bit about your opportunity to still hit at least the midpoint, maybe even the higher end of the guide, if in fact organic growth were to disappoint as we kind of progress through the year. Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, Joe, I'd say on the organic, 1% to 3% guide for 2016 is based on the demand levels we're seeing in the businesses today, as per usual. So we're not counting on improvement in underlying demand or in market conditions. Based on current run rates, we are solidly in that range of 1% to 3%. I think in terms of margin of error, what I would say is that we still have a lot of things that are within our control, in terms of our self-help. And number one on the list are the enterprise initiatives that we've continued to execute well on over the last two years. And we expect another 100 basis points of margin expansion, independent of volume from those in 2016. If you translate that into EPS, as we said in December, that's about $0.30 of EPS growth. Certainly, in addition to that, the $1 billion increase in our share repurchase program gives us some additional EPS benefit. Unfortunately, some of that is, depending on the timing, is offset by recent currency moves. Not so much in the euro, but primarily in Canadian and Australian dollars, the pound, but it does give us a little bit of room here. So overall, in terms of the guidance, we feel very good about maintaining where we're at in the $5.35 to $5.55 range, and we feel really good about continuing to make solid progress on organic growth. You saw some of that in the fourth quarter. And just based on what we're seeing in our businesses today, we'd expect that to continue in 2016. Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's helpful color, Michael. Maybe as my follow-on question, there's a lot of concern in the market regarding what's happening in the auto end market. Clearly, that's an end market that has been incredibly good for you guys. You continue to outpace global auto builds, but it looks like this past quarter, we saw a little bit less outgrowth in Auto OEM. So maybe some color on your ability to continue to sustain outgrowth in that end market and how you think about that end market over the next 12 months. Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, sure, Joe, this is Scott. I think the story for us remains one of penetration. Michael made a comment in his prepared remarks that our planning scenario, essentially, is for 1% increase in global auto builds next year. I think most of the sort of external forecasters and pundits are in the 2.5% to 3% range. So in our own planning assumptions, I think we're taking a much more conservative approach as a baseline. It is also, as we talked about before, the one area of our business where we have a significant amount of forward visibility vis-\u00e0-vis. We've sold programs into production plans going on this year. Those programs were sold two years and three years ago. So I think we've got a pretty stable outlook on, in terms of what our expectations are for 2016, with respect to auto built into our plans. It doesn't mean that builds, if we see some inflection in \u2013 or some change in overall builds relative to our 1%, that's not going to have an impact, but ultimately, I think the potential impacts are pretty modest. I think we've got our plan set where there's an appropriate level of conservatism, and have enough new penetration and new content in 2016 coming online that we ought to be able to be all right regardless of \u2013 pending any sort of major crash, which I don't think anybody thinks is going to happen. I think we're in pretty good position in 2016. Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, great. Thanks, Scott. I'll get back in queue. Operator : All right. Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz of Citigroup. Your line is open. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey, good morning, guys. Nice quarter. Scott, so can you talk a little bit more about the pivot to growth? How much more challenging do you think it could be to get your businesses that are preparing to grow, to get ready to grow, by the end of 2016, as you talked about in the Analyst Day, if the global economy is a bit weaker? And maybe you can talk about what these businesses are. If I look at it, it seems like it'd be businesses like European construction, parts of polymers and fluids, parts of specialty products. But that's what I think. What do you think? Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I think you've hit \u2013 in terms of those three areas of the company, I think you've hit three that are still in the preparing to grow mode. The agenda is pretty much within our own control from the standpoint of what we have characterized as moving from preparing to grow to ready to grow. It's largely a lot of 80/20 work, a lot of product line pruning, a lot of customer focus, and a lot of \u2013 as we talked in December, a lot on really lasering in on where are the best opportunities to grow. So I don't think there's much impact on the preparation part from the standpoint of the external environment. That agenda is pretty well mapped out. The timing is, in terms of the sequencing of various parts of the company, from that prepared to grow to ready to grow, just a function of how big the agenda was to get from A to B. And in some cases, we had further to go than others. So the 60% we've gotten in that mode to this point had a slightly less deep agenda. And we're working our way through the rest. So I don't think there's much impact in terms of the external environment, in terms of the objective that we have laid out to get 85% of our businesses in that mode by the end of this year. That being said, certainly, the external environment, from the standpoint of yield on that investment, is certainly going to have an impact in the short run. A little bit of tailwind, at some point here, would certainly help us showcase the progress we're making, but I think I'd also make the other point that the fact that we're able to grow 45% of our sales in this environment at a 6% clip in 2015 is a pretty good indicator of at least some progress in that regard. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks for that, Scott. And Scott or Michael, can I ask you about price/cost? You had a minor improvement in price/cost from 20 basis points to 30 basis points. But as you know, raw material costs do seem to be coming down, maybe a little more significantly now. So can you actually improve that price/cost from 30 basis points that you had in 1Q or at least maintain it for the year? Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, so I think obviously, Andrew, it's not the main driver of our margin performance here. That's really enterprise initiatives. But we were pleased to see 30 basis points in the fourth quarter. That was our best result in 2015. And the average for the year is 20 basis points. And that's what we modeled for 2016. I think we were all encouraged to see solid price across the portfolio, again, a lot of it driven by the launch of new products, as we've talked about before. And we're starting to see the deflation come through on some of the key raw materials that we're buying. In some cases, we pass those on to customers; we're contractually obligated, so obviously, we'll do that. But there is a little bit more of sort of an improvement in the overall equation here in the fourth quarter. Hopeful that we can maintain that. We're certainly working very hard on that. And we're counting on 20 basis points in the guide for 2016. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks, Michael. Take care, guys. Operator : Okay, thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of John Inch of Deutsche Bank. Sir, your line is open. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, thanks very much. Okay, so I want to \u2013 good morning, everyone. I want to pick up on this auto thematic. I mean, let's be blunt. It was very clear your stock was shorted earlier this year, because of this perceived exposure, your Auto business is going to fall off a cliff. And I understand your confidence based on your track record and your ability to continue to penetrate it. My question is, do you see anything, Scott or Michael, based on your operations that give you a little more comfort than simply the trend? In other words, do you have \u2013 and I realize you've got a little bit of a backlog, look forward, but are there initiatives that you're working on that may be derivative of, say, CAFE standards or vehicle electrification, or you're working on a big something in Indonesia or something like that that you think maybe give you \u2013 maybe not dramatically, but like a point or two of step-up help over the coming cycle? Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : I wouldn't put Indonesia on the high priority list. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I just meant \u2013 that was the only thing that came to mind, but you know. Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: But other than that, I think we have \u2013 I think I get it, your question. If I don't answer it, let me know. But what I would say is we have a very full pipeline over of engineering and product development activity related to Automotive that's certainly driven by some of the things you talked about, and just other changes in the need profile of our OEM customers in terms of new features, new technologies, new things that they're looking to add. So I think we have a very solid view of the next 10 years in the space, in terms of what the opportunities are for our particular niche in the space. And I think that's \u2013 this is not \u2013 we don't manage any of our businesses for the next two quarters, we manage them for the long haul. I think this is an area where we remain, as we've talked before, very optimistic about our ability to continue to increase our content per vehicle, focusing on a very narrowly defined strategy in terms of what we do. And so, all I can tell you is that the pipeline, in terms of the amount of activity in terms of projects we're working on that are going to come to fruition two years and three years and four years out remains very healthy. We track it, we monitor it, so I think we are on top of sort of what the future might hold in terms of opportunity for us here. Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : And John, maybe I'll just add that, for those that are maybe a little more short-term focused, we have not seen any signs of a slowdown in the fourth quarter or year-to-date in the automotive space, or across our business portfolio. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Let me just ask kind of a follow-up. This German company you've bought, right, it's going to give you a leg up into Asia. And obviously, ITW, as you're pivoting with cost and simplification, you're going to be doing more M&A. Is there runway to do other kinds of deals like this, perhaps to extend what clearly is then a successful M&A \u2013 or excuse me, penetration track record in auto into other markets like, I don't know, for example, Japan or something. I mean just I realize you can't talk specifically, but maybe the question was more the deal that you did, was it more one-off? Or do you think that there are other things? And just as a follow-up, I mean having a little bit of experience with German companies, I'm assuming that company has a lot of potential productivity or cost efficiency opportunities. Can you still grow it at that cadence and expand the margins? Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Trying to think about where to start with that one? John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Sorry. Multi-part second part. Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, so I think our overall story in Automotive is largely an organic one. I think this particular business, from the standpoint of complementary fit with our strategy, is a unique opportunity. I would certainly not rule out other opportunities like this. But I think it's not a matter of \u2013 it's not the scale we're after here. It's really about sort of auto opportunities where we can extend our access to the key OEMs and extend our ability to play across a range of different product platforms that we think fit the overall screen in terms of high value-added content. So we talked about the organic growth rate in Auto OEM. I think that's largely that remains the thrust here. So that's the overall focus, and the story is we have significant opportunity to continue to grow and add content per vehicle and do it in a way that's certainly consistent with our overall enterprise performance goals. That being said, would we look at something that gave us a similar opportunity to extend our reach in some other geography? Sure. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Or technology, perhaps? I mean, I won't \u2013 Mobileye comes to mind only because it's been so topical. I'm not talking about that company specifically, but maybe break-through technology. Is that a possibility? Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'm not sure I heard who the company was. I wouldn't comment on it. I don't think it's \u2013 I think we'll assess each opportunity on its own. I don't want to overplay this. I think our primary thrust is \u2013 and focus continues to be on leveraging and executing the strategy that we have. So we don't need any more M&A to continue to generate really strong organic growth at really nice incremental yield. So I would say, our thrust here would be more opportunistic than any view that we have to do anything more here. So if opportunities present themselves that we think that will certainly do it, but we have no particular view of we're deficient, we need this, or we have to have that in order to be very successful here over the long haul. John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: No, I got it. And Mobileye was the company I called out. Thanks very much. I appreciate it. Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Scott Davis of Barclays. Your line is open. Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, good morning, guys. Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I'm new to your story, so I'm allowed to ask dumb questions for a couple of quarters. I hope you guys forgive me. Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: But can you give us a sense \u2013 you seem to have a fair amount of confidence in the 0% to 2% 1Q guide. I mean, January is a fairly important month in the quarter. We're already on this 27th. Are you tracking in that range in January and that gives you the confidence? Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, Scott, we're on track in January for the guidance that we gave for the first quarter. Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then, second question, just following up a little on what John was saying. I mean, this TRW deal looks like just a fantastic deal. I mean, if there's other stuff out there like this, would you be willing to \u2013 I mean, would it make sense, at least, to think about not doing the share repurchase and adding the higher return profile instead? Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : I think, Scott, we really \u2013 absolutely, we will continue to look at acquisitions, where we can \u2013 that meet the criteria that we talked about in December. So really, the primary purpose here is to support or accelerate our organic growth rate and we're looking for businesses, where we can have significant impact from an 80/20 standpoint. And so to the extent that we see those, we'll certainly continue to work on that. In terms of overall capital allocation, nothing has changed in terms of our structure and strategy. As you know, we have a strong balance sheet, we have strong liquidity. We generate a lot of cash flow. You saw 140% in the quarter, 106% for the year. And so we have a lot of options. And so for us, it's not a question of either/or, we can do all of the above. And what we've said is to the extent that we don't identify acquisitions that meet the criteria that I just described, then we make a choice to return that cash to our shareholders through an active share repurchase program. And as you saw, we just raised that today from a $1 billion to $2 billion for 2016. So that's how we think about it. Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. That seems to make sense. And then, just a quick one. How much of the 150-basis-point margin of the year you think was price/cost related or LIFO accounting related, or something related to that? Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So price/cost was 20 basis points and the primary driver was 110 basis points from the enterprise initiatives. Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Perfect. All right, thanks, guys. Appreciate it. Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Okay. Thank you. Operator; Thank you. And our next question will be coming from the line of Deane Dray of RBC. Your line is open. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey. I just want to circle back to the ZF deal. Scott, it's pretty clear this is a natural fit for you guys, but I didn't hear any specifics regarding what the products are. There's a vague description of strategic product platforms, but if you can get down to the level of the 80/20, the 20% that really matter compared to like lift-to-sits, handles, fuel caps, what is it adding to the portfolio and are there any redundancies? Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So, this is Michael, Deane. So if you think about it, $470 million in revenues, half of that is what we would describe as fastening systems. And that, not to get too technical here, certainly, I'm not the right person for that, but they're described broadly as fasteners for trim, pipe and hose, hole plugs and wire harnesses. The other half is what is described as technical components. So this is, again, in the interior of the vehicle \u2013 air registers, interior ventilation systems, lighting and other interior products. So there's a really nice fit with what we know really well and do very well inside of our current Automotive business. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Just in the description, Michael, there are overlaps, the way it sounds, in terms of the fasteners and even some of the air handling. Do you have a sense of how much specific overlap there is? Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : I think overlap is not a good characterization. Every one of these products is custom-designed around a particular model. So we're sort of describing them in broad category, so they're areas that we know. We know fastening very well in Automotive, but there are hundreds of fastening applications on every car. So every product line here is a specifically designed and engineered solution to a specific problem on a specific model for a specific OEM. So these are sort of areas that we're very familiar with in broad terms, but from the standpoint of are there any exact like-like products? Minimal to none. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : That's great to hear. And that's a good perspective. And then, just my follow-up question would be for Michael. On the repatriated cash, what's the effective tax rate that you paid on bringing this cash back? And maybe are you netting it against any tax losses? But just when you say it's tax-efficient, what did you have to pay? Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. So we paid very little. And you saw that in our tax rate last year. We had a similar transaction in the quarter last year. Our rate for the last year was 30.2% for the year, in that 30% to 31% range. And for 2016, we expect to be in that same range, 30% to 31%, including in the first quarter. So, like we said, this was done in a very tax-efficient, very simple transaction. It makes a lot of sense operationally and a really good outcome for the company. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : And, Michael, I'm sorry to try to pin you down on this. When you say very little, what tax rate \u2013 effective tax rate are you paying to bring this cash back? Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Essentially zero. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Terrific. Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Mr. Mig Dobre of Robert Baird. Your line is open. Mig Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I guess, my question relates to slide 11 in the deck, looking at industrial and consumer sequentially. So for your industrial businesses, you're up 4% adjusted for seasonality. Maybe kind of nitpicking a little bit, if Welding was flat and Test & Measurement were up 2%, can you give us a sense for what else sort of grew to get you to the plus 4%? And then, related to this, I'm trying to understand if this is just something that's specific to the company, either through new product introduction or your exposure? Or are you trying to signal that there's something bigger going on in the environment? It's a little different than what we're hearing from other industrial companies in terms of what happens... Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Mig, all we're saying is that, as we talked about on the last earnings call is that what we have seen in our businesses on the industrial side is that trends stabilize, really starting in the second quarter last year. And so if you just take Welding to maybe illustrate this, so if you look at the sequential demand trends in Welding, what we saw in the first quarter was a 8% decline in the demand rate, into the second quarter, into the third quarter, we saw 1%, all seasonally adjusted. And then, in the fourth quarter we saw flat. And so that means that we would expect typical seasonality in Welding. We expect that business to be down 2% and the business was flat. So that's certainly an improvement in terms of the underlying demand trends. Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And part of what I would add to that is there's a lot of volatility in the comps, given just the volatility in the end-market. So we talked about fourth quarter last year. So what we're trying just communicate is, not any big change in trend as much as when you look at the year-on-year comps quarter-by-quarter, because of the volatility over the last eight quarters to 10 quarters, those aren't necessarily indicative of what's going on currently. And essentially what we're seeing is relatively stable demand on a orders per day basis. So we're not calling it a trend, we're not calling it a pick-up, but what we are saying is things have been relatively stable. Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, and, Mig, a point on the consumer side is really that -this is a little bit different, as you were saying, relative to maybe some of our peers, that 60% of our revenues are tied to the consumer. And that in the current environment where there's some pressure on the industrial side, particularly, CapEx into oil and gas, and we have 60% of the company growing at 3% at a very stable rate for the quarter and for the year. So those are the points we're trying to make on slide 11. Mig Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. I appreciate that. And then, I know you commented on price/cost, but if we can focus on just price specifically in your industrial businesses, are there some parallels that you can draw between the current environment versus maybe prior downturns where things were challenging? How's pricing behaving versus history here? Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : No change here, Mig. I mean, we saw across the portfolio the ability to get price based on offering value-added products and solutions. We saw no change in the quarter. So really nothing different here. Mig Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): All right. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of David Raso of Evercore ISI. David Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities : Hi, good morning. Operator : Your line is open. David Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities : So, two questions, one positive, I guess, one negative. But first a clarification. Maybe I missed it. Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks for the warning. David Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities : The guidance, does it not include the auto acquisition, just so we're clear? Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : No, the guidance today does not include the acquisition. But what we did say is that we expect minimal EPS impact in 2016. This is really more of a 2017 and beyond EPS growth story. And so when the transaction closes, which we expect will happen in the first half of the year, we will update revenue margin guidance. We expect some, but very little impact on the EPS side and we'll give you all that once the transaction closes. David Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities : All right. Thank you. On the positive side, the organic growth guidance for the first quarter was stronger than I would have thought. Is it fair to say the tone at the December meeting when you thought about the cadence for 2016 organic to get to the full-year midpoint of up 2%, that the first quarter organic guidance you just gave is maybe a little better than you were thinking a month or two ago? Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : I'd say not really, David. I mean, I'd say, the fourth quarter here was a little bit better than our guidance at the beginning of the quarter, but that wasn't really a big surprise to us. And, again, what we're doing is we're taking typical seasonality, run rates from Q4 adjusted for seasonality into Q1 and that gets you into that 0% to 2% range, so there's nothing really different about it. David Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities : Okay, I have to admit, I was thinking that it was a very back half loaded guide in the sense of first half organic maybe down a bit, second half would have to be up a lot. But it sounds like now the cadence sounds a little more 1%,1%, 3%,3%, is kind of the generic base case of the cadence to get the full-year 2%? Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, yeah, but again, it's much more about the \u2013 because of the comparison to the comps, we're taking current daily run rates and applying basically what we're saying in 2016 is \u2013 no change in current run rates gets us 1% to 3% for the year. Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : And so based on that, I mean, the way you're looking at it, David, I mean, this is not a back-end loaded plan in terms of the organic or the EPS guidance. David Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities : Yeah, I mean, I will say I left the meeting thinking it was even more back-half loaded than the setup you're describing today. On the negative side, obviously, a lot of positive commentary you have on Auto versus the concerns, but still, end of the day, the quarter, the outgrowth wasn't quite as great as we've seen, and the margins still were down, so maybe I missed it in the prepared remarks. But can you help us understand why the margin was down and how do you see Auto margins for 2016 versus 2015? You're saying worldwide builds up 1%. I assume you expect to outgrow, so call it, 2%, 3%, 4% kind of revenue growth for Auto. How do the margins play out in that scenario? Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. So our margins, I mean, it can vary a little bit on a quarterly basis. I would point to 24.2% operating margin in Auto for the year, great progress. That's how I would think about 2016 with some progress on the enterprise initiatives. For the year, 6% organic growth on builds of 1%, 5% in the quarter. There can be some mix issues, like we talked about in the third quarter. And so I wouldn't read too much into, David, the one particular quarter, but really encourage you to look at it kind of on an annual basis. And we'd certainly expect something very similar in 2016. Scott walked through the penetration and the auto build dynamics, but it should be another solid year for the Auto business. David Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities : That's helpful, but just so I make sure I heard you correctly, the 24.2%, and then you made a comment about enterprise initiatives. The 24.2% includes enterprise initiatives, or is that base, and then whatever you can provide (50:22). Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : The 24.2% is the performance for the full-year in 2015. David Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities : Correct. Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : And like all of our businesses, we would expect some progress on margins in 2016, some more than others. David Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities : Okay. that's helpful. Helpful. Just wanted to clarify. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Joel Tiss. Your line is open. Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey guys, how's it going? Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good. Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Just quick for Mike, just a clarification. You said the consumer facing businesses are stable. Does that mean that they're up 3%? They're stable at an up 3% run rate for 2016, or they're stable closer to flat for 2016 versus the up 3% in 2015? Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : No, when we say stable what we mean is the underlying demand trends adjusted for seasonality from Q3 to Q4, we saw stable demand in those businesses. So... Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States): And you said \u2013 oh, go ahead, sorry. Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Now it doesn't mean that we expect the consumer businesses to be flat in 2016. We're certainly not giving guidance for consumer and industrial for 2016, but if you think about what's in there, so Automotive, we talked about Food Equipment, we talked about parts of Construction and Specialty, we'd certainly expect those businesses to grow again in 2016. Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. And then, just a strategic question on the debt. You were saying in December that you were hoping to use the free cash flow to pay down debt. And I see that your cash is coming down a little bit, and your debt's going up. And I just wondered if there's any change in that thinking going into 2016? Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : I think, Joel, I think you were saying that. I don't think I said that at the December meeting. So we have, like I said earlier, I mean, we have our current debt to EBITDA is in that 2.2/2.3 range, and we expect no changes to that. Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Andy Casey of Wells Fargo Securities. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. First question on the acquisition. Could you help us kind of frame the historical growth rate over the last three years? Was it even close to the 8% CAGR achieved by your Auto business? And then, also based on your initial meetings with the organization over there so far, is your impression that they have the embedded skill-set right now to drive both margin improvement, and ultimately, above market growth kind of in line with corporate goals? Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So the answer to the first question is the growth rate has been solid, but not at the rate that we've been growing over the last four years. We expect to have some \u2013 offer some help in that regard. And then, the second question is that we've been very impressed with the management team in the organization and feel like we're getting a really solid quality team, that runs a great business today and through some additional tools that we can provide around our operating system, I think, can certainly leverage those tools to their full potential. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great. Thanks, Scott. And then, last one back on Welding, your comments about that being one of the businesses that stabilized during at least the second half of last year. Did you see any difference in trends through the year between CapEx and consumables? And then, also did you see any change within the second half in some of your bigger customers, maybe machinery OEM behavior versus, if you will, the general distributor base. Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, no, so we didn't really see anything other than what I described earlier, right? And so, on the equipment side, certainly down a little bit more than the consumables that have been fairly stable throughout the year, but no significant changes as we've gone through the year or the fourth quarter. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks a lot, Michael. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Nicole DeBlase of Morgan Stanley. Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah, thanks. Good morning. Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Sorry about the last name, there. Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: It's okay. I'm used to it. It's DeBlase. So the first question is on Construction. So the North America Construction Products core growth, I think, it decelerated a bit to 2% this quarter. It was more like 7% in 3Q. I'm just curious on the drivers, is it a comp issue? Are you seeing some slowdown in North America Construction on an underlying basis? And then, I guess, what are your thoughts on the North America non-resi construction side goal into 2016? Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. So if you look at the fourth quarter, up 3% organic, like I said, residential was flat, which was slightly better than expected. On the renovation remodel channel, that's really where the growth, up 12% for the full-year, and then, commercial down slightly. Those trends, we've been kind of bumping along those same numbers in 2015. We feel good about 2016 and we would expect that business to grow in 2016 at a rate similar to what we saw in 2015, which was up 4% organically. Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, got it. That's helpful. And then, for my follow-up, just looking at the T&M/Electronics business, it was pretty strong this quarter, stronger than we had expected. And I would say that the margin performance there was a bit of a standout. So is that just enterprise initiatives? Or is there anything else to highlight from a margin perspective? And do you also think that T&M/Electronics can show positive margin progression in 2016? Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Absolutely. I mean, we think we'll continue to make progress on operating margin in Test & Measurement. And in the fourth quarter, really nothing unusual other than what we've been talking about for almost three years now in terms of really strong execution of the enterprise initiatives, including 80/20 in that business. So very sustainable. More progress to come in 2016 and 2017. Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks. I'll pass it on. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Good morning. Just two quick follow-ups. One, again, the comments you made about the sequential improvements in some of your industrial businesses was interesting. Can you comment on if that trend continued into January? And then, I guess, the second question is given the incremental lag-down we've seen in oil prices, what have you sort of baked into your guidance in 2016 in terms of risk, because you could see a lag effect there? Thanks. Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So like we said earlier, no change in the month of January. We're on track to the guidance for the quarter. Oil and gas demand, while certainly down year-over-year, has remained stable. And like we said earlier, the primary impact there is on the Welding side and we expect that business to decline in the single-digits in 2016. Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): All righty. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Ann Duignan from JPMorgan. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Well, it would be helpful if they could get my first name right. Morning. Just following up on the acquisition of ZF, as they would call it in Europe, how did that deal come about? For decades companies have been trying to get out of automotive supply. And it hasn't been deemed as a very attractive sector to be in. I'm curious, was this an auction process? ZF was trying to get rid of this business? Or did ITW approach ZF? I'm just curious how it all happened. Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I'm not sure that it's probably our place to comment on that. I think we're \u2013 it's a business that we've known about for a long time. I'll put it that way. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. So you're not willing to comment on whether it was an auction? Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You can ask them. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. No problem. And maybe you could just talk about the backlog then on the acquisition front? What are you seeing out there in terms of buyers versus sellers? Are we still looking at high expectations from sellers? Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, my answer is we remain very much a niche player on the acquisition space. As we've talked about, our primary thrust remains on focus on making this pivot organic. So I'm not sure we're your best barometer. In terms of pipeline, we have a few segments that are in the ready-to-grow mode, largely who are now enabled to start to think about what might be complementary to what they're doing, but I would say, from a standpoint of our overall level of effort here, we wouldn't be a good barometer in terms of what's going on in the overall market. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. I'll leave it there in the interest of time. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Steve Fisher of UBS. Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks. Just two regional outlook questions. On Europe, we're seeing some mixed data points. What are you seeing and expecting for your overall business in aggregate in Europe in 2016? And then, similarly, with China, obviously, roughly, flat in the fourth quarter, but you had some big moving pieces with Automotive, quite a bit something else was down. How do you see China going forward in 2016 overall? Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, so I think, Steve, kind of, big picture here. I mean, Europe was up a little more than 1% in 2015. We expect that to stay at the current run rate to be \u2013 in that range. Maybe a little better than that, driven, again, by strong presence in Automotive growing double-digits, or a big quarter in 2015, and more to come there. Food Equipment should have another really good year in that region. So more of the same, maybe a little bit better in Europe based on current run rates. China was flat essentially in the quarter, flat for the year. And we expect a similar environment going into 2016. Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Aaron H. Hoffman - Vice President- Investor Relations : Great. And that brings us actually just past the top of the hour. So we're going to conclude the call there. Thanks to everyone for your time today and participation. And we'll talk to you of the first quarter in three months. Thank you. Operator : That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s conference. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this point. Now I will turn the meeting over to your host Aaron Hoffman. Sir, you may begin. Aaron Hoffman : Thanks, Evan. Good morning and welcome to ITW\u2019s first quarter 2016 conference call. Joining me this morning are our CEO, Scott Santi; and our CFO, Michael Larsen. During today\u2019s call, we will discuss our first quarter 2016 financial results and update you on our 2016 earnings forecast. Before we get to the results, let me remind you that this presentation contains our financial forecast for the 2016 second quarter and full-year, as well as other forward-looking statements identified on this slide. We refer you to the company\u2019s 2015 Form 10-K for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Also, this presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures. While we use very few non-GAAP measures a reconciliation of those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measure is contained in the press release. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Scott. Ernest Scott Santi : Thanks, Aaron, and good morning. Overall a pretty solid start to the year for ITW as we delivered solid near-term results and continue to make good progress in executing our strategy to position the company to deliver solid growth with best-in-class margins and returns. In the quarter we continued to deliver meaningful improvement on all of our key performance metrics. We grew EPS 7%, 10% excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, organic growth came in at the midpoint of our forecast and was up 1%, 2% excluding the impact of our PLS initiatives. We improved operating margin by 120 basis points to 22.1% and increased after tax return on invested capital by 180 basis points to 21.2%. Both our operating margin and our ROIC metrics were new all-time first quarter highs for the company. Free cash flow was also strong in the quarter at 90% of net income. Based on current demand trends and our strong operational and margin performance in the quarter we are raising our GAAP EPS guidance for 2016 by $0.05 at the midpoint. Before turning the call over Michael for more detail on our Q1 results I\u2019d like to thank all of our ITW colleagues around the world for the great job that they continue to do in serving our customers and executing our strategy. Michael, over to you. Michael Larsen : Thank you, Scoot and good morning, everybody. As you saw this morning ITW is off to a strong start in 2016 as the company delivered another solid quarter with excellent quality of earnings. GAAP EPS of $1.29 increased 7% versus prior year and exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.04. Driven by better operating margin as a result of strong operational execution on our enterprise initiatives. Organic revenue was up 1% and in line with our guidance as North America grew 2% and international declined 1%. As Scott mentioned, we established a number of new all-time highs for our first quarter. Operating margin of 22.1% improved 120 basis points with strategic sourcing, 80-20 practice excellence and business structure simplification all contributing in a very meaningful way. Given the strong margin performance in the quarter we now expect that operating margin will exceed 22.5% for the full year. Operating income of $722 million was also a first quarter record. The prior record of $705 million was pre-enterprise strategy in 2012 and was achieved with revenues that were about $1.3 billion higher in this quarter. After tax ROIC was solid, fee cash flow was strong and we repurchased shares for $500 million. Just a comment on our external financial reporting. As you know, at ITW, we work hard to keep our external reporting simple, consistent and transparent. We only report one EPS number and that is GAAP EPS. There are no adjusted EPS numbers. That said, let me just point out two items that are included in our first quarter GAAP EPS number of $1.29. First, foreign currency translation, which was right in line with our guidance assumption an unfavorable $0.04 year-over-year. Second, last year\u2019s first quarter included a non-recurring gain on the sale of our business. As a result, in the first quarter of last year, other income was $21 million compared to $4 million this quarter. Excluding these two items, EPS would have increased 13%. We strongly believe that in the current economic environment and over the long-term our highly profitable and diversified portfolio is the core strength of the company. We are very well balanced in terms of our end-market and geographic exposures and well positioned to perform at a high level across a wide range of economic scenarios. Our consumer facing businesses makeup 60% of our revenues and include the automotive OEM and food equipment segments as well as portions of specialty products and construction. These businesses continue to deliver stable high quality growth. In the first quarter, our consumer facing businesses were up 3% versus prior year and up 1% sequentially. Our industrial facing businesses such as welding and test and measurement and electronics account for 40% of our revenues and as expected they declined year-over-year. As you can see these businesses were now 3%, but showed some improvement versus Q4 when they were down 6%. As you know the year-over-year comparisons continue to ease as we go through the year. 1% organic revenue growth in the quarter, 2% excluding our Product Line Simplification initiatives or PLS. By region, North America was up 2%, with our consumer-facing businesses up 5%. Solid growth continues in food equipment up 5%, automotive up 4% and construction products with renovation remodeling up 22%. Industrial facing businesses were down 3%, with welding down 7% and test and measurement and electronics down 1%. On the international side overall down 1%, with Europe up 1% and Asia-Pac down 2%. Our international consumer businesses grew 1% and industrial was down 4% primarily due to welding. At ITW we believe that operating margin is a key indicator of our business as competitive advantage and the efficiency with which they leverage it. It is in our view a compelling indicator of the strength and competitiveness of ITW and is a key performance metric for every ITW business. In the first quarter, operating margin improved 120 basis points to 22.1% and six of our seven segments improved. Construction products increased 440 basis points, specialty products 350 basis points, food equipment 190 basis points and automotive was up 140 basis points to mention a few. Approximately half of the decline in welding this quarter is related to restructuring and other non-operating items and the team continues to do a good job in a challenging environment as evidenced by their ability to sustain operating margins in the mid-20s despite a significant decline in revenue. You can also see the positive impact of volume leverage in the faster growing segments, which gives you a sense for what margins and overall profitability will look like as organic growth picks up. On the right side of the page, we listed the drivers of our operating margin improvement this quarter starting with 130 basis points from our self-help enterprise initiatives. Given the strong performance, and positive momentum, we are now expecting more than 100 basis points in the enterprise initiatives this year. Price cost came in as expected stable and favorable at 20 basis points. The unfavorable 50 basis points in the other line is primarily related to investments in growth and the overhead inflation. Overall, continued strong execution on enterprise initiatives and progress on delivering best-in-class margins consistently and sustainably. Before we get into the segment results, we listed the quarterly progression on operating margin expansion since the first quarter of 2013. 520 basis points at the enterprise level, as you can see Construction improved 930 basis points, 780 basis points in food equipment and more than 600 basis points in Automotive and Specialty Products, overall good progress with more to come. Turning to the segments, Automotive OEM had another strong quarter with organic revenue up 3% and 26.4% operating margin. While 3% organic growth is a little below what we\u2019ve seen out of our Automotive OEM segment over the last several quarters, this segment had a very tough comp and Q1 revenue came in right what we planned it to be. In the first quarter of last year, the launch of several new programs in Europe resulted in revenue growth of 13% versus builds of 2%, which is what created tough comp for the business this year. Our long-term growth target for our Automotive OEM business remains 2 to 4 percentage points of above market growth annually and based on already sold programs and our new programs pipeline, we expect to meet or exceed that target both in 2016 and for at least the next several years beyond. In North America 4% organic growth compares to auto builds of up 5% and the Detroit 3 up 4%. China was up 6% in the quarter despite the fact the builds at Western OEMs were down slightly. As expected operating margin improved 140 basis points to 26.4% the highest in the company. The quick update on the acquisition of EF&C from ZF TRW that we announced last quarter. The acquisition remains on track and we expect the deal to close mid-year. As a reminder EF&C should be modestly accretive to EPS in the first 12 months with accelerating benefit from 2017 and beyond. Another strong quarter in Food Equipment up 3% organically with strength in North America up 5% despite a challenging comparison. North America equipment was up 5% with strength in refrigeration and cooking and the service was up 4%. International was up 1% with equipment up 3% and service flat. Continued strong margin performance as operating margin improved by 190 basis points to 24.5%. Test & Measurement and Electronics organic revenue down 2%, Test & Measurement down 3% and electronics slightly better at down 1%. Sequentially the segment was stable down 7% compared to typical seasonality of down 6%. Still a challenging external environment for our welding business and organic growth declined 9%. The 9% year-over-year decline breaks down as 5 points from oil and gas, 3 points from industrial and 1 point from commercial. North America was down 7% with equipment down 10% and consumables down 1%. International was down 15% primarily due to oil and gas. We saw some slowing sequentially with demand trends down 3% compared to the typical 3% increase and the team continues to take appropriate action on the cost side. As I mentioned earlier approximately half of the operating margin declined in welding this quarter is related to restructuring and other non-operating items. Polymers & Fluids achieved positive organic revenue growth of 1%; North America and international were both up 1% and Automotive aftermarket improved 2%. Strong quarter in Construction Products as organic revenue increased 5% with North America up 11%. Renovation remodeling was up 22%, commercial was up 8% and residential was up 2%. Asia Pacific was up 2% and Europe flat, very strong progress on operating margin up 440 basis points to 21%. Solid quarter in Specialty Products with organic revenue up 3% with strength in our consumer packaging businesses, North America was up 5% and international was flat and very strong progress on operating margin with an increase of 350 basis points to 26.1%. So for the year based on our margin performance in the first quarter, we are raising of full-year EPS guidance by $0.05 to a new range of $5.40 to $5.60, the $5.50 midpoint is 7% earnings growth. Our organic revenue growth expectation of 1% to 3% is unchanged and in line with current run rates. We\u2019re forecasting that enterprise initiatives will deliver more than 100 basis points of margin improvement and that full year operating margin will exceed 22.5%. We still expect free cash flow conversion to exceed 100% and we are targeting $2 billion in share repurchases. For the second quarter our GAAP EPS guidance is $1.34 to $1.44, up 7% at the $1.39 midpoint. That puts 49% of our full year EPS forecast into first half of the year which is consistent with prior years. And with that, let me turn the call back to Aaron. Aaron Hoffman : Great. Thanks, Michael. We will now open the call to your question. Please be brief so to allow more people the opportunity to ask a question and please remember one question and one follow-up question. Operator : Thank you, speakers. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Inch from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. John Inch : Thank you. Where am I from, alright? First I want to thank you by the way for the GAAP presentation of earnings and frankly for doing a call and not a selective disclosure podcast. So much appreciated. Can we and don\u2019t answer that, can we just talk about currency Michael? I know you said it was in line with expectations. It was a little bit more of a drag. Just based on where we were marking currencies that we thought would happen in the quarter. So was there I realized got a lot of exposure to Australian dollar and I don\u2019t know, just with the pound and so forth, maybe could you talk about just give us a little more color in terms of the currency fluctuation and where you\u2019ve marked this for the rest of the year and how you expect that to progress in terms of driver your contribution? Michael Larsen : Right, John. So you are headed down the right path here. So you have to look beyond just the euro and if you look at the changes in pound, Canadian and Australian dollar that\u2019s when you get to the 3% translation impact here in the first quarter on the top-line and $0.04 of EPS headwind, which was right in lined with the assumption we had in our guidance. For the rest of the year that translation impact will at current rates as we sit here today will be lower and maybe if you headed down the path of EPS impact for the balance of the year, it is correct, but based on current rates as we sit here today not just looking at the euro, but at the other currency that we mentioned. If currency stays exactly where it is, things could turn out a little bit better. But as you know there is a lot of volatility in currency. So we have not included that in the numbers we gave you today. John Inch : Okay. But you did beat the midpoint of your guide by almost $0.05 and... Michael Larsen : Yes and that is entirely driven by operating margins. John Inch : Right. No I see.... Michael Larsen : So the.... John Inch : No, it's right. I see that. But at current rates how much of a tailwind we have in currency today versus what we had when you first marked rates giving the first quarter in your head guidance, isn\u2019t it like $0.05 or something? Michael Larsen : I just say this, it\u2019s a little bit better than what we had assumed and that\u2019s as we sit here today. Let\u2019s see where rates go from here. Like I said it could be a little bit better based on rates as they are today. John Inch : Okay. So my follow-up, I want to ask you and Scott. What do you think of the or what do you make of the ISM it saw that everyone seems to look at and if you look at the new orders component. I mean it sort of telling you that a big recovery is on the comp. Now last year was flashing green and manufacturing was going the other way. So I think I\u2019m just trying to get your sense, you are a real time company short cycle you are in the economy, do you think that the ISM is reflecting perhaps some seasonal improvement, some sentiment improvement only perhaps a little bit of systematic inventory restock or are you just seeing a complete disconnect? I just want again focus on North America please and how do you based in your years of experience, how do you interpret the ISM and why frankly wouldn\u2019t you be even more positive on your outlook? Ernest Scott Santi : We\u2019ve never from our particular lens we\u2019ve never viewed the ISM number as having a terrific correlation to conditions we\u2019re seeing on the ground, certainly not way off, but I think from the standpoint of either leading or lagging, it\u2019s not been particularly reflective of the conditions that we\u2019re seeing, what I will tell is, my take on the quarter is that we saw a pretty solid demands throughout. So I think things are relatively firm for right now, the one exception to that is obviously welding, we\u2019re hopefully, we\u2019re getting to close a bottom, but I can\u2019t say that we\u2019re seeing anything that tells us that, but beyond that the overall demand profile inside the company was pretty solid as we move through the quarter. So no big movement and certainly not any weakening as we move through the quarter. John Inch : Well, Scott every month has its own seasonal characteristics and we had this weather compares, especially in the Midwest, it's [indiscernible] because I realize, it\u2019s complicated, but if you try and adjust for all that do you think that underlying demand is picking up for your businesses or is it still not clear? Like if you look at things of how the quarter progressed and then into April. Ernest Scott Santi : Yeah. I\u2019d say it\u2019s been pretty firm. I think it\u2019s a little early in a quarter to call with one quarters worth of data, but I think again in the aggregate things were pretty solid through the quarter, look at our consumer facing businesses where the overall demand rates have been pretty solid going back, you know, four or five quarters now, I think we\u2019re feeling good about where we sit in the kind of the overall demand picture that we saw in the first quarter. That being said it\u2019s still a pretty choppy environment out there, but there was no new worry beats based on our first quarter performance that we saw across the company. John Inch : Okay. So basically signs are very stable, but no sort of obvious inflections of sequential improvement on the comp right again adjusting for seasonality. Ernest Scott Santi : No. John Inch : Okay, good enough. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Joseph Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Ernest Scott Santi : Good morning. Joseph Ritchie : So I guess, my first question is on Auto, again first, solid quarter, but clearly you guys had a really, really tough comp, especially if you look on a two year stack. Is the expectations that growth starts to improve beyond the first quarter on your auto business just based on what you know on production schedules and where in the platforms that you are on? Michael Larsen : Yeah. So I think, you know, we talked about a tough comp in the first quarter due to the new programs launched in Europe and if you recall Europe last year was up 11% on builds of 1. So that comp will be with us for the year, but in terms of the year-over-year organic growth rate, as we sit here today looking at the typical seasonality Q1 is the low-point for the year and the organic growth rate on a year-over-year basis will improve as we go through the year. Joseph Ritchie : Okay, great. Thanks Michael. And maybe my following question moving onto Welding so clearly the part of your portfolio there has been a little bit more challenge, you guys mentioned half of the margin performance this quarter was related to restructuring action, does that start to tail-off as we progress through the year or how were you thinking about that business? I guess clearly on the face of it when you take a look at the detrimental, detrimental margins in the first quarter are pretty high, just trying to get a sense for how that business will project for the rest of the year? Michael Larsen : Yeah. So we had as you said about half of the impact in the first quarter here the margin decline down 9%, which is a pretty significant organic, about half of that was restructuring related. We expect a similar impact here in Q2 and then improvement in the second half of the year on the margin side. And obviously, the comparisons get significantly easier in the back half of the year. So last year in the first quarter Welding was down 3%, which sounds like an easy comp, but actually it\u2019s not when you look how the rest of 2015 unfolded. So the comps will get better as we go through this year based on current sequential trends that we look at we\u2019ll see flat to positive in the back half and the margins will improve also in the back half we have another slug of restructuring to get through in the second quarter. And then for now hopefully the worst is behind us. Joseph Ritchie : Okay, great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to follow-up on John\u2019s question. Hello can you hear me? Ernest Scott Santi : Yeah we can hear you. Nigel Coe : So there is some chatter that the March was a bit weaker than Jan and February for industrial markets. Did you see that, doesn\u2019t sound like you did given your comments? Ernest Scott Santi : We did not. Nigel Coe : Okay, good. Moving on to construction and construction was the stand out this quarter with 5% and 11% North America. And I\u2019m wondering is there any way to trying to understand how of this is weather driven, I\u2019m assuming the construction activity did benefit from weather and how much has been pulled forward from maybe 2Q into Q1? And maybe just characterize that by talking about how you exit the quarter on Construction Products was it pretty steady as well? Ernest Scott Santi : Yeah, to answer to your question is there is really no way to factor weather in in terms of how it might have impacted our results relative to whatever you might call it normalized year. So which is a big reason why we usually don\u2019t bite on any single quarter trends in construction as predictive or indicative of overall demand. I think what I would say is we certainly exited the quarter in pretty good shape there. And so I think we are not seeing anything slow down or ease up and we\u2019ll hope it continues through the balance of the year for sure. Nigel Coe : Okay, great. And just a quick follow-on on the construction, Europe is flat and we\u2019ve seen some signs of maybe green shoots in construction activity in Europe. But I know that UK is an important end market. So I\u2019m wondering can you maybe just talk about leasing in Europe as the UK starting to slow down for Europe and I see in some green shoots in Continental Europe? Ernest Scott Santi : No, we are not seeing anything slowdown. We are a bit of lager in terms of when our products are actually going on to the job it\u2019s well after the start phase. So I think in terms of color the overall sort of macro view over there from the standpoint construction is things are heading in the right direction. Nigel Coe : Great, thanks a lot guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Your line is now open. Andrew Kaplowitz : Good morning, guys. Nice quarter. Ernest Scott Santi : Thank you. Michael Larsen : Good morning. Andrew Kaplowitz : You\u2019re more than - you are four years into Enterprise Strategy and Q1 \u201816 appears to be your best quarter really in the last four years in terms of margin contribution from the Enterprise Strategy. So what surprising is that we would think that given tougher comparisons and given you are now obviously more than half way done with your initiatives, you are hitting this kind of performance. Can you give us a little more color as to what\u2019s going on? Is it just that your team is now better at implementing your initiatives are they nearly in the program or is that you are tackling more complicated areas of your business such as European Construction or Specific Products that you actually find it easier to improve efficiency? Ernest Scott Santi : Well, what I would probably say is that we are these were not a series of initiatives that we are all implemented simultaneously. So we are basically sequencing through. If you look at the progression that we laid out and we talked about this as early on that we were heavily focused on the portfolio, business structure simplification, sourcing we said all long had a ramp, if you remember that it was now famously known as the heat map from our first presentation. And then we had an initiative that was related to what we call business model excellence, which we\u2019re applying the ITW business model to be scaled up much more focused businesses and so what we are seeing today is much more now of an impact from sourcing the layer stage stuff. So it wasn\u2019t necessarily in all at once sort of level of execution across all those initiatives they were very intentionally laid out in the sequence because we had to get certain things done that will allow us to get to the next phase things. So some of the improvement that we are seeing and is just now sourcing and business model excellence starting to take over from BSS and the portfolio work that we did. And the other thing that I would say is you are starting to see some impact from incremental contribution from organic growth as we starting to make the pivot to growth. And Michael showed you a chart earlier, but if you look at that where we had the best margin performance in the quarter was in this the parts of the company that were generating most organic growth. So the elevated level of profitability and the incremental profit we generate and every dollar of organic is now starting to contribute as we move into this next phase of our strategy. Andrew Kaplowitz : Got it, Scott. So let me ask you about the pivot to growth that you\u2019ve talked before about 85% of your businesses is being ready to grow by the end of \u201816 from 60% I guess in the last year. So how many more businesses or even should we be thinking like this that you convert in 1Q as ready to grow. And when you do convert these are you seeing the growth progression of businesses that you expect. And you still have percentage point headwind on growth from PLS in the quarter I think you\u2019ve thought about 90 bps for the year. How does that progression work out, does it start falling does the headwind start falling significantly just at the very end of the year or does it start falling now? Ernest Scott Santi : Well to start with the last part first. The portfolio work that we\u2019re doing at the product line level at some point is going to dissipate. I think we are - frankly we\u2019re there is still a fair amount of that to do heading into \u201816. We won\u2019t know what that looks like for \u201817 fully until we get into the planning cycle, but I would say we\u2019re certainly moving in the direction of getting to the tailwind of that. And it will not be some ongoing maintenance that we do, but it will not be something we\u2019ll talk about anymore. Won\u2019t have a significant impact at some point. But it is a process that takes some time to work through. We have to move customers from product A to product B it\u2019s not something that we can just - we just start selling something. So it does take some work and there is a process attached to it. But I would expect that number in \u201817 will be lower than it was in \u201816. And certainly by the end of the \u201817 it should be a non-factor. On the first part of your question we are sort of executing the plan that we laid out. We are - I can\u2019t give you a number for how many crossed the transition line from preparing to grow to ready to grow in the first quarter, but we\u2019ve got a lot of planning around hitting that 85% level by year end. And at that point those businesses start to change their focus to grow as I would certainly note that it\u2019s not necessarily something where we look for an immediate ramp. But ultimately what it means is there is significant part of their organizational energy and effort 75% plus start to go into focusing on fully leveraging their organic growth potential. And from that we certainly expect a change in growth rate velocity inside those businesses. And we\u2019ve already shown that in places like Food Equipment and Automotive that have been that furthest ones down the path. Andrew Kaplowitz : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Raso from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. David Raso : Thank you. I know you maintained your organic sales growth guidance in total as well as total company sales, but maybe I missed it but did you change your outlook at all within the business segments? Any particular end markets be it global auto builds, construction starts I mean any color you can give us on changes within that keeping the total? Michael Larsen : No David, we didn\u2019t change anything by segment. So when we look at our internal planning like we said Automotive and as well as the other segments we\u2019re right on track in Q1. And so we haven\u2019t changed anything in terms of our outlook for the year by segments. David Raso : And then given the auto acquisition is still hopefully you are going to be closed to relatively soon. But the M&A front, obviously was not bigger deal. I assume you\u2019re still out looking at other things. Can you give us an update on how we should think about M&A as we move further into the year into next year? Michael Larsen : Yeah we are still focused on working the plan which is not - M&A is not a big priority. We have what we think is a terrific opportunity that we brought in, in this auto business. And we\u2019re focused on getting that one closed. There is and we\u2019ve talked about where these - where acquisitions fitting our strategy. This is we\u2019re going to - we'll look at things that we think can further support to reinforce the organic growth strategies of our seven segments. And there is probably two or three little bolt-on floating around at any given time. But not a big priority, our big priority is continuing to move down the path of executing these initiatives internally. Getting ourselves very focused then on fully leveraging the organic growth potential for other reasons I talked about earlier. With the incremental profitability from every dollar of organic revenue growth is by far the most accretive thing we can do. David Raso : Okay. And lastly I apologize if I missed it, but the share repo for the quarter what was... Michael Larsen : $500 million in line with the planning that we lead out. So think of the $2 billion as $500 million for a quarter is the way we\u2019ve planned it out. David Raso : That\u2019s helpful. Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray from RBC. Your line is now open. Deane Dray : I was hoping you\u2019d give us update on price cost in the quarter and then the outlook given some of the changes for some of the raws like steel for the balance of the year? Michael Larsen : Yeah Deane so price cost like I said was 20 basis points for the quarter right in line with our planning assumptions, right in line with what we saw last year and that remains our assumption for the rest of the year nothing unusual again this quarter by segment everything is on track. So that\u2019s the color I can give you. Deane Dray : Got it. And then just to go back on the comment at the beginning regarding the emphasis on GAAP earnings and I think I certainly applaud that I know from a quality of earnings standpoint that gets recognized. And so I was interested in hearing that you\u2019re doing somewhat we would call quite restructuring in Welding and you\u2019ve sized that for us what\u2019s the payback that you\u2019re expecting on that and is there any other quite restructuring going on elsewhere in the segments? Michael Larsen : The payback is on this project is typically less than the year this one is actually quite a bit better than that it\u2019s primarily focused on North America. And we do disclose the last page in the press release lays out restructuring by segment and you can see the most significant one is Welding this quarter like I said there\u2019ll be another series of restructuring here in Welding in Q2 and that we\u2019ll kind of update you as we go through the year. Deane Dray : And how much of that is cash? Michael Larsen : So it\u2019s actually all cash, but not significant I mean you look at how much cash we generate this does not don\u2019t think if it is having an impact on our capital allocation strategy. Deane Dray : Understood, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mig Dobre from Baird. Your line is now open. Mig Dobre : Great, thank you. Good morning. Maybe a clarification for me if you would, looking at slide number five where you\u2019re talking about your consumer and industrial businesses on a sequential basis so my understanding is that the sequential number that you\u2019re providing are adjusted for seasonality for the footnote on the page. I\u2019m looking at industrial businesses being down 5%, I think last quarter they were up 4% sequentially. So I\u2019m trying to sort of understand exactly what\u2019s going on in these industrial businesses? And in Welding specifically because that appears to be the driver here. Are things getting incrementally worse in Welding or was this simply that we had some sort of a pull forward of demand last quarter? Michael Larsen : No I wouldn\u2019t say there was any pull forward in demand I mean the reason for the sequential decline is essentially all Welding. Typically in Q1 versus Q4 like we said we would expect our Welding business to be up 3%, I mean it was actually down 3%. Test & Measurement which is the other segment in here was essentially stable from Q4 to Q1. So it\u2019s all Welding driven mix. Mig Dobre : Right. And I guess the spirit of my question was there is a sense out there maybe things are stabilizing in some of these end markets that have been really challenged in 2015 and in Welding you\u2019ve got exposure in a lot of them what\u2019s your read through based on the way your business is progressing? Michael Larsen : I think as Scott said earlier I think other than welding everything is stable and feels pretty firm as we start the year. In Welding we continue to see the impact on energy oil and gas which accounts for the decline on the international side, general fabrication is still challenged especially going into mining, agriculture heavy equipment. So the demand environment in terms of capital equipment going into the industrial economy we would describe as still sluggish and as Scott said we\u2019ve not seen any sign yet of improvement at this point. Mig Dobre : Okay. And then maybe\u2026 Michael Larsen : Go ahead. Mig Dobre : The last thing is when you\u2019re talking about volumes maybe being stable to slightly up in Welding in the back half I\u2019m trying to understand how you think about this business sequentially, seasonally? Michael Larsen : Yeah Mig that\u2019s purely a comparison current run rate. So at current run rates if you run those out and you look at on a year-over-year basis that\u2019s when you get 9% decline organic in Q1. You\u2019ll get us another decline in Q2 and then stable to up in the second half, flat to up in the back half of the year at current run-rate. That can obviously change, but at current run rates given the comparisons year-over-year that\u2019s what we would expect to see. Mig Dobre : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joel Tiss from BMO. Your line is now open. Joel Tiss : Alright, thank you very much. I just wondered if we can dig a little bit more into the food business. And can you give us any color on the different end markets and what some of the drivers in the improvement were and what the outlook is going to the next couple of quarters? Ernest Scott Santi : Yeah so Joe we feel very good about the first quarter, particularly if you look at North America up 5% and the equipment side up 4% service. From a product line standpoint, refrigeration and cooking are the big drivers this quarter. And then by end market it\u2019s really healthcare and lodging continue to be solid for us. But really across the board, we feel very good about the outlook for the year. We have a number of new products coming in here in Q2. And so we\u2019d expect that business to be up similar to last year in the 3% to 4% range as we talked about in the last call. Joel Tiss : Okay. Can we do the same thing for polymers and fluids? There are so many different end markets and different pieces. Can you just give us a little deeper color there too? Thank you. Ernest Scott Santi : Yeah what I would offer on polymers and fluids is it\u2019s a basically an MRO business. Two thirds of it the third is the automotive aftermarket piece, the automotive aftermarket side of it they had a pretty solid quarter up 2%. I think largely how I would characterize the overall growth performance on the quarter is they\u2019ve gotten to the end of a pretty extensive PLS process and are starting to now - the product line is much more stable than it\u2019s been over the last eight quarters and they\u2019re starting to now turn their attention more to growth. And so very pleased to see positive overall organic out of that segment in the quarter. Joel Tiss : Alright, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andy Casey from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Andy Casey : Thanks, good morning. Kind of a detail question to start the 50 basis point drag in components on margin that you call out on slide seven. Your mentioned the overhead inflation could you provide a little bit more detail on what\u2019s driving that inflation? Michael Larsen : Salary increases. Andy Casey : Good for you guys. Then on the follow-up, if we look at some of the macro data the inventory to sales ratios are relatively high in the U.S. in some areas, have you guys seen any change in customer inventory actions meaning destock restock or is it just pretty consistent based on your commentary about overall trends outside of Welding? Michael Larsen :  I\u2019d say very consistent. And you\u2019re seeing little bit of seasonality in Q1, but if you look at the first quarter relative to the first quarter last year, really solid working capital performance and nothing unusual. And just look at the free cash flow number 90% the average is about last few years has been 65%. So really strong cash flow performance again in the first quarter and keep in mind that we typically ramp up from here. So from a conversion standpoint this is typically our lowest quarter and then we will go up sequentially as we go through the year just typical seasonality. So nothing unusual in terms of working capital, continued strong performance. Andy Casey : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Volkmann from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Steve Volkmann : Hi, good morning. Scott I think you mentioned that the best return that you could come up with I am paraphrasing here was basically incremental margin on organic growth. And I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019ve changed the way that you\u2019re thinking about that and it seems like in 2017 maybe we\u2019ll get a little less PLS headwind. And maybe we get a little organic growth if we were to have a couple of points of organic growth in \u201817, my number is not yours, but what - how do you think about incrementals against that backdrop? Ernest Scott Santi : Well. What I said was that the incremental profit from every dollar of incremental - dollar of organic revenue was the highest value opportunity that we had and really what we were focused on leveraging towards full potential not the percentage. And we\u2019ve talked about incremental margin, so our target is roughly 35% going forward in terms of conversion to the bottom line from every incremental dollar of organic growth, that will vary up or down a little bit depending on the segment and if anything I would expect we would comfortably do that or be even a little bit better given the elevated levels of profitability that we\u2019re now operating at. Steve Volkmann : Okay, great. That\u2019s exactly what I was looking for. And then just on Test & Measurement and Electronics, the absolute levels margin there is still not quite in line with some of your others and I know there is a fair amount of acquisition related intangibles et cetera, but is that kind of an okay level in your mind for that business, is that just kind of what that business can do or is there some sort of bigger picture thing that you can do to get that sort of more into the mid-20s? Michael Larsen : So what I would say is 15.5% operating margin includes as you point out the 420 basis points of non-cash amortization expense, so you add that back, it\u2019s about 20 it\u2019s still on the lower end inside of ITW, we expect all of our businesses continue to improve margins some will as you saw more than others and I would probably put Test & Measurement in that category of more margin potential than some of the other segments. So we expect that segment to continue to improve on the margin side including in 2016 as\u2026 Ernest Scott Santi : These amortization charges also bleed off over time. Michael Larsen : Amortization charges, as well as the Enterprise Initiatives, exactly. Steve Volkmann : Great, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sean Williams from BB&T Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Sean Williams : Hi, good morning. Michael Larsen : Good morning. Sean Williams : Wonder, if we just maybe go back to Food Equipment, certainly the margin improvements within that segment has been tremendous over last several years; I just wonder if you could talk a little bit about kind of where we\u2019d go from here? I mean, obviously the - I\u2019d expect maybe further improvement in the back half of the year just kind of seasonal speaking, but I don\u2019t know can just talk about what are the kind of the big opportunities for Food Equipment given that, you\u2019re already kind of approaching best-in-class margins there? Ernest Scott Santi : Like I said, I mean, we expect all of our segments to improve including Food Equipment, certainly good progress, but also more to come. And I think, we\u2019ll give you - if you look at the schedule and the back of the press release you can see the various components. And so the margin expansion now is half is operating leverage and the other half approximately is the Enterprise Initiatives and within Food Equipments specifically, yes. So we\u2019d expect that business to continue to improve. Sean Williams : Alright, that\u2019s helpful. And then, could we just maybe come back and maybe your thoughts on kind of some of the overseas markets. Could you just maybe talk generally kind of industrial versus consumer facing for Asia Pacific I know that that look like sequentially it was down I know that was a tough comp, but just where you\u2019re seeing in Asia Pacific and then any green sheets in Europe as well? Michael Larsen : So I wouldn\u2019t - we\u2019re not going parse it much more than what we did in the prepared remarks and what you can see on page six. And the outlook for the rest of the year in the Asia Pacific is growth rates very similar to what we saw here in the Q1 certainly encouraged by China Automotive of 6%, as well as continued progress on the - in Construction Products, which as may know is primarily Australia based. So that\u2019s how we would describe that. Sean Williams : And then any thoughts on Europe? Michael Larsen : Europe, I think for the year we expect very similar again to Q1. So up in the very low single-digits based on current run rates. Sean Williams : Alright. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Jamie Cook : Hi, good morning. Just two quick clarifications, one, I think within auto you talked about in your prepared remarks being able to grow I think 2 to 4 points better than whatever the market is doing. Just in terms of the clarification does that include the auto acquisition or is that exclusive of the auto acquisition? And then last just another question on the guide, I\u2019m sort of struggling with how you don\u2019t get to the mid or high end given the first quarter, given FX, given commentary industrialist very stable outside of Welding I mean what... I\u2019m just trying to figure out what you did in your repo is what price cost be the biggest risk? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of what you\u2019re most concerned about? Thanks. Ernest Scott Santi : On the first question that growth target we talked about is it does not include the acquisition, that\u2019s core organic and that\u2019s our expectation both for \u201816 and our longer term growth target for the auto OEM segment. With respect to the balance of the year Michael talked about it before. The currency is there is no win in trying to forecast where currency goes. So we\u2019ve always sort of use current run rates on currency. We use obviously at the quarterly levels they move around. So there is - we are not going to forward forecast where currency is going to be, Michael\u2019s comment was that if everything stayed exactly where it was - two comments that I\u2019ll repeat. One is that we are impacted by more than just the euro, Aussie dollar, Canadian dollar, also reasonably material factors, as is the pound. And then the other part of that is if everything stay exactly where it is and I don\u2019t know if you marking the market today Michael but around right now that there is probably a few pennies of upside is on the full year basis. Who knows if that will happen and may go the other\u2026 Jamie Cook : I just wanted to get a sense more on the end market side, because again consumer is pretty good outside of Welding industrial is pretty stable. And I\u2019m just more on an end market or geography where you are most concerned. Ernest Scott Santi : I think generally speaking we are feeling like the first quarter was pretty solid, pretty firm. We have talked about this before, we are basically taking current run rates and projecting those through the year. And that\u2019s how we derive our growth and earnings forecast for the year. So if things stay where they are today we\u2019re in pretty solid shape. Jamie Cook : Okay, thanks a lot. Ernest Scott Santi : Yeah. Jamie Cook : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Ann Duignan : Hi, good morning. One of my questions has been answered. But maybe taking Jaime\u2019s question and asking it a slightly different way. What would have to happen for you to come in at the low end of your Q2 guidance and then the high end of your Q2 guidance? What are you contemplating in those ranges? Ernest Scott Santi : The drivers would be of variance from current run rates either better or worse than what we see today. So that would be the primary driver. I think on the things that are within our own control in terms of the so called self-help Enterprise Initiatives, we feel very good about continuing to execute the way we have for the last since we embarked on the enterprise strategy. So I think those are on the margin side very solid. Michael Larsen : The delta is the demand side. Ernest Scott Santi : Right. Ann Duignan : But within which segments, when you are putting your plan together where do you think the down side risk is, where do you think the up side risk is? Ernest Scott Santi : I think here is what I\u2019d say, I would say one of the real strengths of the company and we talked about this is really well balanced, diversified, high quality portfolio of businesses. And so if certain things are better than run rates in one part of the company it will offset in other pre-existing. And so I wouldn\u2019t - I can\u2019t go down the path by segment how we think about this. Ann Duignan : Okay. And maybe as a follow-up and within welding it does seem to be the one segment where maybe you are not as upbeat about where things are, can you just talk about - a little bit about the difference we are seeing in oil and gas at this point versus you did talk about fabrication for mining and heavy equipment, have any of those end-markets gotten incrementally worse or is it just they\u2019re bad and they aren\u2019t getting any better? Ernest Scott Santi : I think like we said earlier I mean Welding did decelerate in Q1 versus Q4. And when you look at the year-over-year decline, the more than half of that organic decline is oil and gas. So that is the main driver and it like we said earlier, we haven\u2019t seen any signs that things are getting better there yet. Ann Duignan : And on the industrial side? Ernest Scott Santi : Those are fairly stable. The decline is primarily on the oil and gas side. So\u2026 Ann Duignan : Okay, thank you. I leave it there. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher from UBS. Your line is now open. Steven Fisher : Great, thanks. Good morning. I just want to come back to the price cost that Deane was asking about before, because the cost have risen as the core has gone along. So maybe how are the pricing discussions going at the start of Q2? Are those adjusting kind of in real time to more than offset the higher input cost, how do you keep that price cost stable? Michael Larsen : Well I mean I am not sure how to answer that, other than what I said earlier in my prepared remarks and the response to Deane\u2019s question. Price cost was favorable 20 points no change. And we expect it to remain at 20 basis points as we go through the year. And if that changes we\u2019ll let you know over the next earnings call. But we don\u2019t expect it to. Steven Fisher : And so basically it sounds like you\u2019re able to raise prices to offset the costs as it increased. Michael Larsen : If you look at our historical performance and what I just said, that would be the conclusion, yes. Steven Fisher : Okay. And then just summarize this, I know it\u2019s been discussed before, but does your base case assume that the industrial facing businesses exist the year neutral or positive or there will it still be declining? Ernest Scott Santi : Well the base case is take the order rates where you\u2019re getting today on a daily basis and project them through the end of the year. The comps get easier as Michael said, but we are projecting no acceleration or further deceleration from here. And we\u2019ve talked about that before we are a fast reactor we\u2019re not a predictor on the future. So embedded in both our organic numbers and our EPS forecast is an assumption that demand stays exactly where it is today across all seven segments projected out through the rest of the year. Steven Fisher : So will the comps get you to neutral in industrial facing by exiting the year then? Ernest Scott Santi : It may be close. Steven Fisher : Okay, thank you. Ernest Scott Santi : Great. And that takes us to the top of the hour. We appreciate everybody\u2019s time this morning and have an outstanding day. Operator : Thank you, speakers. And that concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion of today's conference. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Michael Larsen, the Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Sir, you may begin. Michael Larsen : Thank you, May. Good morning and welcome to ITW's second quarter 2016 conference call. I'm Michael Larsen, ITW's SVP and CFO and joining me this morning is our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi. During today's call, we will discuss our second quarter 2016 financial results and update you on our 2016 earnings forecast. Following our comments, we will be happy to take your questions. And so that we can accommodate as many people as possible, we will limit each Q&A participant to one question and one follow-up question. Before we get to the results, let me remind you that this presentation contains our financial forecast for the 2016 third quarter and full-year, as well as other forward-looking statements identified on this slide. We refer you to the company's 2015 Form 10-K and Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2016 for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Also, this presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures. While we use very few non-GAAP measures a reconciliation of those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Scott. Scott Santi : Thanks, Michael, and good morning. Overall we were very pleased with our second quarter performance as we continue to execute well and as a result delivered strong results and set several new all-time performance records for the company. EPS of a $1.46 was up 12% year-on-year and came in $0.07 above the midpoint of our guidance, $0.04 from better margins, a penny from slightly higher revenue and $0.02 from non-operating items largely related to our minority ownership interest in our former decorative services segment. Operating income of $792 million was up 8% year-on-year and was the highest quarterly operating income in the company's history. Q2 operating margins of 23.1% were up 180 basis points and after-tax ROIC improved 260 basis points to 22.9% both of which were all-time records for the company. As I commented in our Q2 earnings release, these record results reinforce our conviction and the performance potential of ITW's business model and reflect directly on the great progress that our people around the world continue to make in positioning the company to leverage it to its full potential. While we have made significant progress in this regard over the last 3.5 years, we see plenty of opportunity for further improvement ahead. I'm also pleased with the progress that we\u2019re making in our transition to focusing on accelerating organic growth. Organic growth excluding PLS impact of 2% of the enterprise level was pretty solid in this environment particularly when factoring in the 11% decline in our welding segment in the quarter. All six of our other segments delivered a positive year-on-year organic growth in Q2. Net of welding in PLS impact organic growth for our six other segments combined with 4% in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis our 2016 organic growth rate has improved by 130 basis points versus full year 2015 despite significant further erosion in welding demand and tough first half comps in our auto OEM segment. A couple of final comments before I turn the call back to Michael. First earlier this month we completed the acquisition of the Engineered Fasteners & Components business from ZF TRW. This is a great addition of the company and I would like to publicly welcome the 3500 plus members of the EF&C team to ITW. And second I would like to once again thank all of my ITW colleagues around the world for the great job that they continue to do in serving our customers and executing our strategy with excellence. Michael? Michael Larsen : Thank you, Scott and good morning everybody. Once again ITW delivered another strong quarter with high quality of earnings and solid execution and improving growth performance in many parts of the company drove record results. We grew GAAP EPS 12% to a $1.46 and exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range. Organic revenue was up 2% growth, 1% when including PLS, with fairly stable demand globally and improving organic growth focus and performance across the company. Good progress in Q2 with 6 of 7 segments achieving positive organic growth with welding the only exception. In Q2 of last year, 3 out of 7 segments were growing organically. Consumer facing businesses were up 3%, industrial facing down 2%, no material change from Q1. On the regional basis North America was up 0.4%, EMEA up 2.9%, APAC up 1% and China was up 0.4%. A comment on the U.K. which represents 5% of ITW sales. In Q2 our U.K. sales were up 2% with no signs of a slowdown and in our opinion it is too early to tell what the longer term impact from Brexit may be. But at current FX rate, the weakening of the British Pound is modestly unfavorable which is expected into our updated guidance. As Scott mentioned we established new all-time records on a number of our key performance metrics, operating margin of 23.1% up 180 basis points versus last year. Enterprise initiatives contributed 120 basis points to margin expansion with price cost and volume leverage and other contributing the remaining 60 basis points. We grew operating income 8% to $792 million making this the most profitable quarter ever in ITW's history. After-tax, ROIC improved 260 basis points and was also new all time record at 22.9%. We invested about $140 million in our businesses for growth and productivity. Free cash flow of $471 million was up 23% versus Q2 of last year and 90% to net income conversion was consistent with typical Q2 seasonality. In the second quarter we allocated $500 million to share repurchases and plan to repurchase an additional $1 billion in the second half bringing the total for the full year to approximately $2 billion with $1.2 billion from overseas funds and about $ 800 million from normal surplus cash flow. In the second quarter ITW operating margin exceeded 23% for the first time and we listed the margin drivers on the right side of the page starting with 120 basis points from our enterprise initiatives. Price cost came in as expected modestly favorable 20 basis points and volume leverage and other contributed the balance. Continued strong margin expansion across the company with construction product up 440 basis points to 24.3%, Food Equipment of 300 basis points to 25%, Specialty Products, Test & Measurement and Electronics both up 250 basis points and Automotive up 130 basis points to 25.8%. Polymers & Fluids was flat due to restructuring and in welding despite a 140 basis points of restructuring impact the quarter, operating margin was 24.9%. Welding's peak-to-trough revenues are now down approximately 20% and yet operating margins are still solid in the mid 20s. This performance although pretty challenging cycle is a good example of the resilience of the ITW business model. Turning to the segment discussion and starting with Automotive OEM, another solid quarter with organic revenue up 4% against the top comparison last year as Scott mentioned earlier. In North America 3% organic growth, Europe was up 8% and China was up 13% despite the fact that overall bills were only up 4% and flat at Western OEMs. We expect growth rates to continue to improve in the second half as comparisons get a little easier. Another very solid quarter in Food Equipment up 5% organically with broad-based strength on the equipment side including refrigeration, warewash, cooking and scales. North America was up 6% despite the top comparison with equipment up 9% driven by end market demand in K through 12 lodging, health care and retail and service was up 1%. International was up 3% with equipment up 4% and service up 2%. And continued strong margin performance as volume leverage and savings from enterprise initiatives improved operating margin at 300 basis points to 25%. Also a very solid quarter for Test & Measurement and Electronics, as organic revenue grew 3%. Electronics platform grew 6% due to end market strength in solar and semiconductor. We talked about the margin expansion potential in the segment before, and we were pleased to see 250 basis points of improvement to 18.6%. And remember that the 18.6% includes 370 basis points of acquisition related non cash amortization charges which will beat up over time. Declines in welding demand continued in Q2 with organic revenue down 11% in the quarter with equipment down 13% and consumables down 10%. The decline breaks down as 5 points from oil and gas, 5 points from industrial which is mostly heavy equipment related to agriculture, infrastructure and mining and 1 point from commercial. North America was down 8% with equipment down 10% and consumables down 5%. International was down 21% again due largely to oil and gas. If demand holds steady at current levels year-on-year percentage declines should moderate in the back half of 2016 due to easier comps. And like I said earlier, solid operating margin performance of 24.9% which includes 140 basis points of restructuring impact. Polymers and fluids delivered another quarter of positive organic revenue growth of 2% as this segment continues its pivot to growth after an extensive period of PLS process over the last three plus years. On a regional basis North America was up 1 and international was up 3%. Approximately half of the segment revenues are related to automotive aftermarket which grew 3%. The balance is primarily industrial MRO applications as fluids improve 1% and polymers was flat. Overall margins were unchanged at 20.9% which includes 70 basis points of restructuring impact.  As with our Test & Measurement and Electronics segment 20.9% includes 420 basis points of acquisition related non-cash amortization charges. Another solid quarter in construction products as organic revenue increased 3%, North America was down 1% with a tough year-over-year comparison of 15% in Q2 last year. Renovation remodeling was down 6% after being up 22% in the first quarter and in the quarter - in North America commercial was up 5% and residential up 1% and overall we feel like we\u2019re exiting the quarter in good shape from a demand perspective. On the last call we talked about how quarterly numbers in construction can be a little choppy and not necessarily a good indicator of overall levels of demand. To normalize trends, if you look at North America in the first half up 4%, renovation remodel up 6%, commercial up 7% and residential up 2%, you get a more accurate picture of the underlying levels of demand which are pretty solid. Asia Pacific was up 7% due to Australia, Europe was up 6% driven by the U.K. up 7%, France up 6% and Germany up 10%. And again very strong progress in operating margin up 440 basis points to 24.3%. Finally another solid quarter in specialty products with organic revenue flat, solid growth in consumer packaging offset by some lumpiness on the equipment side. And very good progress on our operating margin with an increase of 250 basis points to 26%. Turning to EF&C, we\u2019re very pleased to complete this terrific acquisition on July 1. As you know in the automotive OEM space, with ITW's very focused strategic positioning, we\u2019ve demonstrated the ability to outgrow global auto builds by over 400 basis points on average since 2012. And given the visibility that we have in this business, we are confident that we will continue to outgrow auto builds by 200 to 400 basis points over the next several years. We are excited about adding EF&C to ITW because it gives us some additional leverage on this very focused strategy and broadens our ability to serve and grow with our global and regional automotive OEM and Tier customers. It expands our ability to drive our global content per vehicle and increase our share of the relevant market. For reference, our global content of $30 per vehicle compares to a relevant market that is greater than $200 per vehicle. Specifically EF&C adds a number of things to our current position. First of all it adds several new strategic differentiated product platforms that have similar characteristics to the core product platform that we support today. And on a regional basis with its global strategically located manufacturing facilities, it is very complimentary to our geographic footprint which is a little more weighted towards North America. So it gives us better global balance overall. And certainly we continue to see significant potentials to leverage our 80/20 business management process and help the EF&C team continue to improve its operating metrics. Operating margin entering ITW are about 10%, and we\u2019re confident that we have a clear path to doubling that rate at a minimum over the next 5 years. EF&C already has a very experienced and capable operating team with a reputation for delivering reliable quality and excellent customer service performance. From the standpoint of the transaction and the financial components, purchase price of $450 million is less than one-time sales and the business is actually performing slightly better than expected. The 2016 financial impact is 2.20 million to 2.40 million of revenues, so 110 to 120 in Q3 and in Q4. From a margin standpoint, EF&C has dilutive approximately 50 basis points to ITW operating margin and after tax ROIC and dilutive approximately 200 basis points to the Automotive OEM segment. So to be clear, excluding EF&C we would have guided to approximately 23% operating margin for the full year to-date including the EF&C we\u2019re maintaining our prior guidance of greater than 22.5%. From an EPS standpoint, we expect no impact in 2016 due to typical acquisition accounting related impacts but certainly accretive in 2017. And we are confident that we can generate after tax returns in the mid to high teens by year seven.  Last page, our updated guidance for 2016 assumes current foreign exchange rates and includes the acquisition of EF&C. We're raising full year GAAP EPS guidance by $0.10 at the midpoint to a new range of $5.50 to $5.70. The $5.60 midpoint represents 9% earnings growth on the year-over-year basis. We expect that demand remains stable at current levels and as a result we\u2019re narrowing our full year organic growth forecast to 1% to 2% due to the more challenging than expected market conditions in welding. Consistent with prior forecast our guidance includes approximately one percentage point of PLS impacts, so excluding PLS we expect full year organic revenue growth of 2% to 3%. Keep in mind that while PLS does reduce revenues in the short term, it is both a critical driver of our margin performance and a key component of our portfolio management strategy, as we exit slower growth product lines and focus on our most compelling opportunities to accelerate organic growth at ITW caliber margins. As I said earlier operating margin guidance is unchanged at greater than 22.5% but now includes approximately 50 basis points of dilution from EF&C. We're maintaining our previously communicated target of $2 billion in share repurchases for the year and finally for the third quarter our GAAP EPS guidance including EF&C is $1.42 to $1.52 assuming operating margin of approximately 23% and 1% to 3% organic growth. So that concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open up the call to your questions. Please be brief and as a reminder one question and one follow-up question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Mr. Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Joseph Ritchie : Thanks and good morning, everyone. So I guess my first question is on organic growth. It was nice to see the organic growth improvement in 2Q versus 1Q despite the weakness that you guys saw in welding. I'm just curious, as you look into the third quarter guidance of 1% to 3%, are you seeing underlying trends improve as you exit the quarter because it seems like you're guiding to a number that's slightly better in the comps on a two year basis - don't really change much. Michael Larsen : Well, Joe, if you look at it, we are assuming current levels of demand going into Q3 and the slight bump in overall year-over-year organic growth rate is due to the comps. So we\u2019re assuming no acceleration in Q3 or Q4 at current demand levels. Joseph Ritchie : Okay. Michael, and then I guess - I mean we're current - where were you exiting the quarter at demand levels that were slightly better as you progressed through the quarter? I'm just curious to\u2026 Scott Santi : Pretty steady - pretty steady through the quarter. Michael Larsen : Yes, it was a pretty steady as we went through the quarter on the monthly basis like we said pretty firm overall in the second quarter and we feel pretty good going into Q3 and Q4. Joseph Ritchie : Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then I guess my one follow-up - maybe touching on welding for a second since clearly trends got a little bit worse this quarter. It was really nice to see the decrementals were solid on the welding side. I'm just wondering if trends persist are you expecting the same type of decrementals for the second half of the year? And then to your comment earlier, Michael, on how to think about welding for the second half, are you just assuming like maybe a 3 to 4 point improvement because comps eased by that much for the second half of the year? A \u2013 Michael Larsen : Yes, the expectation through the balance of the year on the revenue side for welding and current demand rates were down mid-single digits in Q3and Q4. That slightly-- the rate is better because of the comps get easier, but we're \u2013 in our scenario based on what we're seeing right now, we're still expecting some further decline. From the standpoint of the incremental margins they should be certainly right in line; some of the benefits from the structuring charges that we incurred in Q2 should start to show up in Q3 and Q4. Scott Santi : Yes, these are pretty steady margins as we go into the back half based on what we know today. Joseph Ritchie : Okay. Great, thanks guys. I\u2019ll get back in queue. Operator : Our next question is from Mr. John Inch from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. John Inch : Thanks, good morning everyone. EF&C just now that the deal's closed, what sort of intangible amortization is part of this deal and what kind of accretion are we looking at next year assuming the run rate? Michael Larsen : Yes, so what I can tell you in terms of accretion our view is that this will be modestly accretive in 2017. But let's get in there and take a look and make sure we give you a more accurate view than probably when we get to our Analyst Day in December we'll be able to give you a little bit more detail. But we just bought the business, we got to get in there and then we'll give you a more accurate view. Q \u2013 John Inch : Did you say anything on the intangible amortization, Michael? A \u2013 Michael Larsen : We are not completely done yet, so it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate to comment on that. I mean, I think again we will expect no EPS impact here in the second half of the year neutral on EPS slightly dilutive our margins and then the next year modestly accretive with accelerating benefits beyond that. Q \u2013 John Inch : All right. So shifting gears, I appreciate your comments on the UK. I think other companies have more or less said it's still too early to say anything. It's hard from our perspective, I mean generically our perspective, to surmise why Europe doesn't suffer some sort of economic deferral or confidence issues. Certainly you can see European investors rotating into US stocks. They're clearly concerned. Right? My question - you guys have a lot of European exposure relative to other industrial companies. What - you've done a fantastic job and you've clearly - I think people see the flex in your business model. But I can't imagine you're complacent. Right? So I'm trying to understand - what is your strategy for managing through what could be possibly deteriorating fundamentals in Europe? And as the crawl rate to that, you - I'd like to know how this perhaps dovetails into your own M&A strategy. And specifically you clearly want to do more deals, you just don't want to put the cart before the horse. But if things were to deteriorate, does that cause you to do more deals sooner perhaps or just push them out? Just how are you think about that? I'm sorry the question is long. There's just a lot of context to it. Scott Santi : Let me try to hit all the points and let me know if I miss anything, right. I think overall our strategy is no different than how we operate the company day-to-day which is we are \u2013 we have a very - on a relative basis a very flexible cost structure, we are a fast reactor; we're not a predictor of the future. And I think as you\u2019re seeing in welding right now we are certainly confident in our ability to react in an effective way to whatever sort of the cards, however the cards play out in Europe. I think right now and it's certainly reflected in our Q2results there we're not seeing anything yet it's obviously very early. But I think overall I don't really see any difference between sort of the kind of contingency planning we would do around the whole Brexit situation and the other contingency planning that we would do relative to global macroeconomic conditions generally in whatever region of the world. From an M&A standpoint, I think all I would say that go back to where we\u2019ve talked about repeatedly which is the primary focus of the company right now is, is that we\u2019ve got a collection in our view of terrific assets and our primary focus is operating the assets we already have to the best of our ability and there is certainly more runway to go in terms of getting to our \u2013 from where we are to what we view as our full potential. And the M&A we\u2019re doing is really largely bolting on to one of the existing seven businesses that we have and as those opportunities, you know, if should other opportunities emerge at our good faith we will certainly not hesitate. But I think we are very convicted about our ability to continue to grow earnings, growing and continue to improve the operating metrics of the businesses that we own. Q \u2013 John Inch : Maybe one more, Scott, just because you're such a big company in Europe, has Brexit or other issues in Europe caused you as a corporation to defer or modify what otherwise investments you might have been making into Europe and/or step up PLS in some manner or restructuring? Scott Santi : No. It\u2019s just way too early. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to panic and I certainly don\u2019t think we want to try to anticipate what\u2019s going to happen because nobody knows. But I wouldn\u2019t go back to what I said earlier I think our view to react effectively quickly to whatever happens is pretty solid. Q \u2013 John Inch : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Mr. David Raso from Evercore. Your line is now open. David Raso : Hi, good morning. I know it's a little early being July but sort of the setup into the December meeting is going to be important about accelerating the organic growth and you laid out about a year and a half ago the idea of businesses getting ready to grow. And it seems like a fairly sizable increase in the amount of your business as you feel will be ready to grow going into next year than this year. Can you help us point out which of the businesses do you feel are entering that phase and we should look at particularly into next year as the ones that will make that jump to being ready to grow? Scott Santi : Well, we\u2019re \u2013 at the segment level, you know, within each of our segments there are businesses that are certainly there. I\u2019m trying to sort of \u2013 it\u2019s really hard to get at your question, I think clearly based on current performance autos very far along, for the equipment very far along I think we are making some really strong progress in the other five segments. And it\u2019s not a matter of flipping the switch going from not ready to ready. It\u2019s more of an acceleration overtime as more as of the division in five each segment make that transition. In my view is that we\u2019ve \u2013 our second quarter results certainly reflect solid progress in the right direction and you can \u2013 we will - we expect it to continue to improve quarter-by-quarter. But it\u2019s not a matter of \u2013 it\u2019s not a matter of flipping the switch and going from not focus on growth to all in with both feet. David Raso : I'm just trying to figure out, Scott, the idea of - of course the ability to grow is trying to be characterized as not necessarily that sensitive to the end market. Right? It's more of a change in attitude about how you're going to push the business going forward. But I'm just trying to package that in so which of the end markets that maybe I'm more comfortable with or less comfortable with in 2017. So I was just trying to pinpoint where are those particular end businesses that at least you kind of see as their attitude's going to change a bit 2016 going into 2017. It's been building towards it. Just so I can kind of track that progression as we exit 2016 into 2017. Are there some businesses you would at least highlight outside of auto and food right? Those are already pretty far along. Welding's obviously got some macro issues. Maybe those comp C's. But if you can just help us a little bit to flesh it out for our own field work. Michael Larsen : Yes, I mean David as Scott said, this is really a process that\u2019s being orchestrated to vision all level. So we have 84 divisions at the end of last year, 60% of our revenues were in that ready-to-grow category. And we look at the progress every quarter and we are on track to get to the 85% ready-to-grow. So most of the company will be in a position to accelerate organic growth going into '17 and it\u2019s a gradual timeline. So every month, every quarter divisions reach that phase of being ready-to-grow and that\u2019s at the segment level we have different levels of progress based on when the segments really start to focus on the organic growth, strategy. And so it\u2019s hard to really comment at the segment and the end market level beyond what we just walked you through. David Raso : Okay. So I mean just to leave it as then bigger picture - macro the same a year from now as it is today, the idea is with 25% more of the more of the Company ready to grow going into 2017 than you had going in 2016, the base case should be the Company should be able to accelerate as organic. Michael Larsen : That\u2019s fair. A \u2013 Scott Santi : Well, and you saw the slide, the second slide, really illustrates that point, right, where you look at our first half growth rate relative to last year in an environment that\u2019s pretty similar. Good progress on the overall organic growth rate at the enterprise level. David Raso : And the PLS drag is less next year than this year? That's still base case? A \u2013 Scott Santi : Yes, we have to get through the planning process here in the fall. But I think it\u2019s reasonable to assume that PLS will be less than '17 than in '16. David Raso : Terrific. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Operator : Next question is from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Q \u2013 Nigel Coe : Yes, thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to circle back to welding. And I think, Scott, you mentioned that the comps get a lot easier in the second half of the year. And you're assuming that the business is sequentially stable from 2Q. We get into that mid single-digit declines. I'm just wondering, just given the normalcy of knowing that business, do you think 2Q represents a flaw for that business or would you expect second half to be a little bit lower in line with normalcy now. A \u2013 Scott Santi : I don\u2019t think of that. I wouldn\u2019t - given what we\u2019re seeing I would certainly not call it a floor. I think, our expectation heading into the year was that \u2013 that was going to flatten out at some point in '16. And clearly that\u2019s you know based on the first two quarters. We\u2019re not seeing that. So I \u2013 I think we got to see what the future holds there a little bit. But our planning assumption is I think sufficiently conservative in terms of it's you know impacting the overall forecast for the back half of the year. But it\u2019s still a pretty choppy environment and Michael gave you some numbers before down to 15% year-on-year in industrial oil and gas. Six quarters in here it\u2019s still pretty challenging. Q \u2013 Nigel Coe : Yes. Understand. And then just switching to price cost as a follow-on. 20 bps relatively modest. Maybe can you just maybe decompose that between price and raws? And the reason why is that obviously we've got steel inflation coming through in the next six to nine months. And I'm wondering how we should think about that price cost gap developing. A \u2013 Scott Santi : Yes. So Nigel as the price cost came in as expected as you point out and slightly favorable a 20 basis points again. And as you know maybe different from some other companies, price cost has not been a significant margin driver over the last three years. And I think what\u2019s going on inside the businesses is really with the support from our strategic sourcing team. The businesses are closely monitoring the material cost side and taking appropriate action on the price side. And on both price and material costs, we\u2019ve not seen any significant impact or any change in terms of the result in the second quarter. And so going forward we remain confident that we can continue to generate this type of modest price cost favorability on a go forward basis. Q \u2013 Nigel Coe : Okay, I\u2019ll leave at that. Thank you. Operator : Nest question is from Mr. Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is now open. Q \u2013 Andrew Kaplowitz : Hi, good morning, guys. So Test & Measurements and Electronics return to growth for the first time I think since mid-2014. How much of the improvement is the markets getting better versus easier comparison versus ITW's specific focus on pivotal growth? I know you're probably going to say all three, but if there's any additional color on what is going on there that'd be helpful. And have you seen any increase in capital equipment spent on the Test & Measurement side? And electronics at 6%, you mentioned the strength in semis does seem like a pretty strong result versus what you can see. Scott Santi : Yes, I think the way I would characterize it is things pretty stable on a Test & Measurement side but no big and or even modest improvement in terms of underlying buying activity but certainly a solid stable performance. And on the Electronic side as we talked about some nice sequential improvement in the two sectors that you referenced. I think we want to see another quarter or two before we decide that that\u2019s a long term trend. But overall it\u2019s a nice improvement. Q \u2013 Andrew Kaplowitz : Okay. That's helpful, Scott. And maybe - you've obviously done very well versus the enterprise strategy goal that you've set now really several years ago. How do we think about - it's tough organic growth environment here in 2016 again. But the one goal that's out there you doing 20 basis points better than global industrial production still seemed a little hard to achieve if welding continues to be weak. How do you look at that goal here over the next couple of years? Do you need welding to improve? Can you do it with still weak welding if the other segments are good? How do you look at that goal? A \u2013 Scott Santi : Well, I think if welding continues to shrink 11% a quarter it certainly going to be a tough. It\u2019s going to be a tough not to crack. But clearly that\u2019s not our expectation. I don\u2019t think it would be anybody\u2019s expectation that\u2019s a \u2013 that whole industry is a core part of the industrial economy around the world. We have a terrific position in it. They are certainly sort of the double whammy right now of oil and gas and slow industrial investment but all of that\u2019s creating a lot of pent-up demand at the same time. So things going around in our history in welding is that coming out of these sort of down cycles in the market. There is 8 to 12 quarter run of some really strong recovery. I don\u2019t think there is anything fundamental exchange in our view of in terms of the overall attractiveness of the welding market. And so I think in general what I would point to in terms of our \u2013 and our conviction remains unchanged in terms of our goal. We've worked really hard to shape this portfolio, so that we are operating in spaces everywhere where the product really matters to the customers as long as we continue to generate solutions that will help our customers serve their customers better. And we\u2019ve got plenty of room to outgrow the underlying economy and we are not step off that a one bit in terms of our both our commitment to it and all the efforts going on inside the company to make that happen. Q \u2013 Andrew Kaplowitz : All right. Thanks, Scott. Operator : Next question is from Deane Dray from RBC. Your line is now open. Q \u2013 Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to circle back on EF&C and some more specifics on the business now that you own it. And, Scott, you called out some new platforms. I'd be interested in hearing just broadly what the new platforms are or the adjacencies and then maybe where there might be overlaps? And is this where you're going to bring in product line simplification and what percent that might be versus the revenue base today? A \u2013 Scott Santi : Yes, not a lot of overlap, it\u2019s one of the attractive things about it both from a product line and a customers - from a product line and customer standpoint. In terms of the complimentary platform it probably gets a little too messy to try to get into in too much detail. Let me just say that they are similar to the current platforms we are in and that they are highly sort of value-added engineered solutions to specific OEM customer needs, some different categories in terms of the actual functionality. But largely the similar types of position that we have in our core business. So lot\u2019s of opportunity to add those categories to the existing categories we have. I think what I would say is we will clearly spend some time on this in December and it would be more effective for us to do so then as we\u2019ve had a couple of quarters worth of business under our belt. From a standpoint of PLS certainly my expectation is that we are going to have a fair amount of it there under our normal application of 80/20 less so related to dealing with overlap as I said it\u2019s not a big issue. But we need to - and we have some initial views based on some of our due diligence but we certainly need some time to get in there over the next couple of quarters, and really look at it at a much more fulsome way. But it will be part of the mix for a while. Part of the margin improvement agenda there. Deane Dray : Great. And then what about the margin goals that you've laid out to basically double margins by year 5? Have you thought through, can you share what that progression might be? I would imagine the gains come more in the back half of that time frame as opposed to being linear. Scott Santi : Now, I would say they\u2019d probably play at a little more linear and sort of a typical integration. This is as we\u2019ve talked before the application of 80/20 is in our quick fix. It\u2019s a three to five year process from go to full integration. And I would say again we will have a better view of what we will be able to get down in '17 on this when we are a couple of quarters down the road. But I think in general I would - I think a more appropriate planning assumption would be a couple of points a year for the next five, then a big hockey stick. Q \u2013 Deane Dray : Got it. And then just as a follow-up, one of the things within the food equipment results today, I was surprised to see service not a little bit better given the kind of focus that you've put on it there. Is there anything in the quarter that might have been a drag there? Should we start seeing service become a more meaningful contributor? A \u2013 Scott Santi : The answer to the second question is absolutely, I think some of the problems with these quarterly - with these quarterly calibrations are these are strategies that play out over the course of the year. So you\u2019ve got a lot of things bouncing around. I don\u2019t - sitting here right now I can\u2019t say whether there is \u2013 there is a sort of what the top profile was in service and food equipment. But in general as you said we\u2019ve got a lot of focus on service. It\u2019s a great business and a great competitive advantage for us.  The other thing is that there is some PLS have a couple of parts of that business going on right now but my assumption is that if I look at it deeper but my assumption is that\u2019s probably had some impact in Q2. Q \u2013 Deane Dray : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Next question is from Mr. Mig Dobre from Baird. Your line is now open. Q \u2013 Mig Dobre : Good morning, everyone. If I may just going back to the broader organic growth question from - questions from earlier, just kind of looking at the quarter here EMEA certainly ended up outgrowing all the regions - 3% versus everywhere else growth at 1% or below. And I'm just wondering, from your perspective looking into the back half of the year, do you still expect this kind of leadership from EMEA or are you thinking that we're going to see acceleration from North America deliver those organic growth goals of yours? A \u2013 Scott Santi : Yes, I think Mig if you look at the first half growth rates both international and North America kind of in the low single digits that\u2019s probably a good way to think about the back half of the year. So we certainly don\u2019t expect any acceleration on a regional basis and as you know we don\u2019t run the company that way. Q \u2013 Mig Dobre : Okay. And then maybe, again, going back to food equipment, can you provide any commentary in terms of what's been driving the growth in equipment? I'm wondering if there's anything to differentiate in terms of ware washing versus cooking, refrigeration - any color there would be helpful. A \u2013 Scott Santi : Yes, Mig, I made some comments earlier really that this was broad based strength in terms of the product lines with refrigeration, warewash, cooking and the retail side with scales overall really strong performance across the board but as you heard equipment up 9% in North America. Michael Larsen : And I would characterize as it is much more of a function of significant part of food equipment business reaching that ready-to-grow stage. It\u2019s been there for the last year or so and just been in a position to be much more aggressive in terms of attacking our growth opportunities. The innovation pipeline there is terrific. That\u2019s certainly is contributing, but it\u2019s more of an end product of all the work that we\u2019ve done to get the portfolio right get the business simplified and get it focused on its best growth opportunities. Q \u2013 Mig Dobre : Right. And I appreciate that, but obviously the drivers are, I presume, a little bit different, ware washing versus hot side cooking. Right? A \u2013 Scott Santi : I don\u2019t think \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t say they are a lot different based on what I just said. We\u2019ve got a highly competitive, highly differentiated product lines with great opportunity to grow and are now in a position to really focus on attacking that. Q \u2013 Mig Dobre : All right. Thanks for your comment. Operator : Next question is from Andy Casey. Your line is now open from Wells Fargo. Q \u2013 Andy Casey : Thanks a lot. Good morning, everybody. A question kind of going back to pricing. I know, as you just said, Scott, the Company focuses on differentiated product and that kind of shields ITW from price competition. But we are seeing some evidence of competitive pricing in some of the markets that you really don't participate in directly. Did any of the segments realize negative pricing or see competitors resort to price actions to try to drive their volume? A \u2013 Scott Santi : Yes, I think Andy this was a Q2 that this year that look a lot like Q1 and a lot like Q2 last year. So we would say at the enterprise level and even at the segment level no significant changes on the pricing side. Q \u2013 Andy Casey : Okay. That's good news. And then on the EF&C acquisition, the accounting impact, do you expect to realize all that in Q3 or is that going to be kind of carryover into Q4? A \u2013 Michael Larsen : Yes, I really don\u2019t want to get into too much detail here. But in terms of Q3 versus Q4, we are just getting going here, Andy. And what I can tell you is for the second half based on what we know today we expect it to be neutral. And I don\u2019t think it will be a big swing on a quarterly basis but I don\u2019t know that for sure yet. Q \u2013 Andy Casey : Okay. Thanks a lot, Michael. Operator : Next question is from Ann Duignan from JBMC. Your line is now open. Ann Duignan : Hi, good morning, I'm still with JPMorgan. Michael Larsen : Thank you. Good to hear it. Ann Duignan : At least I think I am. A lot of my questions have been answered but maybe you could give us a little bit more color on China in general and how the various businesses progressed during the quarter in China? A \u2013 Michael Larsen : Yes. So I think China overall was flat with strong performance in Automotive. Auto up 13%, Test & Measurement fairly solid, low single digit growth some challenges you would expect on the Welding side and Food down slightly. But I wouldn\u2019t read too much into that. So, overall a good quarter in China. Ann Duignan : Okay. Thank you. And then just back to - overall, we've heard from some other suppliers that there are several OEMs who are shutting down production in Q3 for extended periods. I think you kind of alluded to that perhaps in the welding business but are any of your other businesses seeing any extended shutdowns from the customers? A \u2013 Michael Larsen : Not that I\u2019m aware of. Ann Duignan : Okay, thank you. I\u2019ll leave it there. Operator : Next question is from Joel Tiss from BMO. Your line is now open. Q \u2013 Joel Tiss : Yes. Almost everything's been answered already. Thank you guys for taking the time. I just wondered generally acquisition prices, are they reasonable? Because you guys are a little different than everyone else. You're very zeroed in on specific areas or you see a little inflation out there and it's tough to find things. A \u2013 Scott Santi : Well, we did one deal. So I\u2019m not sure that we\u2019re a market maker on or can give you a good feedback overall. It\u2019s not something where I think we have enough of an active effort on to be a \u2013 to give you any good insight or input on acquisition prices generally. Q \u2013 Joel Tiss : Okay, all right. Well, that was it. Thank you very much. Operator : Next question is from Steve Volkmann from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Q \u2013 Steve Volkmann : Hi, good morning. My follow-up first maybe this time. You made a comment earlier about PLS being less in 2017, but I guess that means it's not going to go away. Does it ever go away? Is it - does go to a normal level? I mean how do we just think of the cadence of PLS longer term? A \u2013 Scott Santi : Yes, I think eventually it goes down to a level where it\u2019s \u2013 whatever described as normal maintenance probably less than half a percent a year I think. I don\u2019t want to get too specific here because as Michael said we stopped looking through the plating cycle. But the big lot of activity on this for the company over the last three years plus has really been around the portfolio strategy execution. Once we get it to where we wanted, it certainly becomes something that we do some minor pruning on an annual basis. But it\u2019s not something that we even talk about it anymore at that point and maybe that\u2019s a couple of years out from here. Q \u2013 Steve Volkmann : Okay, great. That's helpful. And then just on restructuring, I wonder do you have additional restructuring in your plans for 3Q, 4Q? And maybe if you could just touch on sort of what you're doing there and how we should think about that impact in 2017. A \u2013 Michael Larsen : Yes, Steve our restructuring assumption for the year in that $60 million to $70 million range is unchanged. And we don\u2019t expect any significant changes to that as we go through the Q3 and Q4. Even current levels of demand were at 60 to 70 and don\u2019t see anything right now that would take it outside of that range. Q \u2013 Steve Volkmann : Great, thank you. Operator : Next question is from Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Jamie Cook : Hi. Good morning. Just two quick follow-ups. One, I know you don't want to comment on the auto acquisition. But I guess on your other businesses as we exit 2016, how should we think about amortization expense from acquisitions? Because I would assume that's another tailwind as we think about 2017 versus 2016. And then another clarification just on FX impact to EPS. I think last quarter you guided to $0.20. Did you change that number with the pound? That's all I have. A \u2013 Michael Larsen : Yes, let me start with the last one. I think the 20 euro frankly was a way back win at the beginning of the year. If there is a lot of volatility as you know on the currency side of things. And so while at current rates we would expect it to be less than 20 it\u2019s really hard to put hard and fast number out there given all the volatility. On the intangible amortization, we expect that to continue to go down to two segments where we talk about this Test & Measurement and Polymers & Fluids it\u2019s maybe something like 30 to 50 basis points of favorability on an annual basis in those two segments. So\u2026 Q \u2013 Jamie Cook : Okay, great. I will get back in queue. Operator : Next question is from Steve Fisher from UBS. Your line is now open. Steve Fisher : Thanks, good morning. The Q3 margin guidance implies a moderating of the year-over-year improvements in margins, even if you adjust for the 50 basis points of EF&C. It doesn't sound like there's a lot more restructuring there. Are we just sort of getting to the maturity point of the margin improvement or is there perhaps some conservatism there? A \u2013 Michael Larsen : Yes, it\u2019s certainly not like we\u2019re getting to a level of maturity here. So, as you know, we have guided to 100 basis points of margin expansion this year and in '17 independent of volume and Scott talked a little bit about how much more potential we still have inside the company. Really the last year, if you recall, margins were up 180 basis points. We had a really strong third quarter last year. And so it\u2019s really more of a comp issue than anything else. Steve Fisher : Okay. That's helpful. And then how have your expectations changed for the industrial-facing businesses year-over-year? Last quarter I think you said there was maybe a chance that you could get to neutral exiting the year. Has welding now taken a step backwards there or how are you thinking about that consumer versus industrial by kind of exiting the year? A \u2013 Scott Santi : Well, I think I\u2019ll just go back to what I said earlier. I think welding given the performance in the first two quarters, the contraction is certainly continuing on longer than - expectation is kind of the funny word because we tend to just react to the conditions that we\u2019re seeing. But I think ultimately heading into the year given the kind of decline we saw last year I think we are hopeful that things were going to flatten out by the back half clearly given the first two quarters that\u2019s not the case. But at some point it\u2019s going to happen. And I think what we\u2019re doing in the short run is managing the cost structure with some restructuring actions and other things we\u2019re doing to, to do what we should be doing in the short term while preserving our position in our markets and certainly being ready to participate fully as things turn around up there. So I don\u2019t \u2013 but at the same time, we\u2019re performing better on margins, we\u2019re certainly offsetting more than offsetting the impact of weldings having on the short term and that\u2019s one of the values of portfolio of seven really strong businesses is we\u2019re never probably going to have all seven going in the 100% in the right direction all at the same time. But we\u2019re going to have enough of them around at the overall enterprise performance in whatever environment which is going to be pretty good darn good. Steve Fisher : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Next question is from Walter Liptak from Seaport Global. Your line is now open. Walter Liptak : Hi, thanks. Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask about the food equipment business and the 300 basis points of margin improvement and if there's a way of measuring how much of that was 80/20 enterprise initiatives and how much was volume related. A \u2013 Michael Larsen : Yes, the best detail and the most detail that we give you, was in the appendix and the press release. Since if you look at Food total margin expansion 300 basis points 110 of that was from operating leverage. Similar to what you saw in Q1 as these businesses begin to accelerate growth you see really nice improvement on the margin side as a result. And then in addition approximately 80 basis points of enterprise initiative and other margin expansion and then restructuring was slightly lower this year versus the second quarter last year. And so we break that out in the press release by segment and total ITW. Walter Liptak : Okay. Got it, great. Okay. And just as a follow-up on the EF&C business, the doubling in margin - and it's been a while since you guys have done an acquisition like this. I wonder how much of this is new programs related to the business management system and if at all you're thinking this is sort of like a new - like a test case for future acquisitions? Scott Santi : I wouldn\u2019t characterize it as a test case. I think our track record even though it has been a while, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve forgotten how to do this. We\u2019ve been in many ways being doing this everything we\u2019re going to do at the EF&C at all 84 of our other divisions over the last couple of years which is front to back we\u2019re applying our 80/20 management system. So I think our methodology is inside the company is extremely well defined, extremely well proven. We have a fair all business running at mid-20\u2019s EBIT margin and we\u2019re adding this too. So I don\u2019t think there is any sort of mystery of bag what we need to do and the process we\u2019re going to use to make it happen. Walter Liptak : Okay, great. Okay, thank you. Operator : The last question in the queue is from Eli Lustgarten from Longbow Securities. Your line is now open. Eli Lustgarten : Thank you. Good morning. Most of the stuff has been answered. Just a clarification. You said restructuring is going to be about the same as planned before but you had 140 basis point impact on welding and 70 basis point in polymers and fluids. What kind of an impact from restructuring should we expect on margins in the second half of the year from the ongoing restructuring? Scott Santi : Very similar to the first half. So the way we plan this is at a very measured pace and if you go back and we\u2019ve got a restructuring spend on the quarterly basis it\u2019s very consistent in that $16 million to $17 million range and so that takes us to 60 million to 70 million for the year. And obviously that is included in our guidance. So we\u2019re not adding anything back here. Eli Lustgarten : Okay. And secondly, I think you said the $2 billion share repurchase - $1.2 billion is coming from overseas? Scott Santi : So, if you recall it in the back end of first quarter earlier this year, we were able to access a little over $1 billion, $1.2 billion of overseas funds that we\u2019ve allocated to the share buyback program. And so that portion is done. And the comment was that the 800 million, the balance that takes us to $2 billion that\u2019s really more of an \u2013 think of that as a more normal run rate for the company. And so that's our kind of our typical surplus cash flow that this year is being allocated to the share buyback program. Eli Lustgarten : All right. Thank you very much. Scott Santi : All right. I think that brings us to the top of the hour. Thank you everyone for your time today. Operator : That concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the end of the presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at any point. And I would like to turn the call now to your host Mr. Michael Larsen, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Sir, you may begin. Michael Larsen : Hi, thank you, Gary. And good morning and welcome to ITW\u2019s third quarter 2016 conference call. I\u2019m Michael Larsen, ITW\u2019s Senior Vice President and CFO; and joining me this morning is our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi. During today\u2019s call, we will discuss our third quarter 2016 financial results and update you on our 2016 earnings forecast. Before we get to the results, let me remind you that this presentation contains our financial forecasts for the fourth quarter and full-year 2016, as well as other forward-looking statements identified on this slide. We refer you to the company\u2019s 2015 Form 10-K and Form 10-Q for the second quarter of 2016 for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Also, this presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures. And while we use very few non-GAAP measures a reconciliation of those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Scott. Scott Santi : Thanks, Michael, and good morning. In Q3 ITW delivered another quarter of high-quality earnings growth with record operating income, operating margin and return on invested capital performance. In the quarter we generated 8% GAAP earnings per share growth, operating margin of 23.1% which if you exclude the 80 basis points of EF and CE acquisition dilution, it was 23.9% on an apples-to-apples basis. And after-tax return on invested capital came in at 23%. The key driver of our performance continues to be the execution of our strategy. The third quarter marked the 12th quarter in a row that our enterprise strategy initiatives delivered more than 100 basis points of margin expansion. In addition, we\u2019re continuing to make good progress in executing our pivot to growth with six of our seven segments again delivering positive organic growth in Q3 despite a macro environment that obviously remains challenging. Through the execution of our strategy, we have grown earnings per share by an average of 15% per year over the last four years with almost no help from the market environment. But we still have ways to before we are operating to our full potential. We look forward to providing an update on the work that we have ahead of us to deliver on ITW\u2019s full-performance potential at our annual Investor Day in December. With that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Michael, who will provide you with more detail regarding our Q3 performance and our updated Q4 2016 forecast. Michael? Michael Larsen : Thank you, Scott. ITW\u2019s third quarter was another high-quality quarter with solid earnings growth, continued margin expansion and solid free cash flow. EPS was up 8% to $1.50 slightly ahead of the mid-points of our guidance due to solid execution and the resulting better margin performance. Total revenue was $3.5 billion up 4% and organic growth was 2% in-line with guidance. Overall demand was pretty steady state as we move through the quarter, and what continues to be a fairly challenging environment particularly on the capital equipment side. Nevertheless, six or seven segments delivered positive organic growth in key regions such as North America, Europe, Asia Pacific including China were all positive. In my opinion, the highlight of this quarter was ITW\u2019s record operating margin performance of 23.1% - 23.9% when you exclude EF&C, and all seven segments performing above 21%. Operating income grew 6% to $808 million and after-tax return on invested capital improved to 140 basis points to 23%. Both of these performance metrics were all-time highs for ITW. We invested more than $150 million in capital equipment, new products and projects to simplify our businesses. Free cash flow of 101% on the income was a little lower than last year due to some quarterly timing but year-to-date we\u2019re on track at 94% which compares to 96% at this point last year. We typically have a strong Q4 and we expect to finish the year above 100%. In addition, we repurchased shares for $500 million and expect to complete this year\u2019s program with another $500 million in Q4 bringing the total to $2 billion. Finally, as we saw in August, ITW announced a dividend increase of 18%. So, overall, pretty straight-forward, good quarter as ITW continue to execute well and deliver strong results. On slide 5, starting with the key drivers of our operating margin performance, the strong execution of our enterprise initiatives contributed 120 basis points. Price cost was slightly favorable. Volume leverage of 30 basis points was offset by a number of other items. And EF&C diluted margin 80 basis points, resulting in 23.1%, a record for the company and like I said 23.9% if you\u2019re comparing to our long-term performance growth of 23% plus. On page 6, really good operating performance across the seven segments, with all segments at or above 21% for the first time ever. I wanted to point out that automotive OEM margins as expected were diluted 370 basis points by EF&C and that the core business is obviously still very strong at 25% plus. In construction, restructuring related to the simplification of our European manufacturing footprint created a drag of 190 basis points. The other segment numbers speak for themselves, really strong performance again this quarter. Turning to the segment discussion and starting with our automotive OEM, a really good quarter on the top-line as organic revenue grew 7% due to strong penetration gains in every region. In North America, 5% organic growth compares favorably to Auto-builds of 2% and that includes a 1% decline at the so called D3 where we have relatively higher content. Europe was up 5% with 700 basis points of penetration gains, as overall builds were down 2%. And China was up 40% with very significant penetration gains due to new product launches this quarter. Also, you may recall that China was down 5% in this quarter last year making for relatively easy comparisons. Food Equipment was up 1% organically with North America equipment up 3% due to a difficult year-over-year comparison. You may recall that in the third quarter last year, equipment was up 8%. International equipment was down 3% and service was up 1%. Based on Q3 exit run rates and backlog and a more normalized comparison, we expect that Q4 organic growth rate to be more in line with recent trends, so continued solid demand in Food Equipment. Also continued strong margin performance and 27.4% was the highest margin in the company this quarter. A good quarter for Test & Measurement in electronics as organic revenue grew 7% due primarily to an easy comparison. Last year in the third quarter of this segment was down 11%. Electronics was up 13% and Test & Measurement was up 1% in what continues to be a fairly sluggish capital investment demand environment. However, the solid margin expansion is really encouraging and something we\u2019ve talked about on this call before. Margin improved 440 basis points to 21% with 190 basis points from enterprise initiatives and the balance primarily from volume leverage. While the demand environment in welding is stable, it is still pretty challenging as evidenced by the 9% decline in year-over-year revenues. The decline breaks down as 4 points from oil and gas, 3 points from industrial, which is mostly heavy equipment related to agriculture, infrastructure and mining and then 2 points from commercial. The brighter story; is on the margin front and as the welding team continues to do an excellent job managing the cost structure through this cycle by preserving our strong position in the marketplace and being ready to fully participate as things eventually turn around. Despite peak-to-trough revenues being down about 20%, operating margin is 26.5% this quarter, which, is only 150 basis points below peak margins. In the third quarter, benefits from enterprise initiatives and the restructuring projects we talked about last quarter contributed 240 basis points to margin expansion. As we said before our welding segment remains a good example of how resilient the ITW business model is across a wide range of economic scenarios. Polymers & Fluids delivered another quarter of positive organic revenue growth of 1%. On a regional basis, international was up 3% and North America was down 1% mostly due to lower demand on the industrial MRO side of the business. Margin improved 200 basis points to 21% driven by initiatives and restructuring savings. Demand in construction products held pretty steady this quarter as this segment grew 2% organically. Construction also had a challenging comparison to last year when North America was up 7%. This quarter, North America was up 1% as compared to down 1% in Q2, and this quarter commercial grew 5%, renovation and remodeling was up 4%, and residential was down slightly 1 point. Asia-Pacific was up 2%, New York was pretty good up 2% but below the Q2 growth rates of 7% and 6% respectively. And we talked about the margins 24.5% in construction if you exclude the European simplification project this quarter. Finally, specialty products, organic revenue was essentially flat with international up 3%, and North America down slightly. Our consumer packaging consumable businesses in this segment are growing solidly offset by weaker demand on the capital equipment side. Good progress on the margin side with an increase of 210 basis points to 26.1% driven by 180 basis points from enterprise initiatives. Turning to page 10, our updated guidance for 2016. As you saw this morning we\u2019re raising the mid-point of our full-year EPS guidance and narrowing the range to 556 to 566 which represents 9% earnings growth at the mid-point. As usual, we\u2019re assuming current foreign exchange rates which given the recent strengthening of the dollar against the pound and the Euro creates a few pennies of currency translation headwind in the fourth quarter. As a result, this full-year guidance increased of the penny is essentially the $0.03 beep from the third quarter partially offset by $0.02 of additional currency translation headwind in the fourth quarter at today\u2019s foreign exchange rates. We expect full-year 2016 operating margin to be above 22.5%, a new full-year record for the company and up from 21.4% last year. Keep in mind that EF&C dilutes full-year margin by approximately 50 basis points. In other words, excluding EF&C, we would be talking about approximately 23% operating margin for the year. For the fourth quarter, as usual, our forecast assumes Q3 exit run rates which equates to organic growth of zero to 2%. And embedded in that organic growth forecast is a steady state demand assumption that we feel is pretty reasonable in light of the relatively stable demand trends across our business portfolio in Q3. We expect operating margin of approximately 21.5% which is greater than 22% when you exclude EF&C which compares to 20.7% in Q4 last year, so continued strong margin expansion in Q4. Finally, EPS guidance is $1.31 to $1.41 which is, 11% earnings growth at the mid-point marking a pretty strong finish to the year. So, that concludes our prepared remarks. And we\u2019ll now open up the call to your questions. Operator : Thank you, sir, thank you speakers. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question, it\u2019s from Mr. John Inch from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open sir. John Inch : Thank you, good morning everyone. Guys, international Food Equipment softness I guess was consistent with Lennox\u2019s comments. I\u2019m wondering if we could get little more color on that what you\u2019re seeing. I remember sort of the call or the commentary around restaurants which were softer I believe it was about, I think restaurants are about 15% of your mix maybe if you could just sort of put the international softness in the restaurant issue sort of into a context for us? Michael Larsen : Yes, so John, I would just, I wouldn\u2019t read too much into this quarter in Food Equipment, as you know the quarter trends can bounce around a little bit. I think if you look at the year-to-date numbers up in that 3% to 4% range we expect to end up in the same place in Q4 and for the full year. I think Food Equipment more broadly we continue to see strength on the institutional side which is the majority of our business particularly in refrigeration and then on the scale side and the retail business but really nothing to be too concerned about in terms of the demand environment pretty stable as we went through the quarter and we\u2019ll be back on trend in Q4. John Inch : Okay. So, the international, you\u2019re describing it more as a bullet versus some sort of beginning of a trend, is that a fair statement? Michael Larsen : Yes, that\u2019s correct. John Inch : Okay. And then Test & Measurement and Electronics, I think some people don\u2019t fully appreciate what\u2019s in the Electronics segment. And I make the commentary in the context that 3M and others have experienced consumer electronics weakness. In their situation it\u2019s all that conversion and Smartphone saturation. And I guess I\u2019m wondering are you experiencing any kind of consumer softness within the confines of the umbrella of this Electronics up 13% organically? Scott Santi : Our exposures there really have fallen into two buckets. One is and largely clean-room MRO collection of businesses, that\u2019s a pretty steady Eddie business. And then the other piece which is where we saw some of the big driver of the year-on-year growth improvement was really on the Equipment side so we\u2019re producing equipment that people use to produce circuit boards. And that business again Michael talked about it was up somewhat in the quarter but also on a very low comp on the prior year. So I think we would not describe that business as being down significantly or being under pressure but it\u2019s also I wouldn\u2019t read a lot into the year-on-year growth number either. John Inch : That\u2019s fair. And then just lastly, you Auto strength in China, Michael you attributed to product launches. Is this a one-quarter phenomenon or are you gearing up to try and penetrate the China Auto sector, like, do this have more legs beyond the quarter I guess is what I\u2019m wondering. Michael Larsen : Yes, I think this has a lot more legs to it as we go forward and into next year and beyond. Obviously 40% - builds were up 20% plus. But in terms of kind of what the penetration gains can be, I think that\u2019s directional, that\u2019s where we would expect it to be going forward. John Inch : And, that 2X numbers, is that what you\u2019re saying? Michael Larsen : Yes, I think that\u2019s doable. Based on the new products and what\u2019s in the pipeline yes. John Inch : All right. Thanks very much. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. And therefore next question is from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. The line is open, sir. Joe Ritchie : Thanks, good morning guys. Scott Santi : Good morning. Joe Ritchie : In your next fundamental quarter maybe just focusing on Auto, since there seems to be a lot of concern out there right now giving potentially peaking Auto-builds and Ford\u2019s comments about idling capacity. You mentioned in your prepared remarks that the D3 was down 1, but the out-growth in North America was still really strong. And so maybe just provide a little bit more color on where you\u2019re seeing the out-growth and expectation longer-term to continue to outgrow Auto production? Scott Santi : We\u2019ve talked about this a number of times in the past. On the Auto business for us is one where we do have a reasonable amount of forward visibility typically two to three years. So we have, we feel very good about our pipeline of new content going on new vehicles. Certainly we will be impacted on a relative basis based on the overall build levels in the market but our ability to continue to outgrow whatever the market growth rate is. If it flattens out we would still expect it to be positive by 200 to 400 basis points. And that\u2019s pretty much a three-year kind of look. We\u2019ve got some great backlogs and great programs in place and a lot of really compelling things we\u2019re working on. So it\u2019s an area that we are very bullish on, on a long-term basis. Michael Larsen : And I would just add Joe, specifically to the D3 being down 1, the expectations is for them to be down again in Q4. And that\u2019s fully embedded in our forecast. And I think similar to, in food you\u2019ll see a growth rate in line with what we\u2019ve done historically on the Auto side here in Q4. Joe Ritchie : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And maybe touching base on the margins on Auto, I know you guys are under consistent pricing pressure but at the same time can - you really get a lot of production efficiency to help continue to grow margins in that segment. Given that it\u2019s longer-cycle, maybe have a little bit more visibility on Auto. I\u2019m just curious, kind of compare and contract Auto versus welding because you\u2019ve done such a great job at continuing to expand margins in your welding segment despite a roll-over in growth. I\u2019m just curious how resilient you think your Auto margins can be if we do start to see a slowdown in Auto? Scott Santi : The Auto margin still is largely about the value-add content we put in the products. So we have talked I think on a number of occasions of our business being very niche, very oriented around solving tough problems for our OEM customers. We\u2019re not planning in the bumpers on whatever model car you\u2019re talking about. We\u2019re at an RFQ bidder, we\u2019re problem solver. So, from the standpoint of the overall margin performance in that business, it largely is a function of our discipline around the types of opportunities we\u2019re going to engage yet with our customers and how well our skill-set matches up with what they need partner to do. So, I think we\u2019re in really good shape. These are typically longer-term, six-seven-year kinds of program. And certainly there are some commitments often embedded in terms of annual cost tick-up, those are fully baked in terms of our knowledge upfront. And we would work really hard on delivering value not only in the design of the actual solution but then on an ongoing basis continue to drive benefits for customers that also drive benefits for the company. Joe Ritchie : Okay, fair enough. I\u2019ll get back in queue. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you, sir. And for our next question, it\u2019s from Scott Davis from Barclays. Your line is open. Scott Davis : Hi, good morning guys. I\u2019m trying to get a sense of when welding does come back, what type of margin structure we can expect and the question really here is that how much discretionary spend is being cut and things that you\u2019re going to have to add back pretty quickly your investment spend or how you define it I guess. But just general spend that may have to come back that would indicate that maybe even margins don\u2019t go up, when welding comes back but more flattish, just some color on that would be helpful? Scott Santi : Your final comment would be very hard for me to see any scenario where that would be the case. We\u2019ve, the teams in welding have done a really nice job of adjusting cost structure to the overall - current demand environment. But there is nothing. We\u2019ve also been very clear and we\u2019ve worked very hard on making sure that all of our, sort of important growth investments remains fully funded throughout this down-cycle. So, it is largely a matter of lot of reapplication of 80/20, a lot of focus and prioritization, it\u2019s not about cutting muscle it\u2019s about adjusting the cost structures. So from a standpoint of how it looks on a go-forward basis, I would have a hard time seeing any scenario where the incremental margins on the recovery would be far outside of our traditional 30% to 35% bucket. Scott Davis : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just as follow-on, if you think in terms of some normalization in welding sequentially. I mean, when do you think you\u2019d be I know this is hard, but given that oil prices are back up over 50 in emerging markets, we\u2019re getting a bit better and such, so do you get a sense of a book-to-bill in the 1.0 or little bit better range earlier in \u201817? Or do you still think it might be more of a mid-to-later? Scott Santi : I\u2019ll tell you what I would probably not want to give into the forecasting business here. It\u2019s been we\u2019re going up on eight quarters now, some pretty significant contraction. And we got to see it flatten out first, I would say from the standpoint of just sequential daily order rate demand transit has been pretty solid, pretty steady state for the last three or four quarters here. But it\u2019s not - we\u2019re assuming not seeing any signs of any pick up at this point. I would really hesitate to call a turn at some point in the future but we\u2019re well positioned to participate in it when it happens. And I think we\u2019re managing the business through this down-cycle pretty well. Scott Davis : That\u2019s fair. Thank you, guys. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. And for our next question, it\u2019s from David Raso from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. David Raso : Thank you. Just first a broad question. Can you set the framework for December meeting, what we should be expecting organic growth, enterprise initiatives for next year? Scott Santi : No. Michael Larsen : We haven\u2019t Dave, we haven\u2019t even been through our full planning cycle yet for \u201817, so that happens in November and which is always our normal routine and then we come to December well-armed with pretty good view of what we think we got to be able to accomplish in the upcoming year. David Raso : I mean, is it fair to say given next year is officially the last year of the enterprise initiatives that yes, there is a year left of that but the meeting is going pivot more, trying to focus on can you accelerate organic growth with internal initiatives I mean, is that the? Scott Santi : Not necessarily. David Raso : Not, okay, that\u2019s interesting. When I think about the incremental margins you just put up, and kind of simplistically I think of it is as when you provide that organic margin change, this trade operating leverage that you provide right before any changes in variable margin overhead cost. The incremental margins were about 36%, and then obviously went higher when you added some of the enterprise initiatives. Whatever you do provide an organic sales growth for \u201817 at that meeting. How should we be thinking about how you view your organic incremental margins right. Because we\u2019re trying to pivot away from an internal how you can keep growing these margins 100 bps a year but at some point it just gets more challenging. What can you give us on organic and what kind of leverage do you expect, just to provide some framework? Michael Larsen : Well, I think David, consistent with what we\u2019ve said before and I think Scott just mentioned this, and when we\u2019re talking about welding is, we would expect our incremental margins to continue to be in that 30% to 35% range. Scott Santi : That\u2019s the base rate, not. Michael Larsen : That\u2019s the base rate that does not include the enterprise initiatives, that\u2019s correct yes. David Raso : Most of the buckets right, whatever you think you can do on organically and obviously the pressure is on a little bit as we pivot away from the enterprise initiatives, how much can you get the ready-to-grow to show itself in fast-organic. But you still have another year of enterprise value and then again Scott, I do assume that the meeting will get some further, this progress on the idea of pivoting to the organic story? And the capital allocation obviously you\u2019re still generating strong cash. I assume we get some clarity on how to think about the next few years? Just, I mean, I know it\u2019s hard to forecast, just the pivot from here the margin story internally to organic would always be the benefit of your strong cash flow and capital allocation. It is sort of an interesting moment for the stock\u2019s evolution, right. I mean we\u2019ll get more than just here is the \u201817 outlook. Is that fair? Scott Santi : Yes. David Raso : Okay, all right. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. And for our next question, it\u2019s from Andy Kaplowitz from Citi. Your line is open. Andy Kaplowitz : Hi, good morning guys. Scott, so with expected margin in Test & Measurement to improve as your enterprise initiatives continue to ramp up. Were you surprised by the speed of the margin ramp up? Is it really just new leadership this year taking a fresh look at the business and making more immediate changes than anything else? And if there is anything stopping Test & Measurement from being a mid-20% margin business, like your other businesses over time? Scott Santi : Yes, the second answer - the answer to the second question is no. Great fundamentals in that business and I would say as with all of our seven businesses, they are in terms of the work they\u2019ve done moving through, these enterprise strategy initiatives they all started in a different place, they all had their own level of work to be done and Test & Measurement\u2019s case, there were recent progress in terms of outcome is not worthy but they\u2019ve been doing things inside that haven\u2019t necessarily showed up in terms of margin for the last six or eight quarters. And so I\u2019m very pleased with now what\u2019s starting to show up and they\u2019ve been on a pretty good track all the way long in terms of what they\u2019ve been working on to get where they can be. And as you said, still have more room to go. Andy Kaplowitz : Okay, that\u2019s good Scott. And then just shifting to Construction, can you talk about what happened this quarter? You said BSS reduced margins by 190 basis points, but I would have thought that much of the simplification in that segment had already occurred. We know you\u2019ve been trying to simplify your European Construction footprint for some time. But the level of BSS seems a little more out of the blue I guess than I would have thought. Scott Santi : Well, it wasn\u2019t necessarily out of the blue but there was, there are, from day one we knew that there was a lot to get down there, they\u2019ve gone through a couple of cycles. And this particular project that has certainly, have visible impact on margin in Q1 was one that has been in the planning cycle for a while. But it was among our most complex structures in the company if you go back to - I'm talking about European Construction. And so, we\u2019ve talked in the past about not only the work we\u2019ve been doing but the way we\u2019ve been doing the work in terms of doing it in a methodical fashion in a way that doesn\u2019t impair our ability to serve our customers and generate some reasonable incremental progress along the way. So, while this was, this particular activity was known, we knew we were going to have to do it almost back to the beginning, it\u2019s one where we also are now going to place from a standpoint of time and where we\u2019re in a position to do it and do it in a way that doesn\u2019t impact our ability to serve our customers in the region. So, it wasn\u2019t out of the blue from our standpoint by any stretch. Andy Kaplowitz : Scott, does the headwind from this kind of quickly go away in terms of the margin difference? Scott Santi : Yes. Michael Larsen : Look at welding from last quarter, I mean, our restructuring, when it is, when it tends to be that constant in a segment, we\u2019re doing it every quarter, we talked to you about the overall spend, it\u2019s typically spread pretty evenly, we even talked about it, just part of how we operate. But in the case of welding in Q2, we talked about some fairly sizeable actions and then look at the recovery in Q3 already in terms of margin from that. So in construction this is, the expense side of these, are front-end loaded based on the accounting rules. But the benefits ultimately start to show up maybe not fully in Q4 but certainly over the next three quarters or so. Andy Kaplowitz : Okay, great. Appreciate it, guys. Operator : Thank you. And for our next question it\u2019s from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open, sir. Nigel Coe : Yes, thanks. Good morning. I know you don\u2019t provide quarterly guidance by segment, but just given the diversions that we saw this quarter I just wonder if you could maybe give us some help in terms of how you see the zero to 2% playing out in 4Q? I\u2019m assuming that Auto tries to maintain 7%, but any commentary in terms of that spread would be helpful. Michael Larsen : Yes, Nigel, as you know, we and as we said, our Q4 organic growth forecast is based on the Q3 exit run rates from a demand standpoint. And really what some of the deviations from that you see are really more comparison issue than anything else. And I think you asked about automotive, if you look at the year-to-date growth rate in that 4% to 5% range, that\u2019s probably what you would expect to see given current run rates and given the comps here in the fourth quarter. Nigel Coe : Okay. And then how does that look in 4Q? Michael Larsen : How does it look in sorry? Nigel Coe : How does that look in 4Q? Michael Larsen : In Test & Measurement? Nigel Coe : Exactly, yes. Michael Larsen : Yes, I mean, I think Test & Measurement, the comparison is really to drive out the big 7% increase this quarter. That normalizes a little bit here in Q4, and I think you will see probably a year-over-year increase in Q4 that\u2019s in the low-single digits in Test & Measurement. And it\u2019s really driven by the continued sluggish demand for capital equipment which impacts the Test & Measurement side of that segment. Nigel Coe : Right, right. Okay, great. And then, just a quick one on the impact of EFC in 4Q, you guided for 50 bps or thereabouts of dilution for the full year, suggests that the margin impact could be slightly greater in 4Q than 3Q. Is that correct, and if that is the case why would that be given I\u2019ve expected most of the wipe downs have happened in the 3Q as opposed to 4Q? Michael Larsen : Yes, I\u2019m not sure how you got that Nigel I mean Q4 is going to look a lot like Q3 in terms of the EF&C impact. So you saw the margin dilution 80 basis points at the enterprise level. We\u2019d expect the same here in Q4. Revenues in Q3, $117 million which is in line with what we expected and we expect something very similar to that here in the fourth quarter. And then finally on the EPS side, consistent with what we said before, EPS neutral in the first six months here in the second half of \u201816 and then accretive, I would expect you to be accretive as we get into \u201817 and we have to go through the planning process as Scott said and then we\u2019ll give you an update when we get to giving guidance for 2017. Nigel Coe : Okay, I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you very much. Scott Santi : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is from Mig Dobre from Baird. Your line is open. Mig Dobre : Yes, thank you. Good morning. If we can go back to Food Equipment, I\u2019m looking at North America service and growth here over the past couple of quarters has slowed a bit after running at 4% to 5% for the last couple of years. I\u2019m wondering if you can give us any color as to what\u2019s going on here, what\u2019s driving the slowdown? Scott Santi : I wouldn\u2019t say Mig it\u2019s a slowdown, again if you go back and look, service in North America was up 4% in Q3 last year we\u2019re up 2% this year, that\u2019s pretty solid. But we\u2019ve also talked about the fact that we think there is more potential here for organic growth, that\u2019s probably closer to what we\u2019re seeing at least on the equipment side. Mig Dobre : I know, but I\u2019m asking really about service. And it is a slowdown from the 4% to 5% that you\u2019ve consistently put up since early 2014. And I guess my question is really going to this idea that we\u2019re starting to see that restaurant sales have slowed here, and I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s the driver or if it\u2019s something else? Scott Santi : No, that\u2019s not it at all. I think if you go back and look I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve put up 4% to 5% in service since 2014. But I think going forward that\u2019s not an unrealistic expectation. I mean, services is stable here, we talked about this last quarter, also little bit of PLS in some parts of the business. But overall, kind of been this low single-digit is a pretty good way to think about the business on a go-forward basis, from a growth standpoint. And then obviously as you know this is a very profitable part of the business, more profitable than the equipment side. Mig Dobre : All right. And then my follow up is back to Auto, looking at the core margin this quarter which was flattish on pretty good volume growth. I\u2019m wondering if there is a bit of a mix issue there or anything else you would highlight. Scott Santi : Yes, that\u2019s exactly right. It\u2019s really a product mix issue. Mig Dobre : And how do we think about? Scott Santi : So, I\u2019m just saying Mig, 25.5% in automotive pretty solid margins and you\u2019re right to point out that the volume leverage really here is the reason why I didn\u2019t show up is the product mix issue. Mig Dobre : Is this with us going forward into the fourth quarter? Scott Santi : No. Michael Larsen : It might be it\u2019s hard to forecast to that level of detail. But what is going to be with us on a go-forward basis of these core margins, in the mid-20s. Mig Dobre : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question is from Andy Casey from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Andy Casey : Thanks a lot. Good morning, everybody. Just another question on the Auto margin, could you define what the purchase accounting charges were in Q3, and are there any one-offs in Q4? Michael Larsen : Yes, no, I think rather than go through the individual pieces here Andy I\u2019d rather wait until we can give you the complete picture, also and include in that the guidance here for next year. What I will tell you is that the business is actually performing a little bit better than what we thought from an operational standpoint. The operating margins are like where we thought they were going to be. There were no surprises from a purchase accounting standpoint. And like we said there was no EPS impact here in the quarter. Scott Santi : In fact means that the charges basically ate up what the business earned in the last couple of quarters, yes. Michael Larsen : That\u2019s exactly right. So that\u2019s the way to think about it. And we\u2019ve talked about this Andy. When we give you guidance for \u201817, we\u2019ll give a complete picture. Andy Casey : Okay, thank you, Michael. And then the last one in Polymers & Fluids, within that, the 1% North America decline. Can you give any color on that, and update us on what\u2019s going on in the Auto after market? Michael Larsen : Yes, I think automotive aftermarket was pretty stable here again, flat to slightly positive. The decline is really tied to the maintenance, industrial MRO side of that business so industrial lubricants and consistent with what we\u2019ve seen in prior quarters. That is still somewhat challenged, the industrial MRO side. Andy Casey : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Ann Duignan from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Ann Duignan : Hi, good morning, everyone. Scott Santi : Good morning. Ann Duignan : Good morning, sorry about the delay. Can you talk a little bit about the fundamentals in European Construction, and by country or by region and then by application? And where are you seeing strength, are you seeing any slowdown in the U.K., etcetera? If you could just give us a little bit more color on what you\u2019re seeing there, that would be great. Michael Larsen : I think Europe was pretty good this quarter up 2%, pretty steady and really nothing unusual as we went through the quarter or nothing really material to point out on a country level. So pretty steady state, we feel pretty good about the demand levels, obviously up 2% and feel good about it going into Q4. Ann Duignan : Okay, so no big changes in the U.K. versus some of the other regions? Scott Santi : Not at this point. Michael Larsen : No, I mean, overall U.K. as you know, our U.K. business overall, I\u2019m not talking construction, it\u2019s about 4% of sales and was actually positive in the quarter, like we talked about before the impact right now what we\u2019re seeing is on the currency side moving on to translation side of things. But we haven\u2019t seen anything other than that that\u2019s worth mentioning. Ann Duignan : And the FX, is that a net positive or a net negative? Are you exporting out of the U.K. or importing into the U.K.? Scott Santi : We\u2019re producing and selling in the U.K. Michael Larsen : Yes, the impact is really on the translation side. So we are, we have run profitable businesses in the U.K. and when we bring those, we translate those, pound, British Pound, earnings into U.S. dollars, there is a headwind. And so that\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about. Ann Duignan : Okay, I appreciate the color. And then just a little bit more color on the automotive sorry to keep coming back to automotive. But your comments that mix had an impact on the quarter. Can you just give us more color there, is that regional mix or mix of builds, and just a little bit more on how we should think about that going forward? Michael Larsen : Yes, I mean, when we were talking about this product mix, I think in North America and so, our content for vehicle might be slightly different by product line and that\u2019s really what we\u2019re talking about. Ann Duignan : So can I take that as there isn\u2019t a huge difference in margins regionally? Michael Larsen : Yes, that\u2019s correct, yes. Ann Duignan : Okay, that\u2019s important. Thank you. I\u2019ll get back in line. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Steven Fisher from UBS. Your line is open. Steven Fisher : Thanks, good morning. I think you made indirect reference to this, David Raso, but how is your visibility changing on winding down PLS activities? To what extent are you increasingly confident that 2016 is the last main year we\u2019ll see it as a headwind? Scott Santi : Well, I think what I would prefer to do is like to go through this planning cycle that we just talked about we will give you a good update on that in December. But I think before we do any speculating let our businesses run their plans for \u201817 through and then we\u2019ll have a better picture there. Clearly at some point they will start lining down. I would also argue on the other side, we are - this is activity that is very healthy from the standpoint of profitability and focus. So to the extent that there is continued activity there that we\u2019re going to continue to continue to support it until we get all the stuff out of here that we think needs to go so we can really focus on in the highly profitable parts of our business that we think have long-term growth potential. So, we\u2019ll see what happens. I would expect it certainly things start to at least stabilize there if not start to slow down. But until we go through the actual details of what our businesses have in mind for next year, it\u2019s hard to comment. Steven Fisher : Okay. And then within your 35% or so incremental margin targets, how should we think about or how much of that is driven by pricing versus volume? As we look at slide 5, it looked like we had a negative volume impact there, so just trying to break that down if we could. Michael Larsen : Yes, pricing is not a big margin driver for us here. Really the big margin driver is and has been I think Scott mentioned 12 quarters in a row of the enterprise initiatives, that\u2019s really what\u2019s driving the margin expansion. And the incremental margins, to go back and look historically that\u2019s where the company has been for a very long time in that 30% to 35% range. And really on the pricing side, all we\u2019re trying to do is to offset some material cost inflation but it\u2019s not the key driver of our growth or of our margin expansion. Steven Fisher : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question is from Stephen Volkmann from Jefferies. Your line is open. Stephen Volkmann : Hi, good morning. Most of my questions have been answered, but I think you said price cost was like 10 basis points or something in the quarter. I\u2019m just curious if there\u2019s anything interesting to talk about on either the price or the cost side, and how we think that\u2019s going to look maybe in the fourth quarter? Does it actually turn negative, or whatever commentary you might have there? Thanks. Michael Larsen : Yes, no there is really nothing interesting to report. I mean, like I think I said all we\u2019re trying to do is offset to the extent that there is material cost inflation that\u2019s we\u2019re trying to offset that with price. We\u2019ve been in this, 10 basis points to 20 basis points range for a number of quarters here, actually longer than that. And we expect to stay in that range on a go-forward basis. Stephen Volkmann : Okay. I guess there\u2019s a perception that some of these material costs are starting to go up. Are you seeing that and you\u2019re just able to price for it, or is that not consistent with what you\u2019re seeing? Michael Larsen : We\u2019re not seeing any material cost inflation at this point. And when we do we will react like I said, and do our best in the divisions to offset that with efficiency and with price. Stephen Volkmann : I appreciate it, thanks. Operator : Thank you. And for our last question for today we have Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Jamie Cook : Hi, good morning. I just guess just two follow-up questions. One, in your prepared remarks you mentioned free cash flow. The free cash flow was a little light, and it sounded like there were some timing issues. Can you just talk around that sort of what the issues were and how much incremental that is to the fourth quarter? And then second, I guess when I looked at your Construction revenues on an organic basis, it\u2019s still up but obviously the increases are declining. So just a little color on your concern whether that market is turning at all in particular with the ABI data points that we\u2019re getting out because commercial was also very strong within the Construction segment? Thanks. Michael Larsen : So, I think on the free cash flow, like I said on a year-to-date basis we\u2019re exactly what we were last year so there is, things can move around a little bit on a quarterly basis, for example, our CapEx number is up a little bit this quarter, but year-to-date it\u2019s exactly in line with last year. And then maybe some larger payments that go out in one quarter versus another, we fully expect we\u2019ll be at above 100% for the year, which would imply a strong Q4, which seasonally that\u2019s what we usually do. So, other than that, we feel very good about the free cash flow performance. And on the construction side, I would just add, similar to what we said earlier, I mean, demand is pretty steady state. There are some comp issues that we\u2019re dealing with but we feel good about the using current run rates to model the fourth quarter and we\u2019re not expecting any big changes from where we are right now. Jamie Cook : Okay, thanks. I\u2019ll get back in queue. Operator : Okay. That\u2019s all for the questions sir. Michael Larsen : Very good. Thank you very much. And have a great day. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants will be in listen-only mode until the question-and-answer of today\u2019s conference. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now I would like to introduce Mr. Michael Larsen, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Sir you may begin. Michael M. Larsen: Hi, thank you, Leon, good morning and welcome to ITW's fourth quarter and full year 2016 conference call. I am Michael Larsen, ITW\u2019s Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining me this morning is our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi. During today's call, we will discuss our fourth quarter and full-year 2016 financial results, update you on our 2017 earnings forecast. Before we get to the results, let me remind you that this presentation contains our financial forecast for the first quarter and full-year 2017, as well as other forward-looking statements identified on this slide. We refer you to the company's 2015 Form 10-K and third quarter 2016 for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Also, this presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures and while we use very few non-GAAP measures, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release. With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott. E. Scott Santi : Thanks Michael and good morning. The fourth quarter closed out a year of record financial performance and strong execution for ITW. In fact 2016 was the most profitable year in the company\u2019s 104 year history. Earnings per share of $5.70 was up 11% versus 2015 and we achieved all time record performance in the following key operating metrics. Operating income of $3.1 billion was up 7%, operating margin of 22.5% was up 110 basis points and after-tax return on invested capital of 22.1% was up 170 basis points. We continue to generate strong free cash flow in 2016, which we utilized to reinvest in the growth and productivity of our core businesses and to acquire EF&C, a highly complementary bolt-on acquisition for our Automotive OEM segment. We also returned more than $2.8 billion of surplus capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The end of 2016 also marked a completion of the fourth year of our enterprise strategy. We launched our current strategy in late 2012 with a goal of positioning ITW to deliver solid growth with best in class margins and returns. In conjunction with our strategy we have implemented major steps to focus the entire company and leveraging ITWs highly differentiated and proprietary business model to drive profitable growth and enhance productivity throughout ITW. We have come a long way since we started over four years ago and ITWs performance is now approaching best in class levels. That being said, it is clear to us that we have significant capacity to further improve our performance. Within the framework of our current strategy before ITW is operating to its full potential. Moving forward we will remain focused on pushing our performance to our full potential by capitalizing on the significant opportunities that we have in front of us. For meaningful additional structural margin improvement and sustained above market organic growth. To our continuing focus on a commitment to executing our strategy, we are well positioned to deliver differentiated performance in 2017 and beyond. I'd like to close by acknowledging the huge debt of gratitude that we owe to our more than 50,000 ITW colleagues around the world for the great job that they continue to do in executing our strategy and serving our customers with excellence each and every day. They are responsible for ITWs strong performance over the last four years and give us great confidence in our ability to continue to improve and make further progress in the past ITWs full potential. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Michael, who will provide you with more detail regarding our Q4 performance and 2017 forecast. Michael? Michael M. Larsen: Thank you, Scott. Taking a look at slide 3, ITW finished 2016 with another strong quarter of differentiated operational and financial performance as evidenced by record quarterly operating income, operating margin and after-tax return on invested capital. GAAP EPS of $1.45 increased 18% and exceed a midpoint of our guidance with $0.03 from better than expected organic growth and operating margin and $0.06 net benefit from non-recurring items. In the quarter, we received $167 million cash dividend distribution related to our investment in Wilsonart, the former decorative services segment. The resulting EPS benefit of $0.10 was partially offset by $0.04 of one-time non-cash charges related to two small divestitures of non-core assets. The net benefit of these items is the sixth sense and without them, EPS grew 13%. Total revenue was $3.4 billion, an increase of 4% and organic growth was 2%, slightly ahead of the midpoint of our guidance. Operating margin was 21.8%. 22.2% excluding EF&C and all seven segments improved margins. Operating income grew 9% to $742 million and free cash flow of $593 million was 170% of net income. So, overall we\u2019re very pleased with our strong finish to 2016. On slide 4, you\u2019ll see that our enterprise initiatives continue to be the key driver of our operating margin performance as they contributed 130 basis points. This was the 13th quarter that enterprise initiatives exceeded 100 basis points. Our performance was minimally offset by price cost, which was slightly unfavorable this quarter due to higher metal and resin prices. Volume leverage was 40 basis points and EF&C diluted margin 40 basis points resulting in operating margin of 12.8%, an increase of 110 basis points and a new Q4 record for the company. Turning to page 5, let\u2019s go into detail around segment results. Starting with Automotive OEM, we had a really strong quarter with organic revenue of 7% and solid penetration gains. In North America 2% organic growth compares to auto bills of 1%. But keep in mind that number includes the builds down 3% with the Detroit 3 where we have relatively higher content. Europe was up 8% with 500 basis points of penetration gains and China was up 33% also with very significant penetration gains. Excluding EF&C operating margin improved 320 basis points in Q4. Food Equipment had a solid quarter up 3% organically, North America equipment was up 9% due to strong demand for warewash, refrigeration and cooking. As expected service was down as we continue to work through the final phase of some fairly significant PLS activity. International equipment was flat and service was up 1%. Turning to slide 6, we also had another good quarter for Test & Measurement/Electronics and as underlying demand trends remain pretty stable. Organic revenue was flat, but margins improved 200 basis points to 20.1%. The underlying demand levels in welding have remained pretty stable for three quarters now. Year-over-year it\u2019s still pretty challenging, as evidenced by the 8% decline in organic revenues, but as you know comparisons start to ease now and that current is welding organic growth rates should be down low-to-mid single digits in Q1. The 8% decline in year-over-year revenues breaks down as 2 points from oil and gas, 5 points from industrial, which is mostly heavy equipment related to agriculture, infrastructure and mining and 1 point from commercial. On the margin front, margin improved again in welding this time by 190 basis points to 24.4%. Turning to slide 7, Polymers & Fluids delivered positive organic revenue growth of 2%. On a regional basis, international was up 3% and North America was up 1%. Automotive aftermarket and Polymers both grew 3% and Fluids declined 1%. Construction Products grew 3% organically, North America was up a solid 4%, with residential remodel up 6% and commercial down 3%. As you know quarterly growth rates can be a little lump in this segment. For the full year, North America commercial construction was up 4%, which is a better indicator of the underlying demand trends heading into 2017. Keep in mind also that the year-over-year comparison in the first quarter is pretty challenging. In Q1 2016, construction was up 5% with North America up 11%. Asia Pacific was up 1% and Europe was up 3%. Turning to slide 8, in Specialty Products organic revenue was up 1% solid growth in our consumer packaging, consumable businesses was offset by weaker demand for capital equipment. On the right side of the page, you can see the broad-based improvement in operating margin by segment. On a year-over-year basis and since we launched the enterprise strategy in 2012. It's worth noting that at the enterprise level, the non-cash expense associated with amortizing the acquisition related intangible assets has an impact of 170 basis points of operating margin and roughly $0.50 of EPS. On slide 9, you can see that we\u2019re continuing to make good progress in executing our pivot to growth. In 2016 our organic growth rate improved 160 basis points. Six of our seven segments delivered positive year-on-year organic growth. 85% of our divisions have achieved ready to grow status. In addition ITW generated organic growth above the average of our peer group and while we have more work to do to sustain organic growth and our goal is 2 percentage points or more above market, at a minimum these data points are good indicators of meaningful progress and they give us confidence that we're on the right track for 2017 and beyond. As Scott mentioned and as you can see on slide 10, 2016 was a record year, we achieved double digit EPS growth and increased revenue of $13.6 billion. Our enterprise strategy initiatives contributed 130 basis points of margin expansion as five of seven segments increased their operating margins. We increased the dividend 18%, allocated $2 billion of surplus capital to share repurchases and converted 100% of net income to free cash flow for the year. If you adjust for the timing of $145 million in cash tax payments year-over-year. Free cash flow conversion would have been 107% and more in line with 106% in 2015. Total shareholder returns for 2016 was 35% well ahead of the market in our peer group. By any financial measure ITW delivered another great year. Turning to slide 11, before discussing our outlook for 2017, I want to take this opportunity to briefly reflect on the progress of our enterprise strategy. Over the past four years we've had essentially achieved all the goals that we laid out in 2012, including increasing ITWs core operating margins from 15.9% to 22.5% and after-tax return on invested capital from 14.5% to 22.1%. As Scott, said even though our performance is nearing best in class levels we continue to see meaningful potential for further performance improvement as we work hard to deliver on ITWs full performance potential. As demonstrated on slide 12, that potential is reflected in our long term financial performance targets that will increase at our investor day in December. We maintain a clear line of sight to another 200 basis points of margin expansion from our enterprise initiatives and 25% plus operating margin by the end of 2018. We're also committed to achieving organic growth of 200 basis points or more above market. 20% plus after-tax return on invested capital, free cash flow of 100% plus of net income and 12% to 14% average total shareholder returns. Looking at the year ahead on slide 13. We're very well positioned for strong financial performance again in 2017. Today we reaffirm guidance including full year GAAP EPS in the $6 to $6.20 range with organic growth of 1.5% to 3.5%. We expect strong incremental profitability on that organic growth with core incremental margins in the 30% to 35% range. For the year, we also expect operating margin to exceed 23.5% with another 100 basis points of structural margin improvement from sourcing and 80/20. Free cash flow conversion is expected to exceed 100% of net income and we have allocated $1 billion of surplus capital to share repurchases. EF&C is off to a really good start. We expect revenues of about $500 million, operating margins of approximately 10%. After purchase accounting EF&C should contribute $0.02 to $0.04 of EPS. Finally for the first quarter our EPS guidance is $1.39 to $1.49, which is 12% year-over-year earnings growth at the midpoint with organic growth of 1% to 2%. In line with current levels of demand and as usual our guidance is based on current foreign exchange rate. Okay, with that we will now open the call to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citi. Andrew Kaplowitz : Good morning guys. I think that\u2019s me. How are you doing? So Scott or Michael, since you guided 2017 as your investor day, you might agree that global economic sentiment seems to have continued to improve and certainly not good indicators of generally getting better. Your organic growth guidance includes essentially no improvement in macro conditions, for your segments with auto, as you said at the analyst day getting worse or at least conservatively you have a build down. So, do you think at this point we should look at least at the low end of your 1.5% to 3.5% organic growth range is a bit conservative given we could see some improvements from your investor related businesses. How do you plan on that now? E. Scott Santi : Well, my response would be that we are applying you know the same approaches to our forecast and that we always have and that\u2019s that we deal with current run rates. So our forecast is absolutely 100% based on current rates projected through the year. I would certainly agree that the sediment if you will, has gotten a bit better. But I think it's really your job is to apply whatever sort of macro forecast that you see ahead to our results what we are giving you is based on actual real demand. In our businesses today how does that project through the year? I would as we said many times, we've gone through four years of work here without a lot of headwind in terms of any help from the marketplace, so we would love to see it. Pick up absolutely, but until it actually is in the businesses our approach is to deal with reality as it exists today. Andrew Kaplowitz : Understood. And did you see any improvement in December through January, so far in any of the businesses or it's kind of just steady as she goes there? E. Scott Santi : I think fourth quarter was right on track. First quarter, early January also looks solidly on track. Andrew Kaplowitz : Okay, Scott, so can I ask you about welding. If I remember correctly about 10% of the business or so are delivered in gas. You talked about the split, basically it looks oil and gas got a little bit better. But it doesn\u2019t seem like it's responded that much yet to the upstream oil and gas environment getting better. Certainly your heavy equipment seems, same as last quarter maybe a little worse. So I\u2019m a little surprised that welding hasn't shown any signs of improvement. Have you seen anything there? And do you expect maybe oil and gas to start to improve from here? E. Scott Santi : I think, I'll go back to what Michael said in his remarks, which is we've seen pretty solid floor [ph] for the last three quarters and I think that in and of itself as \u2013 I would consider that to be modestly encouraging. I think we're a ways away from, I mean, I don\u2019t know about ways away, but I think we haven't seen anything in terms of and what I would describe is a noticeable uptick from there. But it sits now three quarters of pretty firm stable bottom, which is always the first part of any turnaround. So again hopeful that things start to improve there, but nothing we\u2019re seeing yet. Andrew Kaplowitz : All right. Thanks for that Scott. Operator : The next question we have coming from the line of John Inch from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. John Inch : How did Europe do overall, Scott and Michael, 3M called out a better Europe, they talked about. I know you\u2019re a big company in Germany, they talked about three quarters of kind of improving results in Germany. What are you guys seeing there? Michael M. Larsen: Well, John, this is Michael here. I mean, the big driver of the 3% growth in Europe is the automotive business as you might expect. So I'm not sure we are really good proxy for what's going on in terms of the broader macro environment, but our automotive business as you saw what's up 8% in Europe and that's where the main driver of the 3% growth this quarter. John Inch : Well, you\u2019re also a big construction company in Europe, has that shown any sort of trend one way or another? E. Scott Santi : Construction has been pretty stable, but positive in Europe and was up by 3% in the fourth quarter. John Inch : All right. And then I wanted to ask you going back to welding, so the government is looking to prospectively approve more pipeline activity. What is the nature of Miller's exposure to pipelines? And is that obviously not a short-term, but is it a longer term opportunity because you obviously are big player in North America, right, but what about the pipeline aspect of this? E. Scott Santi : Yeah, I would say we've got a pretty reasonable position there. Overall oil and gas for welding is roughly 15% of revenue and that includes pipeline, upstream, downstream, refining, construction, offshore et cetera and I think our exposures are pretty balanced though, certainly any uptick in activity in terms of pipeline construction would surely be incrementally favorable to us. John Inch : Your European welding businesses is also heavily oil and gas. The stabilization/MRO sort of slow that you've seen improving in the upstream improvement. If you were to look at your oil and gas welding, vertical kind of regionally, right, and I'm just thinking of Europe because it may be a good proxy. Has Europe \u2013 have there been any signs of life in that business going back to the premise of you know when do you start to see welding turn. Because I think Scott you have made comments before that you thought there was a fairly robust pent up demand kind of more broadly in welding, given what\u2019s happened the last couple of years. Is there anything [indiscernible] from that? Michael M. Larsen : Sure. I\u2019d still agree with that statement and that\u2019s just based on our historical participation in this market going back to the early 90s. You know usually come out of these down cycles there is a lot of demand and recoveries are pretty robust. This one has been particularly, noteworthy decline. At this point, what I would say about Europe and our welding business is the first thing is it's a pretty small piece of the overall welding business, so I'm not sure how indicative it is in terms of overall oil and gas activity. Our big oil and gas positions are North American and China. Welding Europe was down about the same percentage on a full year basis. As the overall business down about 9%, so I think, A; given our relatively small position in Europe, not a great indicator of overall macro oil and gas and B; we haven't really seen any change over there. John Inch : Just lastly is there any price change in welding given the sort of the collapse in the oil and gas market. So now we're probably at the trough, and we\u2019ve had three quarters of sequential stability. What's going on with price in that business? So in other words when it comes back, 3/9.11 of the world price more aggressively kind of taken your variable contribution away or what do you feel guys telling on price? Thank you. E. Scott Santi : Well, like it's been very stable over the course of the last four quarters. We talked before about our overall mix tilting very heavily towards the more value-added components of the welding product portfolio, if you will. So from the standpoint of our overall exposure to pricing pressure, I think we're in pretty good shape there. As I said it's not been \u2013 we haven\u2019t seen any evidence of any downward trends of any, at any meaningful level over the last four quarters. John Inch : Thank you very much. Operator : The next question we have is coming from the line of Scott Davis from Barclays. Your line is open. Scott Davis : I'm not familiar with EF&C so I apologize to those on the phone who are. But can you tell us kind of what's the plan on how you get that 10% margin up or is this the turnaround story with some low hanging fruit that is a manufacturing cost, is it something else that give you some confidence, you can get this thing up to, kind of your type of margins over time? E. Scott Santi : Yeah, well it is simply an 80/20 application sort. You know we have an existing business operating at mid-20s EBIT margins applying 80/20 you know very effectively and so I wouldn't call it a turnaround, it's a very good business, very well positioned. It has absolutely all the same characteristics in terms of value-add content, niche in their approach as our legacy business. It's just a function of going through the process of adding the 80/20 management process to all the sort of great raw material and great operating capability that already exists in that business. That is not a quick fix, that's typically 3 year to 5 year process, so the plan is, I think the entry margins were 7 and so we\u2019ve talked about before is going from 7% to 20% over a five year period. Scott Davis : Is the gross margin comparable to kind of what your business\u2019 gross margin was before you fixed your own internal business? E. Scott Santi : Yeah I would offer that we have some very well developed diagnostics around applicability in fit for 80/20 and all of the raw materials there and then some. Scott Davis : Okay, that's all I had. I\u2019ll pass it on. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question we have is coming from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Joe Ritchie : Thanks, good morning everyone. So maybe sorry Michael can you parse out the price cost this quarter, I know it was negative in total, but how much pricing did you guys get and what was the cost impact this quarter? Michael M. Larsen: Yeah, so what you're seeing Joe, is price was a fundamentally unchanged, nothing has changed in terms of our ability to get price. The difference, the 10 basis points is really as a result of increase in raw material prices specifically metal and resins in a few of our segments. But just to put it in context, the difference between flat price cost, which is our assumption for the year in 2017 which is unchanged and down 10 basis points is $3 million. So on total, relative to total operating income this quarter of $742 million. So I just wanted to put in context for you and again, I mean, price cost has not been a big favorable margin driver for us and we don't expect it to be a big headwind for 2017. E. Scott Santi : And just to add a clarifying point, sourcing benefit is communicated in the enterprise initiatives and this is the normal. Michael M. Larsen: Yeah, the key driver obviously, remains as I said in the prepared remarks of our margin expansion is the enterprise initiatives, so that's 80/20 and the sourcing efforts that contributed 130 basis points this quarter and for the year. Joe Ritchie : That makes sense. Maybe shifting gears a little bit, Auto OEM and the margin expansion this quarter, it was much better than we anticipated over 300 basis points EF&C. Can you guys just give us a little bit more color? Clearly the enterprise initiatives are working there, but what else kind of drove the stronger margin performance in auto OEM? E. Scott Santi : If you go to, Joe, the, there\u2019s slide in the appendix of the press release that lays out the drivers of the operating margin by segment and in total. And really as you point out the operating leverage was 100 basis points enterprise initiatives about 160 basis points. Then EF&C diluted by 220 basis points, restructuring and other was slightly lower, 60 basis points so overall 100 basis points of total operating margin change on the core business. I just wanted you know so the better proxy for where this business is operating I think is the, if you look at the full year for 2016 on slide 8, 24.1% that includes 160 basis points of EF&C so 25.7% EBIT margins in the core business in automotive in 2016 with room to improve from here. Joe Ritchie : Got it. And maybe if I can sneak one more in here, I saw that commercial in North America was down 3, are you starting to see any pressure in that business, just from an end market standpoint or anything notable that occurred this quarter? E. Scott Santi : No, no that's just \u2013 it can be a little lumpy in construction and that's really it, I mean, like I said the better way to look at is the 4% growth for the year. As a good proxy for what 2017 might look like. Joe Ritchie : Okay. Fair enough. Thanks guys. Operator : All right. The next question we have is coming from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open Nigel Coe : Yeah, thanks good morning. Just obviously, you talk about, Scott, you mentioned in your opening remarks, about how there still, a lot of runway from end price initiatives, you got 25% are in target. I\u2019m just wondering obviously the early stages was dominated by the business transformation structural organizational changes. I think then the sourcing was meant to kind of like pick up like towards the back end of the plan. I\u2019m just wondering how you view the major drivers of further margin expansion between organizational PLS and sourcing? E. Scott Santi : Well, what we talked about back in December was from the sourcing standpoint. We think we've got at least another couple of years of work in opportunity in front of us in terms of additional structural changes for the benefit of the company. At some point it becomes a much more of maintenance activity, but we've got a solid pipeline of targets in activity going on. So there's at least a couple of years worth of work, an opportunity there. Likewise from an 80/20 perspective our efforts to reapply this sort of the current version of 80/20 inside ITW that we talked about again back in December where we\u2019ve completely reengineered the process and are very focused on executing it to its full potential. There's at least a couple of years worth of work there. I think the best way I can characterize and then on top of it, is as we expect further organic acceleration at you know solid 35% incremental all that gives us room to run this out for you at least the next couple of years, if not longer. We\u2019ve also talked about the fact that this is, we\u2019re operating at levels today that we didn't see as even within our scope of potential four years ago, so this has been a process of the deeper we go, the more opportunity we find. I think we've got the ability to sort of plan and execute on sort of sequential to your parents or your time horizons given what we have visibility of. But I you know I would rule out the fact that, now that we\u2019re in, we\u2019re going to find some more opportunity and that\u2019s really been the way this has been playing out. Nigel Coe : Okay. Again, going back to December, it doesn\u2019t feel like there's a huge change in the way you\u2019re viewing capital allocations between share buybacks and M&A. But I thought the comment you gave to Scott is comment about EF&C, what\u2019s driving that margin is that applying A22 [ph] to that structure. So I\u2019m just wondering why wouldn\u2019t that principle apply to other opportunities, given that you're running well ahead of where some of your competitors are? Why wouldn\u2019t kind of the pendulum swings towards more M&A. Do you have confidence that you can run businesses better than your competitors? E. Scott Santi : Well, I think running them better is one thing, growing them is another. I think that's really been you know, that's the big delta in terms of M&A fits. We didn\u2019t buy EF&C because we can improve the margins. We bought EF&C because it extends, in our view in a very meaningful way our organic growth potential in the Automotive segment. The margin improvement - the ability improve margins it's certainly through 80/20 is an important part of the equation. But I would view that as more risk mitigation on return on investment. It's not the core reason we buy. You know we can buy a lot of things and work really hard for five years improving the operating margins, but ultimately if we can't grow them when we're done doing that at a rate that's consistent with what we're trying to do get done here it becomes counterproductive and creates a lot of complexity. Nigel Coe : Yeah, that's good answer. Thanks a lot. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Andy Casey from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Andy Casey : I know you talked about stable demand, but if market demand supports faster organic growth through the year you know let's say above that 3.5% upper end of organic guidance. All else equal, would you expect short-term core incrementals to exceed the upper end of guidance, you know that 30% to 35%. Or could you pivot and reinvest in the core business at a faster rate? E. Scott Santi : I think, Andy, as we talked about in December that that incremental margin of 30% to 35% already includes all the investment that we want to make in our businesses, so that's a sustainable rate on a go forward basis and it\u2019s a by-product of the way we run the business, it's not a target that we drive to with intention. Andy Casey : Sure. I'm just wondering if given that outlook, if you kind of have a reinvestment budget in mind. If the actual end market growth exceeds the outlook, does the upper end of that core incremental start to exceed 35% in the short-term? E. Scott Santi : They might. Yeah and it's not because we\u2019re holding back investment, I think the point that we want to make sure is clear, is that we are fully invested and continue to improve the productivity and accelerate the organic growth of these businesses. When Michael talks about our capital allocation, he talk about that as our first priority. So it's not like we're saying, we\u2019re only going to do so much because we can afford to do more, it's that we are \u2013 its only so much you can do, particularly through the lens of quality investment and things that drive results at ITW. All that gets prioritized as the first priority with regard to our capital allocation. There\u2019s not, just because things are better than our forecasting scenario, there\u2019s not a bunch of things we wish we could do that we're not doing that we\u2019ll all of a sudden turn on, that\u2019s not, it's just not how it works here. So I think in the short run faster growth is certainly going to have the potential to have higher incrementals. Andy Casey : Okay, thanks a lot, Scott. And then one additional thing, I know you talked about stability in the quarter and so far in January. In addition to some of these sentiment indices, other companies have talked about kind of, you know some catch-up demand during the quarter where the post-election environment in the U.S. might have been a little bit better than the pre-election. Did you see any of that sort of inflection? I know it could just be a temporary phenomenon. I just wondered if you guys saw any of that? E. Scott Santi : No, I think the simple sort of way to look at the quarter from a demand standpoint is all the segments we\u2019re on trend, we thought of being a little bit better. Michael M. Larsen: Yeah and I\u2019d just add, Andy, if you look at the monthly very similar in 2016 to 2015 and prior years, so nothing unusual. Andy Casey : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Next question is from Mig Dobre from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open. Mig Dobre : Maybe trying to ask the prior question a little bit differently. If I'm looking at North America, I know you talked about it throughout 2016. In the first three quarters, North America has grown for you anywhere between 0.5% to 2% and you were flat in the fourth quarter. So wondering if there are some comps issue here or anything like that? How do you think about North America in 2017 within the context of your 1.5 to 3.5 organic guidance? Michael M. Larsen: This is Mike. I mean, the delta in Q4 relative to Q3 and year-to-date growth rates was really have Test & Measurement had a big Q3 as you recall, up 7% and was down slightly in North America, so that's really what tipped the scale here in Q4. I think in terms of 2017, if you took at current run rates, we still expect low single digit type growth in North America. Mig Dobre : But if I may tease this out a little bit, do you think that North America is going to be towards kind of the low end of that organic guidance or towards the higher end of that organic guidance? Michael M. Larsen : Well, so we don't give guidance by geography and we give guidance on current run rate sentiment. It\u2019s certainly more positive, we acknowledge and we\u2019ve talked automotive as a little bit of a wildcard in terms of the outlook for the year, but overall we feel very good going into 2017. Mig Dobre : Okay, great. Then my follow-up, maybe you can comment a little bit on your geographic balance from a manufacturing standpoint. Are you net exporter or importer out of the U.S.? Are you making any sort of changes to your manufacturing strategy, given all the talk that's out there on policy changes? E. Scott Santi : Yeah, the overall answer to that is that we have been a produce where we sell company for a long, long time and none of what's out there in the conversation right now would have any impact in terms of our, any changes in that. We are roughly a modest net exporter from North America to the tune of 4% to 5% of revenue. So pretty balanced in terms of, I think that supports what I\u2019ve just said, we are largely producing where our customers are. We do that not because it's low cost, but because it's the most efficient way to serve our customers around the world and it is something that has served us very well and I don't see that changing regardless of any changes in some of the rules in trade policies, et cetera. Mig Dobre : Great. Thank you guys. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Ann Duignan from JPMorgan. Your line is now. Ann Duignan : Can you talk a little bit about as you enter 2017, which of your businesses are achieving the 200 basis points above market growth? Obviously, Automotive is one of those. And which are you most concerned about are working hard just went to accomplish that 200 bps above market? Michael M. Larsen: Well, I think there are a number of businesses that, first let me just answer the enterprise level. I think, if you look at our performance in 2016 relative to peers or relative to market at the enterprise level we would certainly argue that we grew above market in 2016. If you just look at the performance by business, certainly automotive as you mentioned grew above market. Food Equipment overall, grew above market, we\u2019ve talked about the service fees there, but certainly on the equipment side. I would put Test & Measurement, probably in line with market into 2016. Polymers & Fluids; Polymers, show some PLS activity. In 2016 construction specialty right in line with market. Ann Duignan : Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And on the construction side what specifically do you think you need to do to get benefits outperforming because it is a very [indiscernible]. E. Scott Santi : Yeah, I think the big part of the agenda there's, we still got a decent percentage of not ready to do businesses primarily in Europe, we're still working on restructuring our European businesses over there. We made a lot of progress in that regard in 2016. And would expect to get through the bulk of that probably by the end of 2017. But North America, the business is performing pretty well and certainly is \u2013 the bulk of the agenda now in our North American construction business is centered around consulting organic growth and I think we're really well positioned to do that. But we got Europe straightened away. Ann Duignan : Okay, and that\u2019s been pretty consistent, I think. Just a quick follow-up on the metals and resin price increases. I'm assuming Polymer includes the segment most impacted by resin, which of the businesses, has been impacted by our metal prices. I know you said that\u2019s them, not very material, but still it is a rising risk? E. Scott Santi : Yeah, you're right, I mean, we think this is very manageable, I mean Automotive, Food would be the primary ones, steel prices. Then also on the welding side, a little bit, but again it's not, our business units are all over this. We have a pretty good track record of managing the price cost equation. As a reminder we\u2019re not trying to generate, price significantly above inflation. We\u2019re just trying to cover our costs and I think we've done a pretty good job with that historically. Ann Duignan : Probably just one, the first quarter since we could find where it was a negative. So I think it just caused some of [indiscernible]? E. Scott Santi : We talked a little bit about it in December, right, that we wouldn't be surprised if we saw some headwind on the price cost equation for a quarter or two until we get a chance to kind of respond. Then I would just point out, like I said, earlier we're talking about the difference between neutral and 10 basis points is $3 million out of $742 million of operating income in the quarter. So, I wouldn't get too alarmed. Ann Duignan : Fair point, okay I\u2019ll get back in line. Thanks. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Steven Fisher from UBS. Your line is open. Steven Fisher : Thanks. Just to follow-up on North American growth in 2017. Would you expect the growth to start-off the year slower given the tough comp you mentioned in construction in Q1, I assume that construction comp it was driven by North America? And then would you see acceleration expected starting already in Q2? E. Scott Santi : As you know Steven, the forecasting business, I mean, we said 1% to 2% for overall enterprise growth in the first quarter that's a little bit below where we are for the year. So the improvement in the growth rate in the second half of 2017 is really based on comps. Comps getting a little bit easier, so that's how I would position it and that's all this is at current run rates. Steven Fisher : Okay. I was just trying to have the expectation that if we see a soft North America in Q1, that\u2019s kind of within your expectations. It sounds like it would be, but just on expectation. Michael M. Larsen : Yeah, well, that's right. Yeah, that's right and then primarily, I mean, the comp in construction \u2013 E. Scott Santi : It\u2019s all relative to comp. Michael M. Larsen: Yeah, I mean, the comp in construction, that up 11%, that\u2019s a tough one, so you're right. Steven Fisher : Okay. Then how sensitive is your buyback programs, to level of the stock price or will it be entirely independent there. I mean, you doubled your plan buyback at the beginning of last year, which I assume is partly because the stock was down was up. But actually we think about the judgment that we apply, that, we don\u2019t have $2 billion of cash flow expected here, only 1 billion of buyback. E. Scott Santi : Yeah, I mean, the stock wasn\u2019t really down last year. I mean, the average for the year is 107, so $2 million at an average of 107. And we\u2019ve talked about this before, I mean, we really are in the market on a continuous basis and so this year we have planned it as $250 a quarter, similar to what we did last year. If we were able to the extent that there is a market correction, we certainly have the ability to step in and do a little bit more. But fundamentally the way we think about it is we have a business model here that over the long-term can generate 12% to 14% TSR. Over the long-term that will be reflected we believe in the value of the company and so on and that's how we approach the share buyback program. And it\u2019s really our way to return incremental surplus capital to shareholder business, if there is not an alternative, got to learn some use of that cash other than we could sit on it. Michael M. Larsen: That's right, $1 billion that we have allocated in 2017 is our best estimate of the surplus capital available in North America and so that's. Once we're done with that everything, we talked about the internal investments, dividends, acquisitions that need a set of criteria, with the remainder of the surplus capital then allocated to the share buyback program. Just going to add one other clarification which was the incremental 1 million that we had last year was to some repatriation that we were able to do, it wasn\u2019t related to share price, which was up 35% once. Just to point that out. Steven Fisher : That's perfect. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Jamie Cook : guess two quick questions. One, I mean everyone's tried the question of whether we've seen improvement in demand post-election and you\u2019ve said no. You have referenced better sort of sentiment out there? When you're talking sentiment is that because you're specifically talking to your customers and they're telling you they feel better or are you just watching the stock market and the broader new. I'm just wondering if it's stuff you're reading or stuff you\u2019re hearing from your customers? Then my second question assuming North America does get better at some point. Is there a difference, should we think about North America, is the profitability, I guess, across the different geographies similar now? Or is North America generally have more profitable businesses you know based on what you've done with the enterprise initiatives I don't know if that's - you know the profit by geographies changed at all? Thank you. E. Scott Santi : Yeah, I\u2019ll take the first one and let Michael talk about the second. In terms of the sentiment, I would say it's all of the above. In other words, it's what we read is what our customers talk about, but I'm not sure our customers are doing anything other than reacting to what they're reading, who they're talking to so. As we've talked before, it's I don't think there's any secret that the overall mood seems to be modestly better. Whether that translates into anything meaningful in terms of demand that remains to be seen in terms of our planning. It\u2019s as we said many times we're going to set ourselves up to execute well in the environment as it exists today and certainly be in a position to continue to do so, whichever way the market moves. Michael M. Larsen: Then, Jamie, your question on margins in North America, they are very consistent across all three geographies at ITW, so we could choose different than it was five years. E. Scott Santi : Yeah, absolutely and I think there's - if you look at, so the average of the company is about 23% now that's fairly consistent in North America and Europe as well as, Asia Pacific. Obviously, we have on a relative basis more exposure in North America, about 50% of our sales are in North America, but the margins are the same. Jamie Cook : Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks, I\u2019ll get back in queue. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Walter Liptak from Seaport Global. Your line is open. Walter Liptak : I wanted to ask one about the Food Equipment business and there has been some volatility around some of the restaurants and questions about CapEx. I know you guys have a lot of institutional or are you seeing the same kind of volatility to or same concern on either side. Michael M. Larsen: This is Michael, so institution was really strong in the fourth quarter, you saw Equipment up 9 in North America. Restaurants maybe a little slow early in the quarter, but then picked up in November, December and really stable demand. Then the third piece, I\u2019d just add our retail business, also a solid growth on that side. We haven\u2019t seen any - just look at the number, it\u2019s up 9%, anything to suggest that things are slowing down. Walter Liptak : Well, that's great thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Eli Lustgarten from Longbow Securities. Your line is open. Eli Lustgarten : A couple of follow-on questions since we\u2019ve covered a lot of ground; one, the 100 basis points improvement in profitability. I mean, can you give us an idea where to expect more to come from and I assume welding is going to have difficulty holding its margins collections for \u2013 showing much improvement in 2017 versus 2016. Give us some idea where the probability change we expect across the segments? E. Scott Santi : Well, I mean, the best answer, Eli, I can give you that we would expect to see improvement in all of our segments as we continue to execute on the enterprise strategy, so. Eli Lustgarten : Anyone else besides welding that would be more challenged in 2017, I think welding will be challenged this year? E. Scott Santi : I don't think we would share that view. I think welding has done a nice job, sustaining margins with a lot of downward pressure on revenue. Certainly, has more room to run in terms of enterprise initiatives. Michael M. Larsen: Welding will be part of the \u2013 E. Scott Santi : Yeah, I mean, look at welding margins this year, right, and big improvement again in Q4, up 190 basis points and 210 basis points of that was from enterprise initiatives. So \u2013 Eli Lustgarten : Are you talking about a business that\u2019s down peak to trough, more than 20 percent. E. Scott Santi : Yeah. Eli Lustgarten : 15 days, you announced the formation of the integrated electronic assembly equipment division and you made some changes. I assume maybe handicap, what can we expect out of that consolidation, I assume there\u2019s no improvement for changes in the past 2017 forecast, but even some handicap of what we might be able to do for the segments and improving that? E. Scott Santi : I think from your perspective Eli, it\u2019s not going to do anything, so this is more of a natural outcome of continuing to simplify these businesses and structures and the final phases of business structure simplification, so doesn't do anything in terms of the overall results that we're looking at here. Eli Lustgarten : Just one on automotive, with the slowdown of production is, are there any changes in the automotive spending habits or spending that you\u2019re hearing across the board, particularly in North America, where they just \u2013 this is what adjustments and factored and your penetration will offset it. E. Scott Santi : I think it's been pretty stable I think there are some forecasts out for some slowing in North America in the back half of the year. But in terms of what we're seeing right now and you could see the numbers. Q4 was strong, we\u2019re telling Q1 is in solid shape. Certainly, we\u2019re aware of some of the expectations, but nothing coming through for our customers at this point. Eli Lustgarten : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : All right. The last question we had on the line is \u2013 coming from the line of Joe O'Dea from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open. Joe O'Dea: First, just a clarification on some of the welding in oil and gas comments that the stabilization that you\u2019ve seen over the past few quarters, are you seeing it similarly in the North America onshore markets as you are in the offshore markets. I think you know some encouraging signs recently in the onshore markets, but just want to get a sense of whether or not you think both onshore and offshore have bottomed at this point. E. Scott Santi : We participate in all those markets, I don't have the data right in front of me to answer your question with a great level of detail. So I'll just go back to what we said earlier, overall demand is stable in that business including on the oil and gas side so. Joe O'Dea: Then just one on some potential policy and you commented on this past year taking advantage of some repatriation to take up the buyback. If you do find that there is policy that enables you to access. A lot of cash that is overseas, is share repurchase the most likely avenue for that? Or are there other capital deployment sides of it that we should be thinking about. E. Scott Santi : Yeah, I think it's a little too early to tell. I think that policy in that area is still evolving and trying to guess where it might end up, I don't think would be prudent. We have about, a little more than $2 billion of capital overseas. If we bring some of that back, it would go into the surplus capital category and we would kind of look into the options at that point, but again it's hard to say anything really insightful given the uncertainty in this area. Joe O'Dea: Very fair. Thanks very much. Operator : At this time speakers, not showing further questions on queue. Michael M. Larsen: Okay. Great. Thank you for joining us and have a good day. E. Scott Santi : Thank you. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for joining. You may disconnect at this time.",

At this time, all participants will be on a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this point. Now, I'll turn the meeting over to your host, Mr. Michael Larsen, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Sir, you may now begin. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: All right. Thank you, Andrew. Good morning, and welcome to ITW's first quarter 2017 conference call. I am Michael Larsen, ITW's Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining me this morning is our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi. During today's call, we will discuss our first quarter financial results and update you on our 2017 earnings forecast. Before we get to the results, let me remind you that this presentation contains our financial forecasts for the second quarter and full year 2017 as well as other forward-looking statements identified on this slide. We refer you to the company's 2016 Form 10-K for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Also, this presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures. And while we use very few non-GAAP measures, a reconciliation of those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release. With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott. Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Thanks, Michael, and good morning. Overall, we're off to a good start in 2017. Organic growth improved to 3.5% in Q1 due to a combination of improving end market conditions in our Welding and Test & Measurement and Electronics segments and continued progress on our pivot to growth efforts across all seven of our segments. We were able to leverage this improving organic growth performance into very strong earnings growth, with EPS up 19% year-on-year in the quarter, 21% excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. Operating margins of 23.3% were up 120 basis points and were the highest in the history of the company, despite 50 basis points of margin dilution from the EF&C acquisition. After-tax return on invested capital improved 260 basis points to 23.8%. As you saw based on our Q1 performance, we are increasing our full year EPS guidance by $0.20 at the midpoint and raising our full year organic growth rate forecast to a range of 2% to 4%. Overall, our Q1 performance reflects another solid step forward for the company. And I would like to once again thank all of my ITW colleagues around the world for all their hard work and their deep commitment to serving our customers and executing our strategy with excellence. As a result of their ongoing efforts, I have no doubt that we will continue to make strong progress on the path to ITW's full potential through the balance of 2017 and beyond. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Michael, who will provide you with more detail regarding our Q1 performance and 2017 forecast. Michael? Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Thank you, Scott. Starting with slide 3, GAAP EPS increased 19% to $1.54, 21% excluding the effects of currency translation. As Scott noted a minute ago, organic growth was 3.5% in the quarter. Total revenue was $3.5 billion, an increase of 6%. Six of our seven segments had positive organic growth and Welding improved to flat. Organic growth was positive in all major geographies, with North America up 1.4% and International up 6.4%, driven primarily by Europe, which was up 6% and China, which was up 19%. We increased operating margin 120 basis points over last year, which was driven by continued progress on our enterprise strategy initiatives and volume leverage. Enterprise initiatives contributed 100 basis points of margin expansion. The 2016 acquisition of EF&C diluted margin by 50 basis points. So on an apples-to-apples basis, operating margin improved 170 basis points. Six of seven segments increased operating margin. And excluding the EF&C margin impact and Auto OEM, all segments improved. Operating income grew 12% to $809 million, the highest quarterly total in the company's 105-year history. Our effective tax rate was 28.3% in the first quarter, which was in line with our expectations as we adopted new FASB guidance for stock-based compensation effective January 1. The new guidance requires that the income tax effects associated with the settlement of stock-based awards be recognized through income tax expense rather than equity. Free cash flow of $399 million was 74% of net income, which is in line with typical seasonality. That said, in Q1, free cash flow was impacted by the timing of some tax and pension items. Adjusted for these items, free cash flow conversion would have been even better at 91%. On slide 4, you can see that we achieved an all-time record for operating margin in the quarter. This was largely driven by the continued strong execution on our enterprise initiatives and volume leverage. Enterprise initiatives contributed 100 basis points of structural margin improvement and volume leverage contributed 80 basis points. As expected, price/cost was slightly unfavorable in Q1 due primarily to higher steel prices. At current raw material costs and with our 2017 price adjustments, we expect that price/cost for the full year will be positive in dollar terms and slightly unfavorable 10 to 30 basis points to margin percentage. As we've discussed before, we don't expect that price/cost will have a material impact on our results in 2017. Turning to slide 5, on the left side of the page, overall organic growth in Q1 improved 1.5 percentage points versus Q4 due to meaningful improvement in end market conditions in our Welding and Test & Measurement and Electronics segments, continued strong and above plan organic growth from our Auto OEM segment, and continued progress on our pivot to growth efforts across all seven of our segments. I'll now discuss the segment results in a little more detail, starting with Automotive OEM, which delivered another strong quarter with above plan organic revenue growth of 9%, 300 basis points above global car builds. In North America, 4% organic growth exceeded auto builds of 3% overall and 1% for the Detroit 3 where we have relatively higher content. Outside North America, growth continued to be very strong, with Europe up 12% or 600 basis points above market. China was up 29%, significantly above market as we continue to increase our content per vehicle, particularly with domestic OEMs. Despite the strong performance in Q1 and a positive outlook for Q2 for our Auto OEM business, IHS is still forecasting a decline in domestic auto builds in the second half. Our full year guidance incorporates the IHS forecast as it currently stands, which results in full-year organic growth for our Auto OEM business of approximately 3%. Turning to slide 6. Food Equipment was up 2% organically. North America was up 1%, with stable demand for equipment up 2%. Internationally, both equipment and service were up 3%. Operating margin improved 60 basis points to 25.1%. We had a strong quarter in Test & Measurement and Electronics, both businesses grew organic revenue by 6%, with strong demand in semiconductor-related end markets. In Test & Measurement's Instron business, where demand is tied more closely to business investment, organic growth was up 5%, which is certainly an encouraging sign. Operating margin improved 450 basis points to 20%. The 20% includes 350 basis points of the non-cash expense associated with amortizing acquisition-related intangible assets. Turning to slide 7, Welding organic growth was flat in Q1, which is a significant improvement versus down 8% in Q4. Excluding normal seasonality, demand improved 3% sequentially from Q4 to Q1. Year-over-year, equipment was up 1% and consumables were down 1%. By geography, North America, which is approximately 80% of our business, was up 2%, driven by our commercial equipment business. Our commercial equipment business, which sells through distribution to construction, light fabrication, and farm and ranch customers, was up 4% year-on-year in Q1. Our industrial equipment business, which sells primarily to manufacturing, including automotive and heavy equipment, was down 1% in the quarter. Operating margin performance was the highest in the company at 27.7%. Polymers & Fluids delivered another solid quarter of positive organic revenue growth of 2%. Bulk (09:51) Fluids, which primarily sells highly engineered lubricants and cleaners into industrial and commercial end markets and automotive aftermarket, grew 2%. Polymers, which primarily sells adhesives and sealants for industrial MRO and other OEM applications, was essentially flat. Operating margin was 20.6%, which includes 420 basis points of non-cash expense associated with amortizing acquisition-related intangible assets. On slide 8, Construction Products was up 3% organically, despite a challenging comparison. Demand in North America was solid with organic growth down 2% compared to up 11% in Q1 last year. Commercial was down 1% and residential was down 2%. And as we've discussed before, the quarterly revenue numbers here can be a little lumpy. International growth was strong, with Europe up 8% and Asia Pacific up 5%. Operating margin improved 150 basis points to 22.5%. Finally, in Specialty Products, organic revenue was up 1%, with strong organic growth of 8% in our consumer packaging businesses. Operating margin was 26.9%, an increase of 80 basis points. Turning to slide 9 and our updated guidance for 2017. As a result of our strong Q1 results and assumptions for the balance of the year, we're raising our full year earnings guidance by $0.20 to a new EPS range of $6.20 to $6.40. The $0.20 raise is essentially $0.10 from the first quarter beat, plus $0.06 from higher organic growth, and $0.04 from a slightly lower tax rate of 29%. At current levels of demand, we now expect higher organic growth of 2% to 4%, which, as mentioned previously, includes the IHS forecast for North American Automotive business in the second half of the year. For the full year, we continue expect that operating margin will exceed 23.5%, with 100 basis points of structural margin improvement from our enterprise initiatives. Finally, for the second quarter, our EPS guidance is $1.55 to $1.65 with organic growth of 2% to 4%. With that, we'll now open the call to your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Mr. Andrew Kaplowitz from Citi. Your line is now open, sir. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Morning guys. Nice quarter. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Good morning. Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Good morning. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Can you give us a little more color on your Welding business? You had forecast it to be down, I think, low single-digits for this year. It was flat at 1Q as you said. Comparisons, I think, get easier as the year goes on. So would you expect it to grow now? And then maybe more interestingly, I don't know if I remember a time when your Welding margins have been higher than 27.7%. You did almost 400 basis points higher margins this year versus last year on similar demand. So how do we think about Welding? Could you potentially do 400 basis points higher than the last peak in 2014, which was about 26%? Where is the peak here? Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Well, I don't know if we can give you a peak. What I can tell you is, relative to where margins peaked that you referenced in terms of the, I think you said 2014, certainly, the impact of the enterprise initiatives that we have been implementing across the company have been taking place in Welding right along with the rest of the company. So what you're seeing in terms of improved margin performance is starting to turn the corner, obviously, in terms of demand and revenue, and the benefits of those enterprises initiatives are now starting to come through in a little bit more of a visible way, let's say, relative to an environment where we're down mid to high single digits. So they've done a lot of really strong work despite a very tough environment over the last three or four years in terms of the enterprise initiatives. And I think as Michael noted in terms of the demand environment, we were certainly encouraged by some noticeable improvement primarily in the commercial end of our equipment business. But even the industrial down, I think, 1% in Q1 was a noticeable improvement in terms of what we've been seeing over the last six quarters or so. So things appear to be stabilizing there, getting better on the commercial end. And if we continue on this path, obviously, it will have some pretty good impact in terms of our performance through the balance of the year. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks for that, Scott. And then, look, I mean, you had over 40% incrementals in the quarter and that was despite dilution from EF&C and you mentioned price/cost being a drag. I think at the Analyst Day, you mentioned variable margin at 50% in ITW. So is it reasonable to assume that if organic growth stays toward the higher end of your new range that you could do incrementals well over your normal 35% target? Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: So Andrew, incremental margins, as you pointed out of \u2013 if you look straight off the P&L, we're 44%, certainly, really solid performance. If you add back the impact of EF&C, we are in the 77% range for incrementals. We talked about this on the call last time that, in the short term, we could see incremental margins above our long-term average of 30% to 35% until investments in overhead and other areas catch up to support the growth. Our view, long term, is we would still expect to be in that 30% to 35% range for incremental margins, but certainly well above that here in the near term. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: But Michael, you don't have any new investments that you're making this year versus what you did in the first quarter, right, and pretty much steady as she goes? Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Yeah. No, we're always investing and the levels we're investing at now are similar to what we have been doing in prior years. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Mr. Scott Davis from Barclays. Sir, your line is now open. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Hi, Scott. Good morning. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Trying to get a sense, one of the things that was encouraging that you said was around the Test & Measurement business recovering, and organic growth up 6% is a real encouraging number. And can you give us a little bit of color behind that? I mean, are you seeing customers really responding with some CapEx spend? Is there some pent-up demand, is there \u2013 was there any business pushed from 2017 \u2013 I'm sorry, from 2016 budgets into 2017 budgets that can account for that or \u2013 been trying to see if there's a real recovery here that you're seeing or something more short term in nature. Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Well, I think it's \u2013 from my perspective, Scott, it's hard to tell at this point. I think the overall order \u2013 we typically operate with very little backlog, very little forward visibility. The uptick in demand in Test & Measurement is certainly encouraging at this point but it's only a quarter. I think we have a general view, that I think many people share, that the overall business investment climate has been very depressed for the last six to eight quarters that, as a result, there is some pent-up demand that should conditions overall \u2013 the economy overall begin to improve even modestly that that will be a stimulus in terms of bringing some more comfort around investment back into the picture. So we're certainly hopeful that this is the start of something \u2013 a more positive turn in that direction, but I think after one quarter, I don't think we're ready to call it that yet. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Fair enough. And then just as a follow-on, I mean you have a bit of a \"high quality problem\", if you want to call it that, of you're going to generate an awful lot of cash in 2017 even if 1Q is seasonally weaker, it's going to start piling in. Is there a appetite for higher level of buybacks, if there's anything out there that \u2013 would your appetite for M&A go up a tad with this increased cash? Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: I think, (18:42) Scott, nothing's really changed in terms of how we look at capital allocation. You're right that we're fortunate that we have a strong balance sheet and we generate free cash flow well above net income on an annual basis. In terms of the buybacks specifically, we have planned for $1 billion of buybacks in 2017 starting with $250 million. In the first quarter we have done that and certainly we're on track to execute on that program. To the extent that there is surplus capital, we'll address that as we go through the quarter and we'll update you on the earnings calls if that number can go higher from here. But certainly, we're off to a good start on free cash flow. I'd say on the M&A environment, we've talked about this on prior calls, our views haven't really changed. And just because we're sitting on more cash, doesn't mean that we will not be disciplined in terms of how we look at M&A. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: No, I understand. Nicely done. I normally don't say this, guys, but boy, you're really executing. In the couple years I've covered your stock, it's been pretty amazing, so keep up the good work. Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line is now open. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you, and good morning, guys. Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Good morning, Joe. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Good morning. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Look, hard to not like this quarter. It was a very strong quarter. I guess the question I have, to start off, maybe on price/cost, you mentioned that you were going to start to put through some pricing increases. So maybe, Michael, if you can talk about the cadence and when you start to expect to see some of the benefit from those pricing increases, that would be helpful. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Yes. So those price increases, Joe, have largely been done already. So that's based on what's been implemented year-to-date. So there's really nothing major outstanding from a price standpoint. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And so was that kind of across the portfolio? And specifically, I guess I'm thinking about Welding, one of your competitors had talked about positive pricing in an earlier report. And so I was just wondering whether you're able to see some price impact there as well. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Yes, we're seeing positive price increases in all of our segments. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, helpful. And then I guess just maybe some additional color on the thoughts on Auto. I know that you're baking in 3%. If I want to be clear here, I guess is 3% market or is that 3% growth in your numbers for 2017? And... Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Yeah, that's 3% in our business, Joe. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's 3% in your business. Okay. Got it. So there's some \u2013 perhaps some opportunity there. And, I guess, lastly, maybe just a little bit more color on Welding. Clearly, things got \u2013 things are seemingly getting better with the flat growth number this quarter. Maybe talk a little bit more about the trends that you're seeing across the different end markets I caught that industrial was down slightly, but helpful to get additional color there. Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Yeah, I think I'd just go back to what I said earlier that \u2013 and this is, at least in terms of our sort of past history, this is what we're seeing in the first quarter, the normal signs of a recovery in the welding space. The commercial end for us of the equipment space typically leads the turn, if you will, and so the commercial business was up 4% in the quarter, which was a nice improvement in terms of uptick relative to not just percentage growth but on a sequential basis, up noticeably from Q3. So things are setting up for a nice turn in the marketplace. But again, I think after one quarter, we're \u2013 what I would say, not to sound like the pessimist here, but we've been here before a few times, right? With a reasonable start to the year over the last two or three years and then things in terms of the overall economic environment kind of have petered out. So I think that experience has us a little cautious in terms of posture, but I would say that we're certainly seeing some signs, even in those prior periods that we didn't see before, that give us some level of hope or optimism that we're seeing some broader based recovery than maybe we have in the past that hopefully will sustain itself as we continue to move through this year and beyond. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got you. Okay, great. Thanks, guys. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Morgan Stanley, Nigel Coe. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Morning. Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Morning. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Just, obviously, a very strong quarter. 2Q, your range for $1.55 \u2013 $1.65 on 2% to 4% organic. In my model, that implies that you're embedding a much flatter margin than what we've seen recently. Anything to think about there or is it just you just want to be conservative? Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: I think it's primarily, Nigel, the comp to last year, we had a really strong Q2 last year and that's really the main driver here. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, okay. And then, obviously, within that Auto, we saw the 2 points or so from EF&C. Should we then think about 2Q Auto similar to 1Q and a bit of pressure year-over-year, and then as we get to the second half of the year, more of a normalized comp? Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Yeah, I think that's a reasonable assumption. I think the plus 9% organic in Q1, we may not get all the way there in Q2. But certainly, we feel good about the second quarter. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. And then just finally, on Electronics, obviously, there's a pretty volatile pattern quarter-to-quarter there, and you got a strong 6% in 1Q. We are seeing semi CapEx pretty strong this year. Would you expect that kind of performance to continue through the year? Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: When we look at the full year in Test & Measurement, we're looking at growth in the low single-digit range. So part of what you see in Q1 is also a fairly easy comparison on a year-over-year basis. So certainly encouraging what we've seen. I'd point to Instron and the businesses tied to business investment as really the more meaningful data point here in Q1. Semiconductor as you know, is really hard to forecast, but we feel good about where we are right now. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks for taking the call. Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Through Q2 we... (25:24) Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Through Q2, yes, on the semi-con side. Yes. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andy Casey from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks a lot. Good morning, everybody. Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Morning. Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Hey, Andy. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Just a question on kind of the mix. In the past, you've talked about consumer being 60%, industrial being 40%. We're starting to see some of the consumer markets see a relatively slower growth potential going forward. And I'm just wondering, some of the pushback we get on the stock is related to that historical 60-40 comment. Could you help us understand whether this split is kind of migrating closer to 50-50 and could be less of a drag on growth? Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Near term, I think the sort of macro, from my standpoint, is we are \u2013 the industrial side, given the very sluggish business investment environment, has been the slower growing part of the company. That is seeming to improve. Obviously, if that continues, that will adjust that mix a percentage point or two over time. But I don't see it shifting dramatically off of that 60-40 mix. I think the most \u2013 beyond the end market recovery, the other thing I'd point to, as we've talked before, is we've got plenty of room to grow. In all seven of our businesses, we are continuing to make good progress in terms of the work we need to do on that pivot, and so consumer or industrial, all of our seven businesses have plenty of room to run in terms of ability to drive above-market organic growth from here forward. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you, Scott. And then on the Welding, we compare the Welding segment to some of your external competitors, the margin continues to be quite a premium to what those external competitors are generating. But this quarter the organic growth was a little lighter. I'm just wondering, should we look at the mix a little bit closer, your segment versus the competition, or said differently, do you feel that Welding \u2013 and I know it's one quarter, but... Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: You know the answer before you're going to ask it. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : That's why I'm qualifying it. Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Yeah, I appreciate the point. What we have said, I think, on numerous occasions is quarterly comps, particularly given some of the differences in relative product positions between us and the other great companies in this space, I think are really not particularly meaningful. We don't take credit for them when they work in our favor and in cases where they don't, I wouldn't read too much into what I think the overall \u2013 I think it's a fair comparison on an annual basis, certainly not one that's particularly valid in my mind on a quarter-to-quarter basis. And even on an annual basis, there are still big differences in terms of relative product mix across all the different parts of the Welding portfolio. So you'll have to draw your own conclusions on that. But I think quarter-to-quarter, there's just too much stuff that is individually impacting all the various companies in different ways that makes it less relevant, I think, to add it up as a \u2013 in the aggregate sense. And again, I think we're as consistent about saying that when it works in our favor as it does when it \u2013 as we are when it doesn't. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Mig Dobre from Baird. Your line is now open. Mig Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. I guess, maybe looking at 1Q, very good performance. You beat your guidance by $0.10. I'm wondering, as you look internally versus your initial projections, what were some of the more notable variances? And how did these variances at segment level play out in the way you adjusted full year guidance? Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Well, I think we've talked about it, Mig. The big delta was the organic growth rate and the drivers of that delta in terms of organic growth rate were Automotive, Test & Measurement, Welding. And based on \u2013 we've talked before about the fact that we forecast based on current run rates, so our balance of the year forecast does reflect those improvements that we saw in Q1 in those businesses. Auto was a bit of an exception, as Michael talked about earlier. I think we're taking a very conservative approach. We understand that there're some issues out there in North America on the back half of the year that may or may not impact demand for our products. But we're using the data that we have externally and fully baking that in. But beyond that, everything else is run rated through the balance of the year based on the exit rate in the first quarter. Mig Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: All right. So maybe ask this differently, have you changed your margin assumptions for Welding for the full year? Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: No, we have not. Mig Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Then my follow-up is on Food Equipment. Maybe a little more color as to what you're seeing in North America here. Any split that you can point to in terms of your restaurant versus your commercial customers, refrigeration versus cooking, et cetera? Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Yeah, I don't think a lot has changed. What I would say is that we did have some \u2013 a few good sized project pushout into Q2. So, in terms of Q1 growth rate, it was a little light relative to what we thought it was going to be heading into the quarter but not by much. We're still expecting, on a global basis, 3% to 4% organic growth in Food Equipment for the year. And we've talked before, we got a really strong new product pipeline. We are making great progress across the business both in North America, in Europe and in Asia in terms of driving those new products and our other pivot to growth penetration efforts and feel really good about the balance of the year there. So, no big changes in terms of end market demand color. Mig Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from JPMorgan, we have Ann Duignan. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, good morning. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Morning. Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Good morning. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : We've seen the results of the French elections overnight, and I'm just curious if any of your businesses in Europe and/or in particular in France, so was there any hesitation in spending by customers into the election and whether you feel there might be any pent-up demand that are going into Q2 or the back half of the year just a kind of a relief rally, if you like? Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: We're still trying to figure out who they voted for. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. They voted for the right one (32:48) so far. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Yeah. Ann, so how I would maybe put this in context, our sales in France represent about 5% of our overall sales. And we were actually up 3% in the first quarter, really driven by Construction and Automotive primarily. And so I think it's a little too early to tell whether anything has changed at this point. We still feel good about the outlook for Europe. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And you didn't feel \u2013 I guess, my point was more Europe broadly, you didn't feel there was any hesitation in spending in other countries? Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: No, we didn't see anything like that. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And I just wanted to follow up on your outlook for Automotive. I mean, you noted a few times that your forecast is based on IHS, but you seemed a little skeptical of their outlook. What are you hearing from your customers? I mean, are you \u2013 do you feel that IHS may be a little bit low? Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: No, I wouldn't say that. Our visibility is about a quarter ahead, so for now, what we see is second quarter is set up pretty well. Beyond that, we're just reacting to an IHS forecast that says that there's \u2013 I think the number's negative 10 for the Big 3 in the back half of the year. And that's some production \u2013 that's some extended shutdowns due to some model changeovers and things \u2013 all those things may be very valid. So we are trying to incorporate the best data that we have. I don't mean to sound skeptical at all. If I did, that's my mistake. But I think what we're trying to convey is that we've got that all baked in, in terms of our balance of the year organic growth forecast, and still expect the overall company to be better than we did heading into the year. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. I appreciate the color on that. I'll leave it there. Thanks. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Steve Volkmann from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC : Hi, good morning, guys. I just wanted to come back to Welding one more time, I apologize in advance. But I'm curious if you would mind sharing \u2013 you mentioned commercial up stronger, what's sort of the mix in commercial and industrial in that business? And would there be a margin mix issue where, I assume, maybe the commercial might have a little bit higher margins or maybe not? Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: I think the mix is roughly 50-50. It's close to that. And from a margin standpoint, I think they're also pretty comparable. So no, shouldn't have any material mix impact on margin. Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC : Great. That's helpful. And then maybe on Test & Measurement and Electronics, in the past, you've had an occasional quite large customer who would occasionally come up with big new product launches that would be reflected in your sales of equipment of that kind. Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Who shall remain nameless? Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Yes. Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC : Who shall remain nameless. See, I'm doing a good job here. Should we be thinking about that in the second half of the year? Is that still an issue? Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: No, not an issue certainly in the Q1 performance and not one we expect to be an issue through the balance of the year. Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC : Okay. All right. Great. Thank you. Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Good or bad. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joel Tiss from BMO. And your line is now open. Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey, guys. A lot's been answered, I just wanted to just squeeze one more in. Can you give us a little sense in the Food business? What's the opportunity that you guys see? What areas are really growing, and maybe are there niches that you're not really participating in? Just, you've been kind of growing a little bit slower than some of the other areas, it seems, for a couple of years. Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Well, I think how I would answer that is we're pretty focused on dishwashing, refrigeration, cooking and scales in the retail sector. We have really strong positions \u2013 relative share position in service \u2013 don't let me leave out service, is the other big opportunity. I'm not going to give you our assessment of our global share, but let's just say, we got plenty of room to grow in those areas. So from the standpoint of, is the growth going \u2013 as our focus in terms of go forward growth around getting it to new areas, that's not a big focus for us. Our focus is on really leveraging the full potential of the really strong positions that we already have. Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States): So just more of a service focus and just kind of a little bit of increased penetration? Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Service, warewash, refrigeration, cooking. Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. All right. Thank you. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher from UBS. Your line is now open. Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks, good morning. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Morning. Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Morning. Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC : Just wanted to come back to the margin question that was asked earlier. I would have thought that the organic beat and raise would have driven a margin guidance raise, but you did keep the margin guidance. So just wondering if there was some caution there or if there's some upside that's likely to unfold later in the year? Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: I think the only thing I'd point to is on the price/cost side, we are a little cautious given what we saw in Q1, and so that's why we didn't take the margin guidance up. Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: But Michael did add a bold (38:44) point to the plus. Maybe you didn't catch that in there. Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah. Yeah, no, I noticed. Okay. Great. And then, just \u2013 I know you mentioned you have about a quarter of visibility on some of your businesses or maybe across the business in general. When do you expect to generate that other dime of earnings? Is it balanced across the rest of the year or does the one quarter visibility weight that to Q2 leaving you some further upside potential later in the year? Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: I'd say it's pretty balanced. Actually, if you look at our Q1 EPS and you add the midpoint of our guidance for Q2, we're exactly at 50% of the year from a full year EPS standpoint. So that's \u2013 historically, that's what we've been doing for a long time. So it's pretty even. Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Ms. Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi, good morning. Nice quarter. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Morning. Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Good morning. Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: I guess, two questions. One, was there anything unusual about the cadence of sales throughout the first quarter? Did it follow the typical seasonal trend and sort of what you're seeing into April? And then my second question within Construction, Europe saw some pretty nice growth, and I know that's a business that you guys have been restructuring. So was that \u2013 did you grow in line with the market, above market? I'm just wondering whether we're starting to see the benefits from your organic growth initiatives. Thanks. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: I can share that the (40:17) monthly, the cadence, this was a pretty typical quarter. There was really nothing unusual there. Construction Europe, we certainly benefited from some end market lift, being up 8% in Europe. I think there's still some work to do, as you know, from a simplification standpoint. But overall, encouraged by the progress in our Construction business in Europe. Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: And sorry, any commentary on April, if that's falling in line with seasonal trend or...? Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: We're right on track with the guidance we're giving you today. Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Thanks. I'll get back in queue. Operator : Thank you. And next question, we have, Joe O'Dea from Vertical Research. Your line is now open. Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Hi, good morning. Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Morning. Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Just on the Auto outgrowth considerations into the back half of the year, if you think about mix effect with declines potentially in North America, and you think about some of the Europe outgrowth you've been posting recently, and I think that picked up in the back half of the year, but just how we should be thinking about that. If North America's down, of course that means (41:23) a little bit of a mix benefit to outgrowth, but I don't know if Europe gets harder on tougher comps. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Yeah, I think what I would say is we expect overall, globally, to outgrow the market 200 to 400 basis points, consistent with what we have said in the past. Exactly how that plays out in the back half, we'll have to see. Clearly, in Europe, we're running above that rate; and China, significantly above that average penetration rate. And then we're a little bit lower in North America, because of the starting point. Our content per vehicle in North America is still significantly above where we are outside the U.S. Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. Thanks. And then on the price/cost front, just a clarification, I think that you said, you had announced and implemented pricing, and that's what's reflected in the current guide in your outlook. So just to confirm, based on where commodity prices currently are, that doesn't require any additional actions moving forward this year to hit your price/cost targets. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: That is correct. Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. Thanks a lot. Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And speakers, at this time, we don't have any questions on queue. Back to you. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Okay. Great. Well, thank you very much for joining us today, and have a great day. Operator : And that concludes today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",

All participants will be on a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s conference. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. And now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Michael Larsen, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Sir, you may begin. Michael Larsen : Okay, thank you Bob. Good morning and welcome to ITW's second quarter 2017 conference call. I am Michael Larsen, ITW's Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining me this morning is our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi. During today's call, we will discuss our second quarter financial results and update you on our 2017 earnings forecast. Before we get to the results, let me remind you that this presentation contains our financial forecasts for the third quarter and full-year 2017 as well as other forward-looking statements identified on this slide. We refer you to the Company's 2016 Form 10-K for more detail, but important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Also, this presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures. And while we use very few non-GAAP measures, a reconciliation of those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release. With that I'll turn the call over to Scott. Scott Santi : Thanks Michael and good morning. Overall, ITW continued to execute well in the second quarter as we delivered strong results and established several new all-time performance records for the company. Earnings per share of $1.69 was up 16% year-on-year, 14% if you exclude the $0.03 of share benefit from a legal settlement that we recognized in the quarter. Operating income of $874 million was up 10% year-on-year, was the highest quarterly operating income in the company's history. Q2 operating margin of 24.3% was also an all-time record for the company and was up 120 basis points, with enterprise initiatives contributing 100 basis points of improvement.  After-tax return on invested capital improved 190 basis points to 24.8%. We are continuing to make good progress our pivotal organic growth. Year-to-date, our organic growth rate is up 3%, is up almost 2 full percentage points versus last year reflecting both improving demand in our industrial facing businesses, particularly Welding and Test & Measurement, and Electronics and continued progress on organic growth framework initiatives across all seven of our segments. Based on our Q2 and a relatively stable near-term end market demand environment, we're increasing our full-year EPS guidance by $0.12 at the midpoint. Overall, we continue to make good progress on our path to ITW\u2019s full potential and the company is well positioned to deliver continued strong performance in the second half and beyond. With that I'll turn the call over to Michael who will provide you with more detail regarding our Q2 results and updated 2017 forecast. Michael? Michael Larsen : Thank you, Scott. So starting with Slide 3, GAAP EPS increased 16% to $1.69. Total revenue was $3.6 billion, an increase of 4.9%, with organic growth of 2.6%. Organic growth was positive in all major geographies with North America up 1.4% and international up 4.2%, driven primarily by Europe, which was up 3.4% and China which was up 13.3%. Six of our seven segments had positive organic growth. It was great to see welding turn positive, up 3% for the first time since 2014.  Sequentially, from Q1 to Q2, organic revenues accelerated 2.8%. Ahead of our historical run rate as welding, test and measurement electronics, and specialty products all exceeded their Q1 run rate. We increased operating margin 120 basis points over last year, which was driven primarily by continued progress on our enterprise strategy initiatives and volume leverage. Enterprise initiatives contributed 100 basis points of margin expansion. And five of seven segments increased operating margin. Operating income grew 10% to 874 million, making this quarter the most profitable quarter in the company's history. As Scott mentioned, we recorded an EPS benefit of $0.03 per share related to confidential legal settlement. Excluding this item, second quarter earnings were a $1.66 per share, an increase of 14% versus the prior year. Our effective tax rate was 28.4% in the second quarter, in line with our expectations. Free cash flow of 502 million adjusted for a discretionary pension contribution of $115 million was 85% of net income, which is in line with typical seasonality. In the quarter, we made the decision to accelerate future pension contributions, with surplus cash, essentially fully funding our US plan and setting the stage for lower pension contributions in the future. On Slide 4, you can see that we achieved an all-time record for operating margin in the quarter. Once again enterprise initiatives contributed 100 basis points of structural margin improvement. In addition, volume leverage contributed 50 basis points. As expected, price cost was unfavorable due primarily to higher steel costs in two segments; automotive OEM and construction. At current raw material costs and with our 2017 price adjustments, we expect that price cost for the full year will be positive in dollar terms, but slightly unfavorable 20 to 40 basis points to margin percentage.  The legal settlement that I mentioned a minute ago contributed 40 basis points and EF&C diluted margins by 60 basis points as expected. We added a line to the margin work to point out the timing impact of lower restructuring spend in Q2 that will catch up in the second half and overhead management efficiencies that we\u2019ve planned for the second half that we were able to accelerate into Q2. Combined these two items contributed the balance 40 basis points. In total, margin improved 120 basis points in the quarter On Slide 5, you can see our strong first half 2017 performance at the enterprise level, with 18% earnings growth and 3% organic growth. We improved our operating margin by 120 basis points to 23.8% and grew operating income by 11% to 1.7 billion. Free cash flow was 946 million adjusted for pension. Overall, strong performance in the first half of 2017 and positive momentum going into the second half.  Turning to Slide 6, on the left side of the page you can see what Scott mentioned a minute ago. The solid first half progress on organic growth versus last year as reflected by our first half organic growth rate of 3% as compared to 1.2% in 2016. You can see the results by segment with meaningful improvement in end market conditions in our Welding and Test & Measurement, Electronics segments, continued strong above market organic growth from our Automotive OEM segment and continued progress on our pivotal growth efforts across all seven of our segments. We also laid out the progress on margins with six of seven segments expanding margins on a year-over-year basis. Excluding the 270 basis points of dilution from the EF&C acquisition, automotive OEM margins would be up 190 basis points to 26% and all seven segments which show margin improvement. I\u2019ll now discuss the segment results in a little more detail starting with automotive OEM, which delivered another strong quarter with organic revenue growth of 4%, more than 400 basis points above global car builds.  In North America, the business was flat as auto builds declined 3% overall, with builds down 6% for the Detroit 3 where we have relatively higher content. Outside North America, growth continued to be very strong, with Europe up 7% with builds down 3% and China was up 17%, all significantly above market as we continue to increase our content per vehicle, particularly with domestic OEMs. As we have discussed since December last year, IHS is forecasting a decline in domestic auto builds in the second half of 6% in Q3 and moderating to 2% in Q4. Our full-year guidance incorporates this IHS forecast as it currently stands, which results in full-year organic growth from automotive OEM business of approximately 3%. Operating margin was 22.3%, lower than last year due to EF&C.  Turning to Slide 7, Food Equipment was up 1% organically. North America was down 1% against a challenging comparison versus the prior. North America equipment was down 2% and service was up 1%. Internationally, equipment was up 3% and service was also up 1%. Operating margin improved 140 basis points to 26.4% due to enterprise initiatives. We had another solid quarter in test and measurement and electronics with organic growth of 4%. Test & Measurement grew organic revenue by 6% with continued solid demand in semiconductor related end markets. In our Instron business, where demand is tied more closely to business investment, organic growth was up 4%, which is a good sign for the second half. Electronics was up 3%. Operating margin improved 330 basis points to 21.9%, driven by enterprise initiatives and volume leverage. As a reminder the 21.9% includes 320 basis points of non-cash expense associated with amortizing acquisition related intangible assets.  Turning to Slide 8, demand in welding continues to improve as organic growth was up 3% in Q2. Excluding normal seasonality, demand improved 1.5% sequentially from Q1 to Q2 and year-over-year equipment was up 7% and consumables were down slightly 2%. By geography, North America which is approximately 80% of our business, up 5%, driven by solid growth in both our industrial and commercial equipment businesses. Our commercial equipment business which sells through distribution to construction, light fabrication, farm and ranch customers was up 5% year on year in Q2. And it was very encouraging to see that our industrial equipment business which sells primarily into manufacturing including automotive and heavy equipment was also up 5% in the quarter. Operating margin performance was very strong at 27.2%, driven by enterprise initiatives and lower restructuring. Polymers & fluids revenue declined 1% organically, with automotive aftermarket down 2%, fluids which primarily sells highly engineered lubricants and cleaners into industrial and commercial end markets was up 1%. And Polymers which primarily sells engineered adhesives and sealants for industrial MRO and OEM applications was down 1%.  Operating margin improved 50 basis points to 21.4%, which includes 400 basis points of non-cash expense associated with amortizing acquisition-related intangible assets. In Slide 9, construction products organic revenue was up 2%, demand in North America was solid with organic growth of 3%, both commercial and residential were up 3%. Europe was flat and Asia Pacific was up 1%. Operating margin was 24% down slightly due to headwind on price cost driven by the price of steel. Finally, in specialty products, organic revenue was up 4% with continued strong above market organic growth of 5% in our consumer packaging businesses. Operating margin was the highest in the company at 28.3%, an increase of 230 basis points due to volume leverage and enterprise initiatives. Turning to Slide 10 and our updated guidance for 2017. As a result of our strong Q2 results and based on current foreign exchange rates, we\u2019re raising our full-year earnings guidance by $0.12 to a new EPS range of $6.32 to $6.52. And the increase reflects the $0.09 beat [ph] from Q2 and $0.03 from favorable foreign exchange rates. Also, at current levels of demand, we expect organic growth of 2% to 4% for the year. And we're raising our margin expectation to approximately 24%. For the third quarter, EPS guidance is a $1.57 to $1.67 with organic growth of 1% to 3%, which includes the impact I discussed previously of the decline in domestic auto builds. Finally, our third quarter and revised full-year EPS guidance does not include any EPS benefit from the previously disclosed legal settlement beyond the $0.03 per share recorded in the second quarter. With that Bob, we will now open the call to your questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question is from John Inch of Deutsche Bank. Sir, your line is open. John Inch : Can we start off this line item unallocated in the op margins? I'm trying to remember what is that because it's run rate kind of in the mid 20s down to sort of - it was sort of a source of significant income, why was it almost zero this quarter? Is there any explanation? Michael Larsen : Yes. So that is the impact of the illegal settlement, which was booked in that line item essentially. So what we do is we allocate our corporate cost to the segments on a percentage of revenue basis and because our corporate costs went down as a result of the legal settlement, we allocated less to the segments this quarter. So that's what you're seeing in that line, John. John Inch : So was it about 20 [indiscernible] Michael, kind of the run rate that has been? There's nothing else in there, right? Michael Larsen : No, there's nothing else of significance in there, yes. John Inch : Food equipment was a little weak and it seemed like - if I go back to my notes, I thought some projects, I realized it was a tough compare, but I thought projects were being - have been deferred from the first quarter into the second quarter. Did those not hit or was there anything else kind of going on in the segment? Scott Santi : Those did John, that was on the international side and you international up a solid 3% in line with expectations. I think what you saw a little bit in Q2 here was a slowdown on the restaurant side of the business, which is only about 20% of our business, but it was down in the 7% range. Our business as you know is primarily focused on the institutional side and institutional was actually up in that 2% to 3% range in the quarter. And for us, the QSR side was also positive and the retail side. So overall, the slight slowdown that you're seeing here is as a result of the restaurant side. And as we look into the second half here based on the current run rates and backlog in that business, we\u2019ll be back in that 2% to 3% range organic growth in the second half for the business. John Inch : And then lastly Michael, your auto guidance, you\u2019re still sticking to the 3, so that implies your core growth \u2013 ITW\u2019s core growth is going to go negative in the second half? How would you parse that out sort of between third and fourth quarter? Michael Larsen : So the decline in automotive OEM, if you look at in the second half is going to be in Q3. So that's when you see the bulk of the decline in North America auto builds down 6% and actually down more than that with the D3s where we have relatively higher content. And then the decline in builds moderates in Q4. And so, if you translate that that's part of what's driving the Q3 versus Q4 organic growth rate for the company. So we\u2019ll be you know we are guiding to 1% to 3% for Q3 and that implies a better organic growth rate than that in the fourth quarter, really primarily driven by the auto builds. John Inch : Right, which helps to explain why your fourth quarter EPS doesn't decline sequentially as much as it does or as it has historically, is that a fair statement? Michael Larsen : That is a fair statement. Operator : Our next question is from Andrew Kaplowitz. Andy, your line is open. Andrew Kaplowitz : So Michael, this one might be for you. Maybe talking about price versus cost in general, I know you mentioned that you would have 20 to 40 basis points of headwind this year; I think you had talked about 10 to 30 last quarter. It doesn't look like that big a deal on the total impact of ITW, but it lead to a decline as you mentioned in construction products. So as you go forward here, can you pass through more price in that segment to offset rising costs or should we set out flat margin profile for that segment going forward for a while because of price versus cost? Michael Larsen : Andy, let me just put it in context, I mean, we just reported record operating margins at 24.3%. So price cost was a little bit more of a headwind really as a result of the primarily the price of steel. We have passed on - we\u2019ve made the price adjustments essentially we need to make for 2017 and we're set up for the pressure on price cost to moderate here in the second half of the year and margins would continue to improve from here on the construction side. Andrew Kaplowitz : And Scott, shifting over to welding, obviously it's continuing to improve. I know in the past we talked about, you know, welding used to be a high-single digit growth business and assuming that this is a relatively traditional recovery, is it fair to say that welding growth could get back here into at least the mid-single digits has it\u2019s been in the past. And do you have any visibility that tells you that we're still on the sort of upward glide. I know you mentioned the better industrial results. So, is that the way to look at it going forward? Scott Santi : I absolutely believe that the underlying potential is every bit as positive in welding as it has been historically on a go forward basis. We are, you know, Michael talked about it, I think the encouraging thing in Q2 is that we saw the industrial side of that business turn positive in a pretty significant way in Q2. I think it's, you know, we hate to call one quarter trend. So I think we're in the wait and see mode here a little bit, but overall I would say that we are at least hopeful that what we saw in the second quarter will continue and if it does, then we would expect welding to be back at some point here to its traditional place in our portfolio as one of the strongest organic growers in the company. Operator : Next question is from David Raso of Evercore ISI. David, your lines open. David Raso : I was curious about the guidance, the organic sales growth guidance. If 3Q does come in at your guidance of positive 2%, to reach the full-year guide it implies the fourth quarter again. It clearly has to reaccelerate close to 4%. Can you explain why do you expect that much of an acceleration in the fourth quarter? Michael Larsen : I think we\u2019ve just talked about this a couple minutes ago. I mean the key driver here is really if you look at the IHS forecast for the second half, the decline in domestic builds is greater in Q3 than Q4. So that delta is really what's driving the bulk of what you're describing, which is a 1% to 3% organic growth rate expected for Q3 and then implied a higher growth rate than that for Q4. So it's primarily driven by the forecast for auto builds in North America. David Raso : So for the fourth quarter, are there any other businesses that we should be thoughtful about that you expect an acceleration or is it really that significantly sensitive to the auto swing in 3Q and 4Q year-over-year. Michael Larsen : All of the other businesses, David, as we usually do is a model based on current run rate adjusted for typical seasonality. Scott Santi : [indiscernible] industrial. Michael Larsen : Right, I mean, that\u2019s the other thing. I mean, we are seeing what we just talked about, you know, the industrial businesses; welding, test & measurement, electronics, there is some positive momentum in those businesses. But it is primarily driven\u2026 David Raso : Run rated out from here. Michael Larsen : Yeah. I mean what we usually do is we take current Q2 run rate and order rate and we run rate amount adjust for seasonality, but there is no assumption of a significant acceleration beyond that built into Q4. David Raso : But that math is what it is, just taken some of those CapEx businesses, run rates run them out. They do give you a little better organic growth in 4Q then 3Q or recently right, that's the idea of\u2026 Michael Larsen : Yeah. David Raso : Solely auto, but auto is the main issue. Second question, last question, the gross margin is down year over year; they haven't been down year over year for six years. I wish all my companies could have 42% gross margins, but still to see it down 70 bps year-over-year, was that what you were expecting and is that how we should think of the rest of the year if you can explain that in more detail? Michael Larsen : Yeah I think price cost was a little more unfavorable than maybe we expected. We've talked about this lag in the past between when you start realizing price increases and when the material costs show up in the income statement. And I think what the timing was off maybe a little bit versus what we expected, but as I also said on price cost, we would expect that to start to moderate that pressure here as we go into the second half. We've made the price adjustments we need to make based on current material cost and if anything some of the pressure we've seen on steel may be easing here in the second half. So we feel fairly confident that we have this one baked in our guidance for the rest of the year. David Raso : So for the full year, if you think about the growth, the operating margin is up 150 bps. Do you expect any improvement year-over-year in the gross margin or is it more of an SG&A story for this year? Michael Larsen : It\u2019s both; you will see both, David. David Raso : So you expect gross margins to be still higher year-over-year, okay. Thank you very much, I appreciate it. Operator : Our next question is from Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Nigel, your line is open. * 24-48 Nigel, your line is open. Nigel Coe : Couple of quick follow-ups. Just as kind of, just to put final points on the second half auto, it looks from your comments Mike that your [indiscernible] in 3Q and then flat in 4Q. Is that a fair run rate? Michael Larsen : Yeah. So we -- I\u2019d rather not Nigel -- if I start giving guidance by segment here based on external forecasts, it gets a little tricky, so I'd rather not go down that path, but I think if you model this, you can yourself, based on the data we have provided you, can get pretty close. Nigel Coe : And then just thinking about welding, obviously welding is coming off the trough, so the recovery is going to be somewhat lumpy, but if you think about the sequentials from what we saw in the first half to the second half, we normally see seasonality down slightly from the first half, but obviously coming off the trough, it could be a little bit better than that. So how do you view the second half versus first half in welding? Michael Larsen : Yeah. I mean that is correct. I mean, we've modeled the second half based on current run rates, which is the commercial side, up 5; the industrial side, which was the new news, up 5, that business was down 2 in prior quarter; and then oil and gas is still flattish, down actually 1% here in Q2. So we haven't seen a pickup on that side yet. Nigel Coe : Okay. And just a quick follow-on on the margin bridge, you actually called out overhead efficiency and restructuring of 40 bps, but what exactly is overhead efficiency and how does that differ from the enterprise initiatives? Michael Larsen : This is more discretionary cost management, so it's your day-to-day blocking and tackling on the cost side. Operator : Next question is from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Joe, your line is open. Joe Ritchie : So I guess my first question is on, maybe if you can give a little bit more color on EF&C and the progress that you're making there on the margin side and I guess the reason I'm asking the question is because it seemed to have a little bit more of a negative impact in 2Q to 1Q. So any color around that would be helpful. Michael Larsen : Yeah. I think we're really pleased with the progress and maybe I\u2019ll let Scott talk to the operational side, but on the financial side, we are ahead of what we had modeled when we made the acquisition by a pretty wide margin at this point. As you may recall, they came in at EBIT margins in that 7% range. A year later, we are already at 11. So I think we\u2019re really pleased with what we're seeing financially and then maybe operationally. Scott -- Scott Santi : I would just reiterate what we've talked about in the past, which is it\u2019s a terrific fit with our business I think from a leadership, the quality of the leadership team that we've inherited, we are very pleased. It is all going very well. It does take some time to do what we usually do. So this is a four to five year integration process. And as Michael said, we are ahead of the game, but we are, at this point, four quarters in on a four or five year run. So -- but so far it's been everything we hoped that would be. Joe Ritchie : Got it. That's good to hear. And I guess as my follow-on question, maybe going back to a little bit of discussion here so far an organic growth, so clearly understand the auto build down in the second half of the year and then you guys take a run rate on the rest of your businesses. But to the extent you can provide any color on how business trends went throughout the quarter on the remaining businesses, that would be helpful. Michael Larsen : Yes, actually we \u2013 typically, we don't see much anything unusual. We actually did see quite an improvement in the month of June. So we feel really good about the momentum going into the third quarter here. Joe Ritchie : Was it anywhere specifically Michael? Michael Larsen : It was actually broad based and the international side continues to be strong. And then in North America, in the month of June, now, it's one month, so I wouldn't read too much into it, but really broad based, a meaningful organic growth rate in the mid-single digits, maybe a little higher than that. Operator : Our next question is from Ann Duignan of JPMorgan. Ann, your line is open. Ann Duignan : If we could just focus on foodservice again, just given all the headwinds that are facing the restaurants in this environment, are you seeing any increase in competition for your institutional business, I mean, you've always had a strength in that segment, but I'm just curious if restaurant is under pressure, are the competitors refocusing their efforts on institutional, if you could just give us some color there would be great. Michael Larsen : Ann, this is Michael. We haven't seen any change in the competitive dynamics on the institutional side. As you pointed out, we have a really strong position there that's been our focus for a long time and we were pleased to see the business up in a year-over-year basis, again in Q2 and feel very good about our competitive position. Ann Duignan : Okay. And then as my follow up, could you just talk about share repurchase and what your ending share count was on a diluted basis at the end of quarter? Thanks. Michael Larsen : Yeah. I think we ended up at 347 and so we are executing the program we laid out back in December, which is $1 billion for the year. $250 million per quarter is the plan and that is the plan for the back half here in Q3 and Q4. I will point out that we have a board meeting coming up where we will, as we typically do, discuss capital allocation and surplus capital deployment specifically and after that meeting, here in a couple of weeks, we\u2019ll provide an update, not just into the dividend, but also any potential further share repurchases for the year. Ann Duignan : Okay. And any update on acquisition pipeline. Michael Larsen : Not much of an update here, Ann. We\u2019re not necessarily a great proxy for what's going on in the broader M&A market. I mean, we're really focused on executing this enterprise strategy and deliver the types of results that you've seen from us over the last four years. So that's our primary focus right now. Operator : Our next question is from Andy Casey of Wells Fargo Securities. Andy, your line is open. Andy Casey : A lot obviously has been covered already, a couple of detailed points on total revenue, you raised it a little bit. It looks like it's based primarily on currency. What sort of translation rates are you building in there specifically for the euro? Michael Larsen : Yes. So currency was still a headwind in Q2 and what we, as we always do, Andy, we're modeling based on current rates. So I think if you look today, it\u2019s about 1.17 for the euro. Last year, I think we were 1.12 average. That dealt, the $0.05 just as a rule of thumb drives $0.05 of EPS for the full year. And so in the second half, that\u2019s the $0.03 of EPS favorability versus guidance. But it's nice to see that if rates stay where they are, we're not going to be talking about headwind on currency, which it's been a while since we're able to say that. Andy Casey : Sure. That it good news. Second one, when you look across your businesses and including the comment you made to an earlier question about June seeing disproportionate strength relative to the rest of the quarter, did that drive any incremental backlog growth at the end of the quarter that you will realize in the second half. Michael Larsen : Andy, most of our business is really booking and ship -- I mean we get the order today, we ship tomorrow and replenish the inventory the day after. So we tend to be fairly short cycle and so we've not seen a significant change in backlog. And as I say, we\u2019re not really a backlog driven company. Operator : Our next question is from Steven Fisher of UBS. Sir, your line is open. Steven Fisher : You guys have a few businesses that have margins that are notably below the rest of the company at this point and looking at test and measurement, autos, polymers and fluid, I know you have had obviously in test and measurement, a pretty good year-over-year improvement, which is impressive, but how focused are you on bringing those segments up to the company average or margin improvement results come more so from the other businesses. Michael Larsen : The ones that stick out and if you go to the, there's a schedule in the 8-K, attached to the press release that actually lays out the impact that I talked about on the call, I talk about every call of the amortization of the intangibles related to acquisitions and due to the more recent acquisitions in test and measurement, electronics and in polymers and fluids, that\u2019s where you see the bulk of the impact. So you really, on an apples-to-apples basis, need to add back this quarter 320 basis points in test and measurement, 400 basis points in polymers and fluids and really 150 basis points, if you look at it at the enterprise level and just as an aside, if you and we've done this for you on that same schedule, if you translate that into an EPS impact, it's about $0.10 a quarter. So $0.40 of non-cash expense, $0.40 of EPS on an annual basis. We are focused on improving margins in all of our businesses and I think what's really encouraging is you're seeing our businesses there are clustered in a tight range in the mid-20s operating margin and I think that really is a result of our businesses leveraging this really unique business model with a very high level of efficiency. And so what we have today in our view is a really highly diversified high quality portfolio with no weak links anywhere. These are all, if you compare our operating margins here to peers, on average, they are 500 basis points better than -- higher than their peers and in some cases, significantly more than that. So I hope that answers your question. Steven Fisher : And then why are the consumables or welding, why is that declining, is that just lagging the equipment declines we saw over the last couple of years and if so, if the equipment is turned around, how quickly could the consumables turn around and what the underlying would drive it to become positive that\u2019s not already driving it with the equipment sales. Michael Larsen : Yeah. It\u2019s a good question. I mean, first of all, it's a fairly small part of our business, 20% of our revenues. We\u2019re focused, as you know, primarily on the -- of our businesses on the equipment side. Consumables were down slightly in the current quarter and it's really tied back to the international side, which is primarily oil and gas. And so as the oil and gas cycle starts to make its way into the welding consumable side, we should see an improvement on the consumable side as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mig Dobre of Baird. Mig, your line is open. Mig Dobre : Can we talk a little bit about any changes, if there are any, in your view vis-\u00e0-vis longer term capital deployment, how you're thinking about M&A, any areas where you'd like to add to the portfolio, any updated thoughts here would be helpful. Michael Larsen : Yeah. Mig, I mean, at this point, nothing has really changed. I think we've been very consistent in terms of our ability to generate strong cash flow, maintain a strong balance sheet and allocate our capital or our shareholders capital with very high level of discipline and so our number one priority is invest in our businesses and to drive organic growth and productivity. That's our number one priority. That only consumes, in our very asset light business model, about 25% of our operating cash flows.  The second priority is the dividend. And so as you\u2019ve seen, we've been leaning into the dividend with a meaningful increase last year, I just talked about we have a meeting coming up in August here. We allocate about 25% to 30% of our operating cash flow to a dividend that has been growing slightly faster than earnings certainly last year. And then that leaves a fairly sizable portion for external investments, some combination of acquisitions and we\u2019ve talked about the criteria that we're looking for there from a strategic and from an 80-20 improvement standpoint. We also talked about that not being really the primary focus for us right now and then any remaining surplus capital, we've returned to shareholders through the share repurchase program and so $1 billion this year that we're executing is really our estimate of surplus cash available in North America. So that's a rebound line of our capital allocation strategy and Mig, just given the performance of the company and our strong position here, we haven't changed anything. Mig Dobre : I guess what I'm trying to figure out is, if there's any way that we can understand as to whether or not you\u2019re, call it, more active now when evaluating potential acquisitions than you were say six or twelve months ago. Michael Larsen : No, not really, Mig. We're really focused on executing the current enterprise strategy and continue to make progress on our pivot to organic growth. I think we\u2019re really encouraged by 3% organic growth in the first half, almost two full percentage points better than all of last year and last year was another significant improvement over the year before that. And so that\u2019s the type of momentum that we're trying to generate here really with a laser focus on getting the organic growth rate going. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Nathan Jones of Stifel. Sir, your line is open. Nathan Jones : Starting off here in test and measurement and electronics, obviously, very good margin performance there. It looks like record quarterly margins. Was there anything in terms of mix that influenced that or are we just looking at the enterprise strategy taking hold there and some leverage on volume and how should we think about those margins going forward. Michael Larsen : Yeah. I mean that's -- you got it. It's exactly what you described, it\u2019s over 300 basis points of enterprise initiative impact and volume leverage. So back to -- you see what happens in these segments, you get a little bit of organic growth to volume leverage and the earnings growth we're able to drive with that is really significant, which is back to again why we're so focused on getting the organic growth rate going. So we would expect the test and measurement business to continue to improve from here. Nathan Jones : Okay. And then just a question more broadly on the industrial operating businesses. I would assume over the last two or three years that you've probably seen some demand related pricing pressure in those businesses. You're now talking about those businesses improving. How are thinking about your ability to potentially raise real pricing more than just to cover raw materials as we go forward and see industrial, the industrial economy recovering. Scott Santi : Yeah. I mean Nathan, I appreciate the question. That's not really how we think about it. I mean, we price for value, as we continue to innovate and deliver value to customers, that's how we get price. We\u2019re not, in terms of the price cost equation, we are just trying to cover our increases on the raw materials side. The margin performance by ITW continues to be driven by the enterprise initiatives primarily and then the volume leverage that you're seeing. So those are the key drivers of margin expansion at ITW, not the price cost equation. Operator : Our next question is from Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Ma\u2019am, your line is open. Jamie Cook : Two questions. One on polymers and fluids, I know, the business declined organically in a quarter and I guess the comps were a little tougher, but can you talk about the main drivers, how much of that was auto and what your exposure is there? And then my second question, just broadly on China, you continue to see pretty good growth there. I know a lot of its driven by the auto business, but just sustainability of China growth in the second half of the year across your different segments. Thanks. Michael Larsen : Yeah. So polymers and fluids, as you point out, is really more of a comp issue in the automotive aftermarket business. We launched, the business launched a new product last year and typically, when we do that, you see a ramp up in the quarter that didn't repeat this year. So the only other thing I can point to is really on the polymers side is in selling into the wind industry, there's a little bit of a decline in that part of the business, but overall, stable. And I would just point out that even though as you saw revenues were down slightly, margins continued to improve in that business, which is certainly encouraging. In terms of China, the growth continues to be really strong and it's not just the automotive business, it's really across the board. Excluding automotive, China was up 11% this quarter. And on a year-to-date basis, up 16% and it's really broad based. So we feel really good about our position in China and we feel good about our ability to continue to perform at a high level in the second half. Operator : Our next question is from Walter Liptak of Seaport Global. Sir, your line is open. Walter Liptak : Wanted to ask about just kind of the overall margin profile for the company. It\u2019s a great performance this quarter. I think in the past, you talked about getting to 25% overall and I think that was a 2018 number. And I just wondered if volume, the organic growth continues to come back, are we thinking about the wrong way, if we're thinking mid-20s is where the operating margin improvement ends, could you get to 28%, 30% with operating leverage coming through? Michael Larsen : It's a good question, Walt. I mean how I would think about it is for the year, we expect to be at 24%. We have a clear line of sight to another 100 basis points of margin expansion from enterprise initiatives, obviously for the second half of \u201917 and also for \u201918. So those -- that alone takes us to that 25% range. And then, you have to model what you think the organic growth rate is going to be for the company. And historically, our incremental margins on organic growth have been in that 30% to 35% range, maybe at the higher end of that range recently. And so theoretically, that's where we would be -- where we would be maxing out. So I certainly wouldn't think of the 25% as a cap in any way say perform. We really believe that there's more room to grow here from a margin perspective. As again, we really continue to make good progress on organic growth with strong incremental margins. Walter Liptak : And then if I can ask you a follow-up on the food equipment question that was answered, I think earlier this year, you talked about mid-single digit growth for that segment and I wonder if that's what we're still looking for, because you're a little lower in the first half. Is there enough line of sight on business in the second half to be mid-single digit for the full year? Michael Larsen : I think we probably -- this year, I think long term, certainly we have a lot of conviction around being able to grow the food equipment business in the mid-single digits, which would be 200 to 300 basis points above market. Right now, a little bit of a slowdown on the market side. We talked about that. And for this year, we\u2019ll probably be slightly below mid-single digits in terms of organic growth in the food equipment business. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Barry Haimes of Sage Asset Management. Sir, your line is open. Barry Haimes : I wanted to just follow-up on one comment you made earlier that you thought steel pressure might ease some in the second half and it's widely expected the section 232 decision is going to be out fairly shortly, which arguably could have upward pressure. So I'm just curious what you're seeing in the marketplace that makes you think that steel could come off in the second half? Appreciate that. Thanks. Michael Larsen : Yeah. I mean I think we are seeing a slight moderation on steel prices right now. The tariff really, I mean that\u2019s anyone's guess. If that were to happen, then we will react accordingly. Operator : Thank you, speakers. We show no further questions in queue. Michael Larsen : All right. Thank you, Bob. Thanks for dialing in and have a great day. Operator : That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants all participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of today's conference. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mr. Michael Larsen, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead. Michael Larsen : Thank you, Nancy. Good morning, and welcome to ITW\u2019s third quarter 2017 conference call. I am Michael Larsen, ITW\u2019s Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining me this morning is our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi. During today\u2019s call, we will discuss our third quarter financial results and update you on our 2017 earnings forecast. Before we get to the results, let me remind you on slide two that this presentation contains our financial forecasts for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 as well as other forward-looking statements identified on this slide. We refer you to the company\u2019s 2016 Form 10-K for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Also, this presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Scott. Scott Santi : Thanks, Michael, and good morning, all. In the third quarter, the ITW team continued to execute at a very high level and as a result, delivered another quarter of strong financial results. Q3 earnings were $1.85 per share, which includes a $0.14 per share benefit from a favorable legal settlement that Michael will discuss shortly. Excluding the impact of this legal settlement, earnings per share increased 14% year-on-year, and operating margins increased 130 basis points to 24.4%, with Enterprise Initiatives contributing 110 basis points of improvement. In addition, we continue to make good headway on organic growth acceleration with continued progress on our organic growth initiatives across all seven of our segments. Year-to-date, our organic growth rate of 2.7% is more than double last year's rate despite the fact that two of our fastest-growing segments, Auto OEM and Food Equipment, are experiencing a little bit of market softness. Based on our solid Q3 results and a fairly stable near-term end market demand environment; we are increasing our full year EPS guidance as we now expect to grow full year earnings by 14% at the midpoint, and that's excluding the 17% per share full year benefit from the legal settlement. Overall, we continue to be very pleased with the progress we are making in leveraging ITW's differentiated business model and high-quality diversified business portfolio to deliver consistent top tier performance. We look forward to updating you on our strategy and long-term performance goals at our Annual Investor Day on December 1. With that, I'll turn the call over to Michael, who will provide you with more detail regarding our Q3 performance and 2017 forecast. Michael? Michael Larsen : Thanks, Scott. I'm on Slide 3 and I'd like to start the financial discussion today by separating the impact of the legal settlement from our underlying operating performance in the quarter. The schedule on Slide 3 lays out the key performance metrics as reported, including GAAP EPS of $1.85, the impact of the legal settlement, you can see the $0.14 benefit to EPS here and all the metrics excluding the legal settlement, with EPS of $1.71, an increase of 14% versus prior year. When I discuss our financial results for Q3 on the following slides, all of the results presented and my supporting commentary exclude the impact of the legal settlement. Okay. So, I'm on Slide 4, and as I mentioned, EPS increased 14% year-over-year to $1.71 and exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $0.09, with $0.06 contribution from margins and $0.03 from currency translation. As you may know, we've met or exceeded the midpoint of our EPS guidance every quarter since we began executing on our enterprise strategy five years ago. Total revenue was $3.6 billion, an increase of 4% with organic growth of 2%, which was right in line with the midpoint of our guidance. Six of seven segments had positive organic growth, led by Specialty up 5% and Welding and Construction, which were both up 4%. By geography, organic growth was strong internationally, up 4% led by China, which was up 13% and Europe was up 2%. As we discussed on the last earnings call, this quarter had one less shipping day, and in addition, Product Line Simplification ran a little higher than usual and was a 70-basis point drag on our organic growth rate in the quarter. Adjusting for these two items, the underlying organic growth rate is closer to 4% on an equal day basis. Just to remind you that the calendar for Q4 also has one less shipping day which is factored into our guidance. We increased the operating margin by 130 basis points to 24.4%, a new record for the company, driven by our continued progress on enterprise strategy initiatives and positive volume leverage. Enterprise Initiatives contributed 110 basis points of margin expansion, and we continue to have strong momentum on our Strategic Sourcing and 80/20 initiatives. Operating income grew 9% to $881 million, making this quarter the most profitable quarter in the company's history. Free cash flow was solid at 108% of net income, in line with typical seasonality, and it's worth reminding everyone that we raised the annual dividend by 20% in August. Overall, another strong high-quality quarter as the ITW team continues to leverage our highly differentiated business model to consistently deliver top tier results. On slide 5, we've laid out the key drivers of our 130 basis points of operating margin expansion this quarter. Enterprise Initiatives continue to be ITW's main driver of margin expansion as they contributed 110 basis points of structural margin improvement, marking the best quarterly performance so far, this year. Volume leverage was 60 basis points and as expected, price/cost was unfavorable 40 basis points, due primarily to higher steel costs, which impacted a few segments. For comparison purposes, please keep in mind that we do not include Strategic Sourcing savings in our price/cost calculation. Those are reported separately as a part of the Enterprise Initiatives savings number. If we were to include them, price/cost would have been positive and accretive to operating margin in the quarter. As in prior quarters, we more than offset the cost side with price on a dollar-for-dollar basis. We expect that price/cost for the full year will be positive in dollar terms by $30 million to $40 million and unfavorable by approximately 40 basis points to the margin percentage. Overall, really strong operating margin performance, record operating margin performance, in fact, in the quarter. On slide 6, on the left side of the page, you can see what Scott mentioned earlier, the solid progress on organic growth versus last year as reflected by our year-to-date organic growth rate of 2.7% and positive organic growth in all seven segments. Our growth rate of 2.7% is more than double the 1.2% we did in full year 2016 despite the fact that we were expecting a little bit of softness in two of our fastest-growing segments. In terms of operating margin, you can see the results by segment with meaningful sustainable margin expansion as six of seven segments have improved margin on a year-over-year basis. Test & Measurement and Electronics is leading the way in 2017 with 320 basis points followed by Welding up 230 basis points and Specialty up 200 basis points. As expected, Automotive OEM margins are down due to the margin dilution impact from the acquisition of EF&C last year. Excluding the 160 basis points of dilution from EF&C, Automotive OEM margins are up 20 basis points to 24.3%. I will now discuss the segment results starting with Automotive OEM, which delivered organic revenue growth of 1% in Q3 and grew above market in all key geographies as we continue to increase our content per vehicle. In North America, revenue was down 7%, which was better than the decline in auto builds, which were down 10% overall and down 14% at the Detroit 3 where we have relatively higher content per vehicle. Outside North America, growth continued to be very strong, with Europe up 8% and China up 10% versus market growth of 5% and 1%, respectively. The most recent IHS forecast for Q4 auto builds calls for more moderate declines year-over-year, including down 3% in North America and down 9% at the D3. As a result, we now expect full year organic revenue growth in our global Auto OEM segment of approximately 4%, pretty solid considering a second half decline in North America of 7% overall and 12% with the D3. Turning to slide seven. Food Equipment organic revenue this quarter was flat overall as strength in international markets was offset by market softness and difficult comparisons due to the timing of new program rollouts in North America. North America was down 4% with equipment down 6%. However, international equipment was strong, up 6%. Operating margin remained solid at 27.3% despite a little bit of a slowdown in the organic growth rate. Test & Measurement and Electronics organic revenue grew 1% as Test & Measurement grew by 4%. In the Instron, where demand is tied more closely to the CapEx cycle, organic growth was up 3% as the positive trend continues from the first half of the year. Electronics was down 3% due to a tough comparison versus last year when the business was up 13% due to some one-time large equipment purchases. Operating margin performance was very strong at 24.1%, an improvement of 310 basis points driven by Enterprise Initiatives. As a reminder, the 24.1% includes 300 basis points of non-cash expense associated with amortizing acquisition-related intangible assets. Turning to slide eight. The positive momentum in Welding continued with organic growth of 4% in Q3. By geography, North America was up 8% with equipment up 10% and consumables up 5%. Our industrial equipment business, which sells primarily into manufacturing, including automotive and heavy equipment, was strong, up 11% in the quarter, while our commercial equipment business, which sells through distribution to construction, light fabrication, farm and ranch customers, was up a solid 5% year-on-year. International was down 11% due primarily to oil and gas. And keep in mind though that international only represents approximately 20% of our Welding segment. Operating margin was solid at 26.6%, but was negatively impacted by increased restructuring costs in Europe. Excluding these added restructuring expenses, operating margin Q3 would have been up 70 basis points to 27.3%. Polymers & Fluids revenue improved 1% organically with automotive aftermarket up 1%. Fluids, which primarily sells highly-engineered lubricants and cleaners into industrial and commercial end markets, was up 4%, driven by demand internationally. Polymers, which primarily sells engineered adhesives and sealants for industrial MRO and OEM applications, was down 1%. Keep in mind that the 21% operating margin number includes 400 basis points of non-cash expense associated with amortizing acquisition-related intangible assets. On Slide 9, Construction Products organic revenue was up 4%. And demand in North America was solid with organic growth up 4% as residential led the way with 7% organic growth. Commercial, which is about 20% of our North American construction business, was down 3%. Europe and Asia Pacific was solid, both up 3%. Operating margin performance was very strong at 25.4%, which represents 280 basis points improvement year-over-year, primarily due to volume leverage and Enterprise Initiatives. Finally, in Specialty Products, organic revenue was strong, up 5% led by the international side, which was up 7% and operating margin was the highest in the company at 27.7%, an increase of 160 basis points due to volume leverage and Enterprise Initiatives. Let's turn to Slide 10 and our updated guidance for the full year and fourth quarter. Starting on the left side of the page, we're showing the as-reported numbers, which include the full year impact of the legal settlement. As a result of our strong Q3 results, we're raising our full year earnings guidance by $0.25 to a new EPS range of $6.62 to $6.72. And the $0.25 increase reflects the $0.09 beat from margins and currency in Q3, $0.14 from the legal settlement and $0.02 from higher operating margins in Q4. At current levels of demand, we expect full year organic growth of 2% to 3%, more than double our 2016 organic growth rate as all seven segments are poised to deliver positive organic growth for the full year. ITW's key performance metrics for the year are expected to be all-time records for the company. Excluding the legal settlement, we expect EPS growth of 14% at the midpoint and operating margin of approximately 24%, an increase of 150 basis points, with Enterprise Initiatives contributing 100 basis points. After-tax ROIC is expected to be approximately 23.5%, and free cash flow is expected to be greater than net income. As you can see, we are projecting another strong year for ITW, a record year. Finally, turning to the fourth quarter, our EPS guidance range is $1.55 to $1.65, an increase of 10% at the midpoint. You may recall that in the fourth quarter last year, we recorded a $0.06 EPS benefit from a special dividend related to an investment. Excluding this item, our fourth quarter EPS guidance represents 15% earnings growth at the midpoint. Finally, we expect organic revenue growth of 2% to 3% and as always, we're factoring current foreign exchange rates and current levels of demand into our forecasts. So, with that, we'll now open up the call to your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citi. Your line is now open. Andy Kaplowitz : Good morning, guys. Scott Santi : Hey Andy. Andy Kaplowitz : Can you give us a little more color regarding what's going on in Food Equipment? Obviously, U.S. restaurant seems to be a little weak. It's still a small portion of that business for you guys. Did institutional get a little weaker in the quarter? And you did mention the timing of shipments impacting quarter, so how are you thinking about the potential for recovery in the business at this point moving forward? Michael Larsen : Right, Andy. So clearly, we've seen a little bit of pullback here on the demand side. If you look at it in North America, the equipment side, down 6%. If you look at it by end market, the institutional side was only down slightly, down 1%. And restaurants were actually positive for us, up 1%. And if you'll recall in the last quarter, restaurant was actually down 7%. So, restaurants were up 1%. And then the retail side is where we had the comparison challenge in terms of product rollouts last year that didn't repeat this year in the retail side, which was the scales and the weigh wrap equipment was down 13% on a year-over-year basis. Andy Kaplowitz : So, Mike, do you see these parts of Food Equipment recovering here, or how should we look at it over the next few quarters? I know in the last quarter, you have said sort of 2% to 3% growth moving forward, but obviously, it's been a little weaker. Michael Larsen : Yeah, I know it's -- you're right, it's been a little bit weaker than expected, and based on what we're seeing in the business, we're not expecting anything very different in Q4, which as always, is based on current run rates. So, we're not seeing anything to suggest that these markets are coming back in the near term. Andy Kaplowitz : Okay. That's helpful. And then Scott or Mike, maybe you could just step back and assess the pivot to growth here in 2017. I know you talked about generating something like 130 basis points of higher organic growth this year versus last year, which is good. But as you move forward here, I mean, the global economy has clearly improved a bit. I'm not sure that you're going to generate 200 basis points above market this year but the goal was for exiting next year. So how does that look at this point, especially if a business like Food Equipment is a little bit slower? Scott Santi : Well, I think overall, what I would say is we certainly are getting much better balanc across the portfolio. Keep in mind that there is \u2013 and this is just repeating something you already know, but there has been an intense focus on a lot of the restructuring initiatives going on inside the company related to our Enterprise Initiatives. 85 divisions across the company all starting to make this pivot, all of them in various \u2013 in different stages in terms of making that turn. But I think the encouraging part in terms of what we see is that we're getting better balance across the portfolio. All seven of our businesses are improving in terms of their year-on-year organic growth rate. But it's not a matter of just simply flipping the switch. It is a matter of making a progress on the things that they're focused on internally and then making the shift in terms of the relative balance of effort, energy, attention and investment around growth initiatives. And those are all transitioning across again 85 different divisions across the company. So, I think as we look in terms of our progress to date, I think Michael talked about it, I think our \u2013 the fact that we've been able to get the organic growth rate up better than a full percentage point this year relative to last year with the two businesses that were generating the fastest organic growth for us being in -- experiencing some challenging near-term market conditions, I think, overall feels pretty good. And certainly, understanding what's going on inside these businesses and the kind of progress they're making in terms of this turn, I think we're set up well for another -- we'll talk about 2018 in December so we won't get ahead of ourselves, but we expect continued progress in 2018. Andy Kaplowitz : Scott, I don't want \u2013 I know you don't want to get ahead of yourself, but do you still feel confident about accelerating organic growth, lower POS as you go into 2018 and generally momentum from the businesses from pivot to growth? Scott Santi : Yes, I feel confident that our -- we'll be able to make another step change improvement in overall organic growth rate in 2018 relative to 2017. Andy Kaplowitz : Great. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Scott Santi : Good morning. Nigel Coe : I know you don't really guide quarter-by-quarter, but I'm just wondering it seems that you're not expecting Food to get better anytime soon. So, I'm just wondering if maybe you could just sort of broaden that out in terms of 4Q, the 2% to 3% organic, maybe just throw in a specific comment on Auto. Given the interest there, how do you see the segments relative to the 2% to 3%? Scott Santi : Yes. I think for Food Equipment, first, Nigel, I would expect a growth rate in Q4 on a year-over-year basis that is similar to what we just had here in Q3, maybe a little bit better than Q3 based on current run rates. I think for the Automotive business, the organic growth rate in Q4, on a year-over-year basis based on current run rates should be slightly better than Q3 and also factoring in the forecast from IHS that I just went through. So, if you look at in Q4, North America is down less than it was in Q4 and the Detroit 3 are down less in Q4 than they were in Q3. So, both those businesses should be in line with Q3, maybe a little bit better on a year-over-year basis in Q4. Nigel Coe : Okay. And the rest of the segments will be pretty much consistent with what we saw in 3Q as well? Scott Santi : Exactly. As the momentum is solid in the other five, that's what I would say heading into Q4. Michael Larsen : Yeah, I think what you'll see, Nigel, based on current run rates, most of our businesses will improve their year-over-year organic growth rate in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter. Nigel Coe : Okay. That's helpful. And then just my one follow-on, obviously, the margin trends in aggregates remained very, very strong. Auto margins were slightly weaker year-over-year despite comping the acquisition in 3Q. Maybe just -- maybe Michael or Scott, just discuss the impact of the mix between D3 being down mid-teens versus Europe, Asia up strong? So maybe just talk about that mix and perhaps whether or not we saw a disproportionate impact from raw materials in Auto as well? Michael Larsen : Yeah. It's actually not that much of a mix issue, Nigel. If you look at our business and you don't see this, but if you look at the profitability by geography, it's very similar across North America, Europe and China. Really, what you're seeing in the Automotive margins is the price/cost equation being negative here in the near term. Nigel Coe : Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Joe Ritchie : Thank you and good morning everyone. Scott Santi : Joe, good morning. Joe Ritchie : My first question is perhaps just welding margins for a second. I think, the incrementals were, I think, slightly below 30% for the quarter. I know you guys put through some pricing increases as well, so would have just expected that to be a little bit higher. And Michael, I think in your prepared comments, I think you mentioned some restructuring that was coming through in Europe. So maybe to the extent that you can talk about that restructuring, when we\u2019re going to be through it? And anything else that may have affected the incrementals this quarter? Michael Larsen : The bulk of it, Joe, I mean, so you're seeing a little bit of steel inflation coming through on the Welding side, and then you saw the 70 basis points of increased restructuring costs year-over-year. I think if you look at the year-to-date performance and for the full year, we expect to be in this 27% range in Q4 and for the full year. So really nothing unusual beyond those two items. Scott Santi : And the European restructuring is a one-quarter event. Michael Larsen : Yeah, yeah. Scott Santi : Q3. Michael Larsen : So, this is a one-time restructuring event, which will have benefits obviously in Q4 and next year. Joe Ritchie : Got it. Maybe \u2013 and maybe just a little bit more color. What specifically were you guys doing in Europe from a restructuring standpoint? Scott Santi : Joe, we typically don't discuss the specifics of those projects. Michael Larsen : It's related to Enterprise Initiatives. Nothing unusual out of the ordinary. Joe Ritchie : Okay. All right. Maybe switching then to price/cost. I know that this quarter, I think you guys did 40 basis points or the 40-basis point drag on margins. I think you guys had expected price/cost to be a little bit less of a drag in the second half of the year. And so, I'm just wondering whether that expectation has now changed. And how should we be then thinking about it also for 2018? Is there an opportunity potentially for this to turn into a tailwind to your margins next year? Scott Santi : So, Joe, on 2018, I think we're going to have to wait until -- when we get together in New York in December. I think, we haven't rolled out the annual plan here yet, so I wouldn't be -- I really don't want to comment on 2018 yet at this point. I think what we did say on the call last time where the headwind was 50 basis points in Q2, that we expected it to get better from here on out. We just did 40 basis points in Q3. We expect it to be a little bit better than that here in Q4. And so, for the full year, it should be about 40 basis points of headwind. And I'll just -- to put it in context, I mean, we just took up our margin guidance for the full year. We expect to be at 24% operating margin, and that's after offsetting 40 basis points of price/cost headwind here in 2017. So, we -- fundamentally, nothing has changed in terms of how we look at the price/cost equation. Should get a little better in Q4 and then we'll give you an update in December when we get together in New York in terms of what it might look like for 2018. Joe Ritchie : Got it. That makes sense. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Raso with ISI Evercore. Your line is now open. David Raso : Hi. Thank you. First question, I just want to bridge the gap on the faster organic growth in the fourth quarter than third quarter. You didn't call it out but is it Test & Measurement off of an easier comp? Is that really the notable acceleration in organic fourth quarter versus third? Is the other business still\u2026 Scott Santi : A little better Auto. Michael Larsen : Yeah. I mean, that's part of it. I think, in Electronics this quarter, like, I think, we said in the script here is, Electronics was up 13% last year and so a tough comp and so they will get a little bit better here in the fourth quarter. But I think as we look at it, based on current run rates, the majority of our segments will have a higher year-over-year growth rate in Q4 than they did in Q3. David Raso : Okay. And that is a set up a bit for when you made the comment earlier about in progress, I don\u2019t know if you would used the word, significant progress on the organic sales growth for next year. I know it's a little bit harder with sales than with margins in a way, but we used to think of the margin story as 100 bps a year. This year, the organic sales growth accelerated, if you hit your number, about 120 bps. Just so we can frame the expectations going into the December meeting, when you say significant progress, can you at least give us some idea of -- I mean, people just trying to figure out if the CapEx businesses may be aren't coming back quite as quickly as we like. In Auto, maybe a slower just given the strong growth to start this year. Where are the businesses that we expect accelerated growth? Is it the business that are doing pretty well now? Or is it some of the laggers like Polymers and Food stepping it up? If you can just kind of help frame the acceleration for next year that you speak to. Scott Santi : Yeah. I think we\u2019ve got to defer you to December, sorry. Our plans are still coming together. I would expect every one of our seven businesses to be better in 2018 than they were in 2017. Michael Larsen : Okay. Yeah. David Raso : So organically every business faster growth rate in 2018? Scott Santi : Organic and on margins, too. Michael Larsen : Yes. Scott Santi : Now what exactly that looks like, we got to get through the annual plan process here and then we'll -- we can talk about it in December. David Raso : No, that's helpful. I appreciate it. Thank you. Scott Santi : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mig Dobre with Baird. Your line is now open. Mig Dobre : Yes. Good morning everyone. Scott Santi : Hi, Mig. Mig Dobre : Just maybe to follow-up a bit on David's line of questioning here. I guess I'm wondering, when you're looking at your business this year, obviously, it's done better from an organic growth standpoint. But broadly speaking, growth has been considerably better. I mean, PMI, for instance, is now at the highest level since 2004 and who knows, chances are it's probably not going to accelerate from here as we look at 2018. So, if you're thinking about accelerating organic growth, how much of it would you say is going to be within your control, things like PLS or new products or things of that nature as opposed to simply end markets being better? Scott Santi : Well, I'd make two comments. One is that -- one would be just to remind you that PMI was strong in 2014, 2015 and 2016 when overall organic rates in our industry were not particularly strong, so I'm not sure that, that's the best parameter necessarily. But I would say overall is we are all about what's within our control. So as Michael said, none of our forecast is ever related to anything other than current run rates and what we expect to do incremental beyond that. So, everything that we are committing to, everything that we are working on is all in the realm of the various areas within our control. So, pivot to organic growth is much more focused on, as we talked about, additional penetration opportunities with our biggest and best customers, a very healthy and productive new product pipeline and some combination thereof across all sets of our businesses. Mig Dobre : Is it fair to expect lower drag from PLS next year? Scott Santi : I think it'll -- it's hard to tell. It may be in line with what we're seeing this year, maybe a little bit lower than that. I'll just -- the PLS is a drag on organic growth rate but it is really a very positive thing for what we're trying to do from an 80/20 standpoint. It really sets up the portfolio for much stronger organic growth on a go-forward basis with best-in-class margins and returns. So, we haven't talked about it much this year. We \u2013 I mentioned it today because it was a little bit higher, it can be a little bit lumpy as we go through these projects across 85 divisions. And when we rolled it out, we were a little bit higher than the average for this year. But in 2018, we're probably going to enter into more of a maintenance mode. What that number looks like, I don't know right now but it's probably a little bit lower than what we have seen this year. Mig Dobre : Okay. Great. Lastly, on Specialty Product, there were some headlines early in the quarter here that the Zip-Pak business had three trademarks canceled. I guess, I'm wondering if there's any comment as to how this might impact either the revenue stream going forward or any impact to margin for the Zip-Pak business. Thanks. Scott Santi : Yeah, thanks. There's no impact from that. Mig Dobre : All right. Thank you. Scott Santi : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Ann Duignan : Hi, good morning. Scott Santi : Hi, Ann. Ann Duignan : Just a point of clarification. On the price/cost versus the enterprise strategic sourcing savings, is the right way to think about that price/cost being more perhaps steel inflation showing up in the gross margins versus enterprise strategic sourcing savings maybe being more indirect savings like travel, et cetera? Is that the right way to think about it conceptually? Scott Santi : So, I'd say that the first point of your question was correct that you do see the impact of price/cost in gross margins. But you also see the impact of the strategic sourcing efforts in the gross margins. Michael Larsen : At this point, that's where the 80 of the benefit is, right. Scott Santi : So really on the indirect side is not -- it's really primarily on the direct side. And the only point we're making, Ann, is if we take those -- if we were to report those Strategic Sourcing savings in the price/cost number as some of our peers are doing, not saying it\u2019s good or bad, I'm just saying the way we report it looks a little bit different than some of our peers, the price/cost equation would be positive this year and it would have been positive in Q3. Ann Duignan : Okay, I appreciate that. I just wanted to make sure I was thinking about it conceptually the right way. Scott Santi : Yeah. That's fair. Ann Duignan : Then on the remainder of your businesses, could you just talk, I guess, specifically construction and maybe welding? Was there any impact on your business? I think about the welding business, you can use those welders with backup power units. Any impact on either welding or construction in the back of the storms or anything anticipated going forward? Scott Santi : Yeah, so Ann, let me just say first, we have more than 300 employees in Houston, 400 in Florida, 20 employees in Puerto Rico, and the most important thing as we talked about the impact of the storms is that they're all safe and we're only a small number of them are personally invited. And all of our facilities, the eight facilities in the region, we didn't have a lot of significant damage and we're back up \u2013 and they were back up and running pretty quickly. So, in terms of the results here in the near term, there were certainly some puts and takes by business, which is what you're getting at. We did see a little bit of an uptick on the welding side as well as the construction side. And that was offset actually by some Food Equipment orders that were not shipped into the region where the customer elected to defer for now. So overall, probably neutral for ITW here in terms of the third quarter. I think longer term this will probably be a net positive for some of our businesses, especially on the Construction side. But we've not put anything in the forecast at this point. Ann Duignan : Okay. I\u2019ll take it offline and get back. Thank you. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Jamie Cook : Hi. Good morning. A couple of questions. I guess, first question, obviously, you guys have done a phenomenal job on the margin side in terms of Enterprise Initiatives. As we think about the different business segments, are there certain segments where you feel like you that story sort of played out and there's not as much to do within your control and we should think about margins more driven by volumes versus incremental help from the Enterprise Initiatives as we think to 2018? Michael Larsen : Yeah, thank you, Jamie. And I think we would \u2013 the way we think about it is that despite the considerable progress at the enterprise level and also by segment that we've shown you that data in the past, we believe that there's more room for improvement here. And I think that's a -- we believe that's true for all of our segments and that's based on what they're telling us. This is not what we here at corporate think. This is based on the roll up from the divisions. And we'll see what 2018 looks like, but we expect at least another 100 basis points of margin expansion just from the Enterprise Initiatives alone. And just as an aside, if you look at \u2013 Scott Santi : It's in 2018 over 2017. Michael Larsen : In 2018 over 2017. And just as an aside, if you look at Q3, every one of the segments had at least 90 basis points of Enterprise Initiative impact. So, it\u2019s broad-based, it's still going on and is having a meaningful impact on our margins. The other point, I'll just make, if you look at \u2013 if you go back to slide 6 on the deck, you can see that our seven segments are all starting to cluster around the mid to high 20s from an operating margin standpoint. And some of these businesses have improved by more than 10 percentage points since we started the enterprise strategy. And I think that the fact that they're now clustering in the mid-20s really speaks to how powerful, our differentiated business model is. And as we continue to focus on leveraging that, we expect to continue to see improved margins across the portfolio, and therefore also at the enterprise level. Jamie Cook : Okay. Thanks. I\u2019ll get back in queue. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Fisher with UBS. Your line is now open. Steve Fisher : Thanks. Good morning. Scott Santi : Good morning. Steve Fisher : Michael, you mentioned that PLS can be lumpy, but to what extent was that PLS drag in the quarter plan going into the quarter? Or was that an adjustment that you made as the quarter progressed? Just wondering where you felt the need to do more PLS or kind of where you found the opportunity? Michael Larsen : Yeah, so this was all planned, Steve, at the division level. So, I think I can't really point to any one segment. There's still \u2013the 80/20 initiatives are broad-based across 85 divisions. And like I said, when you we rolled up the number for the quarter, it was 70 basis points, a little bit higher than what we had expected maybe, but that's actually a good thing, as I tried to say earlier. Steve Fisher : Okay. And you mentioned some of the puts and takes of the hurricane in September. But more broadly, did you see any particular acceleration or deceleration as the quarter progressed? Michael Larsen : No, I think when we looked at the monthlies they were all right in line with run rate and what we had expected. So, nothing unusual from a monthly standpoint. Steve Fisher : Okay. And then just real quick, the commercial construction looked like it flipped to a minus 3% from positive 3% last quarter. Was that just a comps thing or is there something moderating there? Michael Larsen : I think that business can be \u2013 commercial construction side can be a little lumpy. I think that market, I would probably say, is flat to maybe slightly negative, maybe slowing a little bit on the commercial construction side, but more than offset by the 7% growth that you saw in residential. And just if you look at commercial construction business on a year-to-date basis, it's flat, which is probably in line with where we see the market right now. Steve Fisher : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nathan Jones with Stifel. Your line is now open. Nathan Jones : Good morning, everyone. Scott Santi : Good morning. Michael Larsen : Good morning. Nathan Jones : Just a question on corporate expense. You guys have had fairly low corporate expense this year, even adjusting out the legal sentiment. Can you talk about what we should expect for our quarterly run rate, say in the fourth quarter and going into 2018? Scott Santi : So, if you look at, Nathan, so there's a line in the income statement in the schedule on the back where we typically, on a quarterly basis, have $20 million of unallocated cost. That has flipped positive with the legal settlement. I would expect for next year that our corporate cost will be flat on a year-over-year basis. And so, as a result of that, you'll see \u2013 we will come back to that $20 million of unallocated cost in the income statement as we go through next year on a quarterly basis. So, don't expect any big changes from a corporate cost standpoint. Nathan Jones : Okay, so about $80 million next year. Then just one question on the international Welding business. You said that was mostly dragged down by the oil and gas market. Is it possible for you to give us any information on how the international Welding business did ex the oil and gas market? Scott Santi : It's really the majority of what we're showing there is oil and gas, so international was down. I think oil and gas international was down 11%, which is in line with the overall number for the international side. Michael Larsen : The vast majority of our international sales, so I don't think we have much in terms of read-through. Nathan Jones : Okay. Fair enough. Thanks very much. Scott Santi : Right. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from Joe O'Dea with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open. Joe O'Dea: Hi. Good morning. Scott Santi : Good morning. Joe O'Dea: Looks like another quarter of good growth out of China. And I think actually looked like some acceleration from 2Q, given a harder comp. We see the data on the Auto side, but just if you could talk about China a little bit more broadly, maybe where you're seeing some sources of acceleration there and kind of confidence that you have in those demand levels as we move forward. Scott Santi : Yes. I think, Joe, if you remember last year, the Auto business in China was up 40% year-over-year, so that was \u2013 so this was a tough comp, and despite that, the business was up 10%, the Automotive business in China. When we look at China, it's \u2013 the strength is really broad-based. So, Test & Measurement, Food, Polymers & Fluids, Welding all positive, Specialty Products all positive here in the third quarter, up 13%. And on a year-to-date basis, the same is true and our businesses in China are up 15% on a year-to-date basis. Joe O'Dea: That's really helpful. And then, I guess, just along that, no signs of something within the quarter that would have been a particular boost? That's more kind of stable demand that you see that's supporting that growth? Scott Santi : Yeah, no, I think across the board really stable overall, like I said, China up 13%. Joe O'Dea: Great. And then just on price/cost, when you talk about the split between the dollars and the margin, when you think about the typical lag, if you can kind of characterize it in any sort of typical fashion, what do you generally see as the lag time before we'd start to see margin come back so that you're at least net neutral on price/cost? Scott Santi : Yeah, it's about two quarters until we've offset any -- the material cost side with price, about two quarters historically so. Joe O'Dea: Perfect. Thanks very much. Scott Santi : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. There are no questions in queue at this time speakers. End of Q&A Michael Larsen : All right, thank you very much, and thanks for dialing in. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Many of you may know Karen from her five years as head of investor relations at DuPont, so welcome Karen. During today\u2019s call, we will discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results and update you on our 2018 earnings forecast. Before we get to the results, let me remind you that this presentation contains our financial forecast for the first quarter and full year 2018 as well as other forward-looking statements identified on this slide. We refer you to the company\u2019s 2016 Form 10-K for more detailed about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Also, this presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of those measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Scott. Scott Santi : Thanks, Michael, and good morning everyone. The fourth quarter closed out another year of record performance and strong execution by the ITW team, excluding one-time tax and legal items 2017 earnings per share of $6.59 was up 16% versus 2016 and we achieved record performance and all of our key operating metrics. Operating income of $3.4 billion was up 11%, operating margin of 23.7% was up 120 basis points and after-tax return on invested capital of 24.4% was up 230 basis points. In addition, we returned more than $1.9 billion of capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We also continued to make meaningful progress on our focused efforts to accelerate organic growth. Our 2017 organic growth rate of 3% was up almost 2 full percentage points versus 2016, and in additional our Q4 organic growth rate of 4% gives us good momentum heading into 2018. Overall these results demonstrate that we are continuing to make progress in our efforts to position ITW to generate consistent differentiated performance on a sustained basis. Through the combination of ITW\u2019s high-quality business portfolio and our continued focus on leveraging ITW\u2019s powerful business model to full potential, we are well-positioned to continue to deliver strong results in 2018 and beyond. In closing, let me say we owe a huge debt of gratitude to our ITW colleagues around the world for their commitment to executing our strategy and serving our customers with excellence each and every day. They are responsible for ITW\u2019s strong performance and give us great confidence in our ability to continue to deliver sustained top-tier performance as we go forward. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Michael who will provide you with more detail regarding our Q4 and full year 2017 performance, and on our updated 2018 forecast. Back to you, Michael. Michael Larsen : All right, thank you Scott. So starting on slide three, before I get to the details regarding our 2017 performance and 2018 forecast, I wanted to spend a few minutes clarifying the impact of the new tax legislation on our reported Q4 and full year 2017 results. This schedule walks us through the impact of the one-time Q4 tax charge associated with the tax cuts and jobs act and then I\u2019ll talk about the tax rate and capital flexibility benefits that would accrue to 2018 and beyond. As you can see, we recorded a one-time tax charge of $658 million or the equivalent of $1.92 of EPS in the fourth quarter, reducing EPS from $1.70 to a GAAP EPS loss of $0.22. I should point out that this charge is our best estimate based on all the information available to us today. The charge has two primary elements, one a $729 million charge for the estimated repatriation taxes, and two, a net benefit of $71 million resulting from the revaluation or ITW\u2019s deferred taxes. We are in the process of analyzing the implications of the new tax law from a capital structure and capital allocation standpoint. Given both the magnitude of the changes involved, and that we expect further clarification with regard to the application of certain provisions of the legislation, we are not far enough along in our analysis to make any strategic decisions with regard to how we will deploy our existing overseas cash or to make a determination as to whether it will cause us to alter our capital structure or capital allocation framework. That said, we have begun implementing plans to repatriate approximately $2 billion of surplus capital to the U.S. by year-end 2018 and we have decided to accelerate our previously announced plan to increase ITW\u2019s dividend payout ratio. Subject to formal board approval, we now expect to increase our dividend payout ratio from 43% to approximately 50% of free cash flow on a run rate basis in August of this year versus by 2020 as previously communicated. With regard to the impact of the new tax legislation on our tax rate, we estimate that our tax rate for 2018 will be in the range of 25% to 26%. As you may recall, we use the tax rate of 29% when we should issued guidance in December. Our updated guidance today incorporates the benefit of the lower rate, which has a favorable EPS impact of $0.35 or 5%. We will provide additional detail and analysis of the one-time charge in our 10K. Moving onto slide four, we have also included a schedule for the full year 2017 that separates out the one-time impact of the tax legislation that I just talked about, and a previously disclosed legal item from the underlying operating performance of ITW. You can see our full year results with 5% revenue growth and 11% operating income growth, 120 basis points of margin expansion and 16% EPS growth. I\u2019ll cover those results in more detail in a few slides.  So with the impact of these non-recurring items clearly identified upfront, when I discuss our financial results for Q4, and full year 2017 on the following slides, the results presented and my commentary will exclude the impact of these two one-time items and focus on the operating performance of the company. We\u2019ll exclude the impact of these two one-time items and focus on the operating performance of the company. So on slide five, our Q4 performance ex the tax charge we grew EPS by 17% year-over-year to $1.70 exceeding the $1.60 midpoint of our prior guidance with $0.04 contribution from operations and $0.06 from a lower tax rate. You may recall that in Q4 last year, we recorded a net EPS benefit of $0.06 from a dividend payment offset by several small divestitures. If you adjust for these items, our Q4 EPS on an apples-to-apples basis was 22%. Total revenue was $3.6 billion, an increase of 7% with organic growth of 4% led by Test and Measurement/Electronics up 9%, welding up 6% and specialty product up 5%. All major geographies are positive, 4% growth in North America, 3% growth in Europe, 5% growth in Asia-Pacific including 7% in China. We improved operating margin by 160 basis points to 23.4% with Enterprise initiatives contributing 140 basis points. Free cash flow of $617 million was 106% of adjusted net income. So overall, another strong high-quality quarter to wrap up 2017 as the ITW team continues to execute. On slide six, you can see the drivers of our operating margin performance this quarter, which was once again driven by strong executional enterprise initiatives. They continue to be the main driver of our operating margin expansion and contributed 140 basis points in the quarter, which is the highest level since we launched our enterprise strategy five years ago. Good momentum and a solid backlog of opportunities in both our strategic sourcing and 8020 [ph] reapplication initiatives have us well set up for another 100 basis points of margin expansion in 2018 independent of volume. Volume leverage was 90 basis points and as expected price cost was slightly unfavorable this quarter at 50 basis points. As you may recall in our guidance for 2018, we are assuming 30 to 40 basis points of headwind from price cost. Overall, operating margin of 23.4% was an increase of 160 basis points and a new Q4 record for the company. On slide seven, you can see the meaningful progress on our focused efforts to accelerate organic growth across the segments. Our Q4, 2017 organic growth rate of 4% was up 2 percentage points year-over-year. And when you look at the detail by segment, you can see the strength of ITW\u2019s diversified high-quality business portfolio. Some of our faster growers last year like automotive OEM and food equipment may have slowed in the near-term due to market conditions, but others like Test and Measurement, Electronics and Welding have accelerated and net were growing at 2X last year\u2019s rate. In addition when you look at the operating margins, you notice two things, one, everyone improved year-over-year, and two, there are no weak links across our diversified portfolio. Let\u2019s go a little deeper by segment starting with automotive OEM, where we had another strong quarter with overall organic growth of 3% in a flat market with above market growth in all geographies, as we continue to increase our content per vehicle. In North America, organic growth was down 2% better than auto bills, which were down 4% overall and down 7% with the Detroit 3. Growth on the international side was very strong with Europe up 7%, and China was up 14%. As you know the growth on a quarterly basis can bounce around a bit, so we added the full year organic growth and build\u2019s numbers to the page. In North America, we managed to hold revenue to down 1% for the year, while overall builds were down four. In Europe and China our growth of 8% and 17% significantly outpaced bills of 3% and 2% respectively. Operating margin improved despite the previously discussed price cost headwinds. In terms of 2018, the most recent HIS forecast has auto build up 1% to 2% and we have essentially locked in content growth for 2018 against the automotive OEM segment organic growth of 4% to 5% for the year at these build levels. Food equipment organic revenue this quarter was flat overall, with North America down 1% in a soft market and against the comparison of up 4% last year as institutional sales was down 8% against the tough 2016 comparison of plus 23%. Retail was also down 5%. International was flat with equipment down 1% and service up 3% and operating margin improved 110 basis points to 25.8%. Very strong quarter for Test and Measurement and Electronics, organic revenue grew 9% as Test & Measurement grew by 13%. In Instron, where demand is tied closely to the business investment cycle, organic growth was up 8% and electronics was up 4%. Progress on operating margin performance was also very strong at 23.4% an improvement of 330 basis points driven by enterprise initiatives and volume leverage. As a reminder, the 23.4% includes 280 basis points of non-cash expense associated with amortizing acquisition related intangible assets. Also on slide nine, strong momentum in welding continues with organic growth of 6% in Q4. By geography, North America was up 10%, our industrial equipment business which serves primary into manufacturing including automotive and heavy equipment was up 15% in the quarter, while our commercial equipment business which sells through distribution to construction, light fabrication and farm and ranch customers, was up a solid 5% year-on-year. Overall, equipment was up 13% while consumables were down 2%. International was down 10% due primary to oil and gas and please keep in mind that international only represents approximately 20% of our welding segment. On the margin front, operating margin improved this quarter by 200 basis points to 26.4%. Polymers & Fluids with positive organic revenue growth of 3% as fluids grew by 5% and automotive aftermarket and polymers both grew 2%. As a reminder here, the 19.9% operating margin includes 400 basis points of non-cash expense associated with amortizing acquisition related intangible assets. Construction products grew 4% organically. North America was up 2 with residential remodel of 2% and commercial down 1%. International was strong with Europe up 5% and Asia-Pacific was up 4%. Operating margin performance was solid at 23.4% which represents 200 basis point improvement year-over-years primarily due to enterprise initiatives. Finally, in specialty product organic revenue was up 5% with notable strength on the equipment side and by geography North America was up 4% and international was up 6%. As Scott mentioned as you can see on slide 11, 2017 was a record year for ITW. We achieved 16% EPS growth, increase revenue of 5% to $14.3 billion and continued to make meaningful progress with 3% organic growth, and positive organic growth in all seven segments and all major geographies. The key performance metrics are all new all-time records including 23.7% operating margin and after-tax ROIC of 24.4%. Free cash flow was $2.2 billion, an increase of 9%. In terms of capital allocation in 2017, we invested almost $600 million in our businesses for growth, and productivity increased ITW\u2019s dividend 20% and returned more than $1.9 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. Turning to slide 12, you can see our record operating margin performance with 120 basis points of improvement year-on-year and record operating margin of 23.7% excluding the legal item. We listed the key drivers here including enterprise initiatives of 120 basis points, volume 70 basis points, price cost down 40 basis points, as expected but positive on a dollar basis. EF&C was slightly dilutive and the legal item added 70 basis points for a total reported margin expansion of 190 basis points. Turning to slide 13, as many of you know we\u2019ve done a lot of work over the past five years to position ITW to consistently deliver solid high-quality growth. We have made some good progress in this regard, as 2017 marked their third year in a row of a meaningful improvement in our organic growth rate. As you can see slightly negative organic growth in 2015 with a lot of PLS activity turning positive 1% in 2016, 3% in 2017 and based on this positive momentum, in our current run rates, we expect to make meaningful progress again in 2018 with a growth rate in the 3% to 4% range. Let\u2019s turn to our updated guidance on slide 14. Relative to your December meeting, we raised our full year GAAP EPS guidance at the midpoint by $0.40 or 6% to new range of 745 to 765 which represents 15% year-on-year earnings growth at the 755 midpoint. The $0.40 increase is essentially $0.35 benefit from our estimated lower tax rate of 25% to 26% and $0.05 from current foreign exchange rates. For 2018, we expect organic growth of 3% to 4% based on current run rates and operating margin of 25% to 25.5% with another 100 basis points of structural margin improvement from our enterprise initiatives. Free cash flow conversion is expected to exceed 100% of net income and we\u2019ve allocated $1 billion of surplus capital to share repurchases. As we mentioned earlier, we are planning to increase the dividend payout ratio to a run rate of 50% of free cash flow subject to formal board approval in August. For the first quarter our GAAP EPS guidance is a $1.80 to $1.90 which represents 20% earnings growth year-over-year at the midpoint with organic growth of 3% to 4% in line with current levels of demand. As per usual our guidance is based on current foreign exchange rates and we are estimating a 24.5% to 25.5% tax rate for Q1. So with that, we\u2019ll now open the call to your questions. And Dale, if you could please open the line for the Q&A session of the call. Operator : Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Speakers, we do have our first question in queue. This one comes from Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi. Andrew, your line is now open. Andrew Kaplowitz : So Scott or Mike, you didn\u2019t change your organic growth guidance for 2018, 3% to 4% and we know it\u2019s early in the year. We know your forecast current run rates but you did beat your own organic growth forecast in 4Q was 3.7% and it does seem like many of your businesses are accelerating, you know welding, test and measurement. So why wouldn\u2019t you deliver at least towards the higher end of your organic growth, if current economic conditions hold. Scott Santi : Sorry about that, by the way the phone ringing in at the background. So essentially I think you\u2019ve pegged it pretty well and the guidance we gave in December was based on activity we were already seeing in the fourth quarter. As you run rate it out, we are still; we think 3 to 4 is the right number. Certainly would acknowledge the fact that there is some momentum building. It is only January, so to the extent things continued on the path of run from the standpoint of the macro environment, I think the possibility is good that we would certainly be in the high end of that range, but from where we sit today, while things are incrementally better, you know the forecast that we gave you in December was based on what we already knew was had going on in the fourth quarter. Andrew Kaplowitz : Got it. And then I have to ask you guys about price versus cost obviously in the sense that you know margin improvement of 4Q was still very strong but maybe slightly light of your forecast given the 50 basis points of price versus cost. You mentioned that you still expect 30 to 40 for 2018, what are the chances that the headwinds from price versus cost gets a little worse before it gets better and you know again you mentioned you are still covering it dollar wise. So, you know how concerned are you about sort of the range to get that on margins given relatively high raw material cost? Michael Larsen : So Andy, I mean we are closely watching this and there certainly is some inflation that is being addressed in our business units. But, I think we have it well covered in our current guidance. So, as you point out, our strategy in 2017 and it will be the same in 2018 is to offset any material cost inflation dollar for dollar with price, and we have been able to do that successfully at the enterprise level. We have assumed for 2018 that we will see a similar impact from a margin standpoint of 30 to 40 basis points. As we talked about in December in New York to be hopefully somewhat conservative we have baked in some EPS headwind as well on the price cost side. So sudden not complacent and taking action getting price in all of our businesses with automotive being the one that\u2019s a little more challenging just given how that industry is structured, but overall feel good about price cost going into 2018. Scott Santi : What I would just \u2013 would just add to that real quick. I think the reality is as you know this affects percentages, but our \u2013 I think we are very comfortable with our ability to recover dollar for dollar. So from the standpoint of actual EPS risk in 2018 we are very comfortable this is not going to be a significant factor as we sit here today. Andrew Kaplowitz : Appreciate it guys, nice quarter. Scott Santi : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question in queue comes from John Inch of Deutsche Bank. John, your line is now open. John Inch : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Scott Santi : Good morning, John. John Inch : Morning guys. So cash flow in 2017 on the conversion side, a little wider, your guide has it above 100%. What were the dynamics and then does that have anything to do, Mike or Scott with kind of $600 million of investment spending and I forget what you said the investment spending is going to be for 2018, but maybe you could add a little more color there? Scott Santi : Yes, that\u2019s actually not the main driver, John. I mean, our investment was up slightly and that\u2019s really if you look at our CapEx and our R&D spend, it\u2019s typically in that 2% of sales range for CapEx and 1.6%, 1.7% for R&D. And so our sales grow, those investments will grow. Operationally we delivered 100%. There are two things going on in the full year number. One is the decision that we made last year to fully fund our pension plans. We talked about that contribution, I think it was in the second quarter last year, on top of our regular contribution the total was about 150 million. And our pension plans are now fully funded to the point where we stress tested them in another '08 '09 type scenario. We are not going to be in a position where we are underfunded on the pension side. And the other piece that gets you to the 100% free cash flow is just the timing of some cash tax payment in 2017 versus 2016. So operationally we did 100%. Now, if you\u2019re really picky, if you look at Q4, we did see a slight increase in working capital and that\u2019s just to assume, support the higher demand and the increase in backlog that we are seeing in some of our businesses. John Inch : Which frankly you would have expected, so I think that makes sense. If there is any of the businesses that potentially seem like they maybe could do a bit better, its food equipment and there\u2019s really no evidence of that in the fourth quarter print and your guide kind of around 1% doesn\u2019t anticipate much. Maybe you could just explain to us what could be the variables that could actually drive that business higher? It would obviously be the U.S. economies, it seems to be accelerating. And is Food Equipment, does it typically historically roll higher or could it all of a sudden start to surprise higher. I mean what are the dynamics in that segment that we should be watching for in 2018? Scott Santi : I think our current view and it is that in the first half of the year we don\u2019t expect much improvement in market conditions in North America. There is some optimism as it relates to the second half. We are modelling at current run rates. We should end up at 2% to 3% for the year, but it continues to be a fairly challenging environment as we\u2019ve talked about for several quarters now in North America. John Inch : That\u2019s fine. And just last, Michael on tax, one is the 2018 effective rate, the 25, 26 is that kind of a number that sustains, barring any other changes that are unforeseen, meaning you know if you fast forward a few years it should still be 25 to 26 unless something has changed. And then just on that point, I think at the December 1st meeting, you had again informally was it guidance, you said maybe the rate rise in the lower 20s. And I think if there is anything that seems to be a pattern, it\u2019s that you know effective tax rate from the part of the company they are coming in higher than people had otherwise perhaps anticipated, uniformly so I\u2019m just curious if you comment on sort of both fronts. Is the rate higher and why is it higher and then is it sustainable or does it tick higher or lower do you think overtime? Michael Larsen : Yes, it\u2019s a good question, John. So, to answer your first question, we do expect that this is a year one [ph] run rate of 25 to 26, and as we get ourselves organized here we could potentially see that go lower from here. The rate is slightly higher, not just for us but I think you\u2019ve seen that for others as well then maybe we had expected one, you know the rate, the federal rate went to 21 not to 20. And the other piece is that there are some we believe somewhat unintended consequences in this act associated with a foreign tax, U.S. tax on foreign earnings of the so-called guilty tax  And the way the math works on that, that\u2019s about two points a headwind to the overall rate. Now that could get, that could get further clarified and maybe there is a workaround, but as the math works today, we are sitting at 25 to 26, and maybe a little bit better on a go-forward basis. John Inch : Meaning if you hadn\u2019t had U.S. tax reform, you were working various angles legitimately to bring your tax rate down. Does U.S. tax reform kind of bump it lower and then you are still on that trajectory or does it actually with guilty etcetera does it kind of plug that? I guess that\u2019s kind of also what I was trying to\u2026 Michael Larsen : No, I think the current rate reflects our current planning, but obviously as these new rules and they are new, we are talking 30 days here, as we analyze and interpret those and those tied back to the comments we made around our capital structure, I mean there\u2019s some far-reaching implications here as we work through that and get our planning organized. I think that that\u2019s what we believe will give us room to lower the rate on a go-forward basis. John Inch : Got it. Thank you very much. Michael Larsen : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Joe, your line is now open. Joe Ritchie : Thank you. Good morning guys, and welcome Karen. So my first question, I guess Michael maybe talking about capital deployment for a second, so clearly nice to see the dividend payout ratio go up and you know the share repurchases, you can easily find out of your free cash flow. So given that you guys are repatriating $2 billion, I\u2019d be curious to hear if you have any initial thoughts on how you are going to allocate that capital? Michael Larsen : I think Joe, I\u2019ll go back to what I said earlier, is that we are still analyzing all the implications of the new tax law from a capital structure and capital allocation standpoint. As you know, these are pretty significant changes. Some of the rules are not entirely clear yet in terms of their application and we expect to receive a further guidance and we simply haven\u2019t had enough time to really work through this in a deliberate and thoughtful way as the management team and with our board. So we are not at a point today where we can really make any strategic decisions on how we\u2019ll deploy that overseas cash this year and also in the future years as it now is available to us here. And what that exactly it means from a either from a capital structure or a capital allocation framework. So what we can\u2019t tell you is that we are working to get the 2 billion back by year-end. We don\u2019t have the money as we sit here today and we have made the decision to accelerate the dividend payout ratio as we talked about it earlier. And that\u2019s really as far as we can go, as we sit here today and we\u2019ll keep you posted as we work through this. And so if we have more information here, when we report Q1, we\u2019ll give you an update. Joe Ritchie : Okay, that\u2019s helpful Michael. And maybe my follow on question and just kind of thinking about the end market trends, clearly you guys ended 2017 with a lot of momentum, particularly within your industrial businesses. So I\u2019d be curious to hear your thoughts around you know given this effect of the tax change, some thoughts around you know CapEx potentially reaccelerating here in the U.S. How are you thinking about the industrial businesses particularly and what the growth trajectory for those businesses should look like? And I know you\u2019ve given guidance on a segment basis, but I\u2019m wondering if you are expecting to see an uptake from further CapEx investing across the U.S.? Michael Larsen : Well, I think we are certainly hopeful and the early indications are that we were seeing some acceleration in business investment already, I mean prior to passage, our Q4 rates, you know one of the big deltas was clearly some really meaningful acceleration and demand trends and involving test and measurement and the capital goods components of our specialty segment. And certainly Joe to your point, I think this new tax legislation has great potential to add some further momentum and stimulation to the economy overall and in particular to business investment. So, I think the raw material in terms of some sustained recovery if you will in business investment particularly the U.S. is certainly there, but as is our habit we\u2019ll wait to see it before we plan on it. Joe Ritchie : Got it. And then if I could maybe just add one more Scott, I noticed that your welding business on the international side was down, you know double-digits, can you maybe just a little bit more color on what\u2019s happening within that market? Scott Santi : Yes. I suppose that's -- they are mostly it's a relatively small part of the overall business as Michael said and our position there is heavily weighted towards oil and gas. So it\u2019s nothing more than that. Certainly it should to the extent it is a turning in \u2013 any direction I\u2019d say we are certainly bottoming out there. But I don\u2019t think we are particularly good proxy for the overall welding market internationally, given the narrowness of our position there. Joe Ritchie : Got it, okay thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Speakers, our next question comes from David Raso of Evercore ISI. David, your line is now open. David Raso : Good morning. I was curious the organic sales guide for the year, what\u2019s the cadence? The 1Q is three to four \u2013 years three to four, what will be the cadence? Michael Larsen : It\u2019s actually if you look at it at current run rates, the 3 to 4 and I\u2019m not giving guidance for Q2 or Q3 but it\u2019s in that range, and then probably a little bit lower than that in the fourth quarter just on from a comp standpoint. David Raso : So even as the comps get a little easier 2Q and 3Q, just thinks if it is sort of 3 to 4? Michael Larsen : Yes, maybe at the higher end of the range, but in that 3 to 4 ranges based on run rates as we sit here today. David Raso : And the inventory being flat sequentially it\u2019s usually down 6% or so 3Q to 4Q. Where was the inventory in particular held a little higher anticipating superior growth historically? Michael Larsen : It was pretty broad based, so I think as you would expect the ones with the highest acceleration in Q4 that we just talked about had a little bit more, but overall there is some pretty good momentum across the portfolio here. Scott Santi : And these are \u2013 just to add onto that, the way that gets managed internally whether it\u2019s one year is that\u2019s sort of an automatic reaction, that\u2019s not a full forecast. So just as Michael said it happens because demand dictates, not because we're making our own bet on where things are heading. David Raso : Yes, nothing really but nothing really anticipatory about it. It's simply the way it works Scott Santi : No, no this \u2013 we don\u2019t as you know most of our businesses are we get the order \u2013 today, we shift tomorrow, we\u2019ve replenished inventory the following day and as demand picks up, we build more inventory. And so that\u2019s really what you are seeing. So I think it\u2019s nothing to be alarmed about. David Raso : All right, appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ann Duignan of JPMorgan. Ann, your line is now open. Ann Duignan : Yes, good morning. Scott Santi : Hi, Ann. Ann Duignan : Hi, I\u2019d like to ask a tax question in kind of a different way. I mean there are lot of changes as you noted that accelerated depreciation on new unused equipment, the elimination of section 1031. You know as you sit there running out a broad base of businesses, do you expect any changes in purchasing behaviour by any of your customers, I mean I\u2019m thinking through the equipment, automotive, welding you know of any changes that you are contemplating in the way people buy your products because of tax changes. Michael Larsen : Yes, I think I\u2019d tie back to what Scott said earlier. It\u2019s really you know on the business investment side were these new accelerated as depreciation rose, I have probably created some positive stimulus and so that it would be primarily test and measurement, welding as well as portions of specialty. So, I think it\u2019s hard to tie back to you know what specific was tax related but I think its part of an overall improving momentum in those businesses. Ann Duignan : Okay. I appreciate the color. And then on the flip side, a lot of talk about NAFTA and it does seem to be all about automotive and content on where it\u2019s built. If NAFTA were to be eliminated even for a short term and can you talk about what impact it might have or could have on your automotive business? Michael Larsen : You know and overall what I can tell you is we produce close to where our customers produced in that space. So to the extent this impacts where they choose to produce vehicles and which we have content then we are overtime we would certainly follow those moves. We are well positioned; in fact one of the strengths of our position is our belief to provide copies of that product all over the world, so it's certainly something that is well within our capacity to react to. I can\u2019t really speak as much in terms of overall demand impact for customers in the short run, but I think in terms of does it create any long-term structural issues for us, I can\u2019t really think of any sitting here today. Ann Duignan : Okay. I\u2019ll leave there. And I appreciate that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andy Casey of Wells Fargo Securities. Andy, your line is now open. Andy Casey : Thanks a lot. Good morning everybody. I was wondering if we could go back to test measurement and electronics. Could you give a little bit more color on what happened in the fourth quarter that organic growth rate moved up pretty substantially and part of it seems to be comps, but is there anything else going on there? Michael Larsen : Well, I think it was pretty broad based really on the test and measurement side and part of what we\u2019re seeing is some strength in the businesses that are tied to the semiconductor end market. But also like I said -- we pointed out, Instron up 8, which we believe again is driven by CapEx, increased demand for CapEx. So those are the two dynamics in test and measurement. We say it looks pretty for the year. In December, we said 4% to 5%, so it\u2019s kind of mid single-digit type growth for test and measurement and electronics, and as we said here today and that supported by the current run rates and the backlog in that business. Andy Casey : Okay. Thanks Michael. And then, if I look at the components of the 2018 guide and then look at the bottom line just trying to reconcile are you expecting any significant change in below the line items, interest expense or other income? Michael Larsen : So, I think kind of from a modeling standpoint on the interest expense, it will probably be a little bit higher, not because of an assumption around increased debt, but its really some of the euro denominated debt at current currency rate, so I think that\u2019s a $10 million, $15 million increase, if I remember correctly on the interest expense side. Most everything, depreciation might be up a little bit as a result of the increased investment that we talk about to support the growth this year. The intangibles, we typically go down $10 million to $15 million, so probably a similar trajectory for 2018. And then the other thing that\u2019s little unusual is the unallocated line this year of the legal item is actually showing a positive number. If you take the Q4 number which is the $20 million or so and run rate that out, so about $18 million for the year. I think that gives you kind of the key pieces that you need to put this together for 2018. Andy Casey : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Jamie your line is now open. Scott Santi : Hello, Jamie. Operator : Since Jamie is not responding shall we go to the next question. Scott Santi : We can go back to the Jamie, if she \u2013 he is still there. Operator : Next question comes from Joel Tiss of BMO. Joel Tiss : How you are doing guys? Scott Santi : Hi, Joel. Joel Tiss : I just wondered if you repatriate some capital and it comes back kind of chunkier, do you think the share repurchases would flow with that? Or they\u2019re going to be more systematic as we go through the year? Michael Larsen : What I can\u2019t tell you Joel is we have a $1 billion in the plan which is consistent with what we said in December. And from a planning standpoint that\u2019s $250 million a quarter. And as I said early we can really comment on the plans for the additional surplus capital, the $2 billion or so in terms of the timing. It will comeback by year-end, but we\u2019re still working through the exact timing. And then what that means from a capital allocation or capital structure standpoint, it's a little too early to comment on that. Joel Tiss : And then the same sort of question on acquisitions with this kind of accelerate your thinking on making bigger acquisitions or the same thing that's more of an opportunistic exercise and the capital flows wouldn't have any impact? Michael Larsen : Yes. This doesn\u2019t have any impact on our thinking around acquisitions. Joel Tiss : Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question in queue is from Mig Dobre of Baird. Mig, your line is now open. Mig Dobre : Thank you. Good morning everyone. I want to ask that acquisition question maybe a little differently. Based on what you know thus far from tax reform, are you changing your thinking on M&A at all, meaning, the way you're thinking about tax shields, the way you\u2019re think about the cost of capital, whether or not U.S. acquisitions versus international ones are more or less attractive, really anything different in the wake of this legislation? Scott Santi : The simple answer is at this point, no. Mig Dobre : Okay. Then maybe I'll ask a pricing question. You talked about automotive maybe struggling a little bit, but I\u2019m wondering do you have any segments in which pricing is perhaps stronger than you anticipated when you should original guidance at the Analyst Day? Scott Santi : I think the general framework is really goes back to how we structure the portfolio from a price cost standpoint. So we are operating in spaces and our products are not commodities, their performance matters to the customer, so we expect given that that any changes in input costs over some reasonable period of time that will -- that those changes in input cost will get reflected in the prices we charge our customers, that just been fair, but we are certainly much more oriented towards how do we grow the high-quality portfolio. And so from the standpoint of overall how to manage this we\u2019re just trying to cover the cost and really remain focused on leveraging the portfolio to continue to accelerate organic growth. Mig Dobre : I appreciate that. I guess I was just wondering on some your businesses that are clearly showing real volume inflection if it's fair to think that those are the ones that are -- getting [Indiscernible] to this point? Scott Santi : I\u2019m sorry; you broke up on the last part Mig. Mig Dobre : What I\u2019m trying to get at is, some of your businesses were clearly seeing a volume inflection. I'm wondering if it's fair to assume that these are also the ones that are currently getting the best price out there. Scott Santi : I don\u2019t know how to. Michael Larsen : I think, Mig, for us its really \u2013 for us price cost is a function of just wanting to recover the inflation that we\u2019re seeing over time. And there is typically a little bit about lag as you saw last year, but we\u2019re not trying to get greedy here and charge more in their business than we normally would, so it doesn\u2019t really impact our thinking. Mig Dobre : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question in queue is from Steven Fisher of UBS. Steven, your line is now open. Steven Fisher : Thanks. Good morning. Scott Santi : Good morning. Steven Fisher : Good morning. Just coming back to tax reform and CapEx, I know you said you're still determining your overall capital allocation plans after that include CapEx, and you say that CapEx is a function of sales, but I guess to what extend do you have more motivation to increase your own CapEx as a result of tax changes? And if you did what will be the types of things that you invest in? Would it be automation, more capacity in general, relocating capacities, any thought there? Scott Santi : I think, Steve, the answer is, if you look at our strong cash flow that we\u2019re already generating and have been for many years. We are already full invested in businesses and in our strategy before the passage of this tax legislation. So there's nothing that we would do or could do now that we didn't do before that would be accretive or at the performance or ability to execute a strategy, so at this point we\u2019re modeling and we penciled in two percent of sales on CapEx. We talked a lot about that in December how we think about these internal investments. And this any changes on the tax side have not \u2013 don\u2019t have any impact there. Steven Fisher : Okay. And I know you're looking for flat commercial construction in 2018 back at the Investor Day. What have you seen over the last month and a half that may shift that in one direction or another if anything? Scott Santi : I think at this point broadly for construction products we\u2019re still in that 3% to 4% organic growth range for the year and commercial we don't \u2013 there\u2019s really no change in terms of our view on the commercial side. Steven Fisher : Okay. So it\u2019s still flat. Scott Santi : Yes, flattish. Yes. Steven Fisher : Okay. All right. Thanks very much. Scott Santi : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question in queue is from Nathan Jones of Stifel. Nathan, your line is now open. Nathan Jones : Good morning, everyone. Scott Santi : Good morning. Nathan Jones : Michael, the $729 million repatriation charges that your expectation of what the cash charge will be over eight year, so like 90 million a year? And does that include free cash flow? Michael Larsen : Yes. So, if you look at the overall charge, the $658 million is very close to a cash number fin two free cash flow yet the liability will charge 608 million is very close to a cast number for all intents and purposes. So if you look at our balance sheet, you\u2019ll see a payable there, non-current tax payable that 614 and then there\u2019s another 50 million or so in current payables, all related to tax reform. I should point of clarification that the repatriation tax number, the 729 also includes any foreign withholding tax on those cash distribution. So any taxes that are payable overseas related to the 2 billion are already accounted for in that number. Nathan Jones : Okay. So the 660 odd [ph] is roughly that payment over eight years that you'll get? Michael Larsen : Yes. Nathan Jones : Okay. Got it. And then just a question I guess it's around T&M and around the CapEx cycle here, I mean, we've seen pretty good recovery in short cycle general industrial, but I guess one thing that's been missing in his recovery is being really any CapEx cycle. You\u2019ve got a few businesses here related CapEx, I think Intron is one that\u2019s particularly levered to that, that is showing good growth that seems to have inflected higher in the fourth quarter. Is it something that you're expecting to continue? Are you seeing signs ex the impact of the tax bill here? Did kind of CapEx cycle was budding here anyway? Michael Larsen : I think we\u2019ve seen a pickup in those businesses that goes back to before the passage of the tax act. So these businesses and so test and measurement, welding in particular have been pretty sluggish for a number for years. And I think it the recovery that we saw in those businesses goes back to November \u2013 October, November of 2016 and so if anything maybe there some additional stimulus here in those businesses and that would certainly be beneficial to ITW if that\u2019s the case. Nathan Jones : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks very much. Scott Santi : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next in line is Walter Liptak of Seaport Global. Walter, your line is now open. Walter Liptak : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I want to ask about 2017 organic growth of 2.9% and have you guys been able to parse out how much his internal initiative versus market growth? Michael Larsen : I\u2019ll tell you we do collect some data on that. I\u2019m not comfortable really sharing that externally. I think it's a combination of the two as we said in the past. I mean, I think clearly what we had point to Walters just look at the progression of overall organic growth rate with more than one percentage point improvement of 15 over 2015, 2016, 2017 and another meaningful improvement in the growth rate for 2018, and its really a combination of things. And I think only recently last year we\u2019ve seen a little bit pickup from a market standpoint, but if you look the last three years we've delivered meaningful improvement really in a pretty sluggish overall pretty challenging macro. So that\u2019s the best thing, so I can give that Walter. It\u2019s a little bit of both. Walter Liptak : Okay. It looks good. Is the PLS in 2017, have you been able to quantify how much of that one was there? Michael Larsen : It was for year 50 basis points for the year and 70 basis points in Q4. Walter Liptak : Okay. Is there any PLS headwind in 2018? Michael Larsen : It will be probably about the same in 2018, so we\u2019re expecting another 50 basis points here maybe as a result of the reapplication of the -- our 8020 [ph] reapplication initiatives across the businesses and you see the benefits were accruing not just in terms of \u2013 from a margin standpoint but also creating a portfolio that has significantly higher organic growth potential. Walter Liptak : Okay. And then in 2018 the 3% to 4%, I guess it\u2019s probably the same as in 2017 where there is some internal, but it\u2019s hard to pass it out as a ring. Scott Santi : Yes, it will be a combination again in it. Obviously the further along we are in the process, it would be reasonable to expect a higher contribution from the organic growth initiatives that we are executing across our businesses. Walter Liptak : Okay. Great, okay thank you. Scott Santi : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will be coming from Ross Gilardi of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Ross, your line is now open. Ross Gilardi : Thanks, good morning gentlemen. Scott Santi : Good morning. Ross Gilardi : I\u2019m just wondering if you talk a little bit more about that strength in the industrial welding part of your business in North America. And are you seeing your customers continuing to ramp production, is the only reason to expect that that won\u2019t accelerate further in 2018 as the year unfolds. Scott Santi : I think industrial 15 is that\u2019s a pretty solid number, I don\u2019t know if I would count on further acceleration from there on a sequential basis. The comps year-over-year are going to change as we go through the year, but we feel really good about the improved demand on them, on the, on the industrial side. Ross Gilardi : Okay, thanks. And then just any color on China, you know as this pertains to auto. I realized China auto in the grand scheme of your portfolio is small, but this is an important part of auto and your ability to continue to generate a 1000 plus basis points of our growth in China auto and anything you can say about like what types of products that\u2019s coming from. Michael Larsen : So I think it\u2019s actually not that small anymore. I mean, that team has been putting up some really strong growth rates for long period of time and as I said for the full year the China automotive business is up 17% and up 14% here in Q4. And when we look at the backlog in terms of further content per vehicle growth that is a sustainable above market growth rate. Ross Gilardi : Got it. Thank you very much. Michael Larsen : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We show no further questions in queue, but as a reminder for the participants again [Operator Instructions]. One moment, we\u2019ll wait and check for questions. Scott Santi : If not Dale, why don\u2019t we just wrap it up here and I\u2019d like to thank everybody for dialing in today and Karen and I are around if you want to give us a call. Thank you. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect",

Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC Operator : Welcome, and thank you for joining ITW's 2018 First Quarter Earnings Call. At this time all participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of the call. Today's conference is being recorded. Any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now I'd like to turn over the meeting to Karen Fletcher, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin. Karen A. Fletcher - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Thanks, Angela. Good morning and welcome to ITW's first quarter 2018 conference call. This morning I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi, along with Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen. During today's call, we will discuss first quarter financial results and update you on our second quarter and full year 2018 outlook. Before we get to the results, let me remind you that this presentation contains our financial forecast for the second quarter and full year 2018, as well as other forward-looking statements identified on this slide. We refer you to the company's 2017 Form 10-K for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Also, this presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of those measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release. With that, I'll turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi. E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Thank you, Karen. Good morning, everyone. Got off to a solid start in 2018 with revenue up 8% and earnings per share up 23%. The ITW team continues to execute at a high level in the quarter as the combination of continued progress in implementing our enterprise initiatives, disciplined price/cost management, and in improving demand environment resulted in strong overall operating performance, with operating income of $903 million, up 12%; operating margin of 24.1%, up 90 basis points; and after-tax return on invested capital of 27.7%, up 400 basis points. Despite lower-than-expected global auto builds impacting our Auto OEM segment in the quarter, we delivered 3% organic growth, and all seven business segments and major geographies were up year-on-year. CapEx-related demand continues to strengthen in a number of our end markets, which is driving accelerated organic growth in our Test & Measurement and Electronics and Welding segments. Overall, based on our Q1 results, positive underlying demand trends across many of our businesses and a strong pipeline of projects and activities supporting our enterprise initiatives, we are raising our full year EPS guidance by $0.15 at the midpoint. I'll now turn the call over to Michael to provide you with more detail on the quarter and our updated guidance. Michael? Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Thanks, Scott. Let's start with chart number 3 and I'll add some color on our financial performance. As Scott mentioned, revenue was up 8%, with pretty solid demand trends and positive organic growth in all segments led by Welding and Test & Measurement and Electronics, both up 8%. Operating margin improved by 90 basis points to 24.1%. After-tax return on invested capital was 27.7%, up 400 basis points, with the new U.S. tax legislation and our lower tax rate a key driver. Free cash flow was $444 million, up 11% versus prior year, and was 68% of net income, which is in line with typical seasonality. We expect 100% conversion or better for the full year. To-date, we have repatriated over $1 billion in cash and expect to bring back another $1 billion by year-end. We accelerated our planned share repurchases to $500 million in the quarter. You will note that the tax rate was 23.2% in the quarter, slightly below our guidance midpoint of 25%, primarily as a result of the Q1 cash repatriation and a $14 million foreign tax credit benefit that resulted from that. We now expect a slightly lower tax rate for the year relative to guidance, between 25% and 26% in quarters two through four, and a full-year average tax rate of 24.5% to 25.5%. And we continue to assess and clarify the provisions of U.S. tax reform, which could further impact our tax rate and future discrete items. Moving to chart number 4 and operating margin, operating margin was 24.1%, up 90 basis points versus prior year and a new Q1 record. Five years into our current enterprise strategy, we're still generating 110 basis points of savings from the strong execution on our 80/20 Front to Back Process and strategic sourcing initiatives. As per usual, we report strategic sourcing savings as part of our enterprise initiatives benefits, not as part of price/costs. But of that 110 basis points, roughly half was from sourcing initiatives. So if you match that up with price/cost headwinds of 50 basis points in the first quarter, our sourcing initiatives actually more than offset the margin impact from raw material cost inflation. As we have discussed previously, our strategy is to recover raw material cost inflation with price adjustments on a dollar-for-dollar basis. We did that in Q1 with net price/cost positive by $4 million in the quarter, and we expect to be positive in dollar terms again in Q2 and for the balance of the year. In fact, based on our price actions and known cost increases, we expect Q2 price/cost margin impact to look similar to Q1, and then improve from there in the second half of the year. While on the subject of price/cost, I'd like to comment on the potential impact of tariffs on ITW. As many of you know, our model is to source and produce where we sell. We have incorporated what we currently know about the impact of Section 232 steel and aluminum tariffs and the mitigating price actions into our business plan and company guidance. We're currently assessing the impact of proposed tariffs under Section 301. Bottom line, as we sit here today, we believe that price/cost is manageable and we expect to continue to cover material- and freight cost inflation with price on a dollar-for-dollar basis as we go through the year. Chart 5 provides some color on segment performance. We'll go through each segment individually, but I'd like to make a few points about overall performance first. The table on the left summarizes organic growth by segment for first quarter 2018 and compares it to organic growth for full-year 2017. You can see that our Q1 organic growth rate is similar to full-year 2017. Then we also provide our updated outlook for organic growth by segment for full-year 2018 to give you a better sense for the run rates and momentum on a full-year basis. We previously provided these segment growth estimates at our Investor Day in December and, as you can see, not much has changed. Today, we're essentially reaffirming what we told you then with two updates. We expect Welding to be better at 5% to 6% organic growth for the year, offset by marginally lower growth than what we projected in December for Specialty. Our segments with the strongest growth in the Q1, that includes Test & Measurement/Electronics, Welding, and Construction are solidly on track toward their full-year targets. While global auto builds in Q1 came in modestly below expectations, they're forecast to turn positive year-over- year going forward, starting with builds up 5% globally in the second quarter. Food Equipment will also show positive growth as comps ease throughout the year. Polymers and Specialty are also expected to improve as we go through the year based on current levels of demand. So while we may have some wider variation than usual in terms of segment growth rates in Q1, our overall growth guidance is unchanged, which illustrates the resiliency of our diversified high-quality portfolio. As I said, we remain firmly on track and expect organic growth of 3% to 4% this year, with all segments contributing positive year-over-year growth. Now let's look at the segment details, starting with Automotive, our largest segment. Organic growth was 1%, while global auto builds were down 1%, as I mentioned. We continue to grow our content per vehicle and, as a result, our Automotive OEM segment again grew faster than global builds. Note that we continue to see excellent penetration in China also, with organic sales are up 8% versus builds down 3%. Forecast for global auto production were just revised up slightly and are expected to be up 2% in 2018. Given the visibility that we have to above market growth of 2 to 4 percentage points in this segment, we expect another strong year overall for our Auto business, with full year organic growth of 4% to 5%. Let's move on to chart number 6. Food Equipment organic revenue was up less than 1% in Q1. On the positive side, we saw a nice recovery in our largest end markets, as institutional sales and chain restaurants in North America were up 7% in the quarter. However, this was offset by a decline in the retail sector, primarily grocery stores. The international side and the service business are pretty stable. And like I said, comparisons will get easier from here and the segment will benefit from new products being rolled out, and we expect to grow 2% to 3% in Food Equipment this year. Test & Measurement/Electronics organic revenue was up very strong, 8%. Instron revenue was up double digits and as we pointed out last quarter, their performance is closely tied to the business investment cycle and that continued to play out this quarter. Electronics was up 5%, with strong demand across the board, including semiconductor end markets. Strong performance as operating margin improved by 340 basis points to 23.4%. Now chart number 7, Welding's organic growth rate continues to accelerate and the backlog is strong. Organic growth was 8%, with global equipment up 10% and consumables up 4%. North America was up 9%, with 15% organic growth in industrial, with strong demand in heavy equipment, ship, rail, and automotive. Oil and gas was strong, too, and accelerating in North America, up 9% and only down slightly on the international side. Margin at 27.7% was the highest in the company. Polymers & Fluids organic growth was less than 1% and our operating margin improved 30 basis points to 20.9% and margin improved despite material cost inflation tied to chemicals and resins. Now moving to our last two segments on chart number 8, Construction continued its solid growth pattern into this quarter with 3% organic growth. North America was particularly strong at 7%, with residential construction at 9%. International markets were about flat. Specialty organic growth can be lumpy and was up 1% following a strong organic growth rate of 5% in Q4 last year. Equipment sales, which represent about 20% of this segment, were up 8%, offset by a 1% decline in consumables. Overall, as Scott said, a solid start to the year. The positive underlying demand trends across our segments and our clear line-of-sight to margin expansion give us confidence that we will deliver top tier performance again in 2018. Our updated guidance incorporates Q1 results, favorability from current foreign exchange rates, a modestly lower share count, and better operational performance. As a result, for the full year, we are raising our guidance midpoint by $0.15. We now expect full-year 2018 earnings in the range of $7.60 to $7.80 per share, up from a range of $7.45 to $7.65, which represents 17% EPS growth at the midpoint. We expect organic revenue growth of 3% to 4% for the full year, enterprise initiatives impact of 100 basis points independent of volume, and an effective tax rate of 24.5% to 25.5%. As you can see from the graphic on the left side of the page, we expect an operating margin of 25% to 25.5%. That number is unchanged in terms of guidance. And after-tax return on invested capital of 27% to 28%. Our guidance incorporates our best estimate of the impact of known tariffs, material inflation, and our implemented price actions, and we believe that the price/cost equation is manageable. These efforts, coupled with volume leverage and the continuous strong execution of our enterprise initiatives, gives us the confidence that ITW operating margins will expand by more than 100 basis points, with margin improvement in every segment ranging from 80 basis points to 130 basis points for the full year. Free cash conversion is expected to be 100% of net income or better. And, as I mentioned earlier, we have already repatriated more than $1 billion to the U.S. and repurchased shares for $500 million in the quarter. As a reminder, subject to board approval in August, we plan to significantly raise our dividend as we increased ITW's dividend payout ratio to 50% of free cash flow. Finally, we're providing guidance for Q2, a range of $1.90 to $2 per share, which reflects 15% growth at the midpoint versus $1.69 in Q2 2017. And we expect organic growth of 3% to 4% in the second quarter based on current run rates, as every segment's organic growth rate is projected to improve in Q2 relative to Q1. So just to wrap up, we continue to see solid demand trends across our businesses. We're well-positioned to deliver strong margin expansion. Price/cost is manageable. We're raising our EPS guidance for the full year by $0.15 at the midpoint, which represents 17% year-over-year growth, reflecting our solid start to the year and our confidence in ITW's ability to continue to execute at a high level through the balance of 2018. Karen, back to you. Karen A. Fletcher - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Michael. So, Angela, let's open up the lines for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin a question-and-answer session. One moment, please, for the first question. The first question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning, guys. E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Good morning. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Good morning. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: So I want to start first on the operating margins, on segment margins specifically. So the segment margins were up about 40 basis points this quarter on a year-over-year basis, but there hasn't been any change to your operating margin guidance for the year. So my question is, how much of that improvement is coming from, like, lower corporate versus you expect to see an improvement on the year-over-year segment margins as we progress through the year and what's driving that? Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: So, Joe, we expect every segment to improve operating margin for the full year, like I said, ranging from 80 basis points to 130 basis points. And the biggest driver there is the continued execution on the enterprise initiatives, as well as volume leverage, as all of our businesses are going to grow on a year-over-year basis. What you're seeing in Q1 is primarily the impact of price/cost in these segments and the lag we've talked about in the past from when the material cost inflation shows up and the price actions actually are realized. And so that's the 50 basis points of price/cost headwind that you saw here in the first quarter at the enterprise level, which, as I said, we expect Q2 to look similar, and then we would expect it to get better from there through the second half of the year, again, as these price actions take hold and offset the known material cost inflation as we sit here today. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Michael, maybe focusing on price/cost for a second, specifically as it relates to Welding. The Welding margins were flat year-over-year. One of your large competitors talked about getting some pretty significant pricing increases this quarter. Probably that hasn't flowed through results yet. Talk to me a little bit about the operational leverage in that specific segment. Just given growth is better, pricing seems to be pretty disciplined. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Yeah. I think what you are seeing, Joe, is similar to what I just described, which is this lag between when the price actions that have been announced, and there have been a number, as you know, offset the inflation that we're seeing primarily on steel on the Welding side. Again, I'll just point to Welding operating at 27.7% operating margin, the highest inside of the company, and we expect to continue to expand margins from here based on what we know today. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Got it. And maybe one last one. Just shifting to growth a little bit and focusing specifically on Auto OEM. You've got a pretty decent ramp on the organic growth side to hit your full year number. Just maybe talk a little bit about \u2013 this is one area where you have a little bit more visibility than some of your other segments. Maybe talk about what your expectation is based on wins you already have as you progress through the year. E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Yeah. I think things were a little softer from the standpoint of global builds in Q1 than it looked like they were going to be in Q4, but certainly as we've moved through Q1, the build picture in terms of input from our customers and some of the public data that you can see, builds for the balance of the year has firmed up. As Michael talked about in his commentary, second quarter builds are projected to be up 5%. That's usually a pretty reliable number, given the timing. And then through the balance of the year, things seem to be firming up. I would also point out \u2013 I think I saw this today. Maybe it was GM that reported some pretty good sales. So I think things are firming up there demand-wise and the overall production scenario, as we look through the balance of the year, is pretty solid. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Fair enough. I'll get back in queue. Operator : The next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is open. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Good morning, Andy. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Scott and Michael, I know you just talked about Auto OEM, but maybe you could step back and tell us what you saw as the core evolved here and also here in April. You guys aren't alone, but I think at the beginning of the quarter we kind of thought that you might get closer to your high end for the year and through the 4% organic guidance. And then you had a couple of businesses, specifically Specialty Products, maybe Polymers & Fluids, which slowed down a bit, but you got your longer cycle CapEx businesses continuing to improve. And I know that speaks to ITW's balance, but when you look going forward, is it going to be more of these longer cycle businesses carrying the torch here? And I know you changed your forecast a little bit for Welding \u2013 for Specialty Products, but is there a chance that Welding continues to outperform and maybe that's what sort of balances out, and Specialty Products is a little slower? Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Well, Andy, the delta in Q1 was what Scott just talked about, on a global basis the forecast that we use, and we talked about this in the past put our guidance together, projected a 1% increase in global builds for Q1 and ended up at being down 1%. If you look at specifically North America, which is our largest end markets and highest concentration for vehicle, North America builds were down 3%. And, as Scott said, if you read some of the headlines, I think March was probably a little bit lower than what people expected. That number goes from down 3% projected to be up 3% in Q2, and overall North America expects to be positive for the year, which is quite an improvement from last year. So we fully expect Auto to deliver 4% to 5% organic growth. We have really good visibility to the content per vehicle growth that gets us from the auto build number to 4% to 5%. In addition to that, you're right, continued strong momentum and acceleration on the Welding side. We have it pegged at 5% to 6%. Hopefully, that will turn out to be a conservative number. And then Test & Measurement, as well as the equipment side within Specialty Products, continue to be really strong in terms of order intake and the backlog for the rest of the year. You talk about FEG. FEG should improve from here as the comps get easier, but there's also a nice product \u2013 new product rollout cadence here for the balance of the year. And so other than retail, which has kind of put a little bit of pressure on the growth in Food this year, we feel very good overall about growth rates improving from Q1 through the balance of the year. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. And, Mike, I wanted to ask you about the guidance increase in the context of, obviously, you beat in the quarter $0.05 versus the middle of the range and, obviously, a little bit lower tax rate. Maybe if you can give us a little more color on the rest of the guidance increase. You talked about currency. You got a lower share count, but you also mentioned a better operating environment and you talked specifically about projects that ITW has. So if I look at the balance of the year, is this just more blocking and tackling? I remember you had some contingency in for this year, maybe on $0.15. Are you using some of that to raise the guidance? Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Just for the record, I don't recognize the $0.15 you're talking about, but the $0.15 guidance increase today is basically the $0.05 beat from Q1. Like we always do at this point, we update our assumptions for current foreign exchange rates. We have a slightly lower share count, given some of the acceleration here in Q1, and in the plan we still have $1 billion for the year for share repurchases. And then the balance in that $0.05 to $0.10 is really better demand and stronger operations, so that's what's driving the $0.15 raise today. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yeah. The contingency was around price versus cost, Michael. You had talked about it. You guys were pretty conservative at the Analyst Day. Just wondering what happened to that. It's getting absorbed with the higher material cost. E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: We're using that up given the cost environment. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yeah. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, if you look at relative to December, I mean, that's one of the variables that's changed, right? So price/cost maybe there was an assumption would be more favorable and maybe a more conservative view today, so. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Ross Gilardi with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. Thanks, guys. Good morning. E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Morning. Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Just a couple of questions. Just on food and beverage, I mean, I think you said institutional and chain restaurants up 7%, which seems like a pretty big number, given the environment. So how sustainable is that? What do you think is going on there? Is that your new products getting good reception, or is it CapEx picking up, or is it a timing issue? Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Yeah. It's really CapEx and stronger demand on the institutional side, I think education specifically. And then on the restaurant side, quick service was also very strong. So that's certainly -- if you look at the core equipment business inside of \u2013 core food service equipment inside of the Food Equipment business, we were up 7% in the quarter, which is certainly encouraging. And those trends look good for the balance of the year with good orders and backlog, and now you have the new product rollouts coming in as well. Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And clearly you seem pretty positive on your ability to offset the higher input costs with pricing. Can you shed any light on what you're actually assuming in your forecast for steel? Do you just sort of mark-to-market where we are now to the balance of the year? Are you forecasting things to come down at all in the second half? Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Yeah. We'll leave the forecasting to other people. We're basically taking what we're seeing in our businesses today in terms of inflation on steel, chemicals, resins, as well as the demand picture. And all of that is included into our guidance today. So... E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Just to clarify, that's already absorbed and also announced, so there are certainly things out there that we're not seeing the full impact of yet, but we've already accounted for those in the guide, and likewise have taken pricing actions on those. But it is all based on known. No forecast. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Correct. Yeah, there's no forecast. Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. And then just lastly, M&A, can you comment on the pipeline at all and likelihood of maybe at least some smaller-to-midsize deals this year? E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: No. We remain very focused on executing our current strategy, getting our businesses up to full potential from an operational perspective. And we've talked about a long-time accelerating organic growth, and so that remains the focus. It doesn't preclude anything that might come our way opportunistically, but we don't have a particularly active agenda right now in that regard. Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning, everybody. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Good morning. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : If you could just talk a little bit about the trends you're seeing in Europe across your broad portfolio, I'd appreciate it. There's some questions out there about PMI slowing, particularly in Germany. The strength of the euro, whether that's beginning to hurt it. Just curious with your breadth of portfolio, what you guys are seeing in Europe specifically. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: We haven't seen any slowdown. We were up a little bit less in the first quarter due to a tough comp. In the first quarter last year we were up 6% in Europe. We're up 1% here in the first quarter, but for the full year we expect to be up in that 3% to 4% range in Europe, and we haven't really seen anything slow down at this point. E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Based on sequential run rates. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Right, that's based on current levels of demand. That's right. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. I appreciate the color. And then, can you just talk about \u2013 when you talk about price increases, I just want to be clear, are all your businesses implementing price increases as opposed to surcharges? And should we consider backlogs not included or dates when price increases will specifically be implemented? I just want to get a sense of \u2013 I know you talked about Q2 being similar to Q1,but if you could just talk us through the details, that would be great. E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Yeah. These are primarily price increases and, as you know, we are not a backlog-driven company, so our businesses tend to be fairly short-cycle, and so these will go into effect relatively quickly. E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: But we do have notification provisions and other elements in terms of how we transact with our customers that are all applied here. We're not breaking those. We're not trying to waive anything in terms of surcharges. I think it's the part of your question, Ann. So there is some cycle in terms of timing and working our way through it. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And any particular segments where it might be more difficult to get pricing in this environment, or are customers broadly acceptant of price increases, which... E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: I think everybody gets it, and I think we're having price discussions everywhere across the company. As you know, Automotive can be a little bit more challenging, but we're working through that with our customers as well. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And just a quick clarification on Automotive. Are you more leveraged or less leveraged to cars versus SUVs, or is there anything in the mix that's changing out there in the industry that we should consider going into maybe next year? Maybe not this year, but Ford made the big announcement yesterday about cutting back on cars. E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Our highest content, Ann, is on SUVs and trucks. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thank you. I appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from David Raso with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. David Raso - Evercore ISI Group : Hi. Good morning. You mentioned in the second quarter each business segment would have faster organic growth than the first quarter. And I was just curious. The comp does get easier for second quarter and third quarter. Are the businesses \u2013 or which businesses do you actually feel are truly accelerating and how much is it just simply the comp eases the next two quarters? Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: I mean, these are all based on current levels of demand, current run rates, so not \u2013 other than Automotive, which we talked about. So we're not counting on an acceleration. So what you're seeing, David, is the comps easier, as you point out, in Q2 and Q3, and then a little bit more challenging in Q4. E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Yeah. And the demand environment is pretty good. I mean, order books are good. I think some of these quarter-to-quarter comparisons, there's so much that goes on that's sort of just circumstantial. And I think there can be a little bit of an over-indexing on a particular quarter-to-quarter comp, but I think from a sequential demand standpoint, the overall environment right now is firm to improving. David Raso - Evercore ISI Group : Yeah. I guess we're trying to figure is, is it truly improving, is it just the comp, and I appreciate the way you try to guide, just current rates, but trying to be a little more thoughtful about actual trends, not just current rate run forward. Maybe to ask another way, if you look at the first quarter organic for each business segment, then you put it up against the full year guide, there's obviously some that are in a lot better shape and other ones that are definitely dragging behind the full year. Can you just maybe quick rattle through the segments, where are the ones that you feel, yeah, maybe that one's a little hard to get to the low end, and that's another one that, sure, the way we're running now, maybe a better chance at the higher end? Just to give us a little play on maybe we're running ahead, we're running behind. E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Well, I think the obvious ones to point to are the CapEx-related businesses that we've certainly seen some really good acceleration in Welding, Test & Measurement, and even the equipment side of Specialty. I think that part \u2013 if you were looking for where there might be some additional upside, it all depends. I think we've gone through \u2013 my perspective on that is two-and-a-half or three years of pretty tamped down business investment, so there is some fair amount of pent-up demand there. And the momentum in terms of order rate seem to be pretty good. I think the rest of them \u2013 the consumable business order rates are not bad. They're certainly not as cyclical as the CapEx parts of the portfolio. But I can't think of any place where we're seeing \u2013 we've got concerns going forward about whether we're going to generate a reasonable amount of growth, given the consumable demand... David Raso - Evercore ISI Group : Yeah. I think the interplay is that those CapEx businesses are running at 7.5% plus in the first quarter. You'd like to think there's a chance they can do better than the 4% to 5% in Test & Measurement and 5% and 6% in Welding. And they usually bring decent incrementals. At the same time, Polymers, actually I'm scratching my head a little bit why we started that slowly. I mean, that's at 0.3% and the full-year guide's 2.5%. Food full year guide's 2.5%. We started at 0.4%. But those business don't have quite the same incrementals usually, at least as a base case. So we just kind of do the interplay of what's above, what's below, and so \u2013 okay, so nothing stands out in particular. E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Yeah. We interact with the leaders of all seven of our businesses every quarter. So I think the overall picture that I would give you is everybody's feeling pretty good about the balance of the year from a demand standpoint. David Raso - Evercore ISI Group : So none of them were thinking of taking down the full year guide on the organic. Let me \u2013 said more blatantly, there wasn't any heavy discussion on Polymers or Food to take it down or... E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: That's correct, other than the adjustment in Specialty we made. Yeah. David Raso - Evercore ISI Group : Yeah, the Specialty tweak. Okay. Thanks. I appreciate it. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from Nathan Jones with Stifel. Your line is open. Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning, everyone. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Good morning. Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Back to the price/cost a little bit here. You guys are saying you're going to have a headwind here in 2Q and you think it will flatten out in 3Q. I know you're not guiding for any more raw material inflation, but we are continuing to see raw material inflation. I'm wondering why you're not maybe taking a little bit more conservative approach to the back half or at least the third quarter on the price/cost dynamic. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Well, what we're telling you, Nathan, is what we really think is going to happen here based on the actions that we've taken and the raw material inflation that we've seen so far. So Q2 we expect \u2013 let's do the margin impact first \u2013 to look a lot like Q1, and then a little bit better than that in the back half of the year. Let me just point out, again, like dollar-for-dollar we are positive on price/cost. So there's no negative EPS impact here from what we're seeing. So we were positive in Q1. We expect to be positive in Q2 in terms of price/cost dollars. And if you extrapolate from what I said, we'd expect to be even more positive than that in Q3 and Q4 based on the price increases that we've announced, so. Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And, I guess, that then leads to the 110 basis points of sourcing savings that you got this quarter. Are there actions you can take on the sourcing front to accelerate the savings out of that? Are there other initiatives that you can accelerate to reduce the cost to try and further offset some of this inflation we're seeing out there in the market? Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: No. I mean, that's not what we're trying to do here. Let me just clarify a few things. So the 110 basis points that you're referring to, like I said in my remarks, is a combination of two enterprise initiatives, one around our 80/20 Front to Back Process, and the other one around projects, more strategic sourcing, structural savings that have nothing to do with price costs. And the point that we were trying to make is that if you were to include those more structural cost savings from a sourcing perspective in the price/cost equation, we would actually be positive. Now, that's not the way we report it. Other people may have reported that way, and so just for comparison purposes to make it easier we broke it out for you this quarter. But we are feeling very good about what we're doing here in terms of price/cost, and we're reporting EPS up 23%, up 17% for the year. There's no need to overreact and do a lot more than what we're doing today. E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: From a price/cost perspective. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: From a price cost standpoint, so. Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Quick one on tax. You repatriated the $1 billion. You're talking about repatriating another $1 billion. The $1 billion in the first quarter led to a tax credit. Is it possible you could get further tax credits for that? Was that specific to one country that maybe you brought cash back from? And then, I think, the guilty tax was one of the things you were waiting for clarification on. Have you got anything on that yet or still waiting? Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Yeah, there's no clarification on the so-called guilty tax. In terms of further repatriation, what happened in Q1 was very specific to where those funds came from. It's possible that there might be further discrete items as we go through the year, but that's all encompassed in the guidance that we're giving you today in terms of our tax rate and the midpoint of 25%. So that's what I would use for your model. Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks very much. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks a lot. Good morning. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Andy, good morning. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : I wanted to first go back to David's question on the organic guidance, and specifically on Polymers & Fluids. I'm just wondering if you could give a little more color on what's driving the organic reacceleration moving from flat to the 2% to 3%, because the back half comps look a little more challenging than, let's say, the second quarter. Is that all pricing? Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: That is a part of it. The other part is there is some seasonality related to the Automotive aftermarket business, and so that business was flat in the quarter, and typically based on historical run rates, including seasonal trends, we see an improvement in the Automotive aftermarket business. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks, Michael. And then if I could ask a little bit of a longer term question, stepping back from the quarter. In between the Investor Day and now you've had the tax reform change. Does that impact how you look at the longer-term total annual shareholder return at all? Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: I'd say the obvious one is the lower tax rate, obviously, is contributing 5 percentage points of EPS growth. So in terms of earnings growth and the associated cash that comes with that, that's certainly a positive. I think there's a broader question around being able to access global cash more easily on a go-forward basis. That certainly strengthens our balance sheet and provides more cash available in the U.S., including distribution to shareholders and then what you saw when we talked about in December, and then the plans that we accelerated last quarter around the significant increase in our dividend payout ratio from currently about 43% of free cash flow to 50% of free cash flow. You do the math on that, that's a sizable dividend increase that's coming subject to board approval in August. So those are just a couple of the big items here, but overall... E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Doesn't change the core strategy in terms of where we're going with the business nor how we allocate capital. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Right. Strategically, yeah, that's right, there's no change. There's certainly a lot of positives for shareholders. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi. Good morning. I guess two follow-up questions. One, some other industrial companies have pointed to increased labor costs or supplier constraints, sort of inefficiencies in the channel. Are you seeing any of that and has that impacted earnings in the quarter? And then my second question relates to, you highlighted the issue with auto build in the first quarter for your segment, but did any of that indirectly impact the weaker Auto? Did any of that indirectly impact the other segments? Because I do know you have some auto exposure in some of the other segments outside of Auto specifically. Thanks. E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Yeah. So on the second, nothing material that I could think of in terms of any bleed over from Auto into the other segments. And then from the standpoint of your first question, we are not experiencing any supply constraints. We're certainly keeping a closer eye on that, but from the standpoint of where we are today, we seem to be managing through that well. And I think the other question... Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: The labor cost. E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Yeah. I think we're \u2013 other than our normal annual pay raises, I think we're right in line with where we expected to be on that at this point. Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Thank you. I'll get back in queue. Operator : Our next question is from Joel Tiss with BMO. Your line is open. Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey, guys. E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Morning. Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States): A lot has already been asked, so I just wondered if you could spend a minute going through some of the pieces of the construction market. Just trying to get a sense of if there's any inflection point or anything changing from interest rates rising. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: No, we really haven't seen \u2013 we continue to see strong growth on the residential side, which includes our renovation/remodel business up in the high single digits, and looks really good for the balance of the year. Then the commercial side continues to be a little more lumpy and kind of flattish, and really no change in trend in either one of those. Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States): And then is there any way that you could give us more specifically in the $0.15 guidance increase, how much is from tax rate and lower share count or you just want to leave that fuzzy? Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: I'd rather leave it the way I said it. But basically the way I think about it is $0.05 is the Q1 beat, which certainly tax played a role. And then the balance is really a combination of currency is a little bit better, the share count is a little bit lower, you can do the math on that. It's the acceleration into Q1 of another $250 million, and the balance is really from the operating side and the confidence that we have that our teams will continue to execute on their plans for the year. Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States): All right. That's great. Thank you very much. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Next question comes from Steven Fisher with UBS. Your line is open. Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. Good morning. E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Morning. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Morning. Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC : On your Auto business, just wondering how you're thinking about the gap between your growth rate and the market over the next year or so. You are out-growing by 3 points in Q4. This quarter was about 2 points. I imagine there's probably some normal quarter-to-quarter variation there, but just wanted to see if you have any particular expectations about that degree of outgrowth over the next year or so. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Yeah, and nothing's really changed. Steve, I mean, it's an area, as you know, inside the company where we have great visibility to above-market growth. Historically, we've been in that 2 to 4 percentage point range. It can be. It can vary a little bit on a quarterly basis. For the year, we're saying 4% to 5% organic growth in automotive builds. Globally it's supposed to \u2013 expected to be up 2%. And that's really how we think about this on a long-term basis for the foreseeable future. Given the orders we took two/three years ago or longer, we expect to outgrow the market by 2 to 4 percentage points, so that hasn't changed. E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: And the new programs we have in the pipeline, which is significant. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Right. Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And then I wonder if you could just make sure I'm thinking about this correctly on your operating margin improvement expected during the year. I think you're looking for about 150 basis points of margin improvement year-over-year for the full year. And it sounds like Q2 is going to be similar to the 90 basis points you had in the first quarter, if I heard that correctly. And then, does that mean, though, with the price lag that you are anticipating benefiting you in the second half, you're looking for close to 200 basis points or so in the second half? Is that the right way to think about it? Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: No, not quite. So what I can tell you is that, Q1 is probably the low point in terms of operating margins. So typically, margins will go up in Q2 and Q3 from Q1. In terms of the enterprise initiatives, they come in on a pretty even 100 basis points a quarter. If you look at the organic growth guidance, we should get a decent volume leverage again Q2, Q3, Q4. And then we talk about price/cost and how that might change as we go through the year. And so those are the big pieces here that get you to the overall expected margin improvement, which, as you say, is more than 100 basis points for the full year. Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. So the acceleration, though, for the 90 basis points will be more in the second half than it is in the second quarter? E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: All-in, yes, because of price/cost. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Yeah. The drag on price/cost will be less in the second half than in the first half, all else \u2013 based on what we know today. Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. I'll follow-up. Thanks. Operator : Next question comes from Walter Liptak with Seaport Global. Your line is open. Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Good morning. Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC : Hoping to just ask a follow-on on the Food Equipment segment, and you called out the QSR business picking up. So it seems like after the last year or so that's a little bit of an inflection. I wonder if you could provide some color. Was it from international markets that picked up, or was it to the general market, or was it large QSR chains? Where did the business start to pick up? Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: That's a domestic number. Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC : Okay. But was it to the general market do you think, or was it to the larger chains? Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: So we typically don't break that out. I'm not sure I have that right in front of me. We typically don't do a lot with the really big players here for a number of reasons. E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: In terms of chains. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: In terms of chains, but quick serve overall was up double-digit for us in the quarter. Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC : Okay. Great. In this segment, foreign currency was a pretty big impact to the reported revenue number. Are you doing exports out of the U.S. or why is foreign currency such a... Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: No, the differences are really some businesses have more overseas sales than others. Food Equipment has, as you know, a big business overseas, and so they are seeing a little bit more impact than Welding, for example, which is where 80% of the business is North America. Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC : Okay. Got it. And if I could switch over to Electronics, the organic growth really strong here, but you kept the organic guide at 4% to 5%. Is there a lumpiness to this business? And, I guess, thinking about it in the light of some volatility in semiconductors this quarter and Samsung calling out some consumer electronics weakness, how you're thinking about second quarter and the back half? Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Yeah. No, orders and backlog look really good here. You just run into some tougher comps particularly in Q4 in that business, but there's nothing to suggest that on a run rate basis things are slowing down. Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC : Okay, great. And the margin pickup, that's 80/20 related and volume leverage? Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: That's right, yeah. Really strong execution on the initiatives, and then combined with the volume leverage. Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC : Okay, great. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Mig Dobre with Baird. Your line is open. Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks for fitting me in. Good morning. I want to go back to these pricing questions, follow-up on that. I know you have a pretty short cycle business, but I'm wondering how quickly and how often can you change pricing through the year, how many bites of the apple, if you would. And is there any way to differentiate between your segments vis-\u00e0-vis your flexibility in changing price in a given year? E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: There's no structural impediment. I think the environment is \u2013 I think Michael said it this way earlier. I think everybody knows it's pretty apparent if you are in a product that's using silicones or steel or a number of other commodities, there are some significant changes in input cost. I don't think there's any impediments. I would also point out that we are operating now only in spaces where the product performance really matters to the customer. So I think these are all actionable and reasonable actions to take from the perspective of not only our investors, but I would say from the marketplace and our customers. The issue is really, from the standpoint of some of the short-term impacts are really related to timing. We have relationships with a number of our customers, where we've agreed to either 60-day or 90-day. And I'm summarizing, Mig, over hundreds of different markets and customers, but there are things that we have to go through to implement these things that are just part of the process. But again, when we're talking about overall margins up 90 basis points in this kind of environment, I think the sum total of the enterprise initiatives, our ability to recover cost dollar-for-dollar, I think we're in good shape here. Based on what we know today baked into our guidance, we're pretty comfortable in terms of what we've got in there around price/cost. And if there are some additional downstream increases in costs that occur, we certainly have the ability to respond to those as they arise. And again, it'll have in some cases a similar month or two lag, but ultimately nothing that would present any sort of big game changing structural barriers to continue to perform the way we are expecting to perform this year. Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: I see. Really, the nature of my question was when I was thinking about this issue with other companies in my coverage, what I've heard is, hey, I can increase prices maybe once, twice a year, and if there is a mismatch in the meantime, I really have to work on the cost side. And I didn't know if that's kind of how you guys operated as well, and maybe this price/cost guidance that you provided contained a maybe more meaningful cost management on your part to address this than is fully appreciated at this point. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, it's a tough question to answer, Mig, because what we're talking about here is the roll-up from 85 divisions and hundreds of end markets and thousands of customers and pricing decisions being made. I think based on that roll-up and based on our strategy, we're very comfortable with where we're at on price/cost for the year and we'll be able to respond if things change, so. E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: But we're not limited to only two a year or something like that. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: No. Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it. Operator : Our last question comes from Joe O'Dea with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open. Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Hi. Good morning. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Good morning, Joe. Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC : First question on the international Welding side and seeing some stabilization maybe there. Is that a reflection of stabilization primarily in offshore? And with that, I mean, any confidence building that the bottom is kind of in there? Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: As you know, I mean, the bulk of our international business is oil and gas, and it's certainly encouraging after a pretty significant down cycle here that the business is starting to stabilize and we're not calling the bottom, but it certainly feels better than it has in prior quarters. E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: But it's not just offshore. It's oil and gas related more broadly. So I don't... Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Right. Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: I don't have in front of me what the offshore piece was specifically in the quarter, so I don't know that we can... Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Maybe a specific comment, but maybe you can follow-up with Karen. Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC : And then on Specialty, with the guidance, it looks like the lower organic growth in the quarter was more a blip and that you get right back on track. Any additional details around what was happening on the consumables side of the business within the quarter? Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: No, the business can be lumpy. I mean, we've seen this before. If you look at Q4, the business was up 5%, and then up 1% here in Q1. We can point to couple of specific things internally that should get better from here based on run rates and backlogs, but that's probably as much as I can give you. As you know, marginally we tweak the organic growth rate for the segment a little bit, but there's nothing really specific to point to. Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. And just last one for you on pricing and timing sensitivity here. Was pricing raised during the first quarter , or is it that those letters have gone out? Over the course of the second quarter, prices are going up, so you get partial realization, and then back half the anticipation of full realization? Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: All of the above. Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Yeah. Okay. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Some of all, yeah. Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Appreciate it. Lots of business. All right. Thanks a lot. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: All right. Thanks, Joe. E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Thank you. Karen A. Fletcher - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Okay. Since there aren't any further questions, I'd like to turn it over to Scott just to close the call out. E. Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Just want to say thanks to everybody for joining on the call. We are, as we have discussed, well-positioned as we look at the back half of the year and certainly expect to continue to execute and deliver on our now revised and updated guidance. And we'll talk to you after the end of Q2. Thank you. Karen A. Fletcher - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Great. If you have any follow-up, feel free to give me a call or email. Thanks, everybody.

Baird & Co. Ann Duignan - JPMorgan Chase & Co. Andrew Casey - Wells Fargo Securities Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company Jeffrey Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Operator : Welcome, and thank you for joining ITW's 2018 Second Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I will now turn the call over to Karen Fletcher, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin. Karen Fletcher : Thanks, Brandon. Good morning, and welcome to ITW's Second Quarter 2018 Conference Call. I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi; along with Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen. During today's call, we'll discuss second quarter financial results and update you on the outlook for the remainder of 2018. Before we get to the results, let me remind you that this presentation contains our financial forecast for the third quarter and full year 2018 as well as other forward-looking statements identified on this slide. We refer you to the company's 2017 Form 10-K and subsequently filed Form 10-Qs for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Also, this presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of those measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release. I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi. Scott? Scott Santi : Thank you, Karen, and good morning. ITW delivered another strong quarter, with revenue up 7% and organic growth of 4%. EPS of $1.97 was up 17% versus prior year and ahead of our expectations despite a $0.03 currency headwind versus the prior guidance. And that's a translation headwind. If you exclude the benefit from a legal settlement we received in the second quarter of last year, EPS was up 19% year-on-year. We delivered strong results on all key financial metrics, including operating income of $932 million, up 9%; operating margin of 24.3%, up 50 basis points; and after-tax ROIC at 28.7%, up 440 basis points. Underlying demand trends remained strong as evidenced by all 7 business segments in major geographies, delivering positive organic growth in the quarter. In particular, CapEx-related demand continued to spur strong organic growth in our Test & Measurement and Electronics and our Welding segments. And we saw improving growth momentum in Food Equipment, with growth 120 basis points higher sequentially versus Q1. Overall, the company delivered 4% organic growth despite 40 basis points of unfavorable impact from North American auto builds, which ended up being down 3% year-over-year versus an IHS forecast heading into the quarter that they would be up 3%. And in addition, we had 70 basis points of Product Line Simplification in the quarter. Michael will share more on -- more details a little later in the call. Overall, our teams are working to offset raw material cost increases on an ongoing basis, and through the first half, we have offset the impact of those raw material cost increases on a dollar-for-dollar basis. And we continue, despite the rising raw material cost environment, to expand margins.  Continued progress in implementing our Enterprise Initiatives contributed 110 basis points margin benefit in Q2 and in the first half as our business teams continued to apply our proprietary business model to deliver solid growth with best-in-class margins and returns. Looking ahead, we have adjusted our full year guidance to account for current foreign exchange rates, which, at the current levels, present roughly a 12% impact to the second half compared to the end of Q1 when we last updated guidance. We expect to deliver 15% EPS growth for the full year as we continue to execute well, accelerate organic growth and expand margins. We are well positioned to deliver continued strong results as we enter the second half of the year. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Michael for more detail on the quarter. Michael? Michael Larsen : Thanks, Scott. Organic revenue growth of 4% was up more than 100 basis points sequentially, and we're seeing good growth momentum across our business portfolio and in every major geography. Product Line Simplification in the quarter reduced organic growth by 70 basis points, and softer North American auto builds versus the industry forecast heading into the quarter was a 40 basis points drag on our overall organic growth rate. We add those back, we would have been right around 5% organic growth. By segment, Welding led the way as demand continued to accelerate, delivering 13% organic growth; followed by Test & Measurement and Electronics and Specialty both up 4%. Scott mentioned good sequential growth momentum in our Food Equipment business, and this was particularly evident in our North America foodservice equipment side with growth of 13% in Q2 following 7% in Q1 and a positive outlook for the second half. Earnings per share of $1.97 were $0.02 above the $1.95 midpoint of our guidance despite a $0.03 unfavorable currency translation impact. Operating margins was strong at 24.3%, up 50 basis points year-over-year, excluding the prior year legal settlement, and up 20 basis points sequentially. Free cash flow was really good at $533 million, up 38% versus prior year. And we repurchased 500 million of our shares this quarter for a total of $1 billion in the first half of 2018. Moving to Chart #4 and operating margin. Like I said, strong margin performance as operating margin continued to improve sequentially and year-over-year. Operating margin of 24.3% was up 50 basis points versus prior year when excluding last year's benefit from a legal settlement. Similar to Q1, strong execution by our teams of Enterprise Initiatives contributed 110 basis points of margin improvement. And volume leverage from higher organic growth added another 70 basis points in the quarter. Pricing actions continue across the company as we execute on our strategy to cover raw material cost inflation with price adjustments on a dollar-for-dollar basis. I'll cover this and tariffs in more detail on Slide 10. Finally, we continue to invest in CapEx and people to support and further accelerate our long-term growth strategies. These growth investments amounted to 60 basis points. Turning to Chart #5 for a look at our first half performance. We delivered strong performance with revenue up 7%, organic growth of 3% and earnings per share up 20%. All segments and major geographies contributed positive organic growth. Across the board, there was excellent operational execution with continued margin improvement as operating margin improved 70 basis points in the first half with Enterprise Initiatives, again, contributing 110 basis points. Pricing actions offset cost increases on a dollar-for-dollar basis. And we just completed the most profitable first half in the company's history and have really good growth and margin momentum heading into the second half. Let's move on to Chart #6 and segment performance. Table on the left summarizes organic growth by segment for first and second quarter. And you can see the good growth momentum we're building, with 5 out of 7 segments improving sequentially. Overall, organic growth was 4% in Q2, which, as I mentioned, includes PLS initiative impact of 70 basis points. We remain confident that we will deliver 3% to 4% organic growth in Q3 and for the full year based on current run rates. The table also shows segment operating margins for the first and second quarters with strong margin performance across the board as all segments improved sequentially, except auto where pricing actions take a little longer to take hold. Now moving to the right side of the chart and an overview of our Automotive business. Organic growth was 3%, up from 1% in Q1. Looking at the regions, our North America growth of 2% was 5 percentage points above builds, which were actually down 3% in the quarter. You'll remember that on our last earnings call, I shared that the Q2 North American build forecast from IHS was up 3%. Had North American builds been at the original forecast, our total segment growth rate would have been 1.5 percentage points higher, well above 4%. China organic growth continues to be very strong at plus 17%, 8 points above builds. And Europe was up 3%, 1 point below builds, mostly on mix and PLS in the region. Overall, in Automotive, PLS had roughly a 4 percentage point impact to organic growth in Q2. Finally, if you look across these 3 major regions, our weighted average penetration was about 250 basis points above the build rate. Margin expanded by 20 basis points, with Enterprise Initiatives and new product penetration offsetting cost inflation in the quarter. Looking ahead, we expect organic growth around 3% in the second half, with margins holding steady. Moving on to Chart #7. Food Equipment organic revenue was up 2%, and on a very positive note, we continue to see a strong recovery in institutional sales, particularly in education, as foodservice equipment sales were up 13% in the quarter, partially offset by decline in retail. Operating margin of 25.4% was up 80 basis points sequentially but down year-over-year due to slightly higher restructuring in Europe this quarter versus prior year and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by the benefits from Enterprise Initiatives. Price/cost did not have a significant margin impact in Food Equipment. Looking forward, we expect the Food Equipment segment to accelerate organic growth and expand margins in the second half. Test & Measurement and Electronics organic revenue was up 4%; once again, particularly strong performance driven by strong CapEx spending in Test & Measurement, which was up 7%. Electronics was flat this quarter, primarily due to timing of large equipment orders in electronic assembly. Operating margin improved by 160 basis points to 23.5%. Now Chart #8. Welding's organic growth rate continued to accelerate in Q2, and the backlog for the second half is looking very good. Organic growth was 13%, with global equipment up 15% and consumables up 11%. North America was up 17% with strong demand across all end markets, including oil and gas. Margin expanded by 210 basis points to 29.3%. Polymers & Fluids, organic growth was 1% and operating margin was essentially flat despite significant cost increases tied to chemicals, silicone and resins. Chart 9. Construction delivered 2% organic growth in the quarter with North American growth of 2%, European growth of 4% and flat in Asia Pacific. 6% growth in North America residential was partially offset by declining commercial construction where we were impacted by a onetime wedge anchor product issue. Excluding this issue, commercial construction was down 5%. This segment also had a 1 percentage point impact from PLS initiatives in the quarter. Specialty organic growth was up 4% this quarter, driven by strong equipment sales that were up 23%. Operating margin was essentially flat at 28.1%. Moving on to Chart #10 with an update on raw material costs and tariffs. As we've talked about before, we continue to execute our strategy to cover cost inflation with pricing actions on a dollar-for-dollar basis. We've done that year-to-date and expect to do the same in the second half. For perspective, full year projected cost inflation, including tariff impact, represents approximately 3% of our total spend. As many of you know, our model is to source and produce where we sell. And this approach helps significantly mitigate the risk associated with tariffs. By our estimate, the impact of tariffs represent about 10% to 15% of our total projected cost inflation in 2018. In addition, only 2% of ITW's material spend is sourced from China. Our \"produce where we sell\" model and the very limited cross-border movement of raw materials and products certainly helps mitigate the impact from tariffs. The bottom line for ITW is that the combination of continued progress on organic growth, which is underway right now, coupled with the strength and resiliency of our business model and our high-quality business portfolio and the excellent operation execution of our teams who are delivering over 100 basis points in Enterprise Initiatives, will drive continued margin expansion and strong earnings growth in 2018. Our guidance midpoint reflects margin expansion of about 80 basis points this year, following 70 basis points realized in the first half. Let's go to Chart #11 and 2018 guidance. As mentioned, we see strength in demand trends across our segments and continued strong margin expansion from Enterprise Initiatives with clear line of sight to projects and activities that will contribute at least another 100 basis points of margin improvement again this year. While we expect raw material cost inflation to continue to impact margins in the second half, we're confident that we will offset those cost increases with price actions on a dollar-for-dollar basis, so there is no negative impact to earnings. The price/cost impact to margin is reflected in our updated operating margin guidance of 24% to 25%. Again, this is strictly a margin percentage point impact, not an earnings impact. As we always do, we've updated guidance for foreign exchange rates as we sit here today, which has a $0.12 impact in the second half versus the exchange rates in place at the time we updated guidance at the end of last quarter. As a result, for the full year 2018, we're adjusting the EPS guidance midpoint by $0.10 and expect earnings in the range of $7.50 to $7.70 per share, which represents 15% EPS growth at the midpoint versus the $6.59 underlying earnings per share in 2017. On the top line, currency is expected to be a 1 percentage point impact in Q3 and Q4 versus prior year quarters. With respect to cash, we expect free cash flow conversion to be 100% of net income or better. Through the first half, we repurchased $1 billion of our shares and now expect to repurchase an additional $500 million in the second half. As a reminder, subject to board approval in August, we plan to significantly raise our dividend as we increase ITW's dividend payout ratio to 50% of free cash flow. Today, we're also providing guidance for Q3, a range of $1.80 to $1.90 per share versus $1.71 in the third quarter 2017. As a reminder, we had a $0.14 benefit in the third quarter last year from a legal settlement. Finally, we expect organic growth of 3% to 4% based on current run rates. So to wrap up, we continue to see positive underlying demand trends across our businesses. We're well positioned to continue to deliver strong margin expansion and earnings growth in 2018. On price/cost, we continue to execute well on an effective strategy and the impact is manageable. Our guidance today reflects solid organic growth with best-in-class margins and returns, including 15% year-over-year earnings growth and strong cash flows. All in, another strong year supported by our performance at the halfway mark and our confidence in ITW's ability to continue to execute at a high level through the balance of 2018. Karen, back to you. Karen Fletcher : Thanks, Michael. Brandon, let's go ahead and open up the lines for questions. Operator : And our first question is from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Andrew Kaplowitz : Scott or Michael, this question is going to be a bit nitpicky because we know that you have still very high margin, but it seems like there has just been a little more volatility in some of your segments' margins over the last couple quarters, arguably outside of price versus cost. So if you look at Food Equipment, you guys talked about it, but down 100 basis points year-over-year this quarter after being down last quarter. And at the company level, you cited 60 basis points of growth, investments, other, which you said was an investment in people but maybe a surprise, at least to us. You did mention more PLS in Food Equipment. Are you having to do more PLS than you thought or the investment in people you've mentioned at the company as a whole? And do you think this increased level of noise will diminish moving forward? Michael Larsen : So there was a lot there, Andy, but I think the bottom line is that we are very close to executing the plan that we laid out at the beginning of the year. Really, the only delta that's meaningful is the price/cost equation, and that's just the margin percentage impact that we talked about. In terms of overall organic growth, margin expansion from Enterprise Initiatives continue in every segment. They're broad-based. We're not done on the Enterprise Initiatives. More to come in the second half and beyond that. So you're pointing out Food Equipment. Like I mentioned, we had slightly higher restructuring in Europe here in the quarter, about 40 basis points. And the balance really is a product mix item in Q2. But like we also said, in Food Equipment specifically, we expect, just based on the orders, the run rate, continued progress here in the back half on organic growth as well as margin expansion. On PLS, we are running at about 70 basis points here in Q2, similar to what we did in Q1. And as you know, that is completely consistent with the way we run our businesses and are really an integral part of our 80/20 operating system. And very briefly, what it does is positions us for continued acceleration in organic growth with better margins and returns. So it's absolutely the right thing to do for a little bit of headwind on the top line here in the short term. Andrew Kaplowitz : Michael, could I just have you clarify the 60 basis points of growth investment still? Was that sort of in the plan? And you talked about adding people, where are you adding people or at least you said investment in people? Michael Larsen : Yes. So we've seen, if you look at the details, an increase in overall levels of investment really to support and further accelerate the organic growth rate. You've seen that now 4 years in a row. We're making progress on the organic growth rate up 4% here in Q2. So a portion of it is CapEx-related as well as new products. And then people is really investment in talent that can support everything we need to do to further accelerate our organic growth rate as well as continue to execute well on our Enterprise Initiatives. Andrew Kaplowitz : Got it. If I could just shift gears briefly and ask you about organic growth. Last quarter, you said that you thought all of your segments would have better organic growth in Q2 than Q1. We see Test & Measurement and Construction had a little bit lower organic growth. I think you explained Construction well with the commercial construction issue in the quarter. In Test & Measurement, looks like Electronics slowed down a bit. So maybe you can talk about that segment in particular. Michael Larsen : It's really not that significant, Andy. I mean, we -- Electronics business was flat in the quarter, really based on some timing, as I think I mentioned, on some large equipment orders. If you were to adjust for that, that's -- Electronics would have been up 4%. And then the Construction item I talked about, if you adjust for that, the Construction business would have been up in that 3% to 4% range. Andrew Kaplowitz : So no changes to either segment for the year in terms of overall balance, would you say? Michael Larsen : They're all, I'd say, pretty close. We talked about Automotive. We have a fairly, hopefully, conservative assumption here at 3% for the balance of the year. And then we continue to see acceleration in Welding and, hopefully, some good progress also on Food Equipment. Operator : Our next question is from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joseph Ritchie : So my first question, maybe just focusing on the growth investments again. I just want to understand that a little bit better. I guess if -- you guys have obviously done a great job the last few years driving strong margin expansion, good cost control. I guess the -- if you look at this line item, I think some folks will say perhaps you guys got too close to the bone and now have to reinvest in either people or CapEx. So maybe talk about that a little bit on your -- where you think you are today from a growth perspective and the investment that you need to make in the second half of the year and maybe even into 2019. Michael Larsen : Yes, Joe, nothing -- if you look back over the last 5 years, we have continued to invest in organic growth and everything that we need to do to support an acceleration in our organic growth rates. So there's really nothing significantly different. We are seeing a -- an increase in our CapEx spend here really to support our customers, which were growing at a fairly rapid rate. So I -- and if you look at it, 60 basis points is not really that meaningful, that big a number on a dollar basis. It just happens to be something that we call out here on the margin walk. Scott Santi : Well, and what I would add is that we have -- we're trying to be more transparent in terms of how we're investing in growth. This is not a new item this quarter. This is something we've been doing for the last 5 years. The presentation is a little different, but ultimately, these investments had been ongoing for the last 5 years. They're embedded, and when we talk about 35% long-term incrementals, those growth investments are embedded in that number. So it is not a new item that just happened this quarter. These investments have been going on for the last 5 years. We've changed the presentation a bit just to reflect, given some of what we heard about, \"Are you investing enough in growth given the kind of margin and progress that you've made over the last 5 years?\" So these are -- this isn't a new item. This is -- these are investments that have been taking place consistently over the last 5 years. Joseph Ritchie : Got it. That's helpful clarification, Scott. If I can maybe turn the conversation a little bit to organic growth and specifically just focus on Auto for a second. I know you've got 3% baked in for the back half. But I think this is the first quarter we've seen you guys actually under-pace global auto builds. And so maybe just talk a little bit more about what happened there specifically this quarter, that would be helpful. Michael Larsen : Yes, it's pretty straightforward. I mean, the global build number includes geographies where we do not have a presence or do not have a significant presence. So if you look at places like Brazil, India, even in Japan, for example. So the right way to look at this is really on a geographic basis, which is the way we laid it out in the slides and described it. And you can see North America, up 5 points of penetration gains there; in China, 8 points; Europe, some mix, and PLS activities there were slightly below. And like I said, on a weighted average basis, we are at 250 basis points, in that 2 to 4 percentage point range that we've been in for the last 4, 5 years. And based on all the projects that we booked already, we expect to remain in that range in the future. Joseph Ritchie : Okay. And, Michael, maybe one last one. The share buyback and the repatriation, I may have missed it, but did you guys give an update on how far along you are with repatriating the $2 billion that you expected this year? Michael Larsen : Yes. So we made some really good progress. We are slightly above $2 billion year-to-date and ahead of schedule. So the obvious question is, how are you going to allocate that repatriation, those cash -- those funds that have been repatriated, the little over $2 billion. So we've reduced our short-term debt about $900 million. Our share repurchases, we just took it up, the target for the year, by $500 million. We've got a dividend increase coming. If you pencil that out, that's about a $200 million increase for the year. And then we have slightly more cash on hand here in the near term. And as you know, we have some maturities coming up in the first half of '19. So really good progress. I'm very pleased with the fact that we were able to accelerate those plans and bring the funds back to the U.S. Operator : Our next question is from Ross Gilardi with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Ross Gilardi : I'm just trying to understand the reduction to the margin outlook a little bit better. I mean, you seem to be moving forward on the Enterprise Initiatives and you continue to say you'll offset raw material costs dollar-for-dollar. So what has actually changed on a margin standpoint? Michael Larsen : Well, I think we're through the first half here, and we are updating the margin guidance now for our current view of how price/cost, again, only from a margin percentage standpoint, will impact our overall operating margins for the year. It's -- again, it's not an impact to EPS, which does not what -- you're not seeing that, you're not hearing that from us today. It's purely just a reflection of what we've seen year-to-date on price/cost and our expectations for the balance of the year. I want to just point out, we're still -- year-to-date, we've expanded margins 70 basis points for the full year. With our updated guidance here, we expect at the midpoint to expand margins 80 basis points. So that's really the only driver here, Ross. Ross Gilardi : Okay. So just to be clear, the reduction to the margin outlook is purely -- is for price/cost. The reduction to the EPS outlook is for FX. Michael Larsen : That is correct. Scott Santi : Correct. Ross Gilardi : Okay. And just back on autos. I mean, are you seeing any signs of disruption? I mean, obviously, Daimler was complaining about the trade war already having an impact on U.S. auto exports to China. And you've seen some other announcements from various auto companies. Anything going on there that you feel like is impacting your business? And can you clarify a little bit more about these tariffs making up 10% to 15% of your raw material inflation? Where specifically in the portfolio is that showing up? Michael Larsen : Yes. So I think, Ross, the short answer to your question is we've not seen anything with our customers. It might be a little too early to tell. There's still some movement around what these tariffs may or may not be and for how long they may be in place. So and again, we are a \"produce where we sell\" company, and the impact from tariffs is significantly mitigated by that. In terms of the overall tariff impact, it's -- as a result of that, fairly small, 10% to 15% of what we project for the full year will come from tariffs. The majority of that is really related to metals, so steel and aluminum, which was the first round of tariffs. And then the China tariffs will pretty -- I'd say pretty broad-based across the portfolio but pretty small impact overall from that -- from the Section 301 tariffs. Operator : Our next question is from David Raso with Evercore ISI. David Raso : Maybe I missed it, the price/cost drag on margins, what is the number now for the year? And then also if you can give us some insight on 3Q and 4Q. Michael Larsen : Yes. We're in that -- consistent with the first half, 60 to 70 basis points range is what we're projecting at this point. David Raso : For each quarter? Scott Santi : And that's the 3% price recovery on the 3% in place. Michael Larsen : Correct. Scott Santi : So little margin... David Raso : But again, the cadence is similar? Third quarter, fourth quarter year-over-year drag is similar for both [indiscernible]... Michael Larsen : Yes, it's similar. You could -- yes, it's the same assumption for Q3 and for Q4. David Raso : The reason I ask, when I try to get to the EPS for the third quarter, the fourth quarter, you seem to be implying for the third quarter the operating margins, even adjusting for the year-ago legal settlement, the margins are flattish to down a bit. But you then need, for the fourth quarter, margins to grow over 100 basis points. And I do see the organic implied is a little faster in the fourth quarter, about 4%; third quarter, 3.5%. So maybe that explains it. But I was kind of hoping to hear on -- maybe making the guide seem easier, that the third quarter drag on price/cost was greater in the fourth quarter. There's some relief, right, some of the pricing actions take hold and the margin drag becomes a lot less. If that's not the case, can you explain why the margins in the third quarter were flat to down, but fourth quarter, they pop back up year-over-year? Michael Larsen : Yes. So we don't give margin guidance for Q3 and Q4, but the price/cost impact is modeled or estimated to be the same in Q3 and Q4. The big delta -- and I don't -- not knowing your model specifically, and so what you have to factor in is really currency. So if you look at the impact from currency in the second half of the year is negative on a year-over-year basis versus being positive in the first half. So I don't know how you've updated your model for that, but that's really the main driver here in the back half of the year. David Raso : Okay. We can take it offline. And on Auto, when you gave the second half organic, at least the quick numbers that I ran, it implies the full year organic went down about 200 basis points. But the offsets, the other segments, the -- I mean, I would assume Welding was a big piece of it. But to make up for the 200 bps lower on Auto, I mean, ideally, if you can give us like you gave us that for the first quarter, maybe a full year organic sales number for each segment, how you're thinking about it or just... Michael Larsen : Yes. So I'm not sure I can do that for you, David. But like I said, I think we adjusted the outlook for Auto. I think we've seen the IHS forecast may not be the most -- haven't been the most reliable data point year-to-date. And so we've put in a 3% growth rate for the back half for Auto. The acceleration really is Welding, and then like I mentioned, some improvement in Food Equipment. Those are the big ones. There's a couple of other puts and takes here, but that's really the -- those are the big drivers. Operator : Our next question is from Steve Volkmann with Jefferies. Stephen Volkmann : Maybe just a couple of clarifications. The -- Michael, the PLS headwind in the second half same as first half. And the cadence question as well is sort of 3Q, 4Q the same? Michael Larsen : Yes. I would -- the same for the second half as the first half, so right around 70 basis points. Stephen Volkmann : And again, 3Q, 4Q pretty similar? Michael Larsen : Yes. Stephen Volkmann : Okay, great. And then just with respect to the remaining $500 million of repo, is that -- should we spread that evenly over the third and fourth quarters? Michael Larsen : I think from a planning perspective, that's probably a good way to do it. Stephen Volkmann : Okay. And then my final one, just quickly again, is on this price/cost thing. Is it your goal to just cover the dollar-for-dollar and leave it at that? Or do we think there will come a point once all the pricing is kind of through the system and everything kind of renormalizes, say, 2019, will you get back the margin as well as the dollars? Or do we just leave it at the dollars and move on? Michael Larsen : No, I think you're raising a really good point. In the near term, what we're doing is covering dollar-for-dollar. But eventually, when we get ahead of this, this will be a positive to margins at some point. When -- we're always operating a little bit of a lag here. We see the cost increases come through. We react on pricing. And we're still, I would say, in a little bit of a catch-up mode, but we will absolutely get ahead of costs here at some point. Scott Santi : There's roughly a one-quarter lag on average in terms of cost versus price response. Michael Larsen : Right. Scott Santi : And so the dollar-for-dollar, if I can say it a slightly different way, that coverage is factoring in that lag. So we're still able to cover -- minimize the EPS impact in the near term. But should the cost increases stop tomorrow, then those pricing actions will continue to carry through and have a positive impact beyond the dollar-for-dollar. Michael Larsen : Correct, yes. Operator : Our next question is from Mig Dobre with Baird. Mircea Dobre : Just looking to clarify a comment you made on Food. As I understood it, it was Welding and Food organic expectations that ticked up to offset Auto. And I guess I'm wondering here what the thinking is because your prior guidance talked about 2% to 3% growth. Even towards the low end of your full year guidance, that would imply pretty significant acceleration in the back half versus what you've done in the front half of this year. Is there enough in your backlog or visibility to where we could be thinking that this -- that, that can grow north of 4% organically in the back half? Michael Larsen : Are you talking about Food Equipment? Mircea Dobre : Yes, I am. Michael Larsen : Yes. So we've got a number of things going on there. One is you saw the acceleration on the institutional side and the really strong backlog going into the second half as well as you're going to get some benefits from pricing and a number of new product launches in the back half of the year. Mircea Dobre : Okay. So this is more sort of internally driven rather than end market-driven, that's what you're saying. Michael Larsen : Well, I think the foodservice side is certainly improving. We don't expect the retail side to improve. And then if you just look at the comps on a year-over-year basis, they also are going to be a tailwind here in the second half. Mircea Dobre : Okay. And then if I may go back to this question on growth investments that you've broken out in \\guidance. Obviously, a new way to present this, but I guess, from my standpoint, when I'm looking at this bridge here, you typically talk about Enterprise Initiatives as well as volume, price/cost and so on. I'm looking at this and I'm interpreting this as incremental investments that are essentially offsetting Enterprise Initiatives at this point. If that's wrong, why is it wrong? And what should we expect for this growth investment drag to be going forward? Michael Larsen : So first of all, I wouldn't necessarily extrapolate from Q2 and assume that we're going to have 60 basis points every quarter going forward. I do -- I think Scott explained very well why we're calling it out. But it also would not be a good assumption to think that the 60 basis points offset the Enterprise Initiatives. So I think really the way to think about this is unchanged relative to what we've done in prior years, which is core incrementals in a normal macro environment in that 35% range, plus the Enterprise Initiatives on top of that. That's really the way to think about this. And that's how you -- that really supports what we've been saying for a while now is that we expect margins to continue to improve from here. Mircea Dobre : But if that is the case and growth was included in Enterprise Initiatives previously -- I don't know. To me, as I read this table, something seems to be materially different, and I guess I'll just leave it at that. Michael Larsen : Well, we can take it offline. I don't think you're interpreting what we're saying and what's on the chart correctly. Operator : Our next question is from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Ann Duignan : Can we talk a little bit more about the negative mix in your PLS model that you mentioned? What specifically is that? And how should we think about that toward the back half of this year? Michael Larsen : Well, that's really mixed with -- at this point, it becomes in terms of -- by OEM as well as by model. And so I would not read too much into that. There was -- again, it's one quarter. If you look at it historically, these penetration numbers can move around quite a bit, depending on when models kind of roll off and when new models kick in. The main driver here in terms of being slightly below the builds was really the PLS work that the team is doing. Ann Duignan : Okay. So it's not, as we might appear, the loss of a platform or the loss of an OEM customer? Scott Santi : No. The penetrate -- obviously, as what Michael said, the penetration numbers on a quarter -- 1-quarter basis are not good gauges. The annual numbers absolutely are. And what -- we will continue to deliver penetration gains in Europe on a full year basis this year. But things do jump around, as Michael said, in a quarter based on when a model is going up, when a new model is being launched and some of the supply chain work behind the scenes that goes on in preparing for that. Ann Duignan : Sure. I appreciate that. And then another point of clarification. On the commercial construction side, I think you said you had a product issue. Can you talk about that and what that means and what the outlook is for the commercial construction side for the back half? Michael Larsen : Yes. So commercial construction has kind of been flattish for a while now. We were down slightly, I think I said down 5%. When you exclude this onetime event, really limited to North America with our wedge anchor product resulting in some returns, if you adjust for that onetime event here in the quarter, Construction would have been up 3% in commercial. Ann Duignan : Okay. And then the wedge anchor problems, can you talk about those? It's sort of uncharacteristic for ITW to have quality issues, but [indiscernible]. Michael Larsen : Yes, I know. We had some inaccurate labeling on the packaging, and we had to correct for that. Ann Duignan : Okay. So not a product quality issue? Michael Larsen : No. Operator : Our next question is from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo Securities. Andrew Casey : On Auto OEM, you mentioned second half expected to be 3% organic growth. Could you help us understand how you may be treating the impact of what appeared to be a North American supply chain disruption, not for you specifically but would have impacted some of your customers? I'm wondering how you're treating that in the outlook. Are you just extrapolating Q2 as is? Or are you including... Michael Larsen : No. Yes, we have -- so you're right. There were some issues in Q1 that we talked about last time. There were some issues in Q2. Not specific to us, and that may be one of the reasons why the IHS forecast was off. IHS calls for North America specifically for significantly higher growth here in Q3 and Q4. We took a conservative approach here and risk-adjusted those numbers and put in a 3% growth rate for Automotive in the back half. Hopefully, that turns out to be a conservative assumption, but that's kind of what we have in our guidance today. Andrew Casey : Okay. And then I guess another round at the growth investments. You mentioned CapEx comments. Are you seeing any market segments where production may have been constrained and may offer restock opportunities in the future? I'm just trying to understand the CapEx part of it. Michael Larsen : No. I think it's just part of our -- as these businesses grow, we continue to invest in CapEx. We've done that for 5 years and even beyond that. I mean, typically, CapEx for us as a percentage of sales is right around 2%. And as sales grow, the CapEx numbers go up, and that's really all that you're seeing here. Again, this is to continue to support our customers with best-in-class quality and service on a global basis. And I really wouldn't read as much into it as the time we spent on it today. Andrew Casey : Okay. And then one last one on it. You mentioned -- or you cautioned against extrapolating the 60 basis points. Was that more lumpy in the quarter than what you'll be seeing in the second half? Michael Larsen : On the growth investments? Yes, I think this can be a little circumstantial to the quarter. I think we will continue to lean in on these investments that we need to make to further support and accelerate organic growth as well as continue to expand margins, core margins in our businesses. So this is ongoing. I think we called it out this time. And given the reaction today, we may not call it out in the future. We'll have to see. But this is an ongoing thing. It's not a response to anything specific. We are fully invested here. We're fortunate that even these investments -- by fully funding every good project inside the company, they only consume 25% of our operating cash flow. So we're not constrained. We'll continue to invest. And we wanted to highlight that today, and that's what you're seeing on that side. Operator : Our next question is from Steven Fisher with UBS. Steven Fisher : When I look at the European auto build outperformance of your business versus the market, it's really been moderating since the -- going back to the second quarter of last year with obviously the flip to negative this quarter. So has that been mix in that trend down all along for the last year? And then what kind of gives you the visibility to that inflecting back positively in the second half? Michael Larsen : Well, I think in Automotive, and this is not a European comment, this is a global comment, we are fortunate that we have visibility 2.5, 3 years out based on the projects we've sold already. So we know what our content per vehicle growth is going to be on new model launches. We know what's rolling off. There can be some mix as these 2, those are the big variables, kind of play out, but we're highly confident that we'll continue to outperform in Europe and on a global basis in that 2 to 4 percentage point range above the global auto build numbers. And that's really on -- the way to look at this is what Scott said is really on an annual basis. On a quarterly basis, it can move around a little bit. But absolutely nothing has changed in terms of our confidence in our visibility to continue to do that on a go-forward basis. Steven Fisher : But that outperformance is basically 0 for the first half, so the second half would have to inflect positively. It sounds like you do have that visibility in Europe right now? Michael Larsen : Well, again, I mean, we can talk about Europe offline. I mean, I think if you look at this on a global basis, we had 2 percentage points of penetration in the first quarter. We just did 2.5% above the weighted average, and nothing has changed. Steven Fisher : Okay. And then shifting over to the commercial construction, just to make sure I heard all the numbers right. The minus 5% on commercial, that was excluding the anchor wedge product issue? Michael Larsen : Yes. We would have been down 15% -- we're down 15%. We would have been 5% if it wasn't for this onetime item. Steven Fisher : Okay. And I think it was down 2% in the first quarter. So where generally are you seeing sort of incremental weakness? Or is that just a comparison issue between Q1 and Q2 year-over-year? Michael Larsen : I would think that's really more of a rounding issue. Commercial is about 20% of our Construction business. And the performance of that segment is really driven much more by the continued growth on the residential and the renovation side. Scott Santi : Of the Construction business, not the commercial. Steven Fisher : Okay. So maybe just one quick clarification. Did your short-term debt go up a lot in the quarter? And I thought you said when you were talking about repatriation, you were talking about reducing short-term debt. Michael Larsen : Yes, that's correct. So that's a reclassification of the maturities that I talked about that are coming due in the first half of '19. So we have some March and April maturities, $1.35 billion. And that -- because we're within 12 months, that slips into the short-term debt category, that's why. If you look at the long-term debt, we're down by the same number. Operator : Our next question is from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Nicole DeBlase : So I guess just first question around the price/cost issue. If you could kind of talk a little bit about from a segment perspective where that has the most impact. I know you kind of said it's not happening -- or it's not a significant issue within Food Equipment, but it would be helpful to know where it is. Michael Larsen : Yes. So the largest impact is really in the Automotive segment where it can take a little bit longer for price actions, new products to offset those cost increases. Everywhere else, we're positive on a year-to-date basis. Nicole DeBlase : Okay, got it. That's really helpful. And then the other question. Just looking at Welding margins, the incrementals were really strong this quarter. I think they were like 44%, clearly above what you tend to target. Just thinking about like the outlook into the second half of the year, is that level of margin expansion or incrementals sustainable into the second half? And I guess a little bit of just what's driving the strength. Michael Larsen : Yes. No, I think this is frankly typical for what we're seeing in Welding with this type of organic growth. So those are -- that's a reasonable assumption for incrementals for the back half of the year. Operator : Our next question is from Nathan Jones with Stifel. Nathan Jones : A bit of a more philosophical question on the impact of some of the -- all the uncertainty in trade and that kind of thing. I would have thought you guys would maybe start seeing some impact on your customers' CapEx spending as all of this uncertainty weighs on their investment decisions. Maybe that led to some of the under build in Auto OEM. Instron was still pretty good. Just any kind of commentary you guys have, what you're hearing out there in the market in terms of, are customers still confident in the economic outlook here? Are you seeing any kind of weakening in just the way people are thinking about the economy going forward? Michael Larsen : No, we've not seen that, Nathan. I mean, I think if you look at the segments most exposed to business investment, CapEx cycle, Welding, Test & Measurement, we continue to see. And the equipment side of Specialty continued to see accelerating demand. So we have not seen any impact from a demand standpoint. Nathan Jones : Polymers & Fluids and Specialty Products both seem to have relatively flat kind of margins here. I figure there's probably a bit more oil impacting that. Is that something that you should be -- we should be expecting to see a little improvement in that as you catch up a bit more in pricing with the, I guess, more recent history of cost increases going through there? Michael Larsen : I think in the near term, there certainly, as you point out, some chemicals, so silicones, specifically resins, are putting some pressure on. But as -- once we work through that, those segments are going to continue to expand margins. Nathan Jones : Okay. And then just one housekeeping one. You had the other income line pick up fairly significantly in this quarter. Can you talk about what drove that up? And do you forecast the number for that in your model? Or is it just a 0 in your guidance? Michael Larsen : Well, there's always some puts and takes. I mean, it can move around a little bit on a quarterly basis. The majority of what's in that bucket is really interest income. And so linked to some of the repatriation we talked about, we saw a pretty significant increase in the other income bucket. We do include an assumption in the guidance, and we also do for the back half, which is right around current levels. But like I said, it can move around a little bit on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Operator : Our last question is from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Jeffrey Sprague : Just a couple of things here. First, just on Welding. I'd love to get a little more color there. I guess no good deed goes unpunished, right? You talked about Welding today. But if you could give us a little bit of color on where you're seeing the most strength and if there's any indication that customers are perhaps pre-buying. And I ask that in the spirit, Lincoln, for example, has raised price 3 times in the last 6 or 7 months, right? We're chasing price up pretty rapidly in this business. Do you see any unusual customer behavior in the channel as a result of that? Michael Larsen : We really haven't. I mean, I think to give you a little bit more color, overall, Welding up 13%, with Equipment up 15%, Consumables moving up double-digit. And then North America is really the key driver of the business, which represents 80% of our sales. We talked about the industrial side before, so that would be heavy equipment, auto up really strong, more than 20%, and the commercial side continues in the high single digits this quarter. I know you're a big offshore guy. We have not seen a pickup in offshore, but overall, oil and gas was up 7% here in the quarter, which is certainly encouraging. Jeffrey Sprague : Great, that's helpful. And then just on Auto real quick. With this European testing logjam, I'm not sure if you're familiar with that, but the WLTP, do you see any disproportionate negative seasonality in your Auto business in Q3 as part of your back half guide? Michael Larsen : In Europe specifically? Jeffrey Sprague : In Europe specifically, yes. Michael Larsen : Yes, no, we have not seen that. Jeffrey Sprague : And then just one last one for me. Just on the Test & Measurement/Electronics, maybe Electronics a little bit more specifically. There is a lot of pressure and noise in just kind of the whole electronics supply chain, semi CapEx, et cetera, particularly rippling through Asia. Do you have visibility on what the back half looks like in that business? Maybe a little extra color there would be helpful. Michael Larsen : Yes. I think the -- for Electronics, the back half looks good, similar to what we were seeing in the first half. We do have a little bit of semi exposure in that business, which may be going through a little bit of a slowdown in the near term but then is expected to pick back up in Q4. Not enough to really move the needle for us, but overall, the team feels really good going into the second half here. Karen Fletcher : Okay. I think that brings us to the top of the hour. Thanks, everybody. And if you have follow-up questions, I'm available. That concludes our call. Michael Larsen : All right. Thanks, everybody.

LLC Operator : Hello, and welcome to ITW's 2018 Third Quarter Earnings Call. My name is Ian and I will be your event specialist today. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. Please note that today's conference is being recorded. At the end of today's presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session It is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Karen Fletcher, Vice President of Investor Relations. Karen, the floor is yours. Karen A. Fletcher - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Okay. Thank you, Ian. Good morning and welcome to ITW's third quarter 2018 conference call. I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi; along with Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen. During today's call, we will discuss third quarter financial results and provide guidance for the fourth quarter. Slide number 2 is a reminder that this presentation contains our financial forecast for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 as well as other forward-looking statements identified on this slide. We refer you to the company's 2017 Form 10-K and subsequently filed Form 10-Qs for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Also, this presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures and a reconciliation of those measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release. Turning to slide 3. Today, we're announcing the date and location for ITW's Investor Day. We hope you can join us on Friday, December 7 in New York City, at which time we'll provide updates on our long-term strategy as well as guidance for 2019. If you plan to attend, we ask that you please register on our Investor website. Moving on to slide 4, as a reminder, in the third quarter of 2017, we disclosed an $80 million favorable legal settlement. This table summarizes key financial measures on a GAAP basis and on an adjusted basis that excludes the legal settlement. Going forward, in our presentation this morning, our comments and variances exclude the legal settlement. I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi. Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Thanks, Karen, and good morning, everyone. The ITW team delivered a solid quarter with 11% earnings growth and EPS at the high end of our guidance range. We improved operating margin by 30 basis points to 24.6% and increased free cash flow by 17%. In the quarter, pricing actions more than offset material cost inflation on a dollar-for-dollar basis and price/cost-related margin percentage dilution showed sequential improvement versus the second quarter. In Q3, we delivered on our earnings commitment with top-tier margins and returns despite more challenging end-market conditions than we anticipated as we headed into the quarter in a few places. North America remained solid with 4% organic growth, while demand in international markets was mixed as auto production in Europe and China and demand levels in several international markets served by our Specialty Products and Polymers & Fluids segments softened. Michael will walk you through the details in a few minutes, but at a high level, the pullback in auto production in Europe and China and the softening that we saw in the two segments I mentioned internationally negatively impacted the company's overall organic growth rate by approximately 2 percentage points in Q3 versus what it would have been had demand in those sectors stayed even the second quarter run rates. In addition, and as expected, ongoing Product Line Simplification activities reduced organic growth by 70 basis points in the quarter. Our proprietary business model continues to generate strong free cash flow with 116% conversion in the quarter, supporting our ability to raise our dividend 28% to an annualized $4 a share and repurchased $500 million of our shares in the third quarter. While we expect that near-term market challenges will continue in the fourth quarter, we're narrowing our guidance range and reaffirming the midpoint of our 2018 EPS guidance at $7.60 per share, which represents 15% growth. Our ability to deliver consistent strong results across a wide range of economic and end-market scenarios is a direct reflection of the resilience of our high-quality diversified business portfolio, the strength of ITW's proprietary business model and our team's focused execution of ITW's long-term strategy. Before I turn the call over to Michael to provide more detail on the quarter, I'd like to again thank our more than 50,000 ITW colleagues around the world for their efforts in executing our strategy and serving our customers with excellence each and every day. Michael, over to you? Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Thanks, Scott. Let's recap some of the highlights on slide 5. Year-over-year earnings growth in the quarter was 11% or 13%, excluding $0.03 of unfavorable currency translation impact. Despite the more challenging end-market conditions in a few places that Scott talked about, we delivered earnings per share of $1.90, at the high end of our guidance range. Organic revenue growth increased a solid 4% in North America, offset by a 1% decline in Europe and a 2% decline in Asia-Pacific. China was down 2% in the quarter, but we remain on track for mid-single-digit growth in 2018 after being up 13% last year. Operating margin was 24.6%, an improvement of 30 basis points year-over-year and versus the second quarter. I will go into more detail on margin on the next slide. After-tax return on invested capital was 28%, an improvement of 400 basis points, resulting primarily from the new U.S. tax rules and regulations. Effective tax rate in the quarter was 23.7% due to a net discrete tax benefit of $15 million in the quarter. Free cash flow was strong at $743 million, an increase of 17%, and in the quarter, we repurchased $500 million of our shares and raised our annual dividend 28%. Moving to slide 6 and our operating margin. Operating margin at 24.6% was a new record when you exclude the favorable legal settlement last year. Our strong execution on Enterprise Initiatives continue to contribute in a meaningful way with 100 basis points in the quarter. Our price actions are catching up to raw material cost inflation as price/cost margin dilution impact in the third quarter improved to 60 basis points from 70 basis points in the second quarter. And in addition, price more than offset raw material costs on a dollar-for-dollar basis this quarter. The other line includes a numbers of puts and takes, year-over-year including some growth investment impact and is in line with our normal run rate this quarter as a 30 basis point impact to margin. All-in, operating margin expanded by 30 basis points in the quarter to 24.6%. I'm going to spend some time on the left side of slide 7 to provide additional color on the organic growth performance relative to our expectations heading into the third quarter. It comes down to three key drivers, all of them related to international end-markets that collectively reduced our organic growth rate by 2 percentage points. The first one is our international Automotive OEM business as both European and Chinese auto production came in lower than expected. European auto production declined 5% in the quarter, following 4% growth in the second quarter. Based on what we're hearing, this was due primarily to the new emission regulations that went into effect in the quarter and lower exports to China. Overall, this change in builds led to a 6% decline in our auto business in Europe, following 3% growth in the second quarter. Auto production in China was down 4%, following 11% growth in the second quarter. This change appears to be more related to overall consumer sentiment and the availability of financing. As a result, our China business, which was up 12% in the first half, was flat. We experienced some softness in a few international end markets served by our Polymers & Fluids segment. Specifically in Europe, additives for automotive aftermarket and reagents experienced lower demand, as did our Polymers & Fluids division in Brazil. Overall, the international component of our Polymers & Fluids segment declined 5% in Q3 in contrast with our North American business, which was up a solid 3%. Finally, the international component of our Specialty Products segment was down 7% after being down 2% in Q2. There were significant PLS activities this quarter in addition to demand declines versus Q2 levels in three divisions; marking and coding, graphics primarily for sports apparel, and appliance components. That said, as you can see from the left of the slide, there were some bright spots too internationally. Welding accelerated to 12% growth with a solid recovery in oil and gas, after 1% growth in Q2. Test & Measurement and Electronics and Food Equipment, both had sequential organic growth increases of 2 full percentage points. Let's walk through each segment for additional color, starting with Automotive OEM on the right side of the slide. Overall, organic growth was flat with builds down about 3% for North America, Europe and China combined. North America was strong, up 7%, 5 percentage points ahead of builds with solid penetration gains. As I mentioned, Europe was down 6%, in line with builds, and China was flat versus builds down 4%. We continue to generate solid penetration gains with European Auto OEM customers. However, inventory reductions to adjust for lower forecasted build rates offset these penetration gains, resulting in our revenues essentially declining in line with European auto rates in Q3. Despite some of the price challenges in the Automotive segment that we've discussed on prior calls, Automotive was able to hold margins on a year-over-year basis. And if it wasn't for higher restructuring expense related to acquisition integration, margins would actually have improved year-over-year. Moving on to slide 8, Food Equipment was a bright spot, with organic revenue growth of 4% as overall demand continued to accelerate from the first half of the year. North America, overall, was up 4% with equipment up 6%, and up 10% excluding the retail sector, which remains challenging due to lower customer investments and a tough comp from a major international rollout in 2017. We saw particular strength on the institutional side, up in the mid-teens as health care was up 20%-plus and education and lodging were both up 10%-plus. International was also solid, up 3% on equipment and up 4% on service. Operating margin of 26.6% was up more than 100 basis points sequentially from Q2 and down slightly year-over-year due to unfavorable product mix. Test & Measurement and Electronics organic revenue was up 3%. Test & Measurement was strong up 7% with Instron up double digits. Electronics slowed slightly due to lower demand in end markets related to solar and consumer electronics, while semiconductor remains fairly stable. Operating margin improved by 60 basis points to 24.7%, a new record for the segment. On slide 9, Welding had another strong quarter with 10% organic growth and really strong performance across the board. Global equipment grew 12% and consumables were up 9%. By region, North America was up 10% and international growth was up 12%. The industrial business and oil and gas were both up double digit and the commercial business grew in the high-single digits. Margin expanded by 160 basis points to 28.2%. As we discussed, Polymers & Fluids organic growth was down 1 point despite solid 3% growth in North America. New product launches in auto aftermarket contributed to organic growth and margin gains in North America. Operating margin improved by more than 100 basis points. Turning to slide 10. Construction delivered 1% organic growth in the quarter, as Europe led the way with 4% organic growth. North America was essentially flat with residential down 1 point on a tough comparison and inventory destocking. Recall that residential was up 7% in the third quarter last year. Underlying demand in residential remains solid as the business is up 4% on a year-to-date basis and the outlook for Q4 looks in line with that growth rate. Commercial was solid too, up 5% and operating margin improved 40 basis points. As we talked about in Specialty, organic growth slowed on the international side. But there were also some real bright spots with 5% growth in consumer packaging, up 6% year-to-date and 7% growth in packaging equipment. Overall, packaging equipment is up 12% year-to-date. On a year-to-date basis, the segment is about flat, which is also our outlook for the year as the comps are challenging in Q4. Moving on to slide 11 with an update on raw material costs and tariffs. We continue to make good progress on price/cost as our ongoing price actions are catching up to raw material cost inflation as pricing dollars are ahead of cost dollars in a meaningful way and the margin dilution impact is stabilizing. We continue to view the tariff impact as manageable and are adjusting pricing as necessary to offset the approximately $30 million impact in 2018. As we talked about in the last call, our exposure is significantly mitigated by our produce where we sell strategy and the fact that only 2% of ITW's spend is sourced from China. For 2019, we estimate the impact of tariffs at around $60 million, which is based on all announced tariffs and tariff increases as well as any carryover from 2018. And we continue to expect that our pricing actions will continue to offset raw material cost inflation, including tariff impact on a dollar-for-dollar basis. Let's go to slide 12 and guidance, we remain on track to deliver our full year EPS guidance midpoint of $7.60 despite some of the challenges we've talked about today. Our midpoint represents 15% earnings growth year-over-year. And as you saw, we narrowed the EPS range to $7.55 to $7.65 per share. In 2018, as we have for the last five-plus years, we will continue to expand our already best-in-class operating margins, returns on capital, and free cash flows. For the year, we expect revenue growth of 3% to 4% with organic growth of 2% to 3%, and operating margins in the 24% to 25% range. Enterprise Initiatives contributed more than 100 basis points again this year. We are planning to repurchase approximately $2 billion of our own shares in 2018 and our tax rate for the year is expected to be in the 25% range. Our Q4 EPS guidance is $1.78 to $1.88, up 8% year-over-year, with organic growth in the 1% to 2% range based on current levels of demand. Looking forward, we remain well positioned to continue to deliver differentiated results across a wide range of macroeconomic and end-market scenarios as we leverage and diversified high-quality business portfolio, the strength of ITW's proprietary business model, and our team's ability to execute. We hope to see many of you at our Investor Day on December 7. At that time, we'll discuss the details of our finish the job agenda as we work to get the remainder of our divisions to their full potential in terms of organic growth and continue to improve on our best-in-class operating margins, returns on capital, and free cash flow over the next two years. Karen, back to you. Karen A. Fletcher - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Michael. Ian, let's go ahead and open up the lines for questions. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie, Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good morning everyone. Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Good morning. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Maybe just kind of starting out, just a clarification on the Auto OEM growth. So, saw organic growth was down 5% this quarter. When I do the regional builds, the plus 7% North America, minus 6% Europe, flat China, something just \u2013 I don't know, the math isn't really working out for me. A bit curious, like, are you guys disproportionately greater in Europe than you are in North America? I thought North America was a larger geography. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: So, I don't know what data you're looking at Joe, but we are overweight in North America, followed by Europe and then China. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Yeah \u2013 and okay. Maybe I can follow-up offline. It's just that the minus 5% number versus the regional builds looks a little bit odd. I guess maybe just sticking with organic growth for a second. If you think about the fourth quarter, 1% to 2%, pretty similar to 3Q. But the comps get tougher on a 2-year basis, I guess just from an underlying perspective, what do you guys expect to be better in 4Q versus 3Q? Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Yeah. Joe, so we just hit a $1.90 EPS. The midpoint for Q4 is $1.83. The revenue is expected to be fairly similar at current levels of demand. The mix is going to be a little bit better by segment. So, some of our higher margin businesses such as Food, Specialty Products should improve. Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Construction. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: And Construction and even Polymers & Fluids, their growth rates should improve in Q4 relative to Q3, offset by Auto which is really at this point one of the lower-margin businesses inside the company. So, that's really on the revenue side, 1% to 2% organic. We expect to expand margins year-over-year, as we've done every quarter this year. Price/cost turned positive on a dollar basis in Q3 versus neutral for the first half. Currency headwind is a little bit lower in Q4 than in Q3. The share count's a little bit lower. The tax rate's a little difficult to call. There's some new guidance expected here in Q4. But overall, we've got a solid path here to our guidance. And I may be just point to our track record over the last five years. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. And then just maybe specifically, just on organic growth for Auto OEM in the fourth quarter. Are you expecting that to improve at all in 4Q versus 3Q? Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: If anything, we expect it to get a little bit worse than Q3. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Good enough. I'll get back in queue. Thanks, guys. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan, JPMorgan. Your line is open. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Just taking your comments there on revenue Q4 versus Q3, and knowing the way that you guys guide, kind of at your current run rate. That would imply that 2019 revenue would come in around $14.4 billion, if I just took Q4 and multiplied it by 4, which you know... Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: You mean for 2018, Ann, or \u2013 you said 2019, you mean 2018? Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Well, I was going to start like in a 2019, because you'll guide for that in December. But my point being that that would be well below your long-term target of 3% to 5% organic growth. I mean, is that \u2013 am I missing something or is that the way we should be thinking about it that the fourth quarter run rate will be what you build off of for organic growth for next year? Or is there anything new or different? Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Too early to say. We're going through our planning process right now. And so, we'll update you in December in terms of our view on a go-forward basis. But beyond the macro, we are working on, as we have been for the last five years, repositioning of our businesses really on two levels as we've talked about for a while now. One is that we've got a lot of work to do in terms of operational excellence reapplying 80/20. And once we get there, getting those businesses to leveraging their growth potential \u2013 realizing their organic growth potential, we're today at about 50% there in terms of the divisions that I would say have \u2013 are operating sort of within the range of their potential, both from the standpoint of 80/20 and from the standpoint of their organic growth, where the combined organic growth year-to-date of those 51% of our divisions is about 7.5% year-to-date. So, part of our growth over next year is certainly beyond the macro is the continued improvement in the underlying performance of those other 49% of our businesses. We're going through the planning process now. So, there's a number of different things beyond just the macro that are going to affect our organic growth rate. But I think we're pretty encouraged by the progress that we've generated in the 50% of the divisions that are largely there. And as I said, 7.5% year-to-date on a combined basis is pretty good and speaks a lot to the potential to continue to move down that path at the entire company level. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. That's useful color. I didn't realize there were so many still to be realized, just with the potential. And just a follow-up on, you noted that in Food Equipment margin was down on mix. Is that because it was more equipment and less service? Is that the right way to think about that? And then, what's the outlook there for the mix? Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: It's really more related to what's going on, on the retail side of the business being down in a pretty significant way. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And the outlook there for retail continued weakness? Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Certainly, in the near term, we don't expect any improvement on the retail side here... Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Through Q4. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: ...through Q4. I think when you look at the balance of the year, the momentum going into Q4 in food specifically looks good. We'd expect a slight improvement in the growth rate in Q4 relative to Q3. And I'd just point, margins, you're right, the mix did have an impact on a year-over-year basis. Sequentially, they were up over 100 basis points. Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. I'll leave it there and get back in queue. I appreciate the color. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz, Citi. Your line is open. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Good morning. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Scott or Michael, can you give us a little more color into your margin performance in terms of the sustainability of that performance into 2019? Again, I know you'll talk about this more in December. But if I look at the quarter, enterprise strategy tailwind was still solid, and volume was a little less of a tailwind. But the other headwind was half of what it was last quarter. I know you didn't break out growth this time. Price versus cost is a little better. So as you look in 2019, do you have decent visibility at this point that your enterprise strategy could still be a 50 basis point to 100 basis point tailwind? You already talked about price versus cost and that other doesn't creep back up, so you still see good margin expansion next year. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Yeah. I think, Andy, it's a little early here. We haven't gone through the plans for 2019 yet. Just on other specifically, this is kind of our normal run rate, if go back and look where \u2013 it's in that 20 basis points to 30 basis points range, may move around a little bit, but I think that's a pretty safe assumption on a go-forward basis. At Investor Day, we'll lay out specifically the finish the job agenda. And what we're trying to accomplish for the next two years, including continued margin expansion, and as we've said in the past, we certainly expect a positive impact from the Enterprise Initiatives next year. But I can't give you the number as we sit here, simply because we haven't gone through the plans and we haven't looked at the projects and activities and the carryover that will get us to a solid number for 2019. Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: But we'll lay it out in December. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Right. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay, Michael, that's helpful. And just the comment that you just made about 50% of the businesses still have potential for pivot to growth. I guess my understanding was that 2018, for you kind of was a pivotal year for you guys in terms of this pivotal \u2013 pivot to growth. And when we think about what growth is going to come in at for this year, it's probably going to be less than 2017. And again, I know that some of the markets have turned down. But when you look at businesses like Construction or Specialty Products, Polymers & Fluids, how much of the \u2013 in growth weakness is maybe that these businesses aren't performing yet to the potential that they can versus just simple market weakness? Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Well, it's certainly some of both. I think what I can tell you is that inside the company, this is not a sector issue in terms of Polymers & Fluids versus Automotive, or any of our other segments. This is 87 divisions that operate inside in each of those seven segments and we're at about the 51%, as I said earlier, in terms of businesses that are both operating at the level of excellence that they're capable of from an operational standpoint, application of 80/20, and are driving organic growth at a range that is within what we believe their potential is. And the other 50%, we've got more work to do. And those are pretty equally spread across all seven segments, so there's no particular tilt. I certainly expect that we would have put some better overall progress on the board have we not had auto pullback, like it's pulling back in the second half of the year. It's been our fastest-growing segment. So, we're giving up a little bit in the near term. But our focus is on getting this company to its full potential. We think we've got about two years left to run in terms of getting all the way there. I don't want to steal the story from December, but that's what Michael's alluding to and we've got plenty of more room to go on both from an operational margin standpoint, and certainly, we've got to get the other 49% of our divisions moving faster on organic. And it's not that they have under-executed, it's that they've started from further back, they've had more work to do to get there. And I think \u2013 our plan at this point is to tell you that in some pretty specific detail at the December Investor Day. So, you'll have a good view of what we think (30:33) and what the processes will look like over the next couple of years to do it. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Scott, real simply, do you think that 2019, you could actually have more outperformance versus market than 2018? Is that sort of the plan as we sit here today? Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: I think, give us a chance to run through all the operating plans. We're right in the middle of that process now. I don't mean to be evasive at all. But I think the December Investor Day is in December for a reason, because it gives us a chance to go through in detail. But what I would say is, we will have a plan for, of the 49% of our divisions that are not there yet, how many of them are we going to get there in 2019 and what kind of help that's going to provide. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Good morning. Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Good morning. Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Just curious, how are you going to think about the IHS forecast into next year's initial \u2013 into initial 2019 guide for auto? I mean, they continue to forecast 2% global production growth in 2019, I believe. I mean with China up 4%, the U.S. kind of flattish, Europe up a little bit. So, I mean, you can't help but wonder, obviously, if there's downward bias based on all the profit warnings we're seeing in the global auto space. So, are you going to abandon pegging your outlook to IHS and take a more conservative approach or how are you going to think about that? Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Well, I think certainly over the last couple of quarters, the facts are that the backward look IHS in terms of what production actually was is pretty good. The forward looks have not been so good. So, obviously, we're going to think \u2013 we'll probably take a more ITW-specific view based on own experience as we think about 2019 for auto. Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks. And then in Test & Measurement, I think last quarter you had attributed some of the slowdown in organic to delivery timing. But the organic seem to slow down even further. Was there an underlying slowdown that was stronger than expected in any of your business? And there certainly seems to be a lot of negative headlines on semis. You said your semi-related business was stable. So, could you still have a softening there still ahead of you or are you just positioned in a part of the market that's going to be immune from some of these broader pressures? Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: No, I think semi, as we said, was fairly stable here in Q3, which means positive growth, although at a lower rate than what we've seen in the first half of the year. That was as expected. We do expect it to slow a little bit further here in Q4 and that's included in our guidance. The other thing to keep in mind for Test & Measurement is you're running up against a difficult comp here in Q4. On a year-over-year basis, that segment was up 9% last year. And even though Test & Measurement was up 7% with a lot of strength in Instron here in Q3, the growth rate year-over-year is probably going to slow a little bit, just based on the comp. But the underlying demand trends in Test & Measurement and Electronics broadly are very solid. Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks. And just the last one on Polymers & Fluids. I mean some of the global peers in that market seem to be getting squeezed pretty hard by raw material cost, but your margins actually surprise to the upside. I mean, is there a cost pressure still on the comm in that segment? Or do you think you've just adjusted prices faster than anybody else? Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: I can't really comment on everybody else. I can tell you what we're doing. We are seeing a fair amount of cost pressure, other than auto, it's the second highest in terms of price/cost impact. But they've done a great job really reacting on the pricing side and more than offsetting those cost increases on a dollar-for-dollar basis. Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: And as we said before, we don't hedge so we have been incurring those costs as they are happening. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Yeah. I think that's a good point. I mean relative to others, and this is true, and maybe to expand a little bit is, not just on raw materials, but also on currency, because we do not hedge currency and raw material costs, maybe they show up faster at ITW and gives our businesses a real-time view of what's going on and then they can react maybe faster on the pricing side. So... Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Okay. Thanks very much, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Inch, Gordon Haskett. Your line is open. John G. Inch - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors : Going back, Michael, to the semi exposure, can you just remind us how much of Test, Measurement, Electronics is semi? And I think to that last question, is there something about the nature of your exposure that's allowed you to outperform? Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: It's about $200 million. I can't really comment specifically on why we're outperforming. Like I said, we've certainly benefited from strong growth over a long period of times. The growth rate slowed a little bit here in Q3, as expected. And we expect it to slow a little bit further here in Q4. How that compares to everybody else, I'm not sure I can give you a good view. John G. Inch - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors : No, no. That's fine. So, auto's \u2013 globally, you guys continue to outperform in North America and China. Last couple of quarters you've had slightly below build average results in Europe. And I'm wondering is that tied to the WLTP emission stuff with respect to your portfolio, are you positioned \u2013 like, are you doing to some PLS work there, which is what may be or may not be going on in Europe? Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Yeah. I think, John, it's more related to the fact that sort of inventory levels are getting adjusted to these lower build rates. We have a lot of confidence based on new programs that we've added and are continuing to add that we are still getting penetration gains in Europe, and it's just a matter of those are being offset by our customers pulling inventory down. Their requirements are less because they're producing less. But you'll see it go back to positive, certainly, over the next couple of quarters depending on how \u2013 where the overall production rates go. John G. Inch - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors : Yes. No, that makes sense. Maybe one more. So, thinking about Polymers & Fluids and then Specialty, other aspects of your portfolio over the last few years have grown more rapidly than these businesses, pretty strong performance, relatively strong competitive positionings. And then as Europe's obviously softened, you've got elements of these portfolios on, I think, the consumable side weakening. So, I'm curious, Scott, does this \u2013 it's one of those things where they \u2013 I'm sure they're all good businesses, but they're not necessarily performing as resiliently as some of your other segments. Does this suggest that maybe there's a lot more PLS work to do or, perhaps, even may be make some select divestitures on, I don't know, some of these consumable elements of both of those segments. Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Well, I think what I can say for sure is, in both cases, for slightly different reasons, they are \u2013 the starting point, it was certainly further back in the pack in terms of just the kind of complexity. Polymers & Fluids was a complete acquisition built segment. So, we just had a lot more \u2013 we've had a lot more stuff to deal with there in terms of getting them positioned to do what we've been capable of. That's sort of where I sit today, I think we've got another couple of years to get this whole company where we think it can be. And in those two, I'd say, parts of Specialty and a lot of Polymers & Fluids, it's just a matter of the starting point was further back, if you will, in terms of making the kind of transformation that we're in the process of making. Both are highly differentiated. Look at the margin rates, they're really solid, positions inside some really strong niches. So, I think we like the competitive position, overall, but they have to grow faster, there's no doubt. John G. Inch - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors : Well, maybe... Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: And if we determine that they can't at some point, then I think your logic is not unreasonable. But I think we've got some more room to go before we are ready to make a call on that. John G. Inch - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors : Maybe just one last one on that point. Is there any kind \u2013 I realize there's a lot of niche business in here. Is any of this pertaining to scale? So, in other words, maybe instead of looking at divestitures, maybe it might make sense to add to those portfolios in some manner to beef-up scale to kind of push it further over the goal line, if you will? Again, it's... Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Yeah. I think, all of that, across the whole portfolio, is stuff \u2013 those are sort of options that are certainly both valid and really interesting. I think, just given the level of performance, the profitability, and what we think the core growth potential is, I think, what \u2013 our focus is \u2013 let's get what we have in full potential position and not try to fix our problems. Let's address it with the businesses by operating the business we own to their full potential. And from that view then, we can look at how we might supplement or perhaps organize ourselves differently. John G. Inch - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors : Yeah. Makes perfect sense. Thanks very much. Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Volkmann, Jefferies. Your line is open. Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC : Good morning. Thank you. Just a couple of clarifications, if I might. I guess, we had a little bit of sequential improvement in sort of the price/cost headwind on margins. And I assume your goal is still to sort of fully offset that over time. Is the 10 basis point sequential improvement the right way to think about kind of the path to get there or can you do it more quickly? Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: I think what's encouraging is that the margin impact, specifically year-over-year, seems to have stabilized. And certainly, it's encouraging to see an improvement in Q3 relative to Q2. This is not going to be a quick fix. I mean, we do expect, between raw materials and tariffs, we're going to have to continue to work the price lever, which we are. And the other piece of the equation is, we were favorable, price dollars were significantly higher than the cost dollars here in Q3, relative to the first half where were neutral. So, that's \u2013 when we talk about things beginning to improve, that's really what we're talking about. But obviously, we're in a pretty dynamic environment here in terms of raw material costs and tariffs. And I just want to be a little bit cautious in terms of saying that all of this is all behind us. We're going have to continue to work this really hard, but certainly encouraged by what we've seen here in the near term. Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC : Okay. All right. Thanks, Michael. And then, just a quick follow-up, and I apologize to keep beating on Auto. But I think you had mentioned in your comments that there was a fair amount of restructuring and integration expense. And I think you said margins would have been up without that. And I'm just curious sort of where are we in that process. How long does that continue? As we get further down the road, when does that headwind sort of fade, if it does? Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Yeah. We're making really good progress there. We're in the year three of basically a five-year process, and we're talking specifically about EF&C that we added. Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC : Right. Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: And so, the things are certainly progressing, I would say, at this point, ahead of plan. It's a great business. We've added some great team members and progress is really good. And I think some of the quarterly timing in terms of restructuring is also \u2013 I don't think it's a particularly big headwind for margin in auto on an annual basis. It does jump out in the quarter based on timing of when we're actually implementing certain things. And I think that was probably more of the case. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Yeah. I think that the impact in Q3 here was 40 basis points. We laid out a plan, Steve \u2013 5-year plan to get margins to 20% and really a steady 200 basis points improvement every year. And that's what we've delivered so far. But it's not a one-time, it's really more of an ongoing program. No rush to do this, but we're definitely on the right track here. Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC : Okay, great. And then, just one final knit, if I could. The destocking that you're seeing in European auto, I guess, we had sort of heard through the channel that that was somewhat short term in nature. And I guess, you're sort of saying that's going to continue. But at some point, I suppose that that headwind goes away as well. Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Well, we think \u2013 from what we're hearing, the biggest factor is new emission standard, and there has been a lot of, let's call them, bottlenecks in terms of our customers getting their vehicles through that process. And to the extent, I \u2013 it's not something that we control, nor is it something that we have either direct input from our customers on or a point of view in terms of where that bottleneck clears and things, let's say, normalize. But that was a big factor in Europe in terms of the reduction \u2013 the decline in production in Q3. That's certainly going to continue to be there in Q4. We will hope to have a look into 2019 by December in terms of \u2013 at least, give you our view of how that will play out. And the other part of Europe was also the softer demand in China. The fair amount of auto production in Europe is exported to China and, ultimately, have demand there. There being China on a go-forward basis will also have an impact. But right now, we're calling this Q4 and we're not expecting any change. Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC : I appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Casey, Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks a lot. Good morning, everybody. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Good morning. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : I'm trying to understand some of the patterns that seem to be appearing in the results on that, it seems a little sporadic by region, but industrial seems like it's reasonably strong, but some of the consumer-oriented stuff seems to be softening. Is that consistent with how you're looking at the portfolio? And if so, outside of international auto, can you talk about whether you're seeing any of your channel partners destock? Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: We talked a little bit about destocking on the Construction side, really into the big-box retailers here in Q3. That's really more of a near-term impact. You're correct, I mean, the industrial side continues to be very solid. And then, on the consumer side, we are seeing some slightly lower growth rates on a year-over-year basis. I think on a geographic basis, like we talked about, I mean, North America continues to be really solid, up in the mid-single digits year-to-date and for the year. And really, what changed here in Q3 versus Q2 is what we talked about in terms of the international side of the business. Now when you look at it by geography, it's hard to say that there are any real trends. Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: It's pretty narrow in terms of the impact that we saw in auto and a couple of spots and pockets. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: It's a couple of pockets of \u2013 offset by strength in other pockets. So, we're not making any regional calls here in terms of what's going on from a macro standpoint. We saw some challenges in a few end markets, but there was also strength in other markets in that same region. So, we're not making a region call here. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. And then, separately, on Food Equipment, within your prepared remarks, you mentioned retail was weak. Can you give a little bit more color on that? Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Yeah. So, I'd rather not go into too much detail here. I'm sorry, Andy. I mean, what I can tell you is it's been pretty challenged for a year now. The comps are going to get easier, but really last year we saw the beginning of a slowdown in investment... Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: This is grocery stores. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: ...in grocery stores, as it relates to our products around \u2013 these are scales, weigh/wrap equipment. We also had a major new roll out of product last year that didn't repeat this year. And we'll see when we do the plans here in a couple of weeks with the Food Equipment team what to expect for next year. But for Q4, in the near term here, we're expecting that things do not get better on the retail side. And it's really a strength outside of retail what we call foodservice on the equipment side, particularly on the institutional side, where our business is up in the mid-teens with a lot of strength, as we talked about, on the healthcare, education, lodging, those trends certainly look really good. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. And if I could squeeze a clarification, and that 2019 $60 million headwind from tariff impact, does that include the anticipated 25% List 3 increase next year? Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Yes, it does. Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis, Melius Research. Your line is open. Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Hello? Operator : Scott Davis, your line is open. Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Want to move? Next call? Karen A. Fletcher - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Beth, let's take the next call. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mig Dobre, Robert W. Baird. Your line is open. Karen A. Fletcher - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Okay, Beth, keep moving. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook, Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi. Can you hear me? Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Hey, there. Okay, good. Go ahead. Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: All right. It's working. Just a couple of quick follow-up questions. One, John sort of asked you about portfolio optimization, either divestures or acquisitions, whether you need scale or \u2013 to help the organic growth story. But how much is the macro sort of impacting your view of being more opportunistic on the M&A front, if multiples come down at all? And then, my second question, just clarification. I think you said in response to one of the questions, in the fourth quarter, sequentially, you expect Polymers and \u2013 P&F and the Specialty division to improve sequentially, just was there anything specific driving that? Thank you. Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: I'll take the first one and I'll let Michael take the second one. And I, again, don't mean to be evasive, but I think in December we'll give you a fulsome update on our thinking with regard to portfolio and how we're thinking about it and how we will go forward. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Yes. And specifically on the Polymers & Fluids and Specialty, our guidance is based on the current level of demand, current run rates in those businesses. We've factored in the comps on a year-over-year basis. And based on that, the year-over-year organic growth rate in Q4 is expected to be better than the equivalent in Q3. So, there's nothing specific other than based on current run rates, factoring in the comps. Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. And then just follow-up question. Some other companies or investors have been concerned that with trade war talk, et cetera, and price increases that there has been any sort of pull forward in the demand, which is why some companies might be seeing good strength in the beginning of the year, and then things sort of deteriorating in the back half. I mean, do you get a sense for any of that as you can you talk to your customer base? Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: No. We're a book and bill. I mean, you order it today, we ship it tomorrow. We've not seen any pull forward that I can think of. I'm sort of running my head through the portfolio here. In fact, we've sort of given our delivery performance incentive by the opposite. Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you. I'll get back in queue. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joel Tiss, Bank of Montreal. Your line is open. Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey, guys. How is it going? Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Good morning. Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States): I wonder, is there any \u2013 you guys have been at this a long time. Are there any signals from your earlier cycle businesses that give you any sort of insight into what could be happening in the later cycle businesses further down the road? Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: I can't really \u2013 we're looking at each other here and shaking our heads. We can't really think of anything, Joel, in terms of short cycle being leading indicator. Like we said, this was \u2013 other than auto and a few end markets internationally in the two segments we talked about, the performance is pretty good. And we're certainly not seeing anything that underlying demand trends are beginning to slow here. Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Good. And then can we just spend a minute going through the different pieces inside the Construction business? We haven't talked about that very much. You mentioned big-box retail was destocking a little bit, but can you just talk about some of the other trends you're seeing there, please? Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Yes. I think that was really the big one that we called out. I mean I think, overall, 1% organic growth in the quarter. Europe really good, up 4%. Australia may be slowing just a little bit. In North America, the residential side was down and that's really more of a comp issue. We had \u2013 there's the hurricane impact in Q3. Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: It was a factor this year versus last. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Yeah. So hurricane impact last year, business was up 7%. Sequentially, on a run-rate basis, the underlying demand is still very good. The business is up 4% on a year-to-date basis. Q4 looks to be in line with that and the full year should be up in that 4% to mid-single digit range on the residential side. Commercial is a smaller part of our business. It can be a little lumpy. It's been flattish for a while here. We're up 5% in the quarter. I wouldn't get too excited about that, to be honest with you. I mean I think this is a more of a low-single digit type growth rate on the commercial side. And even with this slowdown, some pressure on the cost side, the fact that the business improved operating margin 40 basis points is pretty good. Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States): All right. Great. Thank you. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of the Steven Fisher, UBS. Your line is open. Steven Fisher - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. Good morning. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Good morning. Steven Fisher - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning. Talking about international Welding, some nice strength there. Can you just talk about where that strength internationally is coming from, which markets and what visibility you have to kind of continuation of that? Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Yeah, I think really what we saw was a pickup. So, most of our international businesses, as you remember, is oil and gas related. So, we saw a pretty nice recovery. Europe up 10%, a little bit more than that, 11% in the quarter, on the Welding side. China up 15%. So, the majority of that is really driven by oil and gas, which overall was up double digits. You saw the pickup also in consumables, I think up 12% in the quarter here. So, those are kind of the big \u2013 and just in terms of the sustainability, we haven't seen anything to suggest that things are slowing. Steven Fisher - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, that's helpful. And then, in terms of organic growth fourth quarter, kind of number of positive segments versus the number of negative. Obviously, we had a few, three that turned to the negative side in Q3. And as you've talked about, some of the comps get tougher in Q4. Anyway that \u2013 and we can also get to that 1% to 2% organic growth for the fourth quarter in a variety of different ways, though, I'm just curious if you think the number of segments that are going to be negative in the fourth quarter are going to be more than what we've seen here in the third quarter? Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: No. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: We expect it to be less, and it's really just \u2013 the one that stands out is Auto, even though Auto was about flat this \u2013 here in Q3. In our guidance and based on what we're seeing, we're planning for a little bit worse in that segment. The other segments should be positive. And for the full year, even Auto is going to be very close to positive in all segments, even including Auto. Steven Fisher - UBS Securities LLC : Terrific. Thank you. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nicole Deblase, Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Good morning. Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: If I could just ask a little bit of a more detailed question around price/cost. So, just compared to the headwind that you guys have had over the past several quarters, what's the expectation that's baked into the fourth quarter guidance? Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: So, we're assuming pretty similar Q4 to what we saw in Q3. It's like we said earlier, I mean, on the cost side, this is a pretty dynamic environment. Even though certain of the raws may, looking back, have stabilized, there are others where that's not the case. And so, it's hard to call, but we're expecting that Q4 is similar to Q3. And I think that's, hopefully, a pretty conservative assumption, but it's hard to tell. Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then, on Specialty Products, that was kind of a big negative surprise for us this quarter. If you could just give us some color on what drove the pretty big swing to the organic decline and if that continues into the fourth quarter? Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Yeah, it was really the three divisions internationally that we talked about, so the marking and coding business, the graphics business, and then the appliance business, which \u2013 so we sell components into appliance customers. And then, a fair bit of PLS as well, particularly on the international side. So, those were the key drivers. I think what's \u2013 it masks a little bit of this really solid performance on the consumer packaging side, which \u2013 up 5%, the equipment side up 7%. Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Which is the biggest in the segment. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Right. And so, it was really just a couple of divisions on the international side that drove the negative organic growth rate here in Q3. Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weber, RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Karen A. Fletcher - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Okay. Beth, we're at the end of the hour. Why don't we take maybe one more and we'll end the call. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski, Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Good morning. Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Just to follow-up quickly on the last question on price/cost and how that layers in from here? I get that 4Q maybe doesn't look a lot different, but tariffs ramp up again to start the year. Is there a potential for that 60 basis points to actually get a little worse before it gets better? I'm not trying to put too finer point on or getting to 2019 guidance. It's just kind of an earmark date on the calendar that I want to understand a little bit better. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Yeah, I mean, Josh, the best I can give you is \u2013 we gave you what we think the impact of tariffs is going to be for 2019 at that $60 million compared to $30 million this year. That's a meaningful number, but nothing insurmountable here, certainly manageable as we continue to work the price side of things. But beyond that, I can't really tell you until we've gone through the detailed plans here with everybody. Just to be clear, the $60 million includes, I think we said this earlier, List 3 increase from 10% to 25%. And so, that's an all-in number, based on what we know today, but it's a pretty dynamic environment. Ernest Scott Santi - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: And everybody's going through it. So, the only thing I would add is that the pricing reaction of this in the marketplace has been going on all year, will continue to go on, not just by ITW, but you're hearing it from, I'm sure, all of other industrial companies that you cover. And so, I think the environment is one that, I think, we've got a good view as to how costs are going to continue to escalate in terms of what's known. We've got to continue to see and we're certainly not anticipating them to go the other way anytime soon. So I think from the standpoint of attention and focus and our ability to continue to respond as necessary and as appropriate, I think we're pretty comfortable with where we sit. Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. That's helpful. And then just one quick one, I know we've talked a lot about destocking in European Auto, but was there any restock that you guys saw in North America Welding? I've heard some of that comment in the channel. Just curious if it impacted you at all. Michael M. Larsen - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: No. No, we didn't see that, Josh. Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Appreciate the time. Karen A. Fletcher - Illinois Tool Works, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, everybody, for joining us today. If you have any follow-up questions, just reach out and we're happy to help you after the call. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please note, today's conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Karen Fletcher, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin. Karen Fletcher : Thank you, Sheryl. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to ITW's fourth quarter 2018 conference call. I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi; along with Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen. During today's call, we will discuss fourth quarter and full-year 2018 financial results and we will update you on our 2019 outlook. Slide 2 is a reminder that this presentation contains our financial forecast for the first quarter and full-year 2019, as well as other forward-looking statements identified on this slide. We refer you to the Company's 2017 Form 10-K and subsequently filed Form 10-Qs for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Also, this presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of those measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release. As a reminder, in 2017, we disclosed $95 million favorable legal settlement and recorded one-time tax charge in the fourth quarter. Therefore, we provided you with two tables on Slides 3 and 4 that summarize key financial measures for fourth quarter and full-year on a GAAP basis, as well as on an adjusted basis excluding the legal settlement and tax charge. For the rest of this conference call, our comments and variances exclude these two one-time times from 2017. So with that, we can move to Slide 5, and I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi. Scott Santi : Thanks, Karen, and good morning, everyone. Greetings from the epicenter of the polar vortex. In the fourth quarter, the ITW team delivered solid earnings growth and margin expansion. Fourth quarter EPS was in line with the midpoint of our guidance and increased 8%, 10% excluding currency with operating margin up 70 basis points to 24%, and after-tax return on invested capital up 320 basis points to over 27%. For the full-year, the ITW team delivered high-quality earnings growth of 15%, record operating income, record operating margin, and record return on invested capital. Free cash flow was up 10%, and we invested over $600 million in our businesses for growth and productivity. In addition, we returned more than $3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Throughout 2018, we continue to make significant progress on the execution of our enterprise strategy, as evidenced by 110 basis points of margin improvement from our Enterprise Initiatives over the course of the year. We made really good progress on organic growth acceleration in better than half of our operating divisions. As we discussed in our Investor Day back in December, our focus now is on getting the other 36 of our divisions that are not yet growing to their potential, moving more briskly down that path. And it's a major focus for us in the next couple of years. There's no doubt that 2018 had its challenges, raw material cost inflation, tariff uncertainties, decelerating auto production and currency headwinds in the back half of the year. Our ability to power through these challenges and deliver another year of record results, as evidence of the performance power of the ITW business model and the resilience of our high-quality diversified business portfolio. As we head into 2019, I'm confident that we are well positioned to deliver another year of meaningful progress down the path to ITW's full potential and to our 2023 performance goal. Before I turn the call over to Michael, let me conclude by recognizing and thanking my ITW colleagues around the world for the great job that they continue to do in serving our customers and executing our strategy with excellence. Michael, over to you. Michael Larsen : Thanks, Scott, and good morning. Let's stay on Slide 5 and recap a few more highlights for the fourth quarter. GAAP EPS was $1.83, an increase of 8% as we managed through some international end markets softness in two segments : the solid execution and delivered earnings per share at the midpoint of our guidance. Organic revenue was up 1%, with solid 4% growth in North America, offset by a 2% decline in international markets. I'll provide some additional color on what we saw in North America and international markets in a couple of minutes. PLS was 90 basis points this quarter, a little bit above our full-year rate of 70 basis points. Operating margin performance was solid as margins improved 70 basis points, with 110 basis points from Enterprise Initiatives, lower price/cost margin dilution headwind. Finally, free cash flow increased 18% to $727 million, 120% of net income and we repurchased $500 million of our shares in the quarter. Moving to Slide 6 for detail on fourth quarter operating margin. We've expanded operating margin every quarter this year and the fourth quarter was no different. In fact, we did better than last quarter, with 70 basis points of improvement year-over-year versus 30 basis points in Q3. All year, our teams have continued to execute well in Enterprise Initiatives, consistently contributing 100 basis points or more of margin improvement every quarter. And the impact is broad-based. In the fourth quarter, Enterprise Initiatives benefits ranged from 80 basis points to 120 basis points across each one of our seven segments. As I mentioned, price/cost margin dilution improved, narrowing from 70 basis points in the second quarter to 60 basis points in the third quarter, and now 40 basis points in the fourth quarter. Throughout the year, we continue to take decisive pricing actions to offset cost inflation and tariff impact. As planned, on a dollar basis, price more than offset raw material costs this quarter and for the full-year. All in, operating margin expanded by 70 basis points in the fourth quarter to 24%, the highest Q4 operating margin in ITW's history. Now we'll look at segment performance, starting with Slide 7. The table on the left provide some additional color on our fourth quarter organic growth rates by segment and by region. As I mentioned, North America continued its solid growth pattern with 4% this quarter, similar to third quarter and first half of the year. North America has really been steady and strong all year, ending the year up 4%. You can see some really good organic growth numbers in North America, with for example, Food Equipment, Welding, both up 7%; Polymers & Fluids, up 6%. For the full-year, every segment delivered positive organic growth in North America, ranging from 2% to 11%. International was more of a challenge, specifically in two segments, with organic growth down 2% in the fourth quarter, compared to up 2% in the first half of the year. The international market challenges that we're experiencing are not broad-based, and relate to just two segments, Automotive OEM and Specialty. Excluding those two segments, our international growth rate in Q2 would have been 4 points higher at plus 2%. More on that in the next few Slides. I should just point out that China overall was down slightly, at minus 2%, with again lower sales in automotive and specialty only. The other five segments saw positive demand trends as evidenced by, for example, Test & Measurement and Electronics, up 12%; Welding up 22%; and Polymers & Fluids, up 9%. For the full-year, China was up 3%. Let's go into the segment details, starting with Automotive OEM. Organic growth was down 4% this quarter. North America being positive 2% was not enough to offset a meaningful reduction in build rates in Europe and China. For the full-year, Automotive OEM organic growth was flat, as the auto builds in regions that are relevant to ITW all declined. If you look at 2018's full-year organic growth compared to builds by region, we delivered significant above-market growth in two of our key markets, North America and China. In North America, we grew 3% versus builds down 1%. And in China, organic growth was 3% versus builds down 4%. In Europe, the implementation of mandated new emissions testing procedures in Q3 caused significant auto production disruption in the back half of the year. We're confident that our below build rate revenue declines in the second half are a function of mix, what models passed the new emissions testing procedures and when, and not the result of any material share loss. Our new program wins in Europe in 2018 were very strong as is our new program pipeline there. We remained confident that our European auto businesses are well positioned to deliver consistent above market growth and that they will get back to doing so over the next several quarters. With respect to the European market production issues I referenced a minute ago; our auto team on the ground expects that they will work themselves through over the next several quarters, and that conditions will begin to normalize in the back half of the year. Fourth quarter operating margin declined 150 basis points almost entirely due to price cost headwinds. As you know, pricing actions take longer to implement in the automotive market. It is encouraging though that for the full-year; this segment's operating margin of 22.5% was down only 30 basis points with the benefits from Enterprise Initiatives, essentially offsetting price/cost headwinds. Moving on to Slide 8. Food Equipment had a strong quarter and delivered accelerating organic revenue growth of 5%, its highest quarterly growth in four years as overall demand continued to improve across the board. North America grew 7%, with equipment up 9%, and service up 4%. Food service was up 11% and retail i.e. sales to grocery stores, turned positive as we began to lap difficult comps that we've talked about on prior calls. Growth in institutional end markets continues to be very strong, and was up double digits, with particular strength in the education and lodging categories. International markets were solid too, up 3% with good growth in both equipment and service. As expected, Test & Measurement and Electronics organic revenue was flat against the tough comp of 9% organic growth in the fourth quarter of 2017. Test & Measurement was down 1% due to this difficult year-over-year comparison. Electronics was up 2%. While this quarter had a tough comp, full-year organic growth was solid at plus 4% and I should point out that fourth quarter operating margin improved by 140 basis points to 24.8%, a record for the segment. Now on to Slide 9. Welding continued its strong run, with 8% organic growth this quarter, which is impressive versus a comp of 6% growth last year. Demand was strong across-the-board, with global equipment up 7% and consumables up 8%. Industrial business was up 7%, commercial up 8%, and oil and gas, up 9%. By region, North America was up 7%; and international, up 11%. Polymers & Fluids organic growth was 4% with 7% growth in automotive aftermarket, which benefited from a new product launch. And Polymers was up 4%, with strong product sales at Asia Pacific, offsetting a 4% decline in Fluids, which included a significant amount of PLS and a tough comp at plus 5% last year. Turning to Slide 10. Construction organic sales were down 1%, as our North American commercial sales were down 10%, primarily due to project timing in our warehouse growing business. North America residential was essentially flat, with 5% growth in renovation and remodel, offset by decline in new construction. Europe was a bright spot with sales up 6%. Australia and New Zealand sales were down 5% due to a slowing residential construction market there. Specialty organic sales were down 2% against the tough comp of plus 5% last year. This segment also had over 100 basis points of PLS in the quarter. International organic sales were down 8% with some of the same soft spots that we saw in the third quarter, including appliance components and graphics. Equipment sales were a bright spot, up 4%, and our Hi-Cone division, which we saw at our Investor Day, was up 13%.  Moving on to Slide 11 and full-year 2018 performance. 2018 was a record year for EPS, operating income, operating margin of 24.3% and after-tax return on invested capital of 28.2%. Operating margin was up 60 basis points, driven primarily by another year of strong execution on Enterprise Initiatives, contributing 110 basis points. Free cash flow was up 10% to $2.4 billion with free cash flow conversion of 95%, slightly below our target, primarily due to the combination of modestly higher CapEx investments and slightly elevated inventory levels at year-end due to higher material costs. Finally, we executed $2 billion in share repurchases and increased the dividend by 28% this year. Looking back at 2018. We delivered on the full-year EPS guidance that we provided as we entered the year, thus continuing our track record of exceeding our annual guidance for the past 6 years. The consistency and quality of our financial performance as summarized here for 2018 are a testament to the power of ITW's proprietary business model, our high-quality diversified business portfolio and strong execution by the ITW team. Let's now turn to Slide12 in 2019 guidance. We are reiterating our full-year EPS guidance from Investor Day in December. EPS of $7.90 to $8.20, with a midpoint of $8.05, which represents 6% growth year-over-year. We now expect organic growth in the range of 1% to 3%, compared to a range of 2% to 4% previously. This reduction is entirely related to taking a more conservative, risk-adjusted view with regards to auto builds and semiconductor-related demand in 2019. This range also includes PLS of about 80 basis points, which is unchanged from December. We continue to firm up the projects and activities related to our Enterprise Initiatives, and are confident that they will deliver 100 basis points of operating margin expansion, independent of volume. Also, included in our plan are higher restructuring expense versus 2018 and we have particularly heavy restructuring agenda in Q1. This is driven to a significant degree by actions we are taking to rightsize our automotive OEM and specialty businesses in Europe. The price/cost equation remains pretty dynamic, but margin headwinds should continue to moderate as the majority of raw material costs appear to have stabilized, and we have strong pricing momentum heading into the year, with the vast majority of planned pricing actions already implemented. 2019 tariff expectations remain around $60 million, which is based on current and announced tariffs, including the potential impact of these three growing from 10% to 25% in March. We continue to view the overall tariff impact as manageable, given the fact that we are largely a produce where we sell company, and that we only source approximately 2% of our spend from China. Given the differentiated nature of our product offerings across the company, we expect to be able to offset the impact of any incremental raw material cost inflation and tariff impacts that might arise in 2019, with pricing actions on a dollar-for-dollar basis at a minimum, just as we did in 2018. Finally, we expect free cash flow conversion at or above 100% of net income, share repurchases of $1.5 billion and a tax rate in the range of 24.5% to 25.5%, up slightly from 24.5% in 2018 due to the non-repeat of discrete items. Taking a closer look at the first quarter. We should point out that we expect that the first half of 2019 will be a little more challenging that what is typical for us in terms of year-over-year comparisons due to more difficult comps, more currency headwind in the first half versus the second half of the year and higher Q1 restructuring costs. Specifically, in Q1, we have a $0.07 of currency headwind at current rates. The impact of the higher restructuring also $0.07, and $0.05 of tax rate headwind due to a discrete $14 million tax item that we recognized in Q1 of last year. There's also one last shipping day in Q1, which is another approximately $0.02 headwind to EPS and 1.5 percentage points headwind to organic growth. It's important to note that we have an extra shipping day in Q3. As a result, we expect Q1 EPS in the range of $0.73 to $0.83, and essentially flat organic growth. However, coming out of Q1, the headwinds I just described start to moderate. Roughly two-thirds of $0.14 of the expected currency headwind this year is in the first half. Restructuring activities, as we discussed, are front-end loaded this year, and price/cost margin impact should moderate as we go through the year. It\u2019s important to note that our full-year guidance is based entirely on current demand run rates. Existing and announced price/cost impacts, known enterprise initiative benefits, and what we believe is a prudently risk-adjusted posture with regard to 2019 demand expectations in auto and semiconductor end-to-end markets. We do not have any projections of demand improvement versus current levels in our 2019 guidance. However, given what I just described and the fact that revenue comps are much easier in the second half of the year, year-over-year revenue and earnings growth comparisons will get increasingly positive as we move through the year. On Slide 13, we provided an EPS range for 2019 versus 2018. Organic growth of 1% to 3% at our normal incremental margin of 35%, contributes to $0.20 to $0.30 to EPS growth. Benefits from Enterprise Initiatives add another $0.25 to $0.35. Lower share count represents the impact on the $2 billion of share repurchases completed in 2018 and the $1.5 billion planned for 2019. Combined, they contribute approximately $0.25 a share. At current exchange rates, we anticipate $0.20 impact from foreign currency and approximately two-thirds of that impact is expected in the first half of the year as we talked about. And finally, we proved a few things and to other on this bridge. It includes our expectations to higher restructuring this year, approximately $0.10, with $0.07 of that in Q1; a higher tax rate than 2018 due to the non-repeat of discrete items, which is a $0.05 headwind, partially offset by lower interest expense due by savings and the $1.35 billion in bond maturities in March and April. These three items and a few other puts and takes, combined to reduce EPS by $0.10 to $0.20. You will know that there's no accommodations of potential M&A activity and specifically the potential divestitures that we talked about at Investor Day. Our guidance is all in, meaning, that the baseline presented here assumes our portfolio as it is today. We are making good progress on our potential divestitures, and we'll update you on our progress as we go through the year. Importantly, as we said before, any EPS dilution from divestitures will be completely offset by incremental share repurchases, and are therefore, EPS-neutral. Finally, we have provided our views on organic growth outlook by segment for full year 2019 on Slide 14. These are based on current run rates, adjusted for seasonality, and are obviously influenced by year-over-year comparisons as we go through the year. It's important to note that there's no expectation of demand acceleration embedded in our guidance. We see solid growth in Welding of 3% to 6%, down from 2018, but just as a function of the more difficult 10% comparison year-over-year. Food Equipment has good momentum and pretty easy comps in the first half, and are expected to be up 3% to 5% for the full year. Construction of 1% to 4%, which also includes a number of meaningful new product launches. Test & Measurement incorporates a more cautious sales expectation for equipment related to semiconductor manufacturing. Those sales represent approximately $200 million, and are expected to be down double-digits in 2019. This creates a drag of 2 percentage points of organic growth to the Test & Measurement and Electronics segment. Polymers & Fluids and Specialty, all with low single-digit growth expectation, and automotive, as we mentioned, we are being pretty cautious with sales expected to be flat to down 4% despite the fact that third parties, such as IHS, are expecting positive growth in auto builds in 2019. Lastly, a comment about quarterly guidance. From day one back in 2013, our strategy has been centered on leveraging ITW's powerful and proprietary business model to its full potential, and in doing so, position the company to deliver solid growth with best-in-class margins and returns over the long-term. In the early stages of implementing our strategy, we believe that providing quarterly guidance was constructive given the number and magnitude of the changes and initiatives that we were implementing across the company. We have not progressed far enough in executing our strategy that you believe that providing quarterly guidance is no longer value added given the long-term performance focus of the company and our core shareholders. As a result, we are discontinuing this practice as of this quarter. We will continue to provide an updated five-year performance goals and EPS and organic growth guidance annually. With that, Karen, back to you. Karen Fletcher : Okay. Thanks, Michael. Sheryl, let's open up the lines for questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from Andy Casey from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Andrew Casey : Thanks a lot. Good morning, everybody. Scott Santi : Good morning. Andrew Casey : Your guidance is pretty interesting. It looks like topline is more or less consistent with a bear case on the stock, but the bottom line guide is what you said back in December. So a couple of questions on the backend loaded nature of what you just presented. First, why is price/cost negative 50 bps for the year, given pricing momentum is carrying over? And from the outside, it looks like you're looking at apparent decreases in some of your raw material input costs and then within that, do you expect price/cost to improve through the year? Michael Larsen : Yes. Andy, price/cost was negative 50 basis points from a margin standpoint in 2018 and we're not providing a number for 2019 primarily because it's still a pretty dynamic environment in terms of raw materials as well as potential tariffs. That said, what you are saying is correct. I mean it is reasonable to assume based on what we know today in terms of the price actions we've taken, the expected raw material costs, the tariffs including the increase in March from 10% to 25% that may or may not happen. It is reasonable to assume that we will continue to make progress on price/cost from a margin standpoint in 2019 and certainly, we will continue to be positive on a dollar-for-dollar basis to a degree that\u2019s significantly higher actually that what we saw in 2018. So I hope that answers your question. Andrew Casey : It does. And if I can also follow-up on something else, Michael, thank you for that. In your commentary around the first half versus second half, Q1 midpoint implies about 6% earnings decline year-over-year, but the rest of the year is up around 9%. It sound pretty confident that in assuming the current run rate. Is a majority of that confidence really related to the pull ahead of the seven out of 10 for restructuring in the year into Q2? And basically, is that the big part of your confidence? Michael Larsen : Yes. I think what we're pulling forward, the restructuring obviously has a pretty big impact here in Q1 of $0.07. Some of those benefits will start to show up in the back end of the year. Many of these projects have one-year payback or better in many cases. In addition to the higher restructuring, currency is more of a headwind in Q1, the tax rate is a headwind. And then we do have one less shipping day as I mentioned in Q1. And so\u2026 Scott Santi : That we get back in Q3. Michael Larsen : That we get back in Q3. So that's why the year looks a little different relative to what you're used to from ITW, but there is some really good reasons behind that. And when you pencil it all out, you can get comfortable. We certainly are comfortable and very confident in our ability to deliver on the guidance that we are providing today. Andrew Casey : Okay. Sounds good. Thank you very much. Scott Santi : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague, Vertical Research. Your line is open. Jeffrey Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Scott Santi : Good morning. Jeffrey Sprague : Good morning. I wonder if I can just dig into a couple of segment level detail questions. First on automotive and the whole emissions, WLTC had a logjam in Europe. Your view that it doesn't really sort itself up in the second half, is that kind of a well grounded in what you're hearing from the OEMs? Or is that really kind of just kind of caution on the chaos we've seen up to this point and it's just kind of hard to predict how things play out there? Scott Santi : I think it's a little bit of both, but more of the latter. I want to be careful how I say this, but I think the information has, in terms of direct customer, that's been a little bit up and down just because I think it's a fairly fluid situation. But I think our posture from a planning standpoint, we believe is definitely on the conservative side and just to be clear, we're saying that things start to mitigate in the back half of normalized, but certainly aren't all the way corrected probably and it will begin with some elements of this all the way through the year is our current view. Jeffrey Sprague : Okay. And just on the Construction side. I'm sorry, can you elaborate on what drove the commercial weakness in North America and the U.S.? And is there kind of visibility on the recovery plan there? Michael Larsen : Yes, there is. So it's a fairly small part of our overall business in North America. Part of what we do is we provide concrete solutions for warehouse flooring. And we had a number of projects that we're scheduled to go in Q4 that pushed out to 2019, so it's just primarily a timing issue more than a commentary on what's going on in the commercial construction space. Jeffrey Sprague : And maybe just one other really quick follow-up. Do you have some additional restructuring kind of on-the-shelf, for lack of a better term, if kind of the macro environment does begin to pick it on as soon as 2019 unfolds? Scott Santi : Well, I would say, we normally operate with a fair degree of contingency planning around our plans, whether that's within a particular segment or at the overall company level. We certainly have the flexibility to make adjustments as we're talking about here related to auto and specialty in the near term. And that's been sort of normal practice for the company for quite a long time. So should things in terms of sort of external and macro environment play out differently than what we're anticipating now, and again, I think we're taking a pretty conservative posture in terms of our planning approach here. And absolutely, we would expect to be able to adjust to that and do it in a relatively short order. As I said, we have a pretty flexible cost structure given how we operate to maybe 2020. So we could certainly make those adjustments within the quarter or two. Jeffrey Sprague : Great. Appreciate the perspective. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jamie Cook, Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Jamie Cook : Hi, good morning. First, I just wanted to better understand if we think about what \u2013 your preliminary guide at the Analyst Meeting, the EPS is the same as it is today. Basically, reaffirmed it, but your organic growth assumption is 1 point worse. I don't recall of the restructuring number was in there and also FX seems to be more of a headwind. So can you just sort of help me understand what's offsetting those headwinds relative to what you guys said at the Analyst Day? And then my second question is just with regards to the organic growth, the 2% for this year. One would argue in 2018 where the economy was relatively strong. You guys put up the same level of organic growth. So just comfort level on you can put together \u2013 or you can put up another 2% organic growth in a tougher macro. Thank you. Michael Larsen : Yes. So let me start with the first part, which is a very fair question, in terms of the organic growth guide today being lower than what we guided in December. Really on the back of being more conservative around automotive builds as well as factoring in the latest view on the semiconductor-related end markets. As we've gone through these last few months here, we really firmed up our views in terms of the enterprise savings from \u2013 Enterprise Initiatives to specific projects and activities that will deliver 100 basis points of margin improvement as well as other discretionary cost items. And so that's really what's driving the majority of our confidence and ability to maintain the EPS number. In addition to that, I would say, although I'm cautious on this, given what we saw in 2018 as the price/cost headwinds are certainly looking more favorable today than at the end of last year. And then just to be precise, restructuring, I think, that we had in our guidance in December is the same number as today. And so that number has not changed. I think the second part, if I remember correctly, was around our ability \u2013 confidence to deliver 1% to 3% organic growth this year similar to last year. And I'll go back to how we modeled this, which is basically based on current run rates, adjusted for seasonality, and if you run that out for the year, with the adjustments we made in auto and specialty, you get to a range of 1% to 3% organic growth. We provided a little more detail on the last slide, Slide 14, in the deck. You can see how it kind of pencils out by segment. And again, these are based on current run rates, risk-adjusted on a couple of areas, and in our view, pretty cautious and conservative view overall. Jamie Cook : I guess, so just given the account of the weaker macro, there are certain segments where you are assuming that your market share is above average and that sort of helps the organic growth? I mean, can you talk about Construction little? I'm not sure if market share is contributing more, I mean, relative to just overall whatever macro? Thanks. Michael Larsen : Yes. I think Construction, there's significant new product launches on the docket for this year. I'd say in addition to that, I wouldn't underestimate the impact of price this year relative to 2018. And so if you add all that up, these are the numbers that make up the guidance by segment and 1% to 3% in total. Jamie Cook : Okay, thank you. I\u2019ll get back in queue. Michael Larsen : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz, Citibank. Go ahead, your line in open. Andrew Kaplowitz : Hear me okay? Michael Larsen : Yes. We got you. Andrew Kaplowitz : Yes. So Scott or Mike obviously ITW's is relatively strong in Europe, and you did mention that Europe would be up a couple of percent instead of down if it weren't for your issues in auto. And Specialty Products, so maybe give us a little more color regarding what\u2019s going on in Europe. Construction actually looks like strong for you, guys, given the environment there. And so and what's the outlook here as we go through 2019 in Europe? Michael Larsen : Yes, I think the issues on the international side are really isolated to the two segments we talked about. I think the other five segments are doing pretty well across the Board. If you just look at the fourth quarter, certainly, auto, specialty were down, but we put up some really good numbers in Europe. Construction overall was up 6%. Welding, up 7%. Food, up 3%. We've not seen a big impact from Brexit or the U.K. Those markets are pretty stable. So we feel pretty confident going into 2019 in terms of modeling current run rates in that geography. Scott Santi : You just may be \u2013 yes, just another data point is, and if you net \u2013 if you look at our European sales in Q3 and Q4 net of auto and specialty, it was plus 3 in Q3 and plus 2 in Q4, so we're certainly not \u2013 which feels pretty stable to us not \u2013 the 3% to 2% I don\u2019t know, we're certainly not calling that a trend. But sort of down single-digit is pretty sold. Andrew Kaplowitz : Yes. Okay, that\u2019s helpful guys. And then a couple of businesses that have been somewhat lethargic over the last couple of quarters, they looked like they kicked up a little bit here in this past quarter. If I look at Polymers & Fluids and you mentioned that new product intro and auto aftermarket. And then with include equipment that you mentioned retail reconfiguration turning around. Do these businesses have some sustaining power here going forward? In other words, are you seeing a little bit more CapEx from grocery stores, for instance, in Food Equipment and does this new product rollout in auto aftermarket? Does that give you continuing growth in the segment for the next few quarters? Michael Larsen : Yes. I\u2019d say Andy that Food Equipment certainly feels very good. I think the acceleration really started in the second half. The strength is broad-based. On the equipment side, service put up a pretty good number here as well. On the retail side, just to be clear, we're not seeing a pickup in terms of the CapEx spend on the grocery side. Really, what we're seeing is, these are flat to up slightly on a year-over-year basis as we lapped a more difficult comps. But all the benefits that we expected in terms of new product introductions, certainly, we're seeing though in the second half of the year and we expect those to continue into 2019. So Food Equipment, let say, 3% to 5% feels very good for 2019. Polymers & Fluids, we did benefit from a new product launch in automotive aftermarket. I hesitate to say this, but we\u2019re a beneficiary also of some weather-related impact in terms of Rain-X wiper blades. And so that part of the business was up 7% overall. That is not a sustainable rate for the full-year, obviously. But I'd say also in Polymers, you're seeing some good progress there in terms of the overall organic growth rate. And like I mentioned earlier, you are seeing the impact of price. So certainly some good progress in those two segments and we should expect to continue to see that in 2019 as reflected in the segment outlook we gave you on Page 14. Andrew Kaplowitz : Appreciated guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mig Dobre from Baird. Your line is open. Mircea Dobre : Yes. Good morning, guys. So I want to stick with Food Equipment here. I mean, 3% to 5% growth this would probably be the best growth since 2014, 2015, that time range. And I wanted to make sure that I understand kind of what the moving pieces are here. Retail, you said, feels a little bit better, but it's mostly a factor of comps. So I'm not sure how much you're really expecting this business to grow. Institutional, you mentioned, was quite good, so maybe you can talk a little bit about the momentum into 2019? I'm also wondering just your restaurant business, so I think that's pretty meaningful as well. How that's doing international as well as North America? Michael Larsen : Yes, Mig. So the demand we saw really here in Q3, Q4 was broad-based. So we talked specifically about food service, which is everything excluding the retail side, being up 11%. Retail turned positive in the no single-digits. We're not counting on a big pickup in retail in 2019 and it's not that significant portion of our overall business. We continue to see a lot of strengths on the institutional side, up double-digits. And again, there are a couple of categories here, really, around education, so K12, universities as well as lodging. And on the restaurant side also, double-digit growth, including which for us is a smaller part of the business on the QSR side. International is solid, up 3%. Certainly feel good about the momentum going into 2019. And just Q4 was best growth rate I think in over four years here. So new product introductions are really taking off and we feel we're very pleased with the progress we're making in Food Equivalent. Mircea Dobre : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then sort of going back to the big picture topline guidance, so if you're starting the year flat in Q1 and you're guiding on current levels of TAM, and your comp is getting tougher in Q2 by at least 100 basis points. Should we have expectations for an organic decline in Q2, and then acceleration in the second half on easier comps? Is that how we should be thinking about it? Michael Larsen : So Mig, you should definitely think about it as just given the comps higher growth rates in the back half of the year than in the first half. If you just go back and look at 2018, I think in 2018, we were up 3% organic rounding in the first half were up 1% in the second half. That alone is driving some of the higher growth rates, both in terms of organic as well as well as earnings growth. So really the swings you're going to see are really a function of what the comps are on a year-over-year basis. Those are the big drivers. Again, there's no demand acceleration assumed here on the contrary, if anything, we've dialed it back in certainly in auto as well as semi, which we talked about earlier. Mircea Dobre : But there is not something on the products side or \u2013 I don\u2019t know something it based on some of the visibility that you might have that would be able to maybe reassure us that you'd be able to cross the tougher comp in Q2 versus Q1? Michael Larsen : There is typical every year, new products contribute\u2026 Scott Santi : And we are not managed for the quarter. The quarterly plans, we'll give you a Q2 update when we get there. Our expectation is, again, as Michael said, were recent current demand levels and projecting them through the year. I'm \u2013 if you look at Q2 this was a full-year in a Q1 number. I don't recall exactly what the Q2 organic growth rate is embedded in our plan if we had it, and so I think\u2026 Mircea Dobre : No, I appreciate it. I was just trying to make sure that we have already much better line what you guys are thinking. That\u2019s it? Scott Santi : I think the math is \u2013 there's nothing funny in the math here. This is really straightforward, as Michael said, if anything have to dialed back relative to current demand rates in a couple of areas where we think there's some potential risks. We're not seeing that it's going to play out that way. I think overall, that's a smart and prudent approach in terms of our planning. And it also highlights the fact that we've got a lot of earnings growth power from the same point of Enterprise Initiatives and other things going on underneath that's not vulnerable to some further erosion in auto, if things play out. And ultimately, we've got to plan where we believe there's more upside potential than downside. That's why we always plan and that's really what were, I think, embedded in the approach we've taken in terms of taken the organic growth rate down a percent relative to where we were in December. Mircea Dobre : Got it. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John Inch, Gordon Haskett. Your line is open. John Inch : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Michael Larsen : Good morning. John Inch : Hi, Michael. So wondering if there's kind of an update on the divestitures that you plan for this year? And just as kind of to that, Michael, if we were actually to have taken the 2019 divestitures that you've got out and best of them at the beginning of the year, kind of pro forma, would that have any material impact on the 1% to 3% core growth that you're just betting for 2019? Michael Larsen : Yes. So as that's a very good question. So the impact is these potential divestitures all happen is an improvement in our organic growth rate of about 50 basis points and improvement in our operating margins by 100 basis points. So that would \u2013 assuming that all of those take place this year, that's what we would expect to see in 2020. I think that's a fairly optimistic assumption. I think we're certainly making good progress, and I think a more reasonable planning assumption would be maybe half of them get done this year. But none of that is included in the numbers today. So certainly you see some slightly lower revenues to the effect that if EPS dilution, you'll see higher share repurchases to offset that, so that they are EPS-neutral. There are going to be some gains on some of these potential divestitures. Those are also not included, but on pro forma basis, it's a meaningful impact. And we are making good progress. John Inch : If there's some reason you couldn't \u2013 I know you said half, but it's not a bad point, right? But to some reason, if you start to get a cadence going because I'm assuming you're not doing them sequentially one after another, you got kind have booked out more than one. I mean, why couldn\u2019t these things hit sooner? Is it just \u2013 I guess I don't really understand why it \u2013 there's not a lot of companies like why couldn't we get most of this done in 2019? Michael Larsen : I will pass that on to the steering committee in charge of the divestiture activities, John. We prioritized in terms of the biggest impact of the company. We\u2019re going to try to get those done first. We\u2019re not in a rush here. We\u2019re going to be very liberate and thoughtful in terms of how we execute of this and maximizing the value for the company and so\u2026 Scott Santi : I'll just quibble a little bit with your perspective in terms of there \u2013 there is a decent amount of work involved in each one in terms of preparing to separate from ITW and all the things we need to do to\u2026 John Inch : Yes, I look in the ivory tower, so I guess. Scott Santi : I don't want to go to that part, John, but I was just \u2013 I think we've got a good cadence, we've got good plans that we are finalizing now in terms of being very deliberate and intentional how bad \u2013 how we go bad if as Michael said, I think the reality of it is probably a two-year process to move all the way through maybe. And of course, everything that we can do to make it happen faster, we will certainly do that. But at this point, we also are not \u2013 that's not the number one priority right now. So would everything else that we are trying to work on and make progress there. John Inch : And just sort on the polymers business, I know Michael, you called out the auto aftermarket likely not to see that cadence, that make sense. Was there any kind of a pre-buy in that business maybe associated with getting ahead of some cost increases or price increases? That\u2019s also potentially contributing to the 1% to 3% kind of slight acceleration? Michael Larsen : John, we did not see that in Polymers & Fluids. And actually, in any of our other segments as we went through the fourth quarter here. The quarter played out as it usually does on a monthly basis. There's really nothing unusual, as we went through the quarter, including in Polymers & Fluids. John Inch : The other question I had is oil and gas prices have come down obviously, since the December meeting. I know we're talking about raw increases, but I was wondering about the indirect impact or even direct impact of those hydrocarbon pricings coming down? I realize you buy a lot of metals, like, in metals derivatives. But is there possibly some sort of once we get the impact of this, is there some sort of potential net tailwind that kind of begins to accrue to you later this year or something? Michael Larsen : Eventually, the answer is yes. I don\u2019t know whether that will be end of this year or not. I mean there is certainly a tailwind today on a dollar-for-dollar basis, as I said earlier, while raw material costs increases \u2013 just carryover from last year is still pretty significant number in 2019. Its leg than 2018 and we are certainly significantly ahead on a dollar-for-dollar basis. So with the standard, it is providing some tailwind here. John Inch : Got it. One last one, I mean company is used to talk about \u2013 I think they still do selectively kind of these cost pressures that are embodied by wages. If you just focus on the U.S., what's actually happening to your U.S. wage costs given \u2013 what appeared to be tight employment markets? I mean, our wages going up materially in 2019 I don\u2019t remember if you call back out, materially 2019 versus 2018. Is that any kind of the factor here? Michael Larsen : We have not \u2013 I think there would be \u2013 from the standpoint of aggregate, North American wages. I am summarizing a lot of individual data points, but things are up tens of thousands of points maybe relative to sort of plan increases in prior year, but nothing that I would considered to be material in terms of the impact of the overall company at this point. John Inch : Got it, talk it. All right, thanks guys. Appreciated. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Gilardi. You\u2019re line is open. Ross Gilardi : Hey good morning. Thanks guys. Just on auto, I think you said that you're assuming flat to negative 4% for 2019. Can you give us any type of breakdown by region particular since you were saying that you\u2019re not assuming any acceleration in the second half? I would just think given like what's going on in China right now to get the flat to negative 4% and just the pressures in that end market globally that you would have assume some re-acceleration for now to be down more than that. Michael Larsen : Yes. So there is a lot of uncertainty around the numbers that third parties are providing on a geographic basis. I think the best I can tell you is, when we were together in December, the view was is that our auto business will be flat on markets that globally would be down 2% to 3%. We gave that a further risk adjustment here relative to what we said in December. I can't really give you a view by quarter here as the year plays out. I'll give you the actuals, when we get through Q2, Q3 and Q4, but I can't really give you guidance around that. Scott Santi : We got people studied this, like IHS out with a projection of plus 2% on builds on China for the year, plus 1% in North America and I think down a couple \u2013 I think certainly, globally they're plus 1%, we\u2019re at 0% to minus 4%. It\u2019s just one data point, but there are people that study this that have \u2013 I\u2019ll call it an optimistic view, but I think we're back to them. The comment we are making earlier about making sure that we're appropriately conservative there where there's still some uncertainty, but we're not, I don't think we're on the high side of optimism relative to what most of this, at least third parties that we look at to study this market feel like it's going to go on in 2019. We're on the conservative side of them. Ross Gilardi : Just on the restructuring, the $0.07 and I think the $0.10 for the year, what is it actually for? I mean, is it headcount related or is it five-year enterprise initiatives? And I think you mentioned before, but where is it again? Michael Larsen : So this is primarily focused on rightsizing our footprint in Europe in two businesses, the automotive business as well as the specialty business. And beyond that we typically don't comment on specific restructuring projects. Ross Gilardi : Okay. But on that, Michael, I mean, you said that, I mean, clearly there's some pressures tied to what you were describing earlier, but it sounded like you thought things were normalizing that you're not losing share and it's kind of a timing issue of when the market actually improves. So why restructure the European auto business if that's the case? Michael Larsen : Well, we're just moving faster on some things. We still got an acquisition that we did two years ago that is through the restructuring I would say, is normally \u2013 normal part of the integration of that business. It\u2019s a fairly good piece of that. We are accelerating some of that given the environment in this pause and demand, it's a good time to get after some of that. Well there's some things that would have been \u2013 we would have gotten to anyway. It\u2019s the easiest way to describe it that I would say we have accelerated into the front-end of the year given the pause and the demand admit. These things are in some ways is better timing if we can get them done when we're not also dealing with some increases in demand. That's probably a better characterization of it. Ross Gilardi : Okay. Got you. Michael Larsen : That's what we're doing. Ross Gilardi : And just the last one on the Test & Measurement. I mean you guys leaked out 140 basis points of margin expansion with real organic growth in the business in the fourth quarter, which is pretty impressive. But is that type of margin expansion sustainable in the 2019 in a flattish environment for that segment? Michael Larsen : I think we still have ways to go in terms of further margin expansion in Test & Measurement and that's based on what the bottoms up, what the team is telling us. What you're really seeing is the impact of the enterprise initiatives in Test & Measurement. And I think it's another data point that supports the view that we have and the confidence that we have in the ability to continue to expand margins in 2019 and beyond as we talked about in December. We believe we have at least another 3 to 4 percentage points of margin expansion ahead of us and Test & Measurement has at least that level of improvement ahead of it in that over the next three to four years. Ross Gilardi : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie, Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Joseph Ritchie : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Scott Santi : Good morning. Joseph Ritchie : So just on your WLTP comments from earlier, I just wanted to make sure that I understand it. If your platforms are being disproportionately impacted, do you have a sense or line of sight on the approval for those platforms getting through the testing requirements? And shouldn't that just reversed itself at some point in 2019? Scott Santi : Well, it should reverse itself at some point. The answer to your question is we don't have great line of sight because it's a new test and I don't want to speak for the auto OEMs in Europe, but what we're hearing is that there's some uncertainty and some challenges. It's not that it can't be done, it is a new testing procedure and that the backlog involved in getting all of their models through it has been much more of a challenge than perhaps what\u2019s expected. I don't know. I'm not, again, this is where we\u2019ll draw some conclusions over around based on a number of different data points. So my answer to your question is absolutely, it should sort itself out. I think there's still a question of how long it takes to do so. And that's an element of our, let's call it conservatism in terms of our posture around that. There is people are still buying cars in Europe. There's nothing in terms of their consumption data and auto that gives you a whole lot of reason for pause at least to us at this point. It's much more a bad for disruption and the production part relative to the emissions testing regime. And I don't think it's \u2013 smooth sailing from here, let's say in terms of how all that plays out. Based on what we hear. Joseph Ritchie : That's fair, Scott. And I guess just a good quick pop follow-up that I had. You guys gave us guidance on the whole growth outlook for Test & Measurement and Electronics. Just wondering, and I know you've got the run rates, but the Electronics business I guess we've been seeing, yes, some softness channel and any color on that business specifically and what do you you're seeing in kind of perspective will be helpful. Michael Larsen : Yes, most of our position in the electronic space is really more, I would say, MRO-related. So we're not \u2013 with a couple of exceptions, just one in set by we're not sort of upstream in terms of production equipment. So that from our standpoint the electronics has been pretty stable. But it's \u2013 but we're able to describe is pretty downstream from the standpoint of where we participate there. Scott Santi : Yes. Clean room. Michael Larsen : MRO. Scott Santi : MRO activities. Michael Larsen : Not production items. Right. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ann Duignan. Your line is open. Ann Duignan : Hi, good morning. Scott Santi : Good morning. Ann Duignan : Most of my questions have been asked. So I just philosophically, I just wanted to ask about the pulling that quarterly guidance. I'm just curious about timing and whether you talked to the fact that, without quarterly guidance probability is that the sale side estimates will be more variable and then you're more likely to miss somebody's expectations and therefore have greater earnings volatility, which actually meant covering multiple on a stopped. So I'm just curious why you chose to stop giving quarterly guidance. Scott Santi : Well, since we haven't missed one in six years, we thought we would try something different. I'm just kidding. I think ultimately we talked a lot of our shareholders, and there's a fair amount of effort and it goes into providing it. There is some philosophical differences around again, what we think the core investor value proposition for ITW which is really around, strength of competitive advantage in the business model, resilience in terms of high quality, diversified portfolio. All of those things are really oriented towards longer time periods of performance. And given all that, I think this is, we felt like we had, I think Michael said in his remarks, it was valuable early in the process given and talk about the enterprise strategy now. And then at this point we progressed far enough words, it's not value added anymore. And the last thing I would say and this will be a little smart key and I don't intend to be, but we listened to your boss. Jamie diamond has told us that. And a lot of companies we should be doing this. I'm just kidding. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Fisher, UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Steven Fisher : Thanks. Good morning. Scott Santi : Good morning. Steven Fisher : Good morning. Just wanted to follow-up on the oil and gas question more from the revenue side of things? Just wondering to what extent you're seeing any change in momentum in the oil and gas business in the last two or three months or so. And then how that's filtering into your, primarily I guess the 3% to 6% growth in your Welding business. Michael Larsen : Yes, our exposure is pretty limited overall to oil and gas. It's primarily on the international side in the Welding business. And we've just started to see a pickup in oil and gas here in Q3 and Q4. We gave you the number here. And we haven't seen any changes over the last couple of months, if that's what you're asking. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase, Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Nicole DeBlase : Yes, thanks. Good morning. Michael Larsen : Good morning. Nicole DeBlase : Given that some of the \u2013 I guess some of the commentary around why organic growth is a little bit lower for the full-year? Is semiconductor is electronic. I guess I\u2019m curious I don\u2019t think that came up in your commentary within T&M. Are you guys actually starting to see a slowdown in semiconductor spend? Or is it just anticipated to occur throughout 2019? Michael Larsen : So we did see a slowdown here in Q4, not entirely on expected. And again it\u2019s in the portion of Test & Measurement that sells equipment for the upfront manufacturing of - in the semiconductor space. And we did see a slowdown here in Q4. In the past, there have been talks about pause, and then a pick up again in the back end of 2019. And we\u2019ve taken all that out and basically assumed current run rate based on what we saw in Q4 and, therefore in our view, appropriately, risk-adjusted for any exposure in semiconductor. Operator : Our next question comes from Nathan Jones from Stifel. Your line is open. Nathan Jones : Good morning, everyone. Michael Larsen : Good morning. Nathan Jones : Couple of follow-ups on the Welding business there, obviously, some good organic growth, but I know that business does sell a lot of steel. So maybe if you could give us some color on what the input is from volumes versus price, in the fourth quarter? And what the pricing tailwind to revenue, at least, is in 2019? Michael Larsen : Yes. So Nathan, we do not break out price versus volume at the enterprise level or by segment, including for Welding. So I'm afraid I can\u2019t give you that. Nathan Jones : Okay, no worries. Just one on the Construction business that you talked about new product releases on slide for this year. Can you talk about when you expect those to start hitting the market? And any color you could give on the anticipated contribution? Michael Larsen : Yes, it\u2019s a pretty long list of new product centered around our cordless technology where ITW is the market leader. They come in throughout the year the various geographies. Typically, the contribution from new products is somewhere in the 1% range in terms of overall revenue growth and we it just based on what\u2019s in the pipeline to be a little bit higher than that in Construction this year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi, good morning guys. Michael Larsen : Good morning. Josh Pokrzywinski : Just a follow-up on, Michael I guess the \u2013 part of the answer to your last question that you don't really want to break out price with the enterprise level. But it seems like some of the confidence in the year comes from maybe a bit more price yield and perhaps some commercial initiatives that offsets some of that auto commentary. Is that a fair assessment relative to prior years that you guys just feel like outside of, perhaps, auto that you're carrying a bit more price than usual and able to kind of a hold up, at least any downside scenario? Michael Larsen : I don\u2019t know if we really thought about it that the way you\u2019re articulating it. I mean but certainly, like I said earlier, in six out of seven segments, so excluding auto, there's \u2013 we've taken pricing actions to offset raw material cost inflation and tariff impact. So to the extent that we'll probably have a little bit more price coming through in 2019 than in 2018 and that certainly helps the overall organic growth rate. Scott Santi : But we offset price every year. Michael Larsen : Yes, we get price every year. Maybe a little bit more 2019 and 2018, but it\u2019s not the big driver here. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from David Raso, Evercore ISI. David Raso : Hi, good morning. I had another question, but just wanted to circle back first on the organic sales guide. I mean just want to make sure that the takeaway is correct. The idea of the first quarter being flat, the second quarter you do expect it to improve. I'm just making sure we are all level set just giving the idea if it's flat in the first quarter, if the second quarter is not at least one or two, it makes the second half obviously a little more of a struggle. So I just want to make sure we level set on that. So if you can give us some perspective. But my real question, food and welding, the food and welding are going to be over 55% in dollar terms of your EBIT growth. I mean, sorry, the organic sales growth. In those businesses, good to see food pickup at least on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter. Can you give us any help with a backlog number, an order number, just something kind of looking into 2019 that gives us some perspective of the starting point of growth sort of already booked relative just given their significance to the overall growth for 2019? Scott Santi : I'll answer the second and throw it back to Michael for the first. These are all short cycled businesses from the standpoint of \u2013 if we get an order today, we ship it tomorrow. What I can tell you is book-to-bill and both businesses in Q4 was positive. So order rates are at or above shipman rates in Q4. We don't build \u2013 these aren't big backlog businesses is my point. These are given the way we deliver. If we get an order today, we ship it tomorrow, we don't build backlog. But it's from the standpoint of just order rates relative to shipment rates in Q4 on both businesses were pretty solid. Michael Larsen : Yes. That's where I was going to go with this, welding just grew organically 8%. On a tough comp, there were up 6% in Q4 last year. Food Equipment up 5%, organics have good momentum in those two businesses. In terms of the Q1, Q2 question, without telling you anything new really, I mean we did say that we have one that's shipping day in the first quarter, which lowers our overall organic growth rate by mathematically 1.5%. We do not have that headwind in Q2, so I don't know if that helps you in terms of what Q2 might look like. That\u2019s probably the best I can give you. David Raso : Okay. I appreciate it. Just if you do 0%, 2% then it's 3.5%, 2.5%, it feels a little bit better than 0%... Michael Larsen : Yes. David, keep in mind that 1.5% in Q1 that mathematically we lose from one less day. We get that back in Q3. David Raso : Exactly. I just want to make sure we weren't starting second quarter at one or less, so it just gets more challenging. But I appreciate it. Thank you so much. Scott Santi : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Karen Fletcher : Okay. Yes, thank you, Sheryl. We've run a bit over. If you have any other questions or follow-up, please reach out to me today and thank you for your time this morning. Operator : Thank you for participating in today's conference call.

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Karen Fletcher, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin. Karen Fletcher : Thank you, Cheryl. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to ITW's First Quarter 2019 Call. I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi, along with Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen. During today's call, we will discuss first quarter financial results and provide an update on our 2019 full year outlook. Slide 2 is a reminder that this presentation contains our financial forecast for the remainder of the year as well as other forward-looking statements identified on this slide. We refer you to the company's 2018 Form 10-K for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Also, this presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of those measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release. So let's turn to Slide 3 and I'll turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi. Scott Santi : Thank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. Overall, we had a solid start to the year, and the first quarter played out about as expected with EPS of $1.81, coming in modestly above the midpoint of our guidance. The ITW team continued to execute well on the things within our control, delivering 100 basis points of benefits from Enterprise Initiatives and an operating margin of 24.3%, excluding 70 basis points of margin impact due to accelerated restructuring investments.  We delivered 27.7% after-tax return on invested capital and a 21% increase in free cash flow. Sales started out a little slow across the board in January before picking up the pace in February and March. Organic revenue was down 1.5% or flat excluding the impact of one less shipping day in the quarter. Our auto OEM sales declined 6% as auto production in North America, Europe and China was down a combined 8%. That being said, we are seeing some signs of stabilization in Europe and China auto markets and expect to see some modest improvement in the back half of the year. The 6% decline in auto OEM revenues reduced our Q1 organic growth rate by 1.5% at the enterprise level. One less shipping day was another 1.5% and PLS was 70 basis points as expected.  As we discussed on the last call, we had a pretty heavy restructuring agenda in Q1 as we accelerated our 2019 plans into the first quarter, a significant portion of which was directed at our auto OEM business in Europe in order to adjust our costs to current demand levels. As we also discussed on our January call, we knew that the first quarter and, in fact, the first half had some challenges in terms of year-on- year comparisons : the currency translation, accelerated restructuring, a slightly higher tax rate, one less shipping day, tougher organic growth comps and auto production declines in Europe and China. And that these challenges would dissipate and the operating environment would be much more favorable in the back half of the year. Coming out of Q1, things are playing out largely as we anticipated. We are executing well on our long-term enterprise strategy and on our 2019 operating plan. And as a result, we remain firmly on track to deliver on our full year EPS and margin improvement guidance. I'll now turn the call over to Michael who will provide you with some additional detail on our Q1 performance and our outlook for the balance of the year. Over to you, Michael. Michael Larsen : Thank you, Scott, and good morning. GAAP EPS of $1.81 came in above our guidance midpoint of $1.78. As expected, year-over-year EPS headwinds included $0.07 of foreign currency impact, $0.06 of higher restructuring costs and $0.03 of higher tax rate, which combined for $0.16 unfavorable EPS impact in the quarter. Excluding these headwinds, Q1 EPS would have been $1.97, an increase of 4% over last year. It is important to note that we expect these specific headwinds to significantly moderate as the year progresses. More on that later in my remarks. In addition, as we mentioned on the last call, Q1 also had 1 less shipping day, which was approximately $0.03 to $0.04 unfavorable impact to EPS and 1.5 percentage point reduction to organic growth. As a reminder, we get that shipping day back in Q3. Organic revenue for the quarter was down 1.5%, below our guidance due to the slower start in January and flat on an equal day basis. Sales trends improved in February and March as March organic revenue was up 2% year-over-year on an equal day basis. In line with our expectations, PLS impact related to 80/20 activities was 70 basis points this quarter. Operating margin of 23.6% improved 20 basis points, excluding 70 basis points of accelerated restructuring impact. Once again, strong execution on Enterprise Initiatives contributed 100 basis points. Another bright spot was stronger pricing and moderating raw material inflation, which resulted in better-than-expected price/cost margin impact in Q1. Cash flow performance was also a highlight as free cash flow increased 21% with a conversion rate of 90%, which is seasonally strong for the first quarter. Return on invested capital was 27.7% and finally, we repurchased $375 million of our shares as planned. As Scott said, the ITW team executed really well on the things within our control and other than the slow start in January, this was a pretty solid quarter for ITW.  Moving to Slide 4 for some detail on operating margin. Overall, 23.6% operating margin in Q1 as I mentioned. And on the bottom left of the slide, we laid out the positive price/cost trends that I just referenced. Strong pricing across all segments more than offset moderating raw material costs on a dollar basis, resulting in improving price/cost dynamics in Q1 and going forward. On the right side, Enterprise Initiatives continue to be our most significant and most consistent contributor to margin performance. Our 80/20 initiatives and Strategic Sourcing efforts combined for 100 basis points of margin improvement. And that impact is broad-based. In the quarter, Enterprise Initiatives benefits ranged from 70 to 130 basis points across each of our seven segments.  This quarter, revenues were down, resulting in 30 basis points of negative volume leverage, only 10 basis points of margin dilution from price/cost, which was our best performance since the fourth quarter 2016 and 40 basis points of other, which is primarily related to employee costs, specifically our typical annual salary and wage increases. Going forward, we expect to return to our normal run rate of 10 to 30 basis points for this line item in the remaining quarters of 2019. This brings us to net 20 basis points of margin expansion before adding the impact of 70 basis points from restructuring, which considering the negative volume impact this quarter, is pretty solid performance. Even with the higher restructuring, operating margin was strong at 23.6% and the good news is that we have significantly more runway for improvement as the year progresses and over the next few years as we shared at our Investor Day in December. Please turn to Slide 5 for details on segment performance. The table on the left summarizes organic growth both as reported and normalized on an equal days basis. As you can see, six segments had flat to positive organic revenue growth on a worldwide basis despite the slower start to the year, with automotive OEM the only segment that declined due to the decline in automotive production this quarter. On a geographic basis, North America organic revenue was up 1% while international was down 1%. For the year, we're expecting low single-digit growth in all major regions based on current run rates and our risk-adjusted view of auto build forecasts. On that point, IHS forecasts combined auto build growth for North America, Europe and China to be plus 4% in the second half. Our risk-adjusted view puts those combined builds flat for the second half, 4 points lower, which is the scenario embedded in our annual guidance. More on that a little later in my remarks. This brings us to the right side of the slide on Automotive OEM segment results. Overall, organic revenue was down 6%. IHS data for Q1 build rates in North America, Europe and China combined saw the decline of 8% in the quarter in what remains a pretty dynamic industry environment. That said, there's some optimism in the industry and amongst our teams on the ground that builds would bottom out in the first half. Again, looking at North America, Europe and China combined, IHS projects auto production to be down 6% in the first half, followed by 4% growth in the second half. And as I just mentioned, our current guidance reflects an assumption of only 1 -- flat growth in auto production, no growth in auto production in the back half of the year. Our North American business was down 6% with Detroit 3 production down significantly. As expected, in the quarter, builds were also down in Europe and China. In Europe, the implementation of the WLTP emissions testing procedures last year continues to cause some auto production disruption although this situation seems to be normalizing. And in China, auto retail sales were down double digits in the quarter. Automotive operating margin declined 350 basis points this quarter. As planned, restructuring related to our adjusting cost structure in Europe and EF&C acquisition integration reduced margins by 190 basis points. Despite the fact that we're beginning to trend positive on price in this segment and actually getting positive price in the first quarter, price/cost reduced margins by 110 basis points. Just stepping back for a minute from some of these near-term challenges in the auto market. Our new program wins remain strong as does our new product pipeline. Our annual new program win targets equate to 2% to 3% of above-market organic growth, and we have met or exceeded those targets for each of the last three years and expect to do so again in 2019. Overall, we have a strong and focused business operating in a well-defined, highly value-added niche in the auto market. And we deliver a ton of value to our customers in serving that niche as reflected in both our level of profitability and in our organic growth rate over the last five years. As you all know, this is an industry that's going through significant change, and in our view, the trends and changes that will play out in the auto industry over the next decade or so only add to the significant future profitable growth potential that ITW has in this space. There's no question that we're in a challenging point in time with regard to the auto market, and we are taking the appropriate steps to adjust our cost structure accordingly.  In fact, we're performing quite well in the current auto downcycle as reflected in our ability to maintain auto OEM segment operating margins well above 28% despite a meaningful year-over-year revenue decline over the past two quarters. We will continue to manage our way through these near-term demand challenges, but our primary focus remains on acting and investing to position ITW to take full advantage of the significant long-term profitable growth potential that we have ahead of us in our niche of the auto market. Moving on to Slide 6. Food Equipment organic growth was up 3% on an equal days basis, which follows the best quarter in four years. You will recall that Q4 organic growth was up 5%. In North America, organic growth was 2% with equipment flat and service up a strong 4%. Growth in independent restaurants and QSR was solid, partially offset by a decline in institutional, where we had a tough comp of 10% growth in the prior year quarter. Food retail was a bright spot, up double digit and we're encouraged to see a sequential recovery taking shape there. Overall, current run rates, coupled with new product introductions, support our view that sales trends will improve from here as the year progresses. With respect to international markets, Europe grew mid-single digits, primarily on strong performance in our ware wash division. Operating margin was almost 25% with Enterprise Initiatives and volume leverage offsetting the impact from restructuring activity in this segment. Test & Measurement and Electronics had a solid quarter with organic revenue up 1% on an equal days basis against a tough comp of 8% organic growth in the prior year. As expected, Test & Measurement was down 2% on lower sales to semiconductor equipment manufacturers. Excluding semiconductor, Test & Measurement was up 5%. Electronics was up 1% with strong sales in equipment assembly and contamination control, partially offset by a decline in electronic components where we had a 9% growth comp last year. Operating margin expanded 70 basis points to 24.1% with Enterprise Initiative benefits, the main driver. On to Slide 7. Welding had a solid quarter despite the fact that organic growth was off to a slow start in January, in part as our main operations in Wisconsin was shut down for two days due to weather. Welding ended up 5% on an equal day basis against a tough comp of 8% last year. As you can see on this slide, organic growth was fairly consistent across-the-board with equipment and consumables both up in the 3% to 4% range. North America industrial was up 3% against a comp last year of 15% and Commercial was up 5%. International growth was particularly strong in China, up more than 20% while Oil & Gas was essentially flat. Based on current run rates, we continue to expect organic growth of 3% to 6% this year against a tough 2018 comp of 10%. Operating margin was 28.1%, up 40 basis points in the quarter. Polymers & Fluids organic growth was up 1% on an equal days basis. As we talked about on the last call, we expected auto aftermarket to be down following strong 7% growth in the fourth quarter driven by new product launch. Polymers was up 2% while Fluids was up 1% and operating margin expanded 40 basis points in this segment as well. Turning to Slide 8. Construction organic revenue was flat on an equal days basis. North America was down 3% due primarily to a tough comp with Q1 last year, up 7%. Residential remodel sales were essentially flat while new construction was impacted by softness in U.S. housing starts. Commercial construction was down 4%. Recent sales trends support our view here that we expect sales to improve going forward as comparisons ease and new products are introduced. Europe grew a strong 5% with robust demand across-the-board. Australia and New Zealand sales were down 6% similar to the fourth quarter with some continued softness in the economy. Specialty organic growth was flat on an equal days basis with solid organic growth of 6% in the equipment businesses offset by softness and consumables. Specifically, a few division internationally including graphics and appliances. Overall, international is down 6% and North America grew 2%. Operating margin was essentially flat at 26.5%. Moving on to Slide 9 and an update on 2019 guidance. As you saw this morning, we are reiterating our full year EPS guidance range of $7.90 to $8.20, which represents 4% to 8% growth year-over-year. We now expect organic growth in the range of 0.5% to 2.5%, given the slow start in January. Our guidance is based on current demand run rates and a risk-adjusted second half forecast for auto builds as we talked about. This compares to prior guidance for organic growth of 1% to 3%. And other than the slow start to the year, our outlook for organic growth through the rest of the year is essentially unchanged. As we talked about on the last call, we fully expected going into 2019 that the first half of the year was going to be more challenging for a number of specific reasons as many of these challenges would dissipate such as the operating environment will be more favorable in the back half of the year. As Scott mentioned, this dynamic is pretty much as expected, and our current view of the year is pretty much in line with the organic revenue guidance ranges by segment and the EPS bridge that we provided on our last call. Because the first half of 2019 will be a little more challenging than what is typical for us in terms of year-over-year comparisons, I'll spend a minute describing how we expect some of these challenges to play out as the year progresses.  On Slide 3, we sized the EPS impact in Q1 from foreign currency translation impact, restructuring costs and tax rate for a total of $0.16 year-over-year. For Q2, we expect currency impact at current rates of about $0.06 and higher restructuring activity of about $0.03 for a total of $0.09 in Q2, which adds up to about $0.25 per share for the first half of 2019. These 3 items are still headwinds year-over-year in the second half but only to the tune of $0.05 to $0.10. In other words, we expect to see an improvement to second half EPS of $0.15 to $0.20 versus the first half on currency, restructuring and tax.  Now let's talk about organic growth. First, in terms of sales comparisons year-over-year, we have one more challenging organic growth comparison ahead of us in Q2 and then comps get significantly easier in the second half. Second, there's one extra shipping day in the third quarter, which as I mentioned, adds 1.5 percentage points to our Q3 organic growth rate. Third, auto builds for the combined regions, North America, Europe and China, are expected to improve significantly in the second half. As I mentioned earlier, IHS forecasts builds in these combined regions will be up 4% and our guidance has risk-adjusted this down to builds being flat. Therefore, based on current run rates, easier comps, the extra shipping day and our risk-adjusted view of auto builds, we expect organic growth in the second half will be in the range of 3% to 4%.  Finally, on the margin side, we talked about much improved price/cost dynamics with stronger pricing and more favorable raw material costs. At this point, price/cost margin impact is essentially neutral, and on a dollar basis, price remains significantly higher than the raw material costs. In addition, we expect that restructuring benefits related to the projects that we accelerated into the first half will start to give benefits in the second half of the year. The average payback on the projects that we approved in the first half are less than a year, and the savings projected for the second half on these projects are expected to be in the $25 million to $30 million range. The most significant and consistent driver of margin improvement remains the Enterprise Initiatives where we have clear line of sights to projects and activities that support at least 100 basis points of improvement every quarter going forward and for the full year. And as I said earlier, we're off to a strong start in free cash flow and expect conversion above 100% of net income for the year. And as you know, we've allocated $1.5 billion to share repurchases in 2019. Before I wrap up my prepared comments, just a few words on our portfolio management activities. Overall, we're on track to complete some of [indiscernible] of our planned divestitures in 2019, pending Board approval. Given the quality of these ITW businesses, we're seeing solid interest and attractive valuations. As we complete the project schedule for 2019, they will trigger some pretty significant gains on sale and cash proceeds, all of which are excluded from our current guidance. As we have stated before, the divestiture of these long-term growth challenge divisions, when completed by the end of 2020, are expected to be accretive, favorable to our overall organic growth rate and margins in the tune of 0.5 point of organic growth and 100 basis points of margin expansion. And as a reminder, we're committing to making sure that these divestitures are EPS-neutral, and we plan to offset any EPS dilution with incremental share repurchases above the $1.5 billion in our plan today. In summary, as we have for the past 6-plus years, we delivered on our quality commitments despite some near-term challenges that we continue to expect will dissipate in the back half of the year. Overall, we're set up for a stronger second half in terms of delivering solid organic growth with best-in-class margins and returns, accelerating earnings growth and strong free cash flows. With that, Karen, back to you. Karen Fletcher : Okay. Thanks, Michael. We're going to open up the lines for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Cheryl, back to you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Andy Kaplowitz. Andrew Kaplowitz : Scott or Mike, I think you mentioned international being down 1%. What was Europe specifically? In last quarter, you mentioned basically you're just seeing some isolated weakness in Europe mostly in auto. Is that still what you're seeing in Europe and what do you expect for the year there? Michael Larsen : Yes, I mean, in Europe, the biggest -- so Europe overall was down 2%. As you point out, the biggest decline by far was the automotive OEM business. If you take that out, we're actually positive in Europe. We're seeing some pretty good performance. I mentioned Construction Products, up 5%; Food Equipment, up 4% and like I said, the biggest delta was really the automotive business. Andrew Kaplowitz : Okay, that's helpful. And maybe just stepping back. I mean, we like to follow your CapEx-driven businesses like Test & Measurement, ex-Semicon and Welding, they do seem to be hanging there well and you mentioned some improvement in March sales. Did these businesses generally just sort of do well throughout the quarter? Do you have good visibility you think still in the sort of core Test & Measurement and Welding businesses as you move forward? Michael Larsen : Yes, I mean, I think we saw pretty consistently across-the-board a slower start to the year as we talked about in January. But from there on, Welding, Test & Measurement, Food Equipment really improved in February and March and are on track to deliver on the organic growth guidance that we provided on the last call. So Food Equipment, up 3% to 5% for the year; Test & Measurement, tough comp, up 1% to 3%; and Semicon is a 2-percentage-point drag. As you know, we risk-adjusted our Semicon exposure and hopefully we have a pretty conservative view for Test & Measurement. Welding, up 10% last year. We expect to be up 3% to 6% this year. So the CapEx businesses, as you pointed out, are performing well. I'd add maybe to that from a pricing standpoint, that's also the case. Scott Santi : I think the only thing I would add is they are -- to your visibility question, Andy, these are book-and-ship businesses, so these are not long lead time businesses. So we are certainly seeing pretty steady performance right now. But these are not businesses where we have long lead times associated with them. So conditions on the ground right now seems to be up hanging in there pretty well. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Joseph Ritchie : [Technical Difficulty]. First half versus second half? And I know that in the Q, we'll get more information around price/cost. But... Scott Santi : Joe, we were cut off, I think, from the starting part of your question. Can you back up from the beginning, please? Joseph Ritchie : Yes, sure. Sure, no problem. I'll start by again saying good morning. And so -- and so I said that Michael had provided some really good color on the first half, second half. And I was getting to my question which was really around price/cost and I know that this will come in the Q. But maybe if you could just provide a little bit more color around where you're seeing price/cost, what you saw in the segments this quarter and then how you see that progressing? Are there certain segments that are going to be better than others as we progress through 2019? Michael Larsen : I'd say across-the-board, Joe, we saw positive price in all segments, including, for the first time in a while, in the automotive business. So pricing was slightly ahead of our expectations for Q1. And similarly on the cost side, we talked about last year moderating raw material costs. That certainly played out in Q1. And so last year, if you recall, total price/cost was 50 basis points of margin impact even though we're certainly positive on a dollar basis. We just did 10 basis points here of negative margin impact in Q1. And these cost dynamic -- price/cost dynamics are trending positive for the balance of the year. In terms of by segment, I would just point out, I mean, auto, as you know, even though positive on price, it can be a little challenging. It takes a little longer as we talked about before to get price there. But really, all the other segments across the board really strong pricing performance. Scott Santi : And maybe the other color I would add is essentially what the environment we are seeing across the board is moderating raw material cost inflation and the impact of prior price moves ultimately continue to play out in terms of the year-over-year comps. So there's always a lag between the costs and the pricing response. And so it's -- given the things continue to stay stable from input cost standpoint, we are picking up some added benefit on the price side. And that's what I think what we saw in Q1 and sitting here to-date, what we would expect to see through the balance of the year. Joseph Ritchie : Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just two real quick clarifications. Michael, you talked about flat auto builds as your assumption in the second half of the year. Is there still an outgrowth assumption embedded in your forecast? And then the second quick question clarification was really around corporate. That number was lower than we expected this quarter. How should we think about that than for the rest of the year? Michael Larsen : Can you just repeat the second part, Joe? Joseph Ritchie : Yes, the second one was around was... Michael Larsen : The second question. Joseph Ritchie : Yes, the corporate number was lower than we expected this quarter. Michael Larsen : Yes, I think that's a pretty good -- I would take -- on the corporate side, our corporate costs are pretty much flat year-over-year on an annual basis. It can move around a little bit on a quarterly basis, but I would probably model last year. For the auto question, yes, there is -- for the full year, we're expecting, as we talked about, 2 to 3 percentage points of auto outgrowth, maybe at the lower end of that range here for the second half, just again trying to be a little bit more conservative in a pretty dynamic environment. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Volkmann from Jefferies. Stephen Volkmann : So Michael, lots of discussion around sort of first half, second half but I noticed you guys didn't provide sort of a specific guide on the second quarter. And the streets got you sort of flattish, I guess, for the next three quarters. And I guess I just wanted to make sure there wasn't a little more detail you wanted to provide around that. Michael Larsen : Yes. I think Q2 will look, in terms of organic growth, pretty similar to what we just reported for Q1. I think we do have the shipping day issue goes away in Q2 but this -- the first half is going to be, as we expected, pretty challenging. And so I guess that's the color that I will provide on Q2 and the first half. Stephen Volkmann : Okay, fair enough. And then just a quick follow-up on Test & Measurement. Looks like semiconductor was really sort of what dragged that down. What are you hearing or seeing relative to semiconductor as we go forward? Michael Larsen : Yes. So really no change to our view. We have, just as a reminder, about $200 million of Semicon exposure. The assumptions that we built into the plan this year was that to -- for that to be down double digits and we've not changed that view. But like you, we've certainly heard some of the more positive commentary from industry experts and customers as it relates to the back half of the year, but we have not adjusted anything in our guidance for Semicon. And so like I said, hopefully, that, that will turn out just like auto to be a fairly conservative view. Operator : Our next question comes from Jamie Cook, Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Jamie Cook : I guess two questions. The comments that you made about things improving in March, you feel like that's consistent with what we've heard from other industrial companies. Can you just speak to what geographies or segments sort of that was most pronounced in, I guess, is what I would say?  And then just my second question on the guide, I know you're taking organic growth down a little and you talked about the shipping days, your EPS -- but your margin expansion of 100 bps is still the same. Just on the like low organic growth, what's -- how do we still get the same margin improvement on sort of somewhat low organic growth would change quarter-to-quarter? Michael Larsen : Yes, Jamie, you can do the math yourself and 0.5 point of organic growth in terms of EPS impact is in that mid- to high single-digit EPS impact, and the biggest driver kind of working the other way is the price/cost dynamic that we talked about. It really offsets that plus a couple of other puts and takes. But then it's really improved -- improving price/cost dynamics is why we are holding EPS guidance for the full year despite the lower organic growth. And then to your first question, this February, March dynamic vibe, that was pretty broad-based all segments. And if you look at the major geographies, we really saw the same dynamics in terms of a slower start to the year and then sequential improvements in February and March above our typical seasonality. So that's certainly encouraging and that's how it played out in the first quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research. Jeffrey Sprague : Just a couple for me. First, just on the trajectory into Q2. Given that it sounds like you exited March a bit better and we're not going to be talking about government shutdown or weather and everything else that was rolling on, why wouldn't you expect some acceleration in the organic growth rate in the second quarter relative to what you printed here today? Michael Larsen : Yes, I think, Jeff, it's -- the comp is a little bit tougher. I believe we were up 4% in Q2 last year and so certainly, your points are valid. It's just the comp is a little bit more difficult in Q2. Jeffrey Sprague : And then just to clarify on the restructuring, Michael. The $0.09 in the first half, that's just the gross cost of the restructuring or is there some net benefit from the actions already kind of showing up in that number? Michael Larsen : That's just the gross number. And that is -- it is the increase year-over-year in restructuring costs. And so I think we -- year-over-year, $0.10 is the higher restructuring cost, and of that, $0.09 are really in the first half of the year. Jeffrey Sprague : Okay, got it. And then just on back to price/cost. Are you able to continue to push price higher now in this environment or this is more about kind of analyzing the steps you've made and trying to kind of hold onto it maybe as costs start to slip the other way? Michael Larsen : Yes, this is -- I think the big effort was around offsetting raw material costs, including tariff impact and we've essentially done that at this point and we're entering into a more normal pricing environment on a go-forward basis. Certainly, we benefit from the fact, as Scott said, that there was a lag last year. We've kind of -- we've neutralized that and we are trending in a more positive direction. But we also don't expect, to answer your question, that there was going to be price reductions. We will be able to hold on to what we have implemented so far, and we're just benefiting here in the near term from the raw material costs being a little bit better. Operator : Our next question comes from Joel Tiss from BMO. Joel Tiss : I wonder if, can you just -- I don't know if you mentioned this or not but the PLS for the year, I know you're jamming a lot into the first half. Is it going to be pretty much done? Or are there more things that you can pull out in the second half if you need to? Michael Larsen : Yes, I mean, it's really not a number that we manage at the -- it's sort of... Scott Santi : Certainly, manage over the time. Michael Larsen : It's more an outcome of the hundreds of activities and projects going on across the company. And so it was 70 basis points in the first quarter and our view for the year has not changed at 80 basis points. Joel Tiss : Okay. And is it too early to frame for us the kind of earnings dilution you might get from divesting those seven underperforming businesses? Michael Larsen : Well, we're not going to get the -- I mean, we are going to get some -- these businesses are profitable businesses. And so there are some earnings going away, but we'll more than -- the plan is to make that neutral by offsetting any earnings dilution by incremental share repurchases above the $1.5 billion that is in the plan. Scott Santi : $1.5 billion. Michael Larsen : $1.5 billion. Did I say $1.5 million? $1.5 billion that's in the plan. Operator : Our next question comes from Andy Casey from Wells Fargo. Andrew Casey : Just wanted to -- the cadence that you talked about, the slow January getting better through March and you mentioned it was pretty broad-based geographically. Could you -- and Jeff kind of touched on some of this in his question. Can you kind of talk about what you were hearing for the reasons behind that in the U.S. and then also for international markets? Michael Larsen : Yes. I mean, Jeff mentioned a few of them. I mean, I think it's difficult to quantify things like weather, for example. But we do know that our operations in Wisconsin in our Welding business were closed down for two days and you can -- that's certainly had an impact. But beyond that, it's really difficult too. Scott Santi : I would say there's sort of obvious promise it would have been if this was -- would have been isolated to North America or U.S., it was weather and the government shutdown. The fact that it was pretty consistent in our international business was certainly surprising. And to be honest with you, I don't think we've heard any great answers or theories necessarily other than it was certainly there as a factor seems to have moderated as we move through the quarter. But it was a really -- it's called an interesting early part of the quarter this year. Andrew Casey : And then for auto, the EF&C acquisition integration, it seemed to accelerate a little bit from what you can see in the fourth quarter. Is that a correct read and how do you long do you expect that to persist as a headwind to margins? Michael Larsen : I would -- these were -- these were planned activities just as we put together the acquisition integration plans. I think if anything, they were planned for this year and we moved them forward by a couple of quarters. But those were activities that were planned all along. Scott Santi : We're pretty focused in Europe, so some of the acceleration is -- although as Michael said, they were planned, some of the acceleration is really around in response to the dip in production rates in Europe. And in addition to that, some other restructuring in our core auto businesses in Europe. But the normal integration process, Andy, is typically 3 to 5 years, so these are essentially normal going forward with EF&C. And so certainly would expect that slowdown in another year or so in terms of specific restructuring around EF&C. Andrew Casey : Just a follow-up on that. Should we pretty much expect the sort of a headwind through this year or should it dissipate as the year goes along? Michael Larsen : The bulk of the restructuring -- 75% of our restructuring this year will be done in the first half of the year. So there's going to be a benefit when you look at the second half relative to the first half when we get to the second of the year. Scott Santi : In terms of less year-to-year headwind and also in terms of benefits from the investment... Michael Larsen : Right, there's two dynamics here. That's a good point. I mean, there's lower restructuring costs in the second half of the year and you're starting to see the benefits from the projects that we are executing right now and that we've approved for the first half of the year and quantified that at $25 million to $30 million. So $0.05 to $0.06 a share of benefit here in the second half relative to the first half. Operator : Our next question comes from Mig Dobre from Baird. Mircea Dobre : My question is on Food Equipment starting there. So frankly, this was a little bit slower than what I anticipated in terms of your organic growth in the quarter. And I'm wondering if you can provide a little more color here. I understand you mentioned a tough comp in institutional but at least looking back through the data that I've got, it looked to me like from an overall segment perspective, Q1 was really your easiest comp in Food Equipment. And I guess what I'm wondering here, as the comparisons gets tougher as the year progresses, how do you think about growth here and what's happening in front? Michael Larsen : It's tough to hear what you were saying, Mig. But I'll do my -- the volume was a little low. But I think Food Equipment, similar to the other segments we talked about, a little bit of a slower start but then picked up good momentum in February and March up 3% equal days after up 5% in Q4. I think in North America, what's encouraging is the restaurant side, and QSR was growing in the mid- to high single digits. Food retail was up significantly year-over-year, which is the grocery stores. And then the challenge was really some comps on the institutional side. And so those are -- those can be bigger projects that move around, were up 10% on the institutional side last year.  And so like we said, with current run rates, we've got some new products coming in, anecdotally, quoting activity, backlog, order activity all points to a pretty solid year here with 3% to 5% growth. And like I said, new products, retail is improving, Europe's pretty strong and looking good for the rest of the year. So we're pretty confident with our... Scott Santi : And the service business growing by the best quote, that is growing 4% to 5%. Michael Larsen : Yes, service up 4%, it was certainly encouraging. So we're on track here, Mig. It would be our current view. Mircea Dobre : Okay, okay. I appreciate that. Then switching to Welding. So you mentioned a couple of missed shipping days in Q1. I'm presuming this is, I don't know, as much as 300 basis points worth of growth to that segment. When do you expect to make those up? Is that lost business? Or do you just make it up in subsequent quarters? And of course, comps are getting tougher here as well, especially on a two year stacked basis. Do you think there's enough momentum in this market to allow you to really hit kind of this 3% to 6% guidance? Michael Larsen : Yes, I mean, the short answer is yes, we do. We are on track for 3% to 6% organic growth. It's really hard to quantify, of the two days the operation were closed down, how much did we get back in Q1, how much we're going to get back in Q2. I think when we look at -- broad-based, this is still pretty solid. If you look at the equipment up 3%, consumables up 4%, industrial business was up 3% against the tough comp, Commercial was up 5%, national is really good. China up 20%, we don't talk much about that and then Oil & Gas slowed a little bit. But I think some of that, you can maybe point to the rental business specifically and weather, if you want to. But we feel good about the outlook also in Welding for the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Ann Duignan from JPMorgan. Ann Duignan : My questions have been answered, but maybe a little bit more of a deep dive into Construction Products, both U.S. and international, just some commentary on what you're seeing in those markets. Michael Larsen : Yes. I think I sound like a broken record here, but this was a little bit of a slower start. North America was down, which is not typical. We did have a tough comp last year. The residential remodel side is still pretty solid, I think into the big box, kind of retail channel very good. Commercial was down 4%. That can move around a little bit and has kind of been flattish over the years. I'd say we certainly saw a pickup here in February, March, which is encouraging. We got some new products coming in our cordless technology that's going to get rolled out this year across all geographies. Europe really good, up 5%. And then Australia and New Zealand, as expected, down 6%, just like we did last year in the fourth quarter. And I think there, that's really more of a macro economy than anything else. So... Ann Duignan : Okay. And maybe some commentary on North America resi, we're seeing a slowdown in housing. Are you seeing any reacceleration and any color there on the housing side? Michael Larsen : There was a little bit of that in Q1. It's -- residential remodel overall was flat. The remodel side is positive, new housing -- new residential is a little slower. But I don't think there's a big macro commentary hear from us. I think we feel pretty good looking into Q2 and the balance of the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Joshua Pokrzywinski : So I know a lot of the questions have already been asked here. But -- and apologize if I missed this one around inventory destocking. We heard from 3M last hour that they saw a pretty good amount of destocking in auto, which I would imagine most of your exposure is more just-in-time. But just trying to get a sense for across the portfolio, anything you saw on a 4Q pre-buy or a 1Q destock that might not make 1Q look quite as slow as what it appears on the page? Scott Santi : I would say in the auto space certainly, as production drops, there is a bit of a compounding effect in terms of inventory at the tiers and even at the OEMs, so -- right? I know that I would call it sort of intentional destocking other than what I would describe it as, from our perspective, it would be just normalizing inventory levels based on lower production rates. But certainly, it's got some compounding effect beyond just the drop in actual end product production. So certainly, in auto, when you talk about declines in the high single digits, some of that was a factor, there's no doubt, in our organic sales in Q1 as well. Beyond that, I'm not aware of any pre-buy or any significant other actions in any of our other segments related to that. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Got it. And do you have any kind of above-normal price increase on Jan 1 that might have supported that even if it wasn't obvious to see that people would've looked at? Or is the pricing calendar was a little different? Scott Santi : From a pricing standpoint, we certainly had price increases in across our 87 divisions, there are certainly pricing actions that were -- that took place in Q4 and in early Q1. I can't say that any of it was so concentrated on January 1 that it wouldn't have had a big impact if were caused a, let's call it, a material pre-buy at the enterprise level anywhere. But at the division level, I'm sure there's was some puts and takes related to that. Michael Larsen : Yes, I would just add to that, I mean, the pricing activities have really been going on across the company for the last 6 to 9 months as we've worked to offset the raw material cost inflation. And so I would agree with Scott, we don't think anything unusual here, January 1. Operator : And our next question comes from Walt Liptak from Seaport. Walter Liptak : Just a couple of follow-ups that I can go through real quick. One, just to clarify, which segments are getting the restructuring? Michael Larsen : So if you look at the first half spend here, close to half of it is directed at auto automotive segment that we talked about. And the balance is really our typical kind of 80/20 front-to-back activities and it's pretty well suited across the segments. I think if you do the math, Construction, Specialty Products, Food Equipment, kind of in that order would be -- but it's pretty broad-based. Walter Liptak : Okay, great. And then the divestiture, I may have missed this but the timing of it is in the second quarter that we should expect those? Michael Larsen : So I think I more second half would be a realistic view. I think there's quite a bit of work that goes into getting these divestitures done. And so I think we expect second half of the year would expect the first ones to come through. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Fisher from UBS. Steven Fisher : You guys have done a very good job of being able to maintain your EPS despite the organic challenges in recent quarters or years. So I'm just curious if you stress tested that ability. I mean, we can do our own math on buybacks, but it seems like you may have called out some pricing strategies here. Just curious how much organic growth reduction you could phase in and still maintain your EPS guidance. So for example, if we would have to take another point out for the year if the second half didn't really come through. Kind of is that a level of which you could still hold your guidance? Michael Larsen : Yes, I think -- I would guess I'd just point to our track record over the last six years that we've done, I think, a pretty good job giving a realistic view of what the year might look like. And then we've executed really well to do better than that and I think we expect to be able to continue to do that. Steven Fisher : Okay. And then maybe just a follow-up to Mig's question on Welding. Are you anticipating that the organic growth would hit at or near the top end of the 3% to 6% range in the second half? And if so, is that China continuing that strong double-digit pace? Is it oil improving? How are you thinking about that? Michael Larsen : Yes. So as I think for Welding specifically, we are -- like we said, we are comfortable with the 3% to 6% for the year. We have a challenging comp here again in Q2. It gets a little easier in Q4. But beyond that, I can't really give you quarterly numbers for the Welding business in the second half. Karen Fletcher : We're near the end of the hour. How about we take one more question and end the call. Operator : Our final question will be from Nicole DeBlase from Deutsche Bank. Nicole DeBlase : Just one question on March. Is there any possibility that March is benefiting from the shift in Easter from March to April this year? And I guess maybe a way to talk about that is how is the strength you've seen in March continued into the early weeks of April? Michael Larsen : Yes. I mean, I don't have a really good answer to your question other than we saw sequentially better sales trends in February and in March than what we see historically in April, everything appears to be on track as we sit here today. Nicole DeBlase : And then on the price/cost impacts, if we kind of think about how costs are expected to wash through the year, if we assume that there's no major change in input costs from this point, kind of like flat and then the spot rate, is it possible that price/cost turns into a tailwind for you guys by the back half? Michael Larsen : Yes, that is a possibility. If -- and this -- I mean, a little bit, Nicole, because things are pretty dynamic, right, still. And so on the cost side, there's still the tariff dynamic, who knows... Scott Santi : And if you lock the cost right now. Michael Larsen : To answer your question, no, it's based on cost where they are today and where price is. Mathematically, it should turn positive in the back half of the year from a margin standpoint. Karen Fletcher : Okay. So with that, we'll end the call on the hour. I know you guys have a busy day today and I'm happy to take any follow-up questions afterwards. So thanks for joining us. Operator : Thank you for participating in today's conference call.

Good morning and welcome to ITW's Second Quarter 2019 Conference Call. I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi, along with Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen. During today's call, we will discuss second quarter financial results and provide an update on our 2019 full-year outlook. Slide 2 is a reminder that this presentation contains our financial forecast for the remainder of the year, as well as other forward-looking statements identified on this slide. We refer you to the company's 2018 Form 10-K for more details about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Also, this presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of those measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release. So with that I will turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi. Scott Santi : Thank you, Karen, and good morning. As you saw in our report this morning during the second quarter, we experienced a deceleration in demand across our portfolio. At the total company level, second quarter revenues came in 2% points or approximately $85 million below what they would have been had demand helped at the level we were seeing exiting Q1. Q2 revenues were down across all seven of our segments versus Q1 run rates with higher declines in CapEx related products, such as welding equipment. EPS came in at $1.91, down from $1.97 last year. In addition to external market factors, known headwinds primarily foreign currency translation and accelerated restructuring expense reduced EPS by 8% year-over-year in the quarter. Excluding the impact of these headwinds in a couple of small divestitures, this quarter EPS would have been $2 or an increase of 2%. As usual, as the quarter progressed, the ITW team executed well on the elements within our control, operating margin held solid at 24.1% supported by more than 100 basis points of benefits from enterprise initiatives. Despite negative volume leverage and excluding 30 basis points of restructuring impact operating margin improved 10 basis points year-on-year. The team also managed working capital well as we delivered a 14% increase in free cash flow this quarter. And after-tax return on invested capital was 28.6%. Based on the data available to us in the fact that we've only seen these slowing conditions for a couple of months, it is difficult to draw any conclusions as to whether this is a pause related to some near-term business tentativeness or something that may turn out to be more protracted.  And in terms of visibility for us, keep in mind that is a result of the service levels that we provide to our customers. The majority of our divisions are order today ship tomorrow businesses, and as a result we carry very little backlog across the company. That said, we have had contingency planning discussions with our segment leadership as to the adjustments that need to be made to our plans for the remainder of the year in light of the current operating environment. And as we always do, we are adjusting our full-year guidance in line with conditions on the ground as they exist today. Current run rates exiting Q2 projected through the remainder of the year would result in an organic revenue decline of 1% to 3% for the full-year. And as a result, we are reducing our full-year EPS guidance by 4% at the midpoint. All other assumptions are essentially unchanged and we continue to expect a stronger second half on a relative basis, as first half headwinds from foreign currency translation and higher restructuring expenses dissipate. While the combination of a decline in global auto market slowing manufacturing CapEx spending and significant business uncertainty has this operating in a challenging macro environment near term, our efforts over the last seven years have been focused on leveraging the strength and resilience of the ITW business model to position the company for long-term through the cycle performance. To that end, I would point out that despite the external challenges of the moment, in Q2 we delivered the third highest quarterly EPS in the 107-year history of the company. Looking ahead to the remainder of the year, while we will be prudent in making appropriate adjustments based on the near-term demand environment and continue to drive quality execution on the elements within our control, we remain focused on managing and investing to maximize the company's growth and performance over the long term. Our teams are executing aggressively on our Finish the Job strategy agenda,, and we continue to make solid and consistent progress in positioning the company to achieve our 2023 enterprise performance goals. With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Michael to give you more detail on our quarter. Michael? Michael Larsen : All right, thank you, Scott, and good morning. In the second quarter,, organic revenue declined 2.8% year-over-year as demand slowed across our portfolio versus demand levels exiting Q1 to the tune of approximately 2% points. Compared to Q1, Q2 year-over-year organic growth rate slowed in all segments with the most significant slowdown in Welding. Like geography, North America was down 2% and International was down 4% in both Europe and Asia Pacific. Of note, China was down 5% with Automotive, the main driver, and excluding automotive, China was up 1%. You will recall that we previously talked about the first half of the year and Q2 being challenging due to a number of known headwinds , namely currency and restructuring. Those items played out as we expected. GAAP EPS of $1.91 included $0.06 of unfavorable foreign currency translation impact, $0.02 of higher year-over-year restructuring expense and a penny loss related to two small divestitures in Specialty Products. We continue to expect that these first half headwinds moderate in the second half, and I'll provide more detail on the first half-second half dynamics on Slide 9. Excluding these three items, EPS would have been $2, an increase of 2% versus Q2 last year, which you might recall was a record quarter with EPS of $1.97, it was up 17% versus the prior year. As usual, our execution on the elements within our control was strong. Operating margin of 24.1% improved 10 basis points, excluding 30 basis points of accelerated restructuring impact. As you may recall in Q1, we made the decision to accelerate this year's planned restructuring projects into the first half of the year, a decision that sets us up well for the second half. Price was well ahead across from a dollar basis and margin neutral for the first time, first time since 2016 as pricing actions continue to more than offset moderating material costs. Enterprise initiatives were the largest driver again in terms of margin expansion and contributed 110 basis points this quarter with more to come. Free cash flow increased 14% and conversion was 98%, seasonally strong for second quarter. In terms of capital structure, we opportunistically refinanced our short-term debt and locked in annualized interest expense savings, equivalent to $0.07 a share. And we repurchased $375 million of our shares as planned. Overall in a softer macro environment than we expected entering into the quarter, ITW team executed well to essentially hold operating margins despite a 6% decline in revenues, grow free cash flow double digits, and deliver EPS of $1.91, the third highest in our company's history, the highest ever being Q2 last year. Let's go to Slide 4 for some detail on operating margin. Like I said, operating margin was a solid 24.1% as enterprise initiatives contributed 110 basis points. Setting aside the impact from higher restructuring year-over-year, operating margin was 24.4%, a 10 basis point improvement from last year despite negative volume leverage of 60 basis points. Price cost margin impact was neutral this quarter, thanks to strong pricing and moderating costs. You can see the sequential price/cost trends on the bottom left side of the slide. And if things stay broadly as they are, price/cost is on track to turn margin positive in the second half. The other category has a negative 40 basis points this quarter and includes 20 basis points of one-time items. Going forward, we expect the impact of the other category to normalize in the 10 to 30 basis points range in line with historical. So in summary, strong execution and margin performance with enterprise initiatives contributing 110 basis points again. And the enterprise initiatives impact is broad based ranging from 70 to 160 basis points across all seven segments. In fact in a few slides, you'll see some very strong margin performance in the segments including Polymers & Fluids up 160 basis points, Test & Measurement Electronics up 100 basis points, and Construction up 50 basis points, just to name a few. Turning to Slide 5. For details on segment performance. As we talked about on our last call, we expected Q2 to be pretty similar to Q1 based on the levels of demand we were seeing at the time we exited Q1. Based on historical data, we expected sales to be up approximately 3% from Q1 to Q2. In actuality, they were up only 1% as we experienced a broad based deceleration in demand as the quarter progressed. The chart on the left illustrates that point. This is a summary of segment organic growth rates year-over-year in Q1 versus Q2 and to make it apples to apples we equalized the number of shipping days in Q1 and you can clearly see the impact of slowing market conditions across the board with the largest decline in Welding, which was up 5% in Q1 and down 2% in Q2. At the enterprise level, where we were essentially flat year-over-year in Q1, Q2 ended up being down almost 3%. The decelerating demand occurred from May and June. And after only two months, we don't have enough data points to tell whether this is a pause or potentially more of a sustained slowdown. That said, our standard approach is to recalibrate our full year expectations and guidance based on the demand levels we were seeing exiting the second quarter, which essentially means that there is no second half reacceleration built into our guidance. We'll get into that in more detail on Slide 10. Now that's going to be more detail for each segment starting with Automotive OEM and similar to Q1 organic revenue was down 7% compared to the most recent IHS builds down 9% for North America, Europe and China combined. Despite the fact that this quarter included 130 basis points of Product Line Simplification, nearly half of which related to the ongoing integration of a European based acquisition. This segment still outgrew the underlying markets by comfortable margin. North America was down 6% as builds at the Detroit 3 where we have our highest content per vehicle, were down 6% in the quarter. In Europe, organic revenue was down 8% essentially in line with Q1, and beginning to show some signs of stabilizing. In China, organic revenue was down 12%. On a positive note, we continue to take full advantage of the long-term growth opportunities in this segment and a new product pipeline and new program wins remain strong positioning us for 2% to 3% of above market organic growth on a sustained basis. The segment is performing well in the current auto down cycle as evidenced by 22% plus margins despite some pretty sizable declines in revenue over the last four quarters. Operating margin was 22.1% with a significant contribution from enterprise initiatives again this quarter. We'll continue to manage our way through these near-term challenges and adjusting our cost structure as appropriate and focus our positioning the segment for the long term. Looking forward to the second half, even though IHS is forecasting that auto builds for North America, Europe and China combined will be flat versus down 8% in the first half, we are using current run rates which equate to a decline in builds of approximately 5% in the second half. Moving on to Slide 6. Food Equipment organic growth was solid up 2% with strong performance in our service business, which was up 4% and equipment of 1%. In North America, results were similar to the first quarter with 2% organic growth with modest growth in the equipment side and service up 4%. Growth in independent restaurants and QSR was solid up double digits, offset by a decline in institutional where we had a tough comp of 20% plus growth in the prior year quarter. Food retail was a bright spot again this quarter, also up double digits, as the recovery here appears to be taking hold. International organic growth was up 2% mostly on strength in Europe, which was up 4% offset by weakness in China. Operating margin expanded to 25.6% with enterprise initiatives,, the main driver. Test & Measurement and Electronics, Organic revenue was down 1%, excluding lower sales to semiconductor equipment manufacturers, which represent approximately $200 million. This segment organic growth would have been up 2%. As we have talked about before, we plan for semiconductor-related sales to be down double-digits this year. And so far things are playing out as expected. Test & Measurement was down 3%, up 4% excluding semiconductor and electronics was up 1%. Operating margin expanded 100 basis points to 24.5% with enterprise initiatives, the main driver. Turning to Slide 7. In Welding as we talked about earlier, we experienced significant deceleration in demand as the quarter progressed. Organic revenue declined by 2% against the challenging year-over-year comparison. Equipment sales globally were down 4% and the decline was broad based by end market. Consumables were flat. North America was down 3% with equipment sales down 5%, while filler metals were up 5%, suggesting that underlying Welding activity in North America is still fairly solid which is certainly a positive sign. International markets were flat and operating margin was the highest of our segments at 28.8%. Polymers & Fluids organic growth was flat with Polymers up 2%. Automotive aftermarket was flat and fluids were down 3%. Operating margin was up 160 basis points, driven by enterprise initiatives. Moving to Slide 8. Construction organic revenue was down 1% due to market softness in Australia-New Zealand, offset by a pretty good results in North America, which was up 2% with commercial construction up 5 and residential remodel up 3. Europe was stable up 1% and operating margin expanded 50 basis points due to enterprise initiatives. In specialty, organic revenue was down 6% versus a tough comparison of 4% percent, driven in large part by PLS and the performance of potential divestitures in this segment. PLS was almost a 1.5 of which two-thirds relates to a plant closure and the discontinuation of that product line. Organic growth in potential divestitures was lower in the quarter and reduced the overall organic growth rate for the segment by a little more than 2% points. The remaining core specialty was down about 2.5% against an apples-to-apples comparison of plus 8% in the second quarter last year. By geography, International was down 8%, and North America was down 5%. Operating margin declined due to negative volume leverage and higher restructuring. So let's move to Slide 9 for a summary of first half financial performance and how that sets us up for a stronger second half. As we've talked about before, we fully expect that the first half to be pretty challenging due to known headwinds and some tough comparisons versus prior year, including the fact that the first half last year was the most profitable first half ever in the history of the company as EPS increased 20%. As you can see EPS for the first half was 372, which included approximately $0.20 of year-over-year headwinds from both foreign currency translation impact and higher restructuring expense, both factors that will moderate in the second half. At this point, we have completed about 70% of our planned restructuring for the year and in current FX rates, the headwinds from currency begin to dissipate in Q3 and are essentially gone in Q4. As a result, the $0.20 year-over-year headwind in the first half is approximately $0.05 in the second half, so net positive of $0.15 from these two items alone. In addition, we have a number of tailwinds to EPS in the second half, starting with restructuring savings of about $0.05 from the first half projects that were accelerated. These are projects with typically less than one-year payback and other than the acquisition integration we talked about in our last call, they relate to our typical 80/20 front to back activities and are pretty well distributed across the segments. Furthermore, price cost dynamics are favorable, interest expense is lower as I mentioned earlier, and comparisons year-over-year get easier, and we have one extra shipping day in Q3. So overall, solid performance in the first half with a more challenging near-term environment, and importantly a better set up for the second half with organic growth at the enterprise level in line with the first half at current run rates, margin expansion year-over-year at the enterprise level and across the majority of our segments, strong cash flows and mid to high single-digit EPS growth year-over-year. In terms of the quarterly splits in the second half, we expect Q3 and Q4 to be fairly similar in terms of EPS. Q3 does have one more day but Q4 has favorability from lower restructuring expense and higher restructuring benefits, as well as no year-over-year currency headwind at current rates. Now let's talk about our updated 2019 guidance on Slide 10. As per usual process, we are updating full-year guidance to reflect current levels of demand. Run rates exiting Q2 adjusted for normal seasonality project the full-year organic revenue will be down 1% to 3%. This compares to our prior organic growth guidance of 0.5% to 2.5%. The reduction in organic growth rate from a midpoint of 1.5% to down 2% impact EPS by approximately $0.35. As a result, we now expect EPS to be in a range of $755 to $785 with the midpoint of $770 up slightly 1% versus $760 last year. Lower organic growth also translates to lower volume leverage, and as a result, we now expect that operating margin to be flat to up 50 basis points. As you saw, we're off to a strong start on cash flow in the first half and the full-year is expected to be strong with conversion well ahead of net income, and we expect to repurchase approximately $1.5 billion of our own shares for the full-year. Now a brief update on our portfolio management activities. Our divestiture activities are progressing well and we remain on-track to complete about half of our potential divestitures in 2019. Interest is strong and we expect to realize significant gains and cash proceeds upon divestiture, all of which is excluded from our guidance. As we have stated before, the positive impacts from the expected divestitures when completed by the end of 2020 include approximately 50 basis points of structural improvement to our overall organic growth rate and 100 basis points to operating margin. Not counting the gains on sale, we're planning for divestitures to be EPS neutral as any EPS dilution will be offset by incremental share repurchases, above and beyond the approximately $1.5 billion that I just mentioned. Before I hand it back over to Karen, let me just reiterate something that Scott said earlier. Given the strength of our core competitive advantages, the resilience of the ITW business model, our diversified high quality portfolio of businesses, and our team's ability to execute at a high level, we are well positioned to outperform across a wide range of economic scenarios. In terms of the near-term macro after only two months, it's too early to tell where near-term demand is headed, and so we're assuming current run rates will extend through the second half. And as we go forward, we'll continue to make the appropriate adjustments incorporating current market conditions and also remain focused on managing ITW and investing for the long term. So with that, Karen back to you. Karen Fletcher : Okay. Thanks Michael. So, I think I'll open up the line for questions. Operator : Our first question is from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Just two questions from me. And first for Scott, so just picking up where we ended on the call, what is the complexion of the cycle. I clearly understand the point that it is very early, you and I both have been around the block a few times. Looking at what you're seeing in some of your leading indicator type businesses or just customer behavior, could you share a little bit of context of how this looks or feels relative to other slowdowns that you've seen? You know what may be looks like a point of worry or what looks like reason to have some level of confidence that this might just be a pause and what in otherwise is a very long extended cycle? Scott Santi : Yes, I think that look across what we saw in the second quarter. It looks a lot more to me overall at some short-term tentativeness. I think Michael talked about the Welding business data is probably the most tangible data point where we saw a big deceleration in capital investment in the equipment side, but the filler metal business was up solidly mid-single digits in the quarter, which has that our customers are still Welding, the activity level is very high. And I think that's, if we look at the employment rate in the US, you look at a lot of, it's an environment where overall it looks much more like a short-term pause, some tentativeness certainly impacting capital investment decisions. You know it's certainly difficult for me to say after a couple of months that that is - it turns into something larger at this point, but we all know that it's a pretty uncertain environment right now, given all of the things going on from the standpoint of global trade issues and concerns and all that. So I think it's a couple of months, and it certainly was a meaningful data between Q1 and Q2 in terms of overall demand rates, but it is only a couple of months, and it certainly looks in terms of that data point in Welding and some other things like it is some, a bit of a pause, but I don't see anything that says this is the front end of, the end of the expansion cycle for sure. Jeff Sprague : Now I was just wondering, Michael, if you could clarify the comments you gave us on headwinds and tailwinds as it relates to FX and restructuring saves and the like. I believe those were sequential comments. Can you just clarify that and maybe put that in context of what the year would be? Michael Larsen : Yes. So that's the first-half headwinds from restructuring and from foreign exchange are $0.20 a share on a year-over-year basis. In the second half those same items, the headwind from that is only $0.05. So incrementally we get $0.15 year-over-year, better in the second half versus the first half. And that is as always assuming that foreign exchange rates stay where they are today. Jeff Sprague : And that's just relative to the restructuring costs. Jeff Sprague : Correct? And we've got benefits to think of. Michael Larsen : Yes, that is, that's a good catch. That's just the cost side. We are getting an incremental $0.05 of benefits from the restructuring activities, the projects that were implemented in the first half of the year as part of this acceleration that we've talked about before. So there's another $0.05 there. You have, if you want to go down this price cost is turning, beginning to turn positive if things stay where they are. We also have lower interest expense. I said $0.07 annualized. So we'll get about half of that in the second half of the year. We obviously had easier comps year-over-year, even though the organic growth rate is the same at current run rates. First half-second half and then we have one extra day in Q3 that we've talked about a number of times. The straight math on that is that's worth about $0.03 to $0.04, so. Operator : Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citi. Your line is open. Andy Kaplowitz : Michael, we know usually use current run rates when forecasting organic sales going forward, which is to clarify, you do have easier comparisons. You mentioned the extra day in Q3. So is it really just you're being conservative around auto builds because your forecast for declines in the second half is similar to your forecast in the first half? So you've been conservative for auto builds and then everything else kind of stays the same as June basically is how you do it? Michael Larsen : I wouldn't say we're being conservative. I think this is purely a mathematical calculation. We're taking existing run rate exiting Q2, projecting those into the back half of the year. And if you do that, we get to, if you do the math, our first-half was down 2% organic, we're saying the full year will be down two and therefore the second half will also be down two, but there is no subjective input to that calculation. Scott Santi : Keep in mind, Q1 was flat. So we are basically projecting exit Q2 run rates, not first half. Michael Larsen : That's right. These are Q2 run rate. Yes. Scott Santi : Which is why you get to even year-on-year with the extra day. Michael Larsen : Yes. Andy Kaplowitz : And then if you look at the specialty products, you talked about that divestitures there. But maybe if could you give us a little more color, obviously the detrimental there, a little bit weaker than the other segments. I think in the past you've talked about some tariff related headwind on that business. So could you talk about sort of what you're seeing? Is it specific to your appliances there? What's going on in that business? Michael Larsen : Well, I think, similar to the other businesses, we did see a slowdown in demand, but really the bigger delta, which is down 6% is what I was trying to explain with the higher PLS, the divestitures in the core business being down 2.5. On the margin side, I mean the enterprise initiatives were good. The drag is really volume leverage and then higher restructuring and that's, those are the key drivers of the margin performance. There is really no real trends that we can point to inside of these businesses that we can tie back to some macro factor. It's really broad based, lower demand in those businesses with a lot of PLS. We're working on the divestitures and so that's kind of the story on specialty. Andy Kaplowitz : But the step that Michael, you haven't seen with it with the 25% tariffs anymore impact on the margin side compliance or whatever. It's just, there is obviously uncertainty out there on the sales side, but no impact on the margin side, in that segment. Michael Larsen : That's correct. I mean this latest round of this 3 going from 10 to 25 really had a material impact on the company overall we're talking pennies of EPS and well managed and really that goes back to were largely a produce where we sell company and that's also true for specialty products. Operator : Our next question comes from Ann Duignan from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Ann Duignan : I'm just curious if you'd comment on price cost and by segment, what's your thoughts on how your ability to full pricing in an environment where demand is weakening and some of your input costs are probably declining particularly in 2020. Is there any segment in particular where we might see pressure on the business to give up pricing in the lower volume environment. Michael Larsen : No, I mean we do have a number of divisions with index pricing. Of course, those will have to adjust to contracts. But there is really when we look across the board here price continues to improve in Q2 relative to Q1. On a dollar basis and that is true across the board. As you know, automotive is a little bit more challenging. Just given the way the contracts are structured, but across the board. We're really pleased with the price performance and we're entering into more of a normal pricing environment I say we've neutralized the cost impact including the modest tariff impact we just talked about and this issue for now as things there, they are essentially behind us and to be very specific, there is no actions to give price back really all we were trying to do is cover our material cost increases as those increases went through. Ann Duignan : Okay, thank you, good color and\u2026 Michael Larsen : We expect to have answered most of it going forward. Ann Duignan : Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe you could comment on what you're seeing out in the marketplace. I know you talked about maybe a pullback in capital spending, but it was interesting to see that you're automotive aftermarket business was flat and I would have top of that was tied to consumer discretionary spending, which has remained resilient versus maybe business CapEx. So maybe just talk about what you're seeing in that business in particular. Michael Larsen : Yes, I mean there is not much automotive aftermarket has been a grower in the low single digits here and I think there were a couple of things, there is a small portion of their sales that is tied to overall automotive production. But beyond that, there is this business correlates more to miles driven than anything else and we didn't really see much of a, there will be changes in this segment in this, in this business in the quarter. Ann Duignan : Okay, so no kind of the consumer slowing down I think what we can. Michael Larsen : No, I think we. And the thing I would add that there is some within quarters in that business. There are some impacts from the launch of new programs or new product launches. So I think overall the demand there our view is pretty positive. Overall , in Q2, but we can certainly go back and take a look at whether there is a specific issue related to a prior year launch. But it's they got as much said the longer sort of full year trends there are up really solidly. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Joe Ritchie : So my first question maybe just high level, and if we were to just go into a little bit more of a prolonged downturn, you guys historically have done a great job of taking costs out. I'm just wondering like how do you guys think about how much there is left within the organization to continue to take cost out. And then secondly, just from a strategy perspective, do you feel like you need to shift at all from really like that the focus on growth to really cost at this point of the cycle? Scott Santi : Well, I think overall, we have a couple of things going for us. And when they're, when we're seeing some pressure in the marketplace. The first is that we have a very flexible cost structure. We've talked about that before, given our 80/20 operating model. And the historic performance that you referenced is really built around the fact that we have the ability to move up or down, capacity up or down. I won't call it easily, but I would say we have the ability relatively quickly to adjust our cost of the current environment. I think we showed that to some degree in Q2, and certainly we would expect that we will go through the back half of the year. So I would describe that is tactical. I would also describe our ability from a cash flow generation standpoint, and the margin profile that we've now got as a company that will allow us in a downturn to stay invested in the things that we think are really critical to the long-term growth and performance of the company. And that's a very different dynamic perhaps and we - from a overall position standpoint that we might have had in some of the prior downturn. So, I'm certainly very comfortable in our view is that we will make prudent tactical adjustments in the near-term and be able to both do that and stay invested in the things that we really think are the important things for us to be focused on and investing in from a long-term perspective. Joe Ritchie : I guess and Scott, maybe just following on that question really just from the cost levers, like where do you think that there is still kind of opportunity within the organization? I know you guys have highlighted. You've simplified the organization. You've highlighted sourcing as an opportunity before. So, where do you see the opportunities today? Scott Santi : Well, I think we've talked about before, we are - we would kind of certainly a ways to go from the standpoint of our enterprise initiatives. We've got 100 basis points this quarter. There is easily several more years of work there and opportunity there. It depends on your, we're talking about the next 2 or 3 years that certainly is a lever that we will continue to access. And as I said before, the other is that we will adjust our capacity very flexibly in the cost associated with supporting their capacity. So, I think we've got plenty of levers and it also depends on sort of the magnitude of the sort of environment in the ups and downs that we're dealing with here. So our, what we would do I think is our intent is to be very responsive to the environment as we see it in the short term while staying invested in the things that we think are really critical to the long-term performance of the company. And I don't know how to be more specific. Joe Ritchie : Okay. Scott Santi : Yes. Joe Ritchie : No, that makes sense. If I could ask one question just quickly on growth. You guys, I like the slide that you had showing Q1 versus Q2. I'm just curious, it sounds like June certainly took a leg down to the extent that you guys can kind of quantify and I may have missed this earlier, just the order of magnitude that June was down that would be helpful. Scott Santi : Yes, it's June was I mean we really started to see the decline in May and in June, mid-single-digit I would say in June year-over-year, and at the same time going into July here, we are starting to see things, certainly not get worse and stabilizing maybe from what we saw exit in Q2, which again supports our view that run rates are a good way to look at this on a go-forward basis. So, until we see something different. Michael Larsen : Until we see something, yeah. So June was the, the more significant leg down, July looks like things are stabilizing as we sit here today. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Volkmann from Jefferies. Your line is open. Steve Volkmann, your line is open. If you're on mute, please unmute your line. And we'll move along. Our next question comes from Joel Tiss from BMO. Joel Tiss : I can't believe I made it. How is it going guys? Scott Santi : Why do you say so? Joel Tiss : Cheers. Two questions, just one, I know you said that it's a little bit too early to tell and I just wondered if the way you're characterizing sort of a little bit of amplification of slowdown in May and June and stabilizing in July, is there any way to tell and I know you guys are hand to mouth, but is there any way to tell if your customers demand was sort of impacted you know kind of like the amplified a little bit from inventory destocking or there is not really anyway to tell? You know what I mean so that the underlying markets is better than what the number show. Scott Santi : I think we're a tough parameter for you and you know the fact that we deliver at the kind of level of responsiveness that we do means our customers have to carry relatively low amount of inventory. So to the extent there was any inventory adjustment, it's probably not a particularly material number for us. Joel Tiss : But I meant for them, like your customer demand went down because their customers are reducing inventories. Okay, maybe will do... Scott Santi : We can't tell. Joel Tiss : Too much of attending? Okay. Can you give us a little bit of an update on your pivot to acquisitions and where we stand and what you're thinking and how your, how your team is building and how you're seeing with prices and all that? Thank you. Scott Santi : Sure. I don't want to get carried away here, but we have certainly as we talked, going back to our last Investor Day, we have certainly begun the process of starting to explore. And we certainly are ready to, as we talked about begin to supplement the portfolio with nice high quality acquisitions. I would say we have made appropriate efforts in terms of communicating that update of our strategy to the appropriate people and have had pretty interesting change in terms of flow of ideas and opportunities. So, we are certainly looking at a number of things. The pipeline is sort of quickly rebuild. I don't want that in, in any way tip any or give anybody an indication that there's anything imminent there, but we're certainly starting to explore a range of potential opportunities, and we expect that over the next 12-months or so that we will generate some activity there. But it's all a function of quality fit and sort of afford let's call it affordability, doesn't, can we get, let's get and what we think it is the right value for our shareholders. Operator : Our next question comes from Andy Casey from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Andy Casey : Top line question during the quarter and going back to the Investor Day, you talked about 6% of revenue and divestiture process last year to date It up to the Investor Day seeing of 4.6% drop. With the latest weakening, did that and did that pool of revenue associated with the divestitures, did that see a sharper decline than the overall ? Michael Larsen : Yes, so , Andy these are rightfully characterized as long-term growth challenged and we're certainly seeing a performance in those businesses that are below the kind of core ITW. Scott Santi : And that you talked about specifically specialty. Michael Larsen : Specialty is a good example of that where we called it out. Andy Casey : And then the gross margin was flat in the quarter year-over-year despite the revenue drop. I just wanted to, did any of the restructuring fall into gross profit? Michael Larsen : Yes. So I think there is both the 80/20 activities and obviously the sourcing activities and so I think it goes back to what we talked about earlier, just the resilience of ITW with a 6% decline in revenue is half of which organic the other half currency, we're holding margins above 24% and we're holding gross margins. We generate more cash in terms of the conversion rate, and so I wouldn't say we were, that was not a big surprise to us that we were able to do that, that's kind of, that's how we run the rail on the railroad here, so. Operator : Our next question comes from Mig Dobre from Baird. Your line is open. Mig Dobre : Hi, there. I don't know if I missed this, but when you're talking about the back half of the year, by the way I'm looking at Slide 4 right now at your price cost discussion there. What exactly is embedded in your guidance at this point for a price cost tailwind? And can you help us in Q3 versus Q4, is that kind of how your assumptions play out ? Michael Larsen : Yes I think if you look at the trend of the bottom left of the slide, we would probably expect that trend to continue into the back half of the year if things stay the way they are, from a cost standpoint. Mig Dobre : All right, but is there going to be like a 50 basis points tailwind, Is it 100 basis points? What's, what's the right magnitude? Michael Larsen : Yes, I think a more realistic view is that it begins to turn slightly positive in the second half here. And beyond that I can't really give you a number. Mig Dobre : Well, I mean I figured that you would know since obviously this is one of the key elements in terms of the swing. The first half versus back half, and I get it, it's hard to forecast it perfectly but-- Michael Larsen : Let me just Mirc. Just because I don't answer your question specifically, doesn't mean I don't know the answer. I just want to be clear. So it's just a - we have never provided quarterly guidance on price cost and given the dynamic environment we're in and it's I would put it this way. Overall, it's not going to be a material driver to our performance in the back half, but it certainly contributes and relative to where we've been over the last three years, it's no longer a drag, which I think that's really the big story here. The price cost has been neutralized. In terms of price dollars, we are significantly ahead of the material cost side, including the tariffs we talked about. So hopefully that helps. Mig Dobre : No, it does. Fair enough. If I had to try. Then let me, let me ask my follow-up on growth, right. I think everybody kind of understands what's going on with auto, but I was wondering, some numbers here, even if I take out auto. I think your organic growth was down something like 0.7% year to date. And I look at this and that almost feels like a recession type environment. So I guess I'm wondering from your perspective, when you're looking at the remaining businesses excluding auto, you know how much of this decline is generated, has been generated by businesses that you actually looking to exit per Andy's question from earlier versus what's going to stay, what's going to remain in the portfolio? And do you sort of feel like you've got kind of the right portfolio mix in the right geographical exposure at this point or do you need to make maybe some more significant adjustments down the line? Thanks. Michael Larsen : I think in terms of the big, if you look at it by segment, automotive accounts for the vast majority of the decline in revenues year-over-year, I think that's well understood. We're kind of being hit by a number of things here, including and we've talked about semi and now this slowdown in Welding. So, I think it's a little bit about, little bit of an unusual time for us. Usually we have things kind of moving in different directions. But like I said auto is the majority. Then we have this unique situation in Specialty where the divestitures are underperforming. We're still doing a lot of product line simplification and then Welding took a step down here in Q2. So, yeah. Scott Santi : And I'll answer the same question from a longer-term perspective, which is if you look at the margins we generate in every one of these seven businesses, what that tells me is we deliver a lot of value for our customers in those, in every one of those businesses. In every one of those businesses, we have significant share and penetration gain potential, and we expect, as we've said many times before and we are working on it by creating every one of those businesses to outgrow the underlying markets by 1% to 2% percentage points plus. Some have the potential to do be more, some less. But every one of them should outgrow their underlying market growth. And we are working through sort of lots of all things we've talked about before in our path to get there, but I have no doubt we will get there. Mig Dobre : All right, thank you. Michael Larsen : Thank you. Scott Santi : And supplement it with a couple of nice bolt-ons when we get there as well a year maybe. Operator : Our next question comes from Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Jamie Cook : Just one, two follow-up questions. Just one on the Welding side. Could you just provide some color which markets were, end markets were hit hardest? And then I was impressed with the ability to hold the margins. I mean, they were down modestly over year but given the organic growth decline, I thought margins would have deteriorated more. So was there anything unusual in that number, and how do I think about margins for the year? Thank you. Michael Larsen : Yes. So I think on Welding, the decline was fairly broad-based. If you look at, so the equipment side down, for consumables flat and the filler metals is up 5, like we talked about. So that's certainly a positive. The industrial side of Welding in North America, it was down kind of in the mid-single digits, and was the biggest driver overall. The commercial side, as we've talked about before, did relatively better than that, and then the last data point oil and gas kind of was flat in the quarter, so. Scott Santi : What I would add is in the equipment decline, industrial was certainly the bigger decline relative to the commercial end. Michael Larsen : Yes. Scott Santi : So manufacturing. Michael Larsen : Yes, I mean, it's really the industrial economy here is what we're seeing the softening demand. And because we are shorter cycle and Welding is one of these, receive the order today and ship tomorrow. We see it maybe faster than other companies that carry more of a backlog. You have to keep in mind that in Welding since we're on that topic, we carry less than two weeks backlog, because of the best-in-class service levels that we provide in that business. So, and then I think on margins, I'm not sure. Well, you were talking about Welding specifically, I mean I think certainly if margins at 28.8. If you take out the restructuring and Welding they were actually positive in the, in the quarter as well up year-over-year. There was about 60 basis points of restructuring in the quarter. And I think it's back to the resilience of the of ITW and given how we're organized, our teams on the ground when they see things slowing. They are able to react quickly and make appropriate adjustments and deliver. If you look at the decrementals for ITW in the quarter, we are in the mid 20's, which is given that we saw the slowdown late in the quarter, I think it's pretty really strong performance. And as we talked about earlier, we expect that to continue as we go into the balance of the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : You know that amount of 24.3 just to be precise. So it's pretty good. So, in that regard, you know, as we kind of went through the quarter. How satisfied are you that you're preserving the investment spending to get to kind of accelerate growth when the markets return to growth or are we sort of in the zone now where it's all about margin preservation and some of the investment spending kind of get the 3rd? I mean how do you think about that? Scott Santi : We are, we talked about our contingency planning discussions that we had with each one of our segments and the first topic was the conversation around what are the things that we are going to absolutely stay fully invested in as we go through this a little bit of a, of a rough patch in terms of demand. And I'd sort of go back Nigel to what I said earlier is sitting here with mid-20's EBIT margins with a business that as we model it would have to shrink by a 3rd in some unprecedented economic depression for our margins to drop below 20% suggest to us or not suggest, it puts us in a position where we are absolutely able to ride the cycles, power our way through these cycles and stay invested for the long haul. So I am. There are, there are certainly tactical adjustments that can be made in terms of managing capacity appropriate in the short run rates around demand. Again, I talked about our flexible cost structure that helps us move up or down in debt from that standpoint as demand moves up and down. But from the standpoint of capacity to invest and desire to stay invest, we're not trying to be a hero based on decremental percentage. We're trying to build a company that over 5 and 10 year period can outperform based on the core strengths that we have in terms of the business model, the end market positions where in. And the things, I don't want to get too detailed on this, but the things we've talked about in terms of sales capability building in terms of new product innovation, all of those things are part and parcel of the conversations that we've had with each of our segments in terms of the things we are absolutely going to stay invested in as we write this out. Nigel Coe : And then just a quick follow-up on kind of taken a different approach to the price cost question, looking at gross price and have you seen any pushback or increasing sort of investments and incentives in any of the businesses? And I'm thinking here about auto, it's obviously gone through a real rough patch. And how is pricing looking in that end markets? And Welding is another one where we've seen some chatter about deceleration in pricing maybe just address those two and perhaps overall as well. Scott Santi : Yes, I think overall, this is a general statement with millions of products. But I think that all the work that we've done in the portfolio, we've talked about this before. We are in many, in the majority of our businesses, we are in spaces where we're doing something unique and value-added for our customers, which gives us some ability to price based on the value we deliver, not based on a commodity reference points. It's not to say that those, there aren't pressures in certain end markets as you talk about, but our responses to try to find a way to give the customer better value, not necessarily reduce the price that we're seeing or serving. So, we are doing things in auto every day to design products that help our customers to be more efficient in how they manufacture to give them better performance in terms of features and benefits. So, we're not certainly immune to the pressures at the moment as much as I would say we have from the standpoint of the differentiated nature of the product portfolio. We have multiple responses and ways that we can respond to that over time to again deliver value to our customers. We still get paid for the value that we deliver. Michael Larsen : Right. And I'll just add Nigel one data point before, and it was a question earlier and if I didn't say clearly. Our year-over-year price, if you look at in dollar terms was higher in the second quarter than in the first quarter. So, if there is some nervousness around the ability to maintain price, hopefully that data point is helpful. Operator : Our next question comes from John Inch from Gordon Haskett. Your line is open. John Inch : Good morning, Michael, Scott and Karen. So the 55% of the ready to grow, growing, presumably have some model in there obviously. If you were to strip that out, how did that roughly speaking, how did that do in the second quarter? What's kind of the growth rate there for those businesses and sort of how are you thinking about them in the second half ? Michael Larsen : Yes, I think it's a good question, John. When we talked about this at Investor Day last year, I think we described it as a journey. And so what we were going to do is report on our progress on an annual basis. I can tell you we're certainly making progress in those businesses. We are having movement of businesses that were not ready to grow, not growing category that are moving up. Maybe the Service business in Food Equipment is a good example of that where we are now putting solid 3% to 4% organic growth on the board at, by the way really attractive margins as I'm sure you know. Scott Santi : But I would also say that that list was chock-full of Welding businesses, so to Michael's point to try to calibrate this on a single quarter given the macro influences it's, this is a data point that we are certainly comfortable being accountable for in reporting out, but on an annual basis is a better way to reflect our progress in that regard. John Inch : So it's fair to say though the choppiness, the CapEx deferrals et cetera that are going on, is that making it harder to do deals, meaning is the sort of the end-market demand choppiness and there's obviously project push outs not applicable per se to your company but it's affecting CapEx. Is that causing for a little bit of deal disruption in terms of the discussions you're having, or looking to begin to have? Scott Santi : Not yet. And there is no prediction. Actually not yet. It hasn't really been a major focus but yeah it's been a couple of months. John Inch : Just lastly. Michael, you said that even the guide doesn't assume a re-acceleration, but what if there is a deceleration obviously which I realize you can't forecast nobody really can but it holds to reason things sometimes move in trends, and Scott your, I take your comments obviously. I get it right, this is probably ultimately just some kind of pausing but if it's not, how should we think about sort of ITW's resilience or what kind of sensitivity is there if in fact there is further deceleration? Michael Larsen : Yes, I mean, I think if things decelerate from here we will give you an update in the third quarter. I think what you saw in terms of kind of the decrementals are a good way to think about how the company would, that we saw in the quarter a good way to think about how the performance might play out. There is one other data point in the materials today. You saw we adjusted our organic growth guidance down. Every point of organic growth is approximately $0.10 a share so and then you can and I think we're pretty transparent in terms of all the information that we provide, including at the segment level and then you can build your own models and those decrementals by the way are fairly similar across all of our segments. So hopefully that helps you model the sensitivities around, around the top line. Operator : Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Karen Fletcher for closing remarks. Karen Fletcher : Okay, thanks Sheryl, and thanks everybody for joining us this morning. And if you have any follow-up questions, I'm happy to take them offline. Thank you .

My name is Julianne and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the conference call.  [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Karen Fletcher, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Karen Fletcher : Okay, thank you Julianne. Good morning and welcome to ITW's Third Quarter 2019 Conference Call. I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi; and Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen.  During today's call, we\u2019ll discuss third quarter financial results and provide an update on our 2019 full year outlook.  Slide two is a reminder that this presentation contains our financial forecast for the remainder of 2019, as well as other forward-looking statements identified on this slide. We refer you to the company's 2018 Form 10-K for more details about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations.  Please note that this presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of those measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release.  Please turn to slide three. Today we are announcing the date and location for ITW's next Investor Day. We hope you can join us on Friday, March 13 in Fort Worth, Texas at which time will provide an update on our long term strategy and offer a tour of our Traulsen, Refrigeration Plant site and the opportunity to see the ITW business model in action. Today's announcement is strictly a save-the-date alert and will provide more details on the event, including how to sign up for it when the date gets closer.  So now we\u2019ll move on to slide four, and it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi. Scott Santi : Thank you, Karen and good morning. While slowing CapEx investment and declines in auto production in North America and China impacted the demand environment across a broad cross section of our portfolio, we delivered another solid quarter with excellent operational execution.  Despite the macro challenges, we delivered earnings per share growth, operating margin of 25%, and a 12% increase in free cash flow. Despite lower volumes, we improved operating margin 40 basis points year-over-year with enterprise initiatives contributing 120 basis points and increased after-tax return on invested capital by 120 basis points to more than 29%.  Looking ahead at the balance of the year, based on demand rates and our margin performance exiting Q3, we are maintaining our full year 2019 EPS guidance range of $7.55 to $7.85, while acknowledging that the combination of near-term macro uncertainties and the lingering strike at General Motors likely skews the probabilities of potential outcomes toward the lower end of the range.  Moving forward, we continue to focus on executing at a high level on the things that are within our control in the context of the near term macro uncertainties, while remaining fully invested in driving progress on a Finish-the-Job enterprise ready strategy agenda, and on positioning the company to deliver on our 2023 enterprise performance goals.  Our demonstrated ability to deliver strong results across a range of economic scenarios while continuing to make consistent progress towards our long-term full potential performance is a direct result of the combination of the performance power and resilience of the ITW business model and a dedicated team of ITW professionals around the world who leverage it to serve our customers and execute our strategy with excellence day-in and day-out.  With that, I'll now turn the call over to Michael for some more details on our Q3 results. Michael? Michael Larsen : Thanks, Scott, and good morning everyone. In the third quarter, organic revenue declined 1.7% year-over-year as demand slowed modestly across our portfolio. This quarter had one extra shipping day, so on the same-day basis organic revenue was down 3.2% versus the 2.8% decline in Q2. Product Line Simplification was 60 basis points.  By geography, North America was down 2% and International was down 1%. Europe declined 2%, while Asia Pacific was up 2%. On a positive note, organic growth in China was plus 7%.  Our execution on the elements within our control was strong as we expanded operating margins by 40 basis points to 25% with strong contributions from enterprise initiatives and positive price cost. Our Q3 decremental margin was 15%.  GAAP EPS of $2.04 benefited from the fact that we filed our federal tax return and reduced our estimated tax liability for tax year 2018 by $21 million, which contributed $0.07 of EPS in the quarter. On a year-over-year basis the $2.04 GAAP EPS number included $0.05 of unfavorable foreign currency translation impact, which was offset by a $0.05 benefit from our lower Q3 tax rate of 21.6% as compared to 23.7% in the prior year.  As expected free cash flow was strong at $830 million, an increase of 12% with the conversion of 126%. We repurchased $375 million out of our shares and raised our annual dividend by 7%. Overall, excellent operational execution and solid financial performance despite some external challenges.  Let\u2019s move to slide five and operating margin. As you can see from the chart, operating margin improved again this quarter with enterprise initiatives contributing 120 basis points, which was the highest level since 2017. It is worth noting that the enterprise initiatives impact is broad based across all seven segments ranging from 80 basis to 190 basis points, and we're seeing the benefits of the accelerated restructuring activities we initiated earlier in the year.  Price remains solid and well ahead of raw material inflation on a dollar basis. In addition, raw material cost pressures eased again this quarter, and price/cost margin impact was positive for the first time since 2016. Volume leverage was unfavorable 40 basis points, and other was 60 basis points of headwind, about half of which was from normal, annual inflation on wages and salaries, coupled with some one-time items. Restructuring expense was equal to what we spent in the third quarter 2018. So, in summary, strong operating margin performance again this quarter.  Turning to slide six for details on segment performance. The table on the left provides some color on organic grow. As you can see, on an equal day basis, we were down 3% in Q3, which was essentially the same decline as in Q2. Like Q2, we experienced lower levels of demand in some of the CapEx related offerings. You can see the impact in Food Equipment, Test & Measurement, and Electronics, both with growth rates 4 points lower than last quarter. However, in both cases, underlying order rates were pretty good. Automotive OEM was down less in Q3, largely due to the benefit from an easier comparison year-over-year, and the Welding and the remaining three segments were all pretty stable.  Now let\u2019s move to individual segment results starting with Automotive OEM. Organic revenue was down 2%, as the GM strike reduced revenues by approximately 1 percentage point. In addition, we had 100 basis points of PLS impact. North America was down 6%, Europe was essentially flat, and China organic growth was 7% in a market where builds were down significantly. Margins of 22.1% increase 60 basis points year-over-year.  Moving on to slide seven. Food Equipment organic revenue was down 1% despite strong performance in our service business, which was up 3%. In North America, demand for equipment was a little slower in retail, restaurants were about flat, and we continue to experience growth on the institutional side despite a pretty difficult comparison.  Operating margin expanded 90 basis points to 27.5% with enterprise initiatives, the main contributor. Test & Measurement and Electronics was a little softer this quarter as organic revenue declined 3%. Test and Measurement was down 4%. Excluding sales to semiconductor equipment manufacturers, organic growth would have been up 1%. Electronics was down 3%, mostly driven by softness in electronic assembly. Operating margin nevertheless expanded 90 basis points to 25.6% with enterprise initiatives also a main driver here. Turning to slide eight. Welding organic revenue declined 2% against the tough comparison of 10% growth last year. In North American the equipment side was down 4%, but against the comp of more than 10% growth last year. North America consumables were up 4%, which continues to point to pretty good underlying Welding activity at our customers. International is now 3% and operating margin was 28.2%.  Polymers & Fluids organic growth was up 3% with Polymers up 7% against the comparison of down 3% last year. Automotive aftermarket was up 2% and Fluids was down 1%. Operating margin was up 200 basis points, driven primarily by enterprise initiative.  Moving to slide nine, construction organic revenue was down 1% with continued risk in Australia and New Zealand which was down 4%. Europe was up 1% and North America was essentially flat with residential remodel however up 4%, offset by lower demand in commercial construction.  In Specialty, organic revenue was down 5% and similar to Q2 the main drivers were 100 basis points of the PLS impact and the relative performance of the businesses we've identified as potential divestitures. These potential divestitures reduce organic growth for the segment by about a point and half; in other words core specialty was down 3.5%. By geography international was down 5% and North America was down 4%.  Let's talk about full year guidance on slide 10. Based on demand rates and our margin performance exiting Q3, we are maintaining our full year 2019 EPS guidance range of $7.55 to $7.85, while acknowledging as Scott said, that the combination of near term macro uncertainty and the lingering strike at General Motors likely skews the probabilities of potential outcomes towards the lower end of the range.  While the Q3 discrete tax items that I described earlier, lowers our full year tax rate to approximately 24%. This benefit is essentially offset by incremental foreign currency headwind that has crept in since we updated our full year guidance as of the end of Q2. We expect that operating margin for the full year would be approximately 24%, which is down slightly from our previous guidance as a result of higher accelerated restructuring expense and the impact of slightly lower volume. It is worth noting that given the environment, we now expect incremental accelerated restructuring expenses in Q4 that will represent a headwind of approximately $0.03 year-over-year. Our cash performance has been strong all year and we expect that our full year conversion rate will be well ahead of net income. Our plan in terms of share repurchases remains unchanged and we are on track to repurchase approximately 1.5 billion of our own shares this year.  Now for a quick update on our portfolio management activities. Overall our various divestiture processes are on track. As a reminder, we're looking to divest certain businesses with revenues totaling up to $1 billion and are targeting to complete this effort by year end 2020 with about half of the divestitures in 2019.  The positive impact includes about 50 basis point improvement in our organic growth rate and approximately 100 basis points of margin improvement. Not counting potential gains on sale and the EPS dilution will be offset by incremental sherry purchases and we will continue to provide you with updates on our regular earnings calls.  Finally as a result of moving our annual Investor Day to March, we will now provide 2020 full year guidance, part of our January 2020 earnings call. With that, Karen I\u2019ll turn it back to you. Karen Fletcher : Okay, thanks Michael. Julianne, please open up the lines for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Ann Duignan from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Ann Duignan : Hi, good morning everyone. Scott Santi : Good morning! Ann Duignan : Good morning. Maybe we could start out with more color on end markets and what you saw as you went through the quarter in terms of cadence of sales or cadence of orders by segment. If you don't mind, just some color as to what's going on beyond the General Motors strike? I appreciate it. Scott Santi : Yeah, sure Ann. So I think there's really nothing yet unusual on a monthly basis as we went through the quarter. I think as we talked about in the script, we did see a modest slowdown, particularly on the CapEx side here in Q3 similar to what we saw in Q2, and you saw it show up to some extent in Food Equipment as well as in Test and Measurement where the growth rates were lower in Q3 relative to Q2 on a year-over-year basis.  You know that said, I also think it was worth pointing out that when we look at the underlying activity in these businesses and the order rates, they are actually looking pretty good heading into Q4, so a little bit of a mixed bag here. I\u2019d say automotive looks like on a year-over-year basis, certainly the Q3 organic growth rate was better than Q2. Part of that is an easier comparison, and then obviously we talked about the impact of the GM strike here in Q3, so \u2013 and the remaining segments, pretty stable, you know Welding, Construction, and Specialty. Ann Duignan : And just a follow-up on maybe some color on the Welding side consumables versus equipment. I mean, I think you had flagged back in Q2 as the CapEx side slowing, but the consumable side still strong, and I think in your comments you reiterated that. Could you just update us on if there was any change in that industry? Scott Santi : Yeah, so I was just talking about North America which is really 80% of our business. You know, we did see some softness on the equipment side, down 4%, but keep in mind the comp from last year, equipment was up 11% in Q3 last year. Consumables, up 4% \u2013 I think we were up 8% in consumables here in the second quarter. So, a little bit of \u2013 maybe a little bit of a slow down on the consumables side, but overall North America down 1%, and I think we\u2019ve said Welding is pretty stable here in Q3 similar to what we saw maybe in the second quarter. Ann Duignan : Okay, I\u2019ll leave it there in the interest of time. I appreciate the color. Thanks. Scott Santi : Thank you, Ann. Operator : Your next question comes from John Inch from Gordon Haskett. Your line is open. John Inch : Yeah, thank you. Good morning everybody. Scott Santi : Good morning. John Inch : Good morning. The GM strike, is that \u2013 are you guys assuming that the GM strike does not get resolved in the fourth quarter as part of your guidance. It may not move the needle perhaps, but \u2013 and then when it actually ends Michael, that 1% drag, does it flip to a 1% contribution or because there has to be inventory fill back at the company, right in terms of working process, does that actually go up higher than the 1%. How are you thinking about it? Scott Santi : Well, I would say that all the scenarios, all the potential scenarios from it gets settled. I guess next week with the Board [ph], all the way through that never gets settled through the quarter are embedded in our guidance range. You know there is \u2013 we have really no purpose or advantage in trying to make a particular bet. We are obviously not involved in the process, but have incorporated all the \u2013 you know sort of the most optimistic and the most pessimistic scenarios in our guidance range for the balance of the year and essentially that's how we are approaching it. And since you asked Michael, and I\u2019ll give you a little color in terms of the potential impact on the organic growth of the company. Michael Larsen : Yeah, I think here in Q4, as Scott said kind of best case at this point is, we start back up next week. So we\u2019ve already lost a month, which is almost a full point of organic growth at the ITW level, about 3 percentage points of impact in the auto segment alone, so that's essentially done at this point. And then if you can you kind of, as Scott said, if things do not get resolved at all this quarter, which is maybe the worst case scenario, we would lose another [multiple speakers]. Scott Santi : That is the worst case scenario. Michael Larsen : Which is the worst case scenario. You know we\u2019d lose another 2 points of organic growth here. So those things are kind of all embedded in what we're talking about today, and I think it's part of the elements that you know skew our view in terms of the guidance range towards the lower end as we talked about it. John Inch : Okay. So in other words, if the worst case scenario GM doesn't get resolved until Jan 1, the low end of your range for the year, the $7.55 still captures that, that's what you're saying? Michael Larsen : Yes. I mean I think, obviously we don\u2019t want to get into customer profitability, but in terms of you know EPS, we're talking about pennies of impact here. John Inch : No, that's fine. Just for my follow up, Scott I remember historically how your enterprise initiatives and PLS, you were fairly adamant this was going to lead to kind of a structural elevation in ITW's organic growth, and you guys have been at this obviously for years; and it's been very, very successful. Here we are in the third quarter and PLS is kind of sort of at the same cadence, right, 60 basis points; it was 70 last quarter; enterprise initiatives is actually accelerating.  I'm just wondering, I mean presumably you would've gone after kind of the lower-hanging PLS fruit. Is there a risk that as we keep this PLS cadence off that, you know the future for with respect to organic growth and what you had thought would be the benefits from this somehow gets impacted because this PLS just doesn't abate if that makes any sense, and maybe growth has an impact down the road. Scott Santi : Well, I think the \u2013 I don't see it as a risk. I think really what we are seeing play out is that the PLS rate has definitely come down over this, you know the period that we\u2019ve been implementing it. John Inch : Right. Scott Santi : If you remember back to the front end of the implementation of the strategy, it was running 1 point to 1.5 points.  You know, we feel like on an ongoing basis just embedded in how we operate the business model normalized, I think we even talked about this at last Investor Day; normalized PLS should be 30 to 40 bps, so at 60 I don't think we are too far from, you know we're not \u2013 we're certainly demonstrating the movement through that process certainly, and as you suggested, the low hanging fruit we dealt with a few years ago, but there's certainly some fine tuning going on. A lot of that in those businesses that we're still working on, getting position to grow, we\u2019ll give you an update at the Investor Day in terms of how we're tracking on the rate of growing versus not growing divisions, but I assure you we are making solid progress on that front, and we\u2019ll as I said, give you a fulsome updates in March, on Friday the 13th. John Inch : Yes, Friday the 13th. So you're feeling good about the prospective core growth once \u2013 as a result of I guess the PLS and EI, which I presume we're going to see more of once we get rid of these, you know these companies still slated for divestiture. Scott Santi : Yeah, there is no question. I'm not \u2013 you know the macro environment certainly right now would offset some of the online [ph] progress, but we are on it from the standpoint of the qualitative steps we need to take to accelerate organic growth. That has continued unabated through this process. It's certainly a little more difficult to see in terms of growth rate, the yield on all that effort given the environment right now, but you know we have \u2013 I assure you we are making really solid progress and it remains the number one focus of everything we're doing. John Inch : Many thanks. Scott Santi : You bet. Michael Larsen : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Jamie Cook : Good morning. The margin performance I guess, if you think about the second quarter and the third quarter, I guess even in first quarter you faced I guess some more challenging organic growth that\u2019s been fairly depressed. And then if you think about, you know the margin performance in the fourth quarter and while it\u2019s good, it's still implying sort of you know more of a step function down and the inability to I guess keep the margins up year-over-year I guess which is expected, but to some degree can you just provide some context on the degradation in Q4 margins and just what that implies for 2020 in terms of how we think about detrimental margins for Q2, Q3 elevated more so because the price cost. I'm just trying to understand the step function change there.  And then just my second question \u2013 I guess my second question is we all debate, you know whether how this market plays out in terms of sort of mid-cycle slowdown versus you know more challenging concerns, recessions and how you guys are familiar managing your business. Thank you. Michael Larsen : Why don\u2019t I take the easy one, which is the first part, then maybe we'll take a stab together on the second piece.  I mean I think we've tweaked our full year margin guidance as you noticed, really to account for two things. One is that just given the demand environment that we're in, we made a decision to further accelerate some restructuring projects and so we are going to be spending more on restructuring for the full year. And these are really projects that were in the pipeline for next year and so we've pulled them forward into this year, so that's a portion of it.  And then the other piece is really you know we talked about GM impact and just kind of the macro environment and the potential impact on volume leverage, so really those two things combined.  I will tell you that at the same time when I look at the \u2013 you know we'll give you kind of a squiggle, 24%. I mean we're really talking about decimal points here, so I wouldn't read too much into, you know certainly into the implications for next year. Our ability to continue to expand margins, nothing has changed from that perspective.  So hopefully that makes you feel a little bit better about the margin assumptions here and then the second question I think was really in terms of how things play out from here, from a macro standpoint and\u2026 Scott Santi : You\u2019re looking at me. Michael Larsen : I\u2019m looking at Scott here for some wisdom. Scott Santi : Well, I guess I don\u2019t want this to be interpreted wrong, but I have none. I think our view, you know fundamentally in terms of how we operate the company is we are going to operate, we are going to react and we are going to operate to the best of our ability and whatever the external environment throws our way. I think we've built \u2013 spent six or seven years now building a highly competitive, very effective company that now has the kind of margin cushion underneath it that allows us to react to whatever the world throws at us.  I think you're all well aware of some of the issues right now and that they relate largely to a lot of uncertainty that\u2019s out in the environment for reasons that you are I'm sure all well aware of.  I think whatever \u2013 you know however that gets resolved, this company is well positioned to operate at a very high level on an absolute and a relative basis in that environment and given some of what we\u2019ve talked about historically in terms of flexible cost structure, in terms of margin and profitability that we will continue to focus on operating the company in the most appropriate way for whatever the environment is that we find ourselves. Personally I'm optimistic, but who knows. Jamie Cook : Okay, thanks. I\u2019ll let someone else get in. Operator : Your next question comes from Andy Casey from Wells Fargo Securities, your line is open. Andy Casey : Thanks a lot. Good morning! Scott Santi : Good morning. Andy Casey : Within welding, could you provide a little bit more color in the U.S.? did you see any significant differences in performance by main market? Scott Santi : So not really Andy. It was pretty similar in North America to what we saw in Q2, I think characterized a little by some stability is maybe a way to describe it. I think if you look at you know the industrial businesses, down and low single digits, so that's more on the heavy equipment side.  The commercial business flat, maybe down a point or so and an underlying that like I said so the equipment side down four, offset by consumables up four, so we end up basically flat. Maybe I'll give you one more data point here. You know the oil and gas side was actually slightly positive, not a big part of the business in North America, but up mid-single digits in Q3, so \u2013 but really a stable quarter in terms of welding. Andy Casey : Okay, thank you. And then when you look forward in the Q4, you called out that $0.03 of accelerative restructuring. Is that concentrated in any few segments or is that kind of similar to what we've been seeing the placement during the year. Scott Santi : Yeah, it's very similar. I mean if you look at, there\u2019s a schedule in the appendix of the press release that lays out kind of the \u2013 this is pretty broad based and you know as I said, I can give some points out. These are projects that were planned all along for 2020 and we're going to try to accelerate some of those into the Q4 just as a result of this, kind of the demand environment that we're seeing. Andy Casey : But they are related much more directly to enterprise initiatives than\u2026 Scott Santi : That is correct. I think if you want to make a distinction, I think the first half of this year there was a focus certainly around acquisition integration on the automotive side. We accelerated some projects there just give the environment that in hindsight turned out to be you know a good decision and you know this time around it's more enterprise initiative 80/20 related projects that were you know scheduled for 2020 that we're going to pull forward into 2019. Andy Casey : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Scott Santi : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from David Raso from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. David Raso : Hi, good morning. Scott Santi : Good morning. David Raso : A quick clarification on the fourth quarter of the margin. With the implied sales and the implied EPS, which is about $1.94 or so to hit your mid-point, it does seem to require the operating margin to be you know nearly 25%, call it 24.8%, 24.9%, something like that. So are we saying there's a step down in the margins in the fourth quarter and if so, is the fourth quarter helped by below the line items to hit the EPS? I'm just trying to level, is that the fourth quarter view. Michael Larsen : Yes, so this is a little tricky Dave, because we don't give Q4 guidance, we're giving you a full year number. What I will tell you is, as you go back and look at historical margins, typically take a step down here in Q4 relative to Q3, like I said, here we talked about restructuring, we talked about lower volume, you could model what the impact might be from that, and then there's no \u2013 we're not counting on any one time item one way or another in terms of the fourth quarter. So hopefully that's helpful without giving you specific guidance for the quarter. David Raso : I appreciate that, but obviously if you take the mid-point you can't have a margin that's like 24.2% or 24.3% or whatever it may be and still hit your EPS number, unless you do get help below the line. So there's a little bit of a mismatch in the numbers and we can discuss offline.  The inventory management I thought was pretty good during the quarter. That's a first time in a few years your inventory performed better year-over-year than your sales, meaning they were down a lot more than sales were down. The incremental restructuring in the fourth quarter, the way you're handling the inventory, you know it does seem likely at least you\u2019re doing the right thing so to speak for maybe a slower \u201820.  Can you help us a bit with the inventory, how you view it in your channel? You know obviously your own inventory as I just said sort of did a pretty good job sequentially year-over-year. Can you help us with the channel inventory color? Scott Santi : Well, I think from the standpoint of channel inventory and we talked about this before, but we are \u2013 given the performance embedded in, let\u2019s call it the operational X, you know elements of 80-20, you know we are you know for 90% plus of what we sell. You give us an order today, we ship it tomorrow. So from the standpoint of channel inventory, I think that's an advantage and from the standpoint of our channel partners in terms of minimizing their need to carry a lot of inventory, so you know I think it\u2019s one of the reasons why we tend to have these external market inflection one way or the other show up in our business quicker than maybe some others where there's more backlog involved.  I think that's a real advantage, but you know I don't think we're going to talk about destocking or any of that stuff, because I don't really think it's an issue from our standpoint given the relatively low level of them toward that are \u2013 I mean there are some out there certainly, but it's not a material element given the way we\u2019re able to service our channel partners. David Raso : So that's interesting. You're saying the improvement in the inventory management, 2Q to 3Q that we normally say again year-over-year, that was just normal course a business. You would say that was not any proactive\u2026 A - Scott Santi : Right. That \u2013 we\u2019re not getting into a lot of detail. That\u2019s just \u2013 there's a self-correcting element to demand found where you know all that stuff is. We\u2019ve talked about this before and we\u2019ll show it to you in Fort Worth a little bit when we visit there, but essentially we are producing today what our customers bought yesterday. So there's no forward forecasting in our raw material replenishment. It's all basically replenishment from vendors, so it\u2019s essentially self-correcting to the demand environment, which is the reflection and what showed up or what you are looking at. David Raso : Right. Well, lastly \u2013 thank you. The portfolio management, that half of the asset sales are still hope to be done by the end of this year. Can you just give us an update on \u2013 you know we're only few months away. Is it a matter of the right partners, is it you know still discussing the price? Just to make sure we\u2019re comfortable and we still see some of those asset sales done by the end of this year. Thank you. Scott Santi : Yeah, it's a little bit of all of the above. I mean I think these processes are all in various stages. In terms of negotiations and you know I think we've talked about our goal is to get half of these transactions completed this year and all of them completed by the end of next year.  I'll say in terms of overall financial impact, you know there may be some one-time gains on sale that I'm sure you know we're going to call those out and you can adjust our EPS numbers based on that. I think fundamentally from a financial standpoint as we look forward, this is to 2020, the EBITDA that we are divesting here, that will essentially be offset by lower share account. So from an EPS standpoint there really is no significant impact on the company.  And then structurally when all of these are completed by 2020, which is certainly our goal, you know structurally there's an element here of addition by subtraction as we've talked about. That's the 50 basis points of improvement in the organic growth rate and 100 basis points of improvement in our underlying operating margins. David Raso : Right, thank you. Scott Santi : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from Joseph Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Joseph Ritchie : Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Scott Santi : Good morning. Joseph Ritchie : So maybe asking David's question a little bit differently, I know you don't want to give an explicit guide for 4Q, but if we think about the full year guidance of 24% at the operating margin level, it implies that 4Q is going to be down year-over-year, you know call it roughly 50 to 60 basis points, and I'm trying to understand the moving pieces. So I recognize restructuring has now been increased to the fourth quarter, but there is also a $0.05 benefit from what I remember coming through in 4Q as well. And so maybe you can just kind of help me with the moving pieces year-over-year. A - Michael Larsen : Yeah, I mean Joe. I'm not sure I can add much more to what I said previously. I mean we've given you the elements here, you're right. I mean higher restructuring we talked about, you know there's an assumption of lower volume, which includes and you know we talked about extensively the GM impact. And then certainly we expect to see you know enterprise initiatives continue to contribute at a high level and price cost trends are positive. So I think those are kind of the pieces here.  Again, you know like I said, this is a \u2013 things are in the round here. We're talking about decimal points of differences and you know I wouldn't get too caught up in kind of the Q4 versus full year margin number. I think for the full year, in a pretty challenging year you know margins are essentially flat.  If you take out the restructuring, margins are improving year-over-year which is the Q3. 40 basis points a margin improvement, detrimental margins of 15% and so I think the company is performing at a pretty high level just given the environment that we're in, so\u2026 Scott Santi : And I\u2019ll just extent that. I know we should \u2013 in any way interpreting this is the same. We are not fully on track to take in our margins to where we think we can on a long term basis by 2023, right. Joseph Ritchie : Okay, and maybe I\u2019m going to follow-on that question and Scott, as you kind of think about the moving pieces, I know you're going to give explicit guidance at the Analyst Day in March. But as you kind of think about the moving pieces, you know obviously commodities have become a little bit more of a tailwind for a lot of industrial companies, your price costs only turned positive, which is great. But there's also been additional investment spending that has been a bit more of a drag on the overall margin in recent years and so maybe you can provide a little bit more of a bridge for next year and how we should be thinking about the different moving pieces as you guys see it. A - Scott Santi : Well, I don't know that I can give you a lever. In terms of specifics we're going to give you our guidance. As Michael said in January, we haven't even completed the planning process yet. We do that typically in November, so all I can tell you from the standpoint of moving pieces is for sure we have a backlog of enterprise initiative projects. We expect continued margin improvement structurally from those next year.  I can't exactly dimension it for you yet, because we haven\u2019t gone through the planning process, but I would say it would be you know my \u2013 sitting here today that would be \u2013 it would be in line with what we did this year, which is a full point or so give or take. You know and the other big question for next year is going to be where does the volume go in terms of the macro. This is a company that's really well set up. In terms of leverage if we can get some volume growth going from the standpoint of end markets, but if we see further deceleration in 2020, then we'll, you know we\u2019ll react to it. I think we'll operate well either way and then these divestitures will as Michael said, add a full point of margin performance as we work through those and complete those by the end of next year.  So I think from the standpoint of the overall margin profile of the company and you know the clarity of our path to where we said we were going to get 2023, I don't see anything that\u2019s also becoming an obstacle to that for sure. Joseph Ritchie : Okay, thanks for your time. Operator : Your next question comes from Stephen Volkmann from Jefferies. Your line is open. Stephen Volkmann : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. Michael, I think you sort of talked about this already, but you're not looking at any meaningful changes in things like PLS, enterprise initiatives, price cost, etcetera for the fourth quarter, that's not part of the equation here? Hello? Operator : We are experiencing technical difficulties. Please stay on the line.  And you're now reconnected. Stephen Volkmann : Hi guys, can you hear me? Karen Fletcher : Yes, sorry we lost the connection in our room, so you'll have to start from the beginning. Sorry about that. Stephen Volkmann : Okay, good. I don't think it was my fault, I didn't touch anything. A - Scott Santi : I think Joe didn\u2019t like the last question. [Cross Talk] Stephen Volkmann : Yeah sorry, this is Steve with Jeffrey. So I just had a couple of quick follow-ups and the first one Michael, I think you kind of touched on this stuff, but I just wanted to make sure you weren\u2019t forecasting any meaningful changes in the cadence of things like PLS, enterprise initiatives, price cost in the fourth quarter to kind of explain a little bit of that shift. Michael Larsen : Yeah, that's correct, yeah we're not \u2013 that\u2019s not what we're talking about. Stephen Volkmann : Okay, great. And then this is maybe a slightly annoying question, but assuming you get 50% of your divestitures done by the end of this year, does that mean that 50% or 50 basis points of even improvement sort of flows into 2020 or are you potentially kind of working on the bigger return projects first and it might be a little higher or perhaps lower even, I don't know. A - Michael Larsen : Yeah, I mean directionally, I'd say about half of the impact. If everything \u2013 theoretically if everything gets done by year-end 2019, so like let\u2019s say everything \u2013 half of the projects that we're working on, they all get done by year-end, you will see approximately half of the benefit that I mentioned earlier in 2020, and then when everything is complete as they were targeting by the end of 2020, so 2021 will be the first year where you would see a full 50 basis points of organic growth and 100 basis points of structural margin improvement, so hopefully that\u2019s clear. Stephen Volkmann : Yeah, very clear. Thank you so much, I'll pass it on. Michael Larsen : And then any EPS impact will be \u2013 you know the goal is to completely offset that so we shouldn't see anything from any EPS standpoint. Stephen Volkmann : Got it, thank you. A - Scott Santi : Yeah, some one-time gains that would flow through, yes. Operator : Your next question comes from Vlad Bystricky from Citi. Your line is open. Vlad Bystricky : Good morning, everyone. A - Scott Santi : Good morning. Vlad Bystricky : So just going back to the segments here for a minute, you gave obviously some good color around the GM issues in North America. But if I look at auto OEM, you actually had pretty nice rebound in organic there internationally. So can you give us more color on what's really going on in Europe and especially in China where the out performance versus builds you know really widened this quarter? A - Scott Santi : Yes, so I think in Europe we talked about I think in the last call, things appearing to begin to stabilize in Europe and so we've gone from being down kind of mid to high single digits to you know now flat as builds have recovered as well in Europe, so.  And then China was really the big outperformance there as really as a result of continued penetration gains, primarily with local Chinese OEM's. So even in a market where builds are down kind of in the mid-single digits here in Q3, we\u2019re able to outperform and grow our business you know 7%. So it's nothing new. It's really a continuation of the strategy that we've been pursuing there for many years, so. Vlad Bystricky : Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe just stepping back bigger picture, at the last analyst day you categorized the divisions into three groups that you've talked about a bit; ready to grow and growing versus ready to grow and not yet growing versus long term challenge. Now that we've had a bit of a hick-up in the macro, can you give us some more color on how each of those three groups of businesses have been performing through the current slowdown and whether you're seeing anything that changes how you may be thinking about the longer term outlook for any of the particular businesses. Scott Santi : We haven't seen anything that changes our view of both the potential from the standpoint of growth in any of those businesses and also in terms of the agenda and the things we need to do to get them to deliver growth to that full potential. We\u2019ll give you guys a really good update, I promise, when we meet in March, in terms of exactly how those different types of businesses performed, even through this period where there\u2019s some macro pressure. Vlad Bystricky : Okay, that's helpful thanks. I\u2019ll get back in queue. Scott Santi : Alright, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : Thanks guys. Good morning. Scott Santi : Good morning. Nigel Coe : I apologize. I'm going to go back to well-trodden ground here. There\u2019s a lot of confusion about your \u2013 what the message is on Q4 margin, and if we take what you said, which is point us towards the lower end of the range, for obviously, one understands the reasons, it does point to a so 24% margin for 4Q.  So we've got a higher structure, it\u2019s about 30 basis points based on the $0.03 impact. Is it just simply lower volume? I'm asking this in a sort of track to clear out some confusion out there. This could be lower volume in Q4 of the business Q3 with some GM impacts in some of that. But just \u2013 if you just could clarify that point that would be very helpful. Scott Santi : Yes, so two things Nigel. So let me recap what I said earlier, maybe say it a little more clearly. So one is typical seasonality if you go back and look, our orders, our margin rates go down from Q3 to Q4 because of the volume goes down, so that\u2019s one piece here. The second piece is higher restructuring on a year-over-year basis, and then the third piece is lower volume, and so including the potential GM impact that we quantified earlier.  So it's really those three elements that are you know factored into the overall equation and our overall guidance, and even with those elements, you know within EPS, within organic growth guidance and that we treat the margins for the full year really to reflect everything I just talked about. And again, we're talking about decimal points on rounding\u2019s here. Nigel Coe : That's great, that's very helpful and then of course another fact would be that you typically managed down inventory from Q3 to Q4, so that\u2019s where you got some production currency there as well and you know to shut down especially in Europe. So I'm just curious, you did a great job of managing inventory, you know David Raso that you know earlier in the call. Are you planning to take another say $50 million to $100 million inventory out in Q4, just typically what you do? Scott Santi : It would \u2013 we don\u2019t have any forward plan to do that. As I said earlier, you know the system for us is essentially self-correcting to the level of demand that our businesses are experiencing week to week and so in a way I would say yes, because normally fourth quarter volumes dip from Q3 and therefore inventory and actually it follows that path. But it's more of a, just a way the 80-20 operating system operates. It\u2019s not a you know what, not to tell people to do it. Nigel Coe : Yep, okay, well thanks. Hopefully that's the last Q4 margin question. Thanks a lot. Scott Santi : Alright, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Mig Dobre from Baird. Your line is open. Mig Dobre : Hi, good morning. I will not ask about the margin in the fourth quarter, but I will ask about your revenue guidance. Not sure if I missed this, but you reduced revenue by $300 million versus the prior guidance, call it a little over 2%. What were the moving pieces here in terms of FX, organic hit from GM macro? Scott Santi : Yeah, I mean the big difference is really you know the currency piece. So we have you know a more headway on the top line and on EPS relative to when we gave guidance in Q2, really as a result of foreign exchange rates moving against us here since July when we were on the last earnings call. Mig Dobre : Okay, so that\u2019s, it\u2019s all FX. Scott Santi : Yes. Mig Dobre : I see. And then my follow-up going into segments again, I'm looking at the welding business and to me it's pretty remarkable that your volumes have grown in North America in the quarter. Certainly that's not what I'm hearing when I'm talking to people in the industry and we all sort of see that some big customers, especially on the heavy equipment side are cutting production. So I'm kind of wondering why that's happening and what your hearing from your business operators there. Are you taking share, are there some other dynamics or is it simply that the environment is not as dire as we're all thinking and that may be the flipside applies to Food Equipment, which has slowed and I would think that that market is not as macro sensitive, maybe as welding as for instance. Scott Santi : Yes, so let me start with the welding. I mean in think we characterized it as a pretty stable and just to be clear, our organic growth rates, we don't break out volume versus price, right, so that may be part of \u2013 and I don't know what everybody else is saying at this point, but that may be part of the difference here on the welding side.  You know Food Equipment, you know we did continue to see solid growth on the institutional side as we talked about restaurants flattish and then really the softness if you want in food was on the retail side and we can point to some specific orders that were pushed out to Q4 and so the underlying order rates on the food equipment side are pretty good. So that's how we tried to characterize it earlier. Mig Dobre : Alright, thank you. Scott Santi : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Walter Liptak from Seaport Global. Your line is open. Walter Liptak : Hi, thanks. Good morning guys. Scott Santi : Good morning. Walter Liptak : Just a follow-on with the food equipment segment. The restaurants being flat, you know I think that was growing pretty rapidly for you guys in prior quarters and you called out some CapEx things as slowing. I wonder if you can just provide some more color about what you're seeing in that restaurant segment? Michael Larsen : Yeah, I mean I \u2013 all right, so we'll give you a little more detail here. In terms of the QSR side, fast casual actually showing continued to show really strong growth on a year-over-year basis and it's really more of kind of the full service, think like fine dining type that was a little bit slower here in the quarter. So net-net we ended up at about flat on the restaurant side. Walter Liptak : Okay, but what \u2013 but that flat I think was down from prior quarters. I think you guys were up high single digits in the first half. Was there something that slowed? Michael Larsen : I have to go back and look, I mean \u2013 and how comps played into that. I mean I think the best I can tell you is the description I just gave you. I think comps probably if you factor that in are the main driver, but we can follow up on that. Walter Liptak : Okay. All right, thank you guys. Scott Santi : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi, good morning guys. Scott Santi : Good morning. Josh Pokrzywinski : Just a first question maybe to help level set on some of this price cost. Michael, I think if I look back historically, we're kind of in the zip code of where you know price cost is normally I guess kind of topped out in deflationary environments, kind of in this 20 maybe 30 basis point range. Is there something that kind of governs that system based on the mix of business from going higher or should we think about you know something in the zip code as kind of being historically more of high end than something that can go higher. Michael Larsen : No, I mean I think historically what we've \u2013 our goal has always been to just offset any material cost inflation with price, and you know that's what we've done so far this year. If you're asking whether things are going to accelerate from here in terms of the 20 basis points of price cost, I wouldn't make that assumption if that\u2019s your question. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it, that's helpful. And then just a follow up, you know thinking about the auto side, but maybe more in Europe where we have some changes coming down the road on emissions and maybe some of the OEMs get a little pinched on mix next year. Have there been any discussions about any kind of mix changes or you know folks getting more, I guess you know kind of aggressive on pushing back on prices than usual just as a function of some of the margin challenges the OEMs will be going through next year. Thanks. Michael Larsen : So we haven't through any of the plans yet, but I would be very surprised if we heard somebody describe the environment the way you just did, so I think we\u2026 Scott Santi : I don't know how you can push back more. Michael Larsen : It\u2019s a tough industry and in automotive you know our positioning has a very niche, value added solutions provider. You know it\u2019s fueled by innovation and thousands of patents, that\u2019s how we generate price in automotive, but the cost pressures will always remain and that hasn\u2019t changed and I'd be surprised if that would change on a go forward basis, so\u2026 Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. Thanks, I\u2019ll leave it there. Scott Santi : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from Steven Fisher from UBS. Your line is open. Steven Fisher : Thanks, good morning. I just wanted to clarify the non-residential construction versus the resi comments you made there, where you said resi was up and non-resi down. Can you just clarify was that specifically North America or more broadly, and then can you just give a little more color on what parts of the non-res market are driving that lower. Michael Larsen : So, like I said, this was a North American comment and the residential remodel side continues to be really solid and so that's where we experience 4% growth here in the quarter and that's really the \u2013 what we call the age of the business; that's the bulk of the business in North America. You know the commercial side can be a little lumpier. There\u2019s a project business in there. One of the products that we provided is we pour concrete floors for warehouses and data centers and some of those projects can move in and out of the quarter, and you know this quarter that business was down in the low to mid-teens and kind of offset into North American and ended up basically flat. Scott Santi : Let me just clarify, we make products that people use and they pour on those floors, we don\u2019t do that. Michael Larsen : We don\u2019t pour it, we make the\u2026 Steven Fisher : Sure, understood. And then just related to the auto side of the business, how does your content per vehicle for 2020 look relative to 2019. I imagine at this point you have some view of that. Just kind of curious, what kind of growth you have in the bag already from a content perspective. Michael Larsen : Yeah, I mean the content as we talked about before is locked in for the next two to three years, so that\u2019s content growth. Obviously we don't know what the auto builds are going to be, but in terms of new product launches and content of new vehicles, the whole business is geared around you know 200 to 400 basis points of above market growth as a result of continued penetration gains. Obviously that number is higher in China as you saw this quarter again, and have seen for many years, but on average it's in that 200 basis to 400 basis range and that hasn\u2019t changed. Steven Fisher : Okay, thank you very much. A - Scott Santi : Sure. Operator : Your last question comes from Nathan Jones from Stifel. Your line is open. Nathan Jones : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for fitting me in. Michael Larsen : Good morning. Sure. Nathan Jones : Michael, you made a comment that I don't think anybody's asked you about, that the test and measurement in electronics orders were actually pretty good. I think that's probably a bit surprising given the soft CapEx environment. Can you maybe talk a little bit more about what was driving that, whether you know there is just some timing impact there or it's more of a you know an improving trend you're seeing. Michael Larsen : Yeah, I mean I think as you look at the test and measurement business, so down 4% but up 1% excluding the semi-business. We've seen actually some \u2013 a couple of months here on the semi side from an order standpoint and then the electronics business is down really primarily driven by electronic assembly. And here similar to what we talked about early, we had some orders that we're differed from Q3 into Q4, and so\u2026  But the MRO side inside of electronics and more I think like clean room technology is pretty stable. But again, it's really more \u2013 so that the pressure is really more of the on the equipment side. But again order rates are somewhat encouraging as we head into Q4. If you look at historical, Q4 is always the biggest quarter for the test and measurement business. So that's probably as much color as I can give you. Nathan Jones : Okay, and I guess my follow-up question on enterprise initiatives, you guys are looking for a four point this year and four point next year. If I think back a couple years to your Analyst Day in 2017, I think you said 2018 would be a 100 basis points, 2019 will be like half that and then you thought the margin tailwind from enterprise initiatives would be over. Clearly you're out performing that, so maybe you just talk a little bit about, you know the kind of things you have found at a time to continue to drive that, and whether there's an expectation that you can continue to drive margin improvement out of EI past 2020. Michael Larsen : Well, I think that's a great question, and I think we\u2019ll be spending quite a bit of time on that at Investor Day. I mean I think part of what's going on here is 80-20 is \u2013 the core element here is that of continuous improvement and you know I think the more work we do in this area, the better we get at 80/20, the better the raw material in terms of the underlying businesses, you know the more opportunity we find.  And so if you recall all the way back to when we launched the enterprise strategy, the goal was to get to 20% EBIT margins. Today we are sitting in the mid-20s with a clear path to 28% in the not too distant future, and it's not that we knew all along, that's what we were going to end up with. It's really that we keep getting better and better at 80-20, and 80-20 today as our operating system is more powerful than it's ever been in his to the company and it continues to evolve. So you know I can't give you specifics in terms of basis points for next year yet, but we expect to continue to make progress consistent with what we've done over the last six years and I\u2019ll just want one more data point.  If you look at, this is not one or two segments driving this. This is really broad based. I think we said between 80 and 190 basis points across the segments and so that gives me and should give you some confidence for sure that there's a lot more opportunity to come here from the margins standpoint, so\u2026 Nathan Jones : Very helpful. Thanks very much. Scott Santi : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : We have no further questions. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Karen Fletcher for closing remarks. Karen Fletcher : Okay, thanks Julianne. Thanks for joining us on the call this morning and feel free to reach out to me if you have any further questions. Thank you.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Karen Fletcher, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Karen Fletcher : Okay. Thank you, Julianne. Good morning, and welcome to ITW's Fourth Quarter 2019 Conference Call. I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi; and Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen. During today's call, we will discuss fourth quarter and full year 2019 financials results and provide guidance for full year 2020. Slide 2 is a reminder that this presentation contains our financial forecast for 2020, as well as other forward-looking statements identified on this slide. We refer you to the company's 2018 Form 10-K for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. This presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures and a reconciliation of those measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release. Finally, I would like to remind folks, we have our Investor Day coming up six weeks from today on March 13 in Fort Worth, Texas. We encourage you to join us or listen to the webcast for an update on our strategy and long range plans. The link to access the webcast is posted on our investor website. Please turn to Slide 3. And it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi. Scott Santi : Thank you, Karen, and good morning everyone. The ITW team delivered another quarter of solid operational execution and strong financial performance in Q4. Despite some broad based macro challenges, we delivered GAAP EPS growth of 9%, operating margin of 23.7% and after-tax return on invested capital of 28.9% in the quarter. For the full year against the backdrop of an industrial demand environment that went from decelerating in the first half of the year to contracting in the second half of the year, we continued to execute well on the things within our control. As a result, despite revenues that were down $700 million or 4.5% year-on-year, we delivered record GAAP EPS of $7.74 expanded operating margin to 24.4% excluding higher restructuring expenses, and grew free cash flow by 9%. In addition, we were able to raise our dividend by 7% and returned $2.8 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Equally important, in 2019, we continued to make solid progress on our path to ITW's full potential performance through the execution of our enterprise strategy. Last year, we invested more than $600 million to support the execution of our strategy and further enhanced the growth and profitability performance of our core businesses. In addition, each of our divisions continued to make progress in executing well-defined and focused plans to achieve full potential performance in their respective businesses. We look forward to providing a full progress update on our enterprise strategy and our progress towards ITWs full potential performance at our Investor Day in March. Looking ahead, ITW's powerful and proprietary business model, diversified high quality business portfolio and dedicated team of highly skilled ITW colleagues around the world position us well to continue to deliver a differentiated performance across a range of economic scenarios in 2020 and beyond. Now, I'll turn the call over to Michael who will provide you with more detail on our Q4 and full year 2019 performance as well as our guidance for 2020. Michael? Michael Larsen : Thank you Scott, and good morning everyone. In the fourth quarter, organic revenue declined 1.6% year-over-year in what remains a pretty challenging demand environment. The strike at GM reduced our enterprise organic growth rate by approximately 50 basis points and product line simplification was 60 basis points in the quarter. By geography, North America was down 2% and international was down 1%. Europe declined 1% while Asia Pacific was flat. Organic growth in China was broad-based across our portfolio and up 7% year-over-year. As expected, our execution on the elements within our control remained strong in the fourth quarter. Operating margin was 23.7% including 40 basis points of unfavorable margin impact from higher restructuring expenses year-over-year. Excluding those higher expenses, operating margin was up 10 basis points to 24.1%. Enterprise initiatives contributed 130 basis points and price cost was positive 30 basis points. GAAP EPS was up 9% to $1.99 and included $0.11 gain from three divestitures and $0.06 headwind from higher restructuring expenses year-over-year and foreign currency translation impact. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 22.8%. Free cash flow was 114% of net income and as planned we repurchased $375 million of our own shares during the quarter. Overall, Q4 was another quarter characterized by strong operational execution and resilient financial performance in a pretty challenging demand environment. Let's move to Slide four and operating margin. Overall, operating margin of 23.7% was down 30 basis points year-over-year primarily due to higher restructuring expense. Excluding those higher restructuring expenses, margin improved 10 basis points despite a 3% decline in revenues. Enterprise initiatives were once again the highlight and key driver of our margin performance contributing 130 basis points the highest level since the fourth quarter of 2017. The enterprise initiative impact continues to be broad based across all seven segments ranging from 80 to 200 basis points and the benefits of the restructuring activities that we initiated early in the year are being realized. The majority of these restructuring projects are supporting enterprise initiative implementation. Specifically our 80/20 front-to-back execution. Price remained solid with price well, ahead of raw material costs and price/cost contributed 30 basis points in the quarter. Volume leverage was negative 30 basis points. In Q4 as we always do, we updated our inventory standards to reflect current raw material costs. As raw material costs in the aggregate have declined over the course of the year, the annual mark-to-market adjustment to the value of our inventory that we do every fourth quarter this year had an unfavorable impact of 30 basis points versus last year. We also had a favorable item last year that didn't repeat this year for 40 basis points. And finally the other category which includes typical wage and salary inflation was 50 basis points, so overall solid margin performance again for the quarter and the year. Turning to Slide 5 for details on segment performance. As you know, 2019 was challenging from an industrial demand standpoint and you can see that the organic growth rate in every one of our segments -- seven segments was lower in 2019 than in 2018. At the enterprise level, the organic growth rates swung from positive 2% in 2018 to down 2% in 2019 with the biggest year on year swings in our CapEx related equipment offerings and automotive. Speaking of automotive, let's move to the individual segments results starting with automotive OEM. Organic revenue was down 5% as the GM strike reduced revenues by approximately two percentage points. Taking a closer look at regional performance. North America was in line with D3 builds down 13% Europe was essentially flat versus builds that were down 6% and China organic growth was 11% compared to builds up 1. Continued significant output in China reflects increasing penetration, particularly with local OEMs. Moving on to Slide 6, food equipment had a good quarter with organic growth up 2% year-over-year despite a tough comp of 5% organic growth last year. The service business was solid up 4% in the quarter. Equipment growth of 1% reflects double-digit growth in retail and modest decline in institutional and restaurants against tough year-over-year comps for both of those. Operating margin expanded 90 basis points to 27.5% with enterprise initiatives, the main contributor. Test and measurement in electronics had a very strong quarter with test and measurement up 6% with 13% growth in our Instron business. The segment also experienced a meaningful pickup in demand from semiconductor customers. Electronics was up 2%. Margin was the highlight as the team expanded operating margins 330 basis points to a record, 28.1% the highest in the company this quarter with strong contributions from enterprise initiatives and volume leverage. Also in the quarter, we divested in electronics business with 2019 revenues of approximately $60 million. Turning to Slide 7, welding organic revenue declined 4% against a tough comparison of 8% growth last year. North America equipment was down to 3% against a tough comparison of up 7% last year. The lower demand is primarily in the industrial business. While commercial, which includes smaller business and personal users, was pretty stable. Oil and gas was down 2%, operating margin was 25.4% down 150 basis points primarily due to higher restructuring expenses. In the quarter, we divested an installation business with 2019 revenues of approximately $60 million which reduced weldings organic -- with overall growth rate by 250 basis points in the quarter. Polymers & Fluids organic growth was down 2% versus a tough comp of plus 4% last year. Polymers was flat, automotive aftermarket was down 1%, fluids was down 6%. Operating margin was strong up 150 basis points driven primarily by enterprise initiatives. Moving to Slide 8, construction organic revenue was down 1% with continued softness in Australia and New Zealand, which was down 4%. Europe was down 3%, but the U.K. down 14%, North America was up 2% with residential remodel up 2% and commercial up 5%. Operating margin was 22.2% down due to the inventory mark-to-market adjustments and higher restructuring expenses. In specialty, organic revenue was down 3% which on a positive note is an improvement from the past couple of quarters. As in prior quarters, the main drivers are significant PLS and the relative performance of the businesses we have identified as potential divestitures. Excluding these potential divestitures, core organic growth was down 1.7%. By geography, North America was on 4 and international 3. We also divested a business in this segment with 2019 revenues of approximately $15 million and these divestitures reduced specialties of growth rate by almost 8 percentage point. Now let's quickly review full year 2019 on Slide 9, and in a challenging industrial demand environment, organic revenue was down 1.9% with total revenues down 4.5% as foreign currency translation impact reduced revenues by 2.3% and divestitures by 30 basis points. GAAP EPS was 7.74 and included $0.09 of divestiture gains as well as $0.32 of headwinds from foreign currency and higher restructuring expenses year-over-year. Operating margin was 24.1%, 24.4% excluding higher year-on-year restructuring expense as enterprise initiatives contributed 120 basis points, after tax return on invested capital improved 50 basis points to 28.7%. Our cash performance was very strong with free cash flow up 9% and a conversion rate of 106% of net income. We made significant internal investments to grow and support our highly profitable businesses, increased our annual dividend by 7% and utilized our share repurchase program to return surplus capital to our shareholders. A quick update on our various divestiture processes that overall remain on track. As a reminder, we're looking to potentially divest certain businesses with revenues totaling up to $1 billion and are targeted to complete the effort by year end 2020. The strategic objective with this phase of our portfolio management effort is to improve our overall organic growth rate by 50 basis points and improve margins by approximately 100 basis points. Not counting potential gains on sales, the plan is to offset any EPS dilution with incremental share repurchases. In the fourth quarter, we completed the sale of 3 businesses with combined 2019 revenues of approximately $135 million generating a pre-tax gain on sale of $50 million or $0.11 a share. In 2019, these businesses were a 20 basis points drag to our organic growth rate and 10 basis points to our margin rate. In summary, a challenging demand environment -- in a challenging demand environment, the ITW team executed well and delivered strong financial results, made solid progress on our enterprise strategy and agenda, including our organic growth initiatives and positioned the company for differentiated performance in 2020 and beyond. On Slide 10, we wanted to give you a quick update on the progress that we're making on our organic growth initiatives. We estimated the aggregate market growth rate or decline for each one of our segments and compared it to the segments actual organic growth rate in 2019. We also included the product line simplification by segment. As you know, full potential steady state PLS is expected to be about 30 basis points. As you can see overall, we've made some good progress as our segments are all outgrowing their underlying markets except for specialty products. At the enterprise level, we estimate that we outpaced our aggregate blended market growth rates by approximately 1 percentage points. So overall good progress on our organic growth initiatives and by completing our Finish the Job agenda over the next several years, we expect to generate one or two percentage points of additional improvement in ITW's organic growth rate. As Scott mentioned, we look forward to providing a full progress update at our Investor day in March. Now let's talk -- let's turn the page and talk about 2020 and starting with Slide 11. First, we expect GAAP EPS in the range of $7.65 to $8.05 for 2020. Using current levels of demand, adjusted for seasonality. Organic growth at the enterprise level is forecast to be in the range of 0% to 2% for the year. At current exchange rates, foreign currency translation impact and the revenue associated with our 2019 divestitures each of 1 percentage point headwind to revenue. PLS impact is expected to be approximately 50 basis points. We expect to expand operating margin from 24.1% in 2019 to a range of 24.5% to 25% in 2020 with enterprise initiatives contributing approximately a 100 basis points. After tax ROIC should improve to a range of 29% to 30% and as usual, we expect strong free cash flow with conversion greater than net income. We have allocated $2 billion to share repurchases with core share repurchases of $1.5 billion and additional $500 million to offset the EPS dilution from the three completed divestitures. Additional items include an expected tax rate in the range of 23.5% to 24.5% which represents a $0.10 EPS headwind and foreign currency at today's rates is also unfavorable $0.10 EPS. Just a quick word as it relates to the Coronavirus situation in China and we are obviously in the same position as everyone else. At this point, we've baked into our guidance a last week of production, assuming that we all return to work in China on February 10th. But obviously, it's too early to tell and we'll continue to monitor the situation closely. Overall, ITW is well positioned for a differentiated financial performance across a wide range of scenarios as we continue to execute on the things within our control and make meaningful progress on our path to full potential performance through the implementation of our Finish the Job enterprise strategy agenda. Finally, we're providing an organic growth outlook by segment for full year 2020 on Slide 12. And as always, these are based on current run rates, adjusted for seasonality and are obviously influenced by year-over-year comparisons as we go through the year. It's important to note that there's no expectation of demand acceleration embedded in our guidance. You can see that every segment is forecasted to improve the organic growth rate in 2020 relative to 2019. The same is true for margins as every segments expects to improve their margin performance in 2020. With that Karen, I'll turn it back to you. Karen Fletcher : All right. Thanks Michael. Julianne, we are ready to open up the line for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citi. Your line is open. Andrew Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning guys. Scott and Mike, you had a big pickup at Instron in the quarter and in Food Equipment, which are CapEx businesses that you've tended to watch over the year, so while recognizing all the uncertainty that's out there now, because of the virus, may be still some trade uncertainty, did you actually see some movement in CapEx decisions from your customers and what does it tell you about 2020? Michael Larsen : Well, I think Q4 certainly the growth rates in those businesses were better than what we saw in Q3. Part of that was a number of orders in Q3 that were deferred into Q4. And so I think it's -- in our view, it's a little too early to talk about a pickup in demand here in those businesses. Certainly encouraging, but a little too early to tell Andy. Andrew Kaplowitz : Okay. That's helpful. And then, if I look at your enterprise strategy program, your margin benefit seems to be accelerating here. As these programs get mature, you would think that maybe they'd level off or decelerate. So I know you have your Analyst Day coming up, you'll talk about this, maybe just continuing to get better on 80/20 as you evolve in enterprise strategy, is that, really what this is and do you expect your [indiscernible] enterprise strategy to be at least a 100 basis points, through that target date of 2023? Michael Larsen : Well, I mean, let's take one year at a time here. I think the fact that we are eight years into this current enterprise strategy and still generating, 100 basis points of margin expansion in 2020 is certainly encouraging. We've talked about before why that is, 80/20 today is significantly more powerful than when we began this journey. We've continued to learn and gotten better from an execution standpoint. The raw materials that we're working with in terms of the quality of the businesses are significantly higher after all the work we've done in the portfolio. And so I think we're really encouraged by the continued progress. We're highly confident that we will reach our 2023 performance goals. 80, 20 will be a big -- continue to be a big part of that, but it's a little too early to tell what those contributions might be in 2021 and 2022, but you can rest assure that we are highly confident in achieving those margin objectives we've put out there. Andrew Kaplowitz : Thanks Mike. Appreciate it guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Good to see that the divestiture activity picking up. Is it just that, some things kind of fell in place or do you expect actually the pace to be accelerated here? And can you remind us how many individual businesses are lefts, so these are all kind of one-at-a-time transactions, I would take it. Michael Larsen : Yes. So I think this is -- the cadence here was in line with the process that we've laid out. We've got a number of businesses. So three divestitures completed. I think when we filed a 10-K, you'll see that there are another three at this point that are in that held for sale category. And then there will be a number of businesses beyond that. So, we're making good progress in a little bit more challenging macro than what we had expected maybe going into this, but the most important\u2026 Jeff Sprague : Which has slowed the process down a bit. Michael Larsen : Yes. I think, I was going to say, it's probably slowed things down maybe a little bit. I think the really important thing is we are -- we're still on track to achieve the 50 basis points of structural improvement in our organic growth rate and a 100 basis points of margin improvement, current expectations, we're targeting to get those done by the end of 2020, and we certainly have a shot at that, but as Scott said, I mean, just given the macro backdrop that might get pushed out a little bit. But overall these processes are on track. Jeff Sprague : Well, on the flip side of that, obviously you've been hunting for deals given that you're kind of a cash rich strategic buyer, do you see things kind of getting easier? Is the pipeline filling up? Like what would you really expect to happen here in 2020 on the acquisition side? Michael Larsen : Well, I think we have certainly been more active from the standpoint and we've talked about it before in terms of our willingness to consider adding to the portfolio, the right kind of assets. And we're certainly I had -- let's just call it maxed up by our activity in that regard in 2019. As it is obvious, we didn't hit on anything yet in that regard. And it's a combination always of sort of the fit in terms of strategy and also sort of the valuation environment. And I would say the overall color in 2019 is that we looked at some things that we're interested strategically that from a valuation standpoint didn't hit the screen, didn't meet the criteria, and we will continue to be active in assessing opportunities to add to our portfolios as we've talked about in the past, but we're going to remain a very disciplined posture in that regard. And I have no doubt that we will very successfully add to our portfolio as we go. Jeff Sprague : Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : Your next question comes from Mig Dobre from Baird. Your line is open. Mig Dobre : Good morning everyone. Just a quick question on the margin guidance. Have you factored in any restructuring at this point? Michael Larsen : Yes. So the -- at this point Mig, we are guiding to margins for 2020 in that 24.5% to 25% range which includes restructuring. So on a year-over-year basis at this point we are assuming that restructuring will be flat and obviously we'll see how the year plays out and adjusts accordingly. Mig Dobre : Flat in dollar terms or in terms of margin drag? Michael Larsen : Flat in dollar terms and margin drag and therefore EPS neutral. Mig Dobre : Okay. Then my follow up, I'm just trying to kind of wrap my mind on the buckets here. So, if I'm looking at the low end of your guidance the 24.5, I'm presuming that that's consistent with the low end of the revenue guidance or the volume that you're providing. And I'm comparing it to sort of what you've done in the prior year. Can you maybe help me with a bit of a bridge here? Obviously you've got the enterprise initiatives were a 100 basis points that helped, but there's some other items to price cost, maybe some other things that you are doing how do we get to the high-end and the low-end here? Michael Larsen : So Mig, are you talking EPS or margins. What would you like to do? Mig Dobre : Just margin, not EPS, just margin. Michael Larsen : Yes. So I think for 2020, we provided quite of bit information already. And maybe one way to think about it is, the initiatives contribute a 100 basis points. We have positive volume leverage baked into our guidance. You can look at historically based on Europe organic growth rate, what the impact might be there. Price cost, we're assuming neutral at this point, maybe slightly positive and we'll see how that plays out. The divestitures that we completed in '19, that is a little bit of a favoribility to margins. And then, I'd say the remainder here is, we're going to continue to invest to support our organic growth initiatives. We're going to invest in our people and we're going to invest to sustain our core businesses as we always have. And so if you kind of look at the remaining buckets, 2020, maybe expect it to be similar to what we had in 2019. Mig Dobre : Got it. That's helpful. And lastly, if I may, as you look at your segments into 2020, are there one or two that stand out to you as having more margin potential than margin expansion potential than average? Thanks. Michael Larsen : Yes. I think, Mig, this is really across the board as I think I said in my comments, we expect every one of our segments based on our bottoms up planning process, based on what they have told us really at the divisional level on up, we expect every segment to continue to make progress in 2020 over 2019. Scott Santi : And I'd say that the other delta is, is what you talked about before, which is the volume leverage component, right? The more growth we get, the more increase in the margin we're going to get. Michael Larsen : Yes. And I think you saw a good example of that. This quarter if you look at just the performance in test and measurement margins up, 330 basis points, two-thirds of that was the volume leverage and the enterprise initiatives. So, you can see what happens in these businesses when we get a little bit of volume, a little bit of organic growth coming through. So\u2026 Mig Dobre : All right. Fair enough. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Ann Duignan from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Ann Duignan : Hi. Good morning. Just looking at your segment, organic growth forecast, could you just walk us through the various segments and where you see the upside versus the downside risks? Michael Larsen : Well, I'd say these are all, first of all based on kind of current run rates. And so, I think there are a couple of segments here that have a slightly wider range automotive OEM, welding, which reflects maybe a little more market uncertainty in those. I think Food Equipment has a measurement those look pretty solid, Food Equipment in that two to four range, Test and Measurement one to three. And then, you can see the rest here, Polymers and Fluids, Construction, Specialty kind of in that low-single-digit at the mid point. So that's kind of -- I think how we characterize it. I mean, as you know Ann, this is a pretty uncertain environment, right? I mean this is -- 2019 is a challenging year. 2020, we've got to -- we have to see how this China situation plays out that we just talked about. And so as we sit here today, this is kind of our current forecast using the current levels of demand that we're seeing in these businesses. Ann Duignan : Yes. And in that context, I mean, you're much closer to these businesses than we are obviously, but then Polymers and Fluids, I think of that business as being more consumer driven. And so, can you just talk about all of the guidance for on the downside, the negative one? Michael Larsen : Well, I think -- so Polymers and Fluids, about half of the business is -- when you say consumer-driven you're pointing I think to the automotive aftermarket business. If you just look at kind of where retail numbers are in that space, they're probably down slightly. We've had some challenges this year on the MRO side. Scott Santi : Which is more B2B. Michael Larsen : More B2B, the fluids business on the MRO side, particularly in Europe. And then, you also have a couple of other end markets that are not exactly very favorable at this point, including some petrochemical exposure. There is some marine exposure and so overall, we'd say Polymers and Fluids flat in 2019 and slightly positive here in 2020. Ann Duignan : Okay. I appreciate the color and then I'll get back in queue. Thank you. Michael Larsen : All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Andy Casey from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Andy Casey : Thanks. Good morning. A little bit of a clarification on the margin walk, you called out several things, inventory restructuring, non-repeat of an item. Would those in the past typically be included in other? Michael Larsen : Yes, that is correct. Okay. So the inventory adjustment, sorry, I need to interrupt you, but the inventory adjustment, it's one that we make every year. And it's just that this year, because raw material costs have come down throughout the year that adjustments is a little bit larger than prior years as we mark-to-market the inventory. And so we decided to call it out as a separate item and kind of give you the transparency, the detail around that. Andy Casey : Okay. Thank you. And then a few questions on the divestitures, on your earlier comment about the slower pace than expected due to the macro. Is that purely timing or are you encountering hesitancy from potential buyers of the assets because of the overall uncertainty? And then, for the three and the four sale category, you mentioned in the K, are they excluded from 2020 top-line guidance and what was their impact on 2019 margin performance? Michael Larsen : Yes. So those -- but let me start with that one. So the ones that you'll see that are held for sale, we are assuming in our guidance that we are going to own those in 2020. So 2020 numbers exclude any further divestitures as well as any acquisitions. So this is really -- think of it as all in as we the businesses that we own today. I think on your first question, I think it's a little bit of both. I mean, I think some of these, it's an element of timing. And I also think the\u2026 Scott Santi : The process is taking longer. Michael Larsen : Process is taking a little bit more longer, maybe that has to do with the desire to do maybe more due diligence. And then, I think the other piece is, the macro backdrop, there is some uncertainty and so I think we've seen some of both of those, but -- and then I'll just say finally, I mean we're going to be disciplined as we divest these businesses. And if this is not, if this isn't the right time to do it from an evaluation standpoint, we might defer some of these processes into next year. So, we'll keep you posted as we go through the year and get on these earnings calls. And we'll get you an update on the processes. Scott Santi : I'm just going to add. These are all high-quality businesses certainly on a relative basis. They are not businesses that we think are the right fit for us long term, but these are not distressed businesses by any stretch. So these are quality assets that have certainly a lot of appeal. And as Michael said to the extent that the macro environment creates a situation where we don't think we're able to trade at fair value, then we're going wait to cycle out and we'll get there eventually. But we've been able to do three so far. We've got another -- all the three versions. Andy Casey : Okay. Thanks. Just as a follow-up on that, the three that are mentioned in the K. Should we expect those to have a similar type margin performance to the three that you have already been able to sell? Michael Larsen : Yes. I think they're all pretty similar. I mean, there's a range. The average maybe it's the way to think about it is in that high-single digits EBIT percentage. So that's one way to think about it. Andy Casey : Okay. Thank you very much. Michael Larsen : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from Ross Gilardi from Bank of America. Your line is open. Ross Gilardi : Hey. Good morning, guys. Thank you. I was just wondering like, clearly, we are in a very choppy and challenging demand environment, but and you guys are continuing to expand margins even with that. But how do we -- how is the company thinking about the 3% to 5% organic objectives and at some point it's become counter productive to even be shooting for that in this type of environment. And can you remind us, where do you get to in your margins over the long-term in just sort of a flattish environment like we're in right now versus the plus three to five. Scott Santi : I think from the standpoint of our core growth rate objectives, what we are really saying essentially is that this is a business that should out grow the underlying growth rates that the markets we're in from -- anywhere from say 2% to 4% on an average basis over time. We're in a situation right now where the market and our estimation of the blended market rate, these are -- sort of using our best assumptions was down 2.5 last year. So, in a normal, let's call it a normal average GDP world of you pick whether it's two or three on a long-term basis and that's where the three to five essentially comes from in terms of the overall expectations that we have for this company. And there's nothing in this, call it industrial recessionary environment that would in any way change the view of what we think our long-term potential is. This is a highly differentiated portfolio. We've talked before and again, we'll get into a lot more depth on this at the Investor Day, but we've got the ability to generate at least the point of incremental growth from innovation. And other point from penetration is the simple math. That's the bottom-line standard that we're working to position ourselves to execute consistently on. And we've got a lot of businesses that are already there and then some. So, the last thing we'd want to do is take a point in time set of market conditions and ultimately get us off of our long-term view of what we think the potential of this company is. I think from a margin standpoint, we've got -- I'll let Michael jump in here, but we've got a set of performance objectives out into the future that we've laid out in the past that we expect to continue to make progress again. Michael Larsen : Yes. I think nothing has changed in terms of our view on the margin target as I said earlier. I mean, Ross, it might be helpful, the three to five, we know that we're not going to grow three to five every year. This is over a five-year period, we'd expect kind of in a normal macro that's the performance that we should be able to deliver. And with that comes to margins in that 28% range and EPS growth in the low double-digit, everything that we've laid out for 2023. So our views on those haven't changed just given the macro that we're in today. Ross Gilardi : No. Thanks guys. I realize you're still outgrowing your end markets. I wasn't trying to pick on you for that at all. I was just trying to -- with respect to your long-term margin target, really just to remind me how much of that getting there was coming from your ability to hit the three to five versus if we're just in a flattish environment for the next several years. Michael Larsen : Yes. I mean, again, I think the biggest driver here remains the continued strong execution on the enterprise initiatives. And then, there's a reasonable assumption of some volume leverage that comes with that. And you saw that, like I said earlier, if you look at Test and Measurement is a great example this quarter, you got a little bit of volume leverage. We get a normal macro environment. We're going to get there very quickly. I think that's what we're trying to say here. And over any five-year period, we expect that we'll average in that three to five range, but if we get a couple of really good years and we'll get there faster than that. Ross Gilardi : Okay. Since you mentioned, you reminded us of the semiconductors and I realize you weren't factoring any pickup into your guide by just ITW is obviously a great barometer for capital spending in general in the global economy. Are you seeing any signs of CapEx picking up anywhere or percolating or, it feels like discussions are getting a little bit more optimistic in any of your businesses? Michael Larsen : No. Not at this point. I think, Q4 was really more of the same. This remains a pretty challenging, a pretty challenging environment, so. Ross Gilardi : Okay. Got it. And then just the last thing I want to ask about is, you've seen a return of the outgrowth in your European and China auto businesses. China now for a couple of quarters are -- do you feel like you're back to the point where that is firmly kind of set to continue or does it feel kind of quarter-to-quarter at this point, just given the weakness in the end market? Michael Larsen : China is very solid. I mean, I think we have a long track record. The team has a long track record of outgrowing the underlying market there by a wide margin. And as I think we said in the prepared remarks, big drivers are continued penetration with local OEMs and there is a lot of runway still. And if you just look at the projects that have been locked in for the next two to three years, we're confident that that outperformance will continue. Scott Santi : Yes. I think on the question of Europe and North America, I think the issues now, we're sort of using a very gross number in terms of builds and the underlying issues are given the volatility OEM to OEM in those builds and what's going on in the quarter-to-quarter. It's kind of -- a bit of a choppy comparison. I think on a full year basis, it's a better way to look at our relative performance in Europe and North America. We will be in a position to provide an update on that for '19 at the Investor Day. So some of the -- my only point is, we have a big pipeline of penetration projects in Europe and North America and fully expect on a sort of -- let's call it even a medium term, that we will outgrow those markets by a minimum of two to four points. But some of the last things that have gone on over the last six quarters, both from the standpoint of how different individual OEMs are reacting to some of the current environment and how the supply chains react to those OEMs reacting. There's some sort of real volatility that I think sort of mucks up some of the ability to see through the underlying progress. But we track our penetration on a per vehicle basis with each of the OEMs. And on that basis feel really good about our ability to continue to penetrate at a rate well above market all around the world. Ross Gilardi : Got it. Thanks guys. Operator : Your next question comes from John Inch from Gordon Haskett. Your line is open. John Inch : Good morning everybody. Hi guys. Michael, just a quick clarification, the repo is going from 1.5 to 2, is that delta of 500 to offset the 1.35 of the divestitures you announced or\u2026 Michael Larsen : Yes. That's correct. So let me just spend a second on that. So kind of the -- our estimate for surplus capital for the year is 1.5 billion, but that's currently allocated to share repurchases. I think of those as kind of the core share repurchases. And then there's an incremental 500 million to offset the EPS or the earnings that went away with those three divestitures. And to the extent that there are -- hopefully there are further divestitures this year. We will adjust that share repurchase number accordingly. So we could end up at a number that's higher than what's on the page today. John Inch : Got it. Michael, is overall demand growth presumably begins to come back once we get past some of these China issues in this year and you're spending probably dollars up a little bit consistent with what other companies might be doing. How are you feeling about your confidence level of maintaining or how should we think about, say, a 100 basis points of enterprise initiatives that actually came in the past when growth was better in the environment? Does it, is it one of those things where maybe the -- you get better improvement because of the contribution benefits from improved growth by EI, enterprise initiative benefits sort of bounce back a little bit because of the spending or, , how would you think of the mix of that? I suppose on an improving\u2026 Scott Santi : Yes. I'll sort of piggyback on part of what Michael said earlier, which is -- the enterprise initiative visibility that we have is really about one-year forward, so that those are discrete projects, certainly underneath a broader strategy that is largely around two things at this point, strategic sourcing and continued improvement in the quality of our practice of 80/20 across the company. And so what we're saying now is, we've got another point in front of us in 2020 that certainly I can say with confidence if that's not the end of it. But we will continue to have that as some additional sort of fuel to the profitability story here for a while. The other thing, I can tell you is on sort of the incremental contribution from organic growth as it accelerates. The best way I can frame that as I don't see any way, we don't generate somewhere in the range of 30% to 35% incremental contribution from every dollar of organic growth over and above enterprise initiative. John Inch : That's helpful. Yes, no, it definitely helps. But just lastly, Scott and Michael, what are your -- what would you say your top personal priorities are for ITW to accomplish? Maybe as we look back in a year on 2020, if there's a way to sort of frame that out? Scott Santi : You asked to go individually. Michael is going to say he is going to upgrade the quality of the CEO. But I think we're on it. I think the biggest things that we've got to continue to do the thing we've been, it's certainly been the largest part of our focus for the last, I'd say two years now is really continued to accelerate our focus or not just our focus, but our execution on organic growth. And this kind of environment, it's certainly hard to see the underlying progress. But I can tell you that all of us get up every morning thinking about -- our Vice Chair, Chris O'Herlihy, Michael and I and everyone of our AVPs get up every morning thinking about what are we going to do today to help to continue to get this company towards our full potential from an organic growth rate standpoint. I think the other activities around the enterprise initiatives are -- there's a lot of potential there. Those are certainly things that need some level of attention to continue the momentum for sure. But ultimately I feel really good about both the structural and strategic things we're doing from the standpoint of organic growth acceleration. And I don't think that changes in 2020 regardless of what the macro is doing at the moment. Michael to give you his answer. Michael Larsen : Mine is exactly the same. I would just add, John, that at Investor Day, we obviously going to spend a lot of time on this topic of organic growth including, we'll give you a progress update if you would call on the number of divisions that are in that ready to grow and growing category defined as consistently growing above market. We're not going to -- and we'll share those numbers with you and you'll see we made steady progress in 2019. And we expect to -- as we execute on some really focused plans in 2020 to continue to make progress on that. So we'll share those metrics with you and we'll also give you some real divisional examples because that's really where this work is taking place. To give you kind of some insights to what Scott's talking about. The whole company is focused on getting the organic growth rate going and we'll give you a lot more detail on that when we get together in March. John Inch : I mean, the way you talked about Instron last time was very helpful. So yes, very much looking forward to it. Thank you very much. Bye. Bye. Operator : Your next question comes from Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Jamie Cook : Hi. I think most of my questions been answered. Just clarification -- or I guess two questions. One, on the welding side, I appreciate, your guide, just wondering, how you think about your organic growth guide relative to sort of what we saw in the 15, 16 time period and why we shouldn't be concerned? What you're seeing in the market to give you confidence that it couldn't be worse than that? And then my second question, just given all the restructuring that you guys have done and obviously done a great job improving your margins, but assuming the markets were weak or is there any change if your sales declined on how we should think about decrementals? Thanks. Michael Larsen : Yes. I think on the restructuring, maybe I'll start with that. I think, we'll see how the year unfolds. And if market conditions deteriorate similar to what we did last year, we'll pull forward some of these enterprise initiative projects specifically related to our 80, 20 front to a back pipeline. I expect we will play at the same way in 2020. Welding, I think difficult comps. I'll start there. That's a business that was up 10% in 2018, it's slightly down in 2019 at current run rates. We're estimating down 2 to plus 2, and that's really, as much as we know at this point. We know that in all of our businesses, regardless of what the environment throws at us, we will react accordingly. And manage the cost side of the equation as we always do. Like we did in 2019 and 2020 will not be different, but I don't have a better -- we don't have a better crystal ball than you in terms of what welding might look like other than, we're using current run rates and\u2026 Scott Santi : And the underlying activity, it's far from terrible in terms of the amount of\u2026 Michael Larsen : Yes. Scott Santi : The assumption going on. We saw a pretty big pullback in cap spending on, in welling and other places in '19, but I think our assumptions for 20 or certainly not for improvement in the CapEx investment side of that. But I think steady state is a reasonable assumption given the underlying. And input we're getting from our customers and we're seeing in terms of the actual sort of consumption of welding consumables, et cetera. Jamie Cook : Thanks. I'll let someone ask a question. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Joe Richie from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Joe Richie : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Happy Friday. So, my first question, I guess I'm trying to understand what comprises the low-end of your guidance. Since it would imply deceleration in earnings at a time when you're expecting, growth to be a little bit better and for margins to still be there? Michael Larsen : Well, I mean, I think -- like I said earlier, we were in a pretty challenging demand environment. And in the guidance range, what we try to do is account for a wide range of possible scenarios. I think the biggest swing factor here will be the overall demand environment. And so if things remain where they are you know, we'll be likely closer to the mid point, if things accelerate from a demand standpoint, we'll be at the high end or, or above. And if things slow further, we'll be at the lower end. So I think that's really the, the best answer. I can give you the remainder of the items, you know, the initiatives. We've clear line of sight as I think Scott said earlier, do all the projects and activities and that'll generate those savings. We know what the share repurchase program in terms of share count will do. Currency, tax we're using, the rates that we gave you. And so I think those are -- there's a lot less variation around those. The swing factor here is whether the overall demand environment and in the near-term this situation in China that needs to be sorted out. And so we're keeping a close eye on that. So that's probably the best I can give you. Joe Richie : Okay. That's helpful Michael. And maybe -- my quick follow-up here is, I'm thinking about the cadence both from a growth and from a margin perspective, is the expectation as we kind of start 2020, that growth remains negative and then turns positive as the year progresses. And then, specifically on margins, you guys front end loaded, your restructuring last year. How should we think about that 40 basis point impact in 2020 you're going to front-end the 2020 as well. Michael Larsen : No. That's not the current plan on the restructuring, I think it'll be more kind of equally spread throughout the year. If the demand environment deteriorates, we can obviously adjust. I think on your first question. So as you appreciate, we don't provide quarterly guidance anymore. I think if you look at kind of historically at how organic growth and margins and EPS kind of plays out through the year. If you look at historical averages, you can get pretty close to a reasonable scenario here. I think in Q1, we have this added uncertainty around China. So we'll have to see where the organic growth rate ends up. And then I think on margins, typically what you see in Q1 is some margin improvement year-over -ear. And then sequentially Q2 Q3 gets better. And then Q4 is slightly lower. So if you look at these historical trends Joe, I think you can -- I think that's pretty informative as you think about 2020. Joe Richie : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Steven Fisher from UBS. Your line is open. Steven Fisher : Thanks. Good morning. I know that the commercial construction piece of your construction business is not the biggest, but you've had some helpful and interesting perspectives on that in recent quarters. Just curious what your view is at this point, what you're seeing and assuming going forward on a commercial piece. Michael Larsen : Yes. So the commercial business can be a little lumpy on a quarterly basis. Really they're related to the timing of projects. So 5% in the quarter was certainly one of the better numbers from that business. I think if you look at the full year the business construction and the commercial side is actually down low single digits. And so, I think we expect a current runway rates, it'll be a similar to that in 2020. So I wouldn't expect a significant acceleration in 2020 and again, the Q4 number at 5% is at the high-end of what this business typically does. Steven Fisher : Okay. That's helpful. And then just to follow up again on welding, where does the current run rate of business puts you within that range of minus 2 to plus 2. I know you said you're, this is of the businesses where you're assuming a wider range of outcome. So just curious where that -- where it puts you in that range and because it, it does seem like, there could be some additional headwinds there. So I'm also wondering if within that consumable piece that's keeping it relatively steady overall, are there some of the drivers that are more positive and some that are more negative. Michael Larsen : Well, I think to answer your question, we try to do is bracket kind of the mid point of what the runway would suggest for 2020, adjusted for typical seasonality. So that's probably the best I can give you pro welding. So, our capital goods to consumable ratio and welding is 60. Scott Santi : I think as you know, our product mix, the geographic mix is quite different than some of our peers in this space. So we are more weighted on the equipment side. That's where the technology is. That's where the higher margins are relative to the consumable side. And you know, we're more weighted towards the North American market, which represents almost 80% of our business. Steven Fisher : And there's no way within that segment the end markets that are driving the demand there. Any that are up in any that are down or you're all seeing them kind of moving in the same direction? Michael Larsen : No, I think, the industrial side, so think more heavy equipment. There's certainly some contraction and demand there down those single digits. I think the commercial side, which is more the smaller businesses, personal users that's more flattish at this point. And I think we gave you oil and gas earlier. Was I think down 2%. And so that's probably as much color as I can give you a welding. Steven Fisher : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Our last question will come from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : Thanks guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking me in. I think you have covered a lot of ground here. So I want to keep this kind of fairly high level. So, I think we now in the eighth year of maybe seventh, eighth year of the enterprise initiatives and obviously it's been very successful. It seems like most of the benefits really come through on the SG&A line in the last sort of three or four years. You talked about strategic sourcing is a big 10 a driver this year, Scott and wanting to other things as well. But do you think that we're now at a level where the benefits will come more in the gross margin line and maybe on top of that, do you think there's more scope to take down SG&A below 16% going forward? Michael Larsen : Well, I think Nigel, so far contributions from 80/ 20 and sourcing have been fairly equal, we divided I think under the go forward basis we may see a little bit more impact on the VM side. But, I think overall the important thing is what we talked about earlier, another solid 100 basis points this year and from the enterprise initiatives, what the exact geography will look like. We'll see as the year unfolds. Maybe a little bit more, like I said, on the variable side of things. But overall, what's really encouraging is every segment continues to execute and identify projects, just look at Q4, the range of contribution here is from 80 to -- all the way to 200 basis points and overall 130 basis points in the fourth quarter. So that's probably as much as, yes\u2026 Scott Santi : I think the only thing I would add is the way this gets executed. We're not going after some ratio on the P& L. We're simplifying business processes. We're improving how we execute. In terms of certainly from the standpoint of productivity and efficiency, but also benefits around how we serve our customers. So none of it is that says, okay, this project, or the focus now is SG&A, the focus is how do we, how do we better support sort of the quality pieces of each of these individual businesses. And so it's hard for me to even think about your question in the sense of sort of where in the geography on the P&L, this is, we're simplifying and improving the effectiveness of the overall performance of the business. And it certainly is going to adjust the ratios on the P&L as a result. I'm sitting here kind of trying to think about your question and it just is kind of outside of how it actually happens. We improve our practices and we generate outcomes in terms of -- and we're, we focus on the top-line and the bottom-line and ultimately to improve the bottom line, those ratios all have to get better in terms of margin, but ultimately it's not really focused at particular slice of the cost structure, but maybe that looks it up even further. Nigel Coe : The ratios are not coming on inputs. I think I understand that. And then, just a quick follow-on, and this is definitely for Mike on the inventory. So the 40 bps adjustment, that's a LIFO charge, is that correct? Michael Larsen : Yes. I mean it's really -- it's the mark-to-market of the inventory given that raw material costs have come down. So as we adjust the standards lower to reflect the lower raw material costs, that's the impact that you're seeing. Nigel Coe : Okay. I've got a CPA, but inventory accounting is a way to escape me. Michael Larsen : So, I can promise we will provide a lot of detail in the 10-K that should satisfy even the most advanced CPAs amongst us. Nigel Coe : So, yes, I'm saying not about CPA, but they just conceptually, the little raw materials close through the price cost line, and then we've got a mark-to-market at year end, is that, does that sort of just in a very simplistic way to think about it? Michael Larsen : In very simple terms, that's how it works. Yes. Nigel Coe : Yes. Great. Thanks Mike. Michael Larsen : All right. Thank you. Operator : We have no further questions. We turn the call back over to Ms. Fletcher for closing remarks. Karen Fletcher : Okay. Thanks for joining us this morning. I know it's a busy day for everybody.

And it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi. Scott Santi : Thank you, Karen and good morning, everyone. Stating the obvious, a lot has changed relative to the environment we operated in for most of the first quarter. As a result, our focus this morning will be on the company's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and, more specifically, our strategy to leverage ITW\u2019s considerable strengths in executing on the challenges and opportunities ahead. I will provide some brief commentary on our Q1 performance, and then we will transition to our pandemic strategy. We have included much of our normal quarterly performance detail in the appendix and you are of course, welcomed to ask questions regarding our Q1 results during the Q&A session at the conclusion of our presentation. As Karen noted, I've asked our Vice Chairman, Chris O\u2019Herlihy to join Michael and me on the call this morning, as I thought that it would be helpful for you to hear perspectives from all three of us and how we are managing through the near-term challenges of the containment period we're currently in and on the actions we are taking now and will take over the coming weeks and months to ensure that the company is positioned to participate fully in the recovery.  Before we jump in, I want to offer our heartfelt thanks to all of our ITW colleagues around the world. We talk often about the fact that our decentralized entrepreneurial culture is a key element of ITW\u2019s secret sauce. It is core to who we are as a company, and it is never more valuable than during times of significant and in this case, rapid change. The proactive teamwork, ingenuity and selflessness of our people and quickly adapting to rapidly changing conditions and tackling new challenges that seemingly arise daily at the moment is ITW at its finest. We thank all of our colleagues for the incredible level of care and commitment they are bringing to keeping their co-workers safe, while continuing to serve our customers with excellence. The fact that the ITW team has responded exactly as we expected they would doesn't make it any less extraordinary. Now on to first quarter results, total revenue declined 9% year on year with organic revenue down 6.6%, currency at 1.5% headwind, a negative 1% impact from divestitures and 40 basis points of PLS.  The majority of the organic revenue decline occurred in the last two weeks of March where we saw organic revenue down more than 20%. By geography, North America was down 5% and Europe was down 7%, China was down 24% for the quarter, but appears to have bottomed in February and was flat year on year in April. An encouraging sign. In the face of a challenging demand environment, we continue to execute well on the elements within our control. Despite a 9% decline in revenues, operating margin was flat at 23.6%, 5 of our 7 segments expanded margins in the quarter due largely to benefits from enterprise initiatives which contributed 120 basis points to operating margin at the enterprise level. After tax return on invested capital is 27% and free cash flow was $554 million with a conversion rate of 98% of net income. Lastly, as noted in our press release this morning, given the uncertainties regarding the impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are suspending our previously announced guidance for full year 2020. We will resume guidance once and market stabilized and the recovery path becomes more clear.  Now let's shift gears and talk about how we will manage ITW through the global pandemic. Please turn to slide 4. Despite the unusual and in some cases unprecedented challenges of the moment, we continue to execute at a high level and with our usual degree of focus and discipline across the company. As a result of all the work we have done over the last 7 years in executing our enterprise strategy and the progress we have made on the path to our full potential performance, ITW is today in a position of significant strength in dealing with the effects of the global pandemic.  Today's ITW is centered on our powerful and proprietary business model and our people are better trained and more skilled at executing it than ever before in the history of our company. ITW is 80/20 front to back methodology and the laser light focus that drives on the relative handful of critical performance, difference makers, and every one of our businesses has served the company extremely well in times of both opportunity and challenge for a long time now. I have no doubt that this unique ITW skill will be a significant asset to us as we work our way through the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath.  In addition, as I mentioned earlier, we are very fortunate to have a decentralized operating structure and an entrepreneurial culture that has been developed, nurtured, and protected over many years. Our people think and act like owners. They are accountable and they deliver. They are deeply trained in our business model, our strategy and our values and I assure you that even in an unprecedented times such as these, none of them are waiting around to be told what to do. In addition, in today's ITW, we have worked hard in shaping our portfolio and driving consistent high quality execution across every business in it, both to position the company to deliver consistent upper tier long term earnings growth, when global conditions are favorable and to build in a margin cushion and level of diversification, that makes us highly resilient during most periods when they are not. And it follows from there that the robust free cash flow we generate through our strong margin profile, and the unique attributes of our business model, combined with our very, disciplined capital allocation strategy, gives us an extremely strong balance sheet and Tier 1 credit ratings. So with these elements is our foundation, our strategy for managing through the pandemic and its aftermath is to focus, on the following four priorities. First, to protect the health and support the well being of our ITW colleagues, second, to continue to serve our customers with excellence, third, to maintain financial strength, liquidity and strategic optionality and fourth, to leverage ITW strengths to position the company to fully participate, in the recovery. Chris will give you some additional color on priorities one and two. Michael will cover priority three and I will come back and cover priority four. And then, we'll open it up for your questions, Chris. Good morning, over to you. Chris O\u2019Herlihy: Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. This is a challenging time for all of us, as the world continues to grapple with the effects of a global pandemic. At this point, I'm sure that every one of us has been impacted by this situation, in ways that were unimaginable just a few months ago. And ITW as a company and the community is certainly being affected. Having said that, and Scott reference, or divisional leaders think and act like owners, are able to react quickly and take the necessary actions to protect our people and serve our customers, which is a particular advantage of the company, in times of significant challenge. Let's move to slide 6. The actions were taken to protect the health and support, the well being of our colleagues. We developed and deployed a number of practices to minimize exposure. And prevent the spread of COVID-19 and keep our colleagues safe. We have followed CDC, WHO, and local government guidelines in doing so. Out ITW colleagues have redesigned production processes to ensure proper social distancing practices, adjusted shift schedules and assignments that have colleagues who have childcare needs, due to school closings and implemented aggressive new water and sanitation practices, to minimize infection risk. We're also providing full compensation to employees, who have been quarantined. In addition, our strategic sourcing team is heavily engaged in helping our businesses, by coordinating the procurement of personal protective equipment, to ensure all our employees receive the protection they need. I'm pleased to say, that as a result of our containment efforts, to this point we've largely been able to restrict infections to single cases, in a minority of our locations, which is a testament to the actions our colleagues have taken to implement sound sanitation practices and social distancing and to protect one another, to the best of their abilities. Turning to slide 7, let's shipped to another important stakeholder group and how we continue to serve our customers with excellence. To support our customers, our teams have worked diligently to keep our factories open and operating safely. In areas around the world where governments have issued shelter in place orders, the vast majority of ITW businesses have been designated as critical or essential businesses. And as such, they're needed to really an open and operational. In some cases, it's because our products directly impact, the COVID-19 response effort. For example, our welding equipment is used to manufacture hospital beds or structural products are utilized to build temporary medical facilities, or test and measurement products test medical and laboratory equipment. Our Polymers & Fluids products sanitize workplaces. And our food service equipment is used to feed people in hospitals. In other cases, our businesses are designated as critical, because they play a vital role in serving and supporting industries. They're essential to the physical and economic health of our communities. Although, some facilities are subject to mandatory shutdowns, roughly 95% of our global manufacturing capacity is currently available to be deployed to serve our customers. The same is true for our service networks, particularly in food equipment and test and measurement, which we continue to keep fully available in order to ensure that we can help keep essential businesses and healthcare facilities in operation. In both cases, across all segments, we continue to maintain best-in-class performance for product and service quality and the availability. Finally, we're rigorously managing our supplier base to both mitigate near-term supply risk for critical raw materials and components and ensure that we are positioned to win in a wide range recovery scenarios going forward. With that, I'll turn the call over to Michael. Michael Larsen : Okay, thank you, Chris. And good morning, everyone. Well, that\u2019s the primary objective of our enterprise strategy, an important byproduct, if you will, a lot of work done over the last seven years is that ITW is in a position of considerable financial strength to deal with highly disruptive events, such as this global pandemic. In many ways, ITW was built for times like this. And through the pandemic, we will manage the company to maintain our financial strength, liquidity and strategic optionality so that we can leverage our strong financial foundation and resilient profitability profile to position the company for maximum participation in the recovery. Turn to Slide 9, there's no question that in Q2, we will see an unprecedented level of demand contraction due to the complete shutdown of wide swaths of the global economy. ITW has more than enough financial strength and resilient \u2013 resilience to withstand this kind of shock to the system, that the global economy is under experience over the next several months. We are prepared for it. We'll get through it. And we'll come out the other side strongly positioned for the recovery. As we sit here today, one month into the quarter, we're estimating the Q2 revenues will be down 30% to 40% on a year-over-year basis. Obviously, there's a fair amount of uncertainty around how May and June actually play out but that is our current view. As you would expect, given that most of our automotive OEM customers in North America and Western Europe have been essentially shut down since mid-March, and are only beginning to restart production in early to mid-May. Our automotive OEM business will be the hardest hit with revenues potentially down 60% to 70% year-over-year. And abrupt decline of this magnitude in the quarter is pretty unprecedented. As difficult as it may look, if it plays out this way, we expect that ITW will still make operating profit in the $200 million to $400 million range, generate free cash flow of more than $500 million and end the Q2 with cash on hand of about $1.5 billion. Onto slide 10. Knowing that we have the financial strength to withstand whatever comes our way over the next few months, our number one priority becomes positioning to play offense in the recovery. And this is an area where our strong margin profile really helps us. Whether the pace of recovery is fast or slow, V shaped or U shaped, over the next few quarters, it doesn't really impact us that much. Under very fast paced recovery, we end up down 15% for the full year, and margins are 19% to 21%. They're much slower recovery, revenues are down 25%. Yet, our margins are still a very strong 17% to 19%. This is against a backdrop, where most of the companies that our divisions compete with came into the pandemic, with margins at half of ours or less. As a result, a number of them may have to retrench in a major way in order to get through the epidemic, potentially creating some significant share gain opportunities for us in the recovery. With our margin cushion, we are concerned with how quickly demand is going to recover in Q3 or Q4. We can be fairly certain that it will be incrementally better than Q2. But beyond that, it really doesn't affect us a whole lot, which allows us to think long-term and positioned for maximum participation in the recovery, making sure that we are in a strong position to fully support our customers, as their businesses begin to re accelerate, and that we are in an equally strong position to take share from competitors, who can't, is the central imperative of our pandemic response planning for every one of our divisions. We will, of course, need to manage our businesses smartly across our portfolio and make some meaningful capacity and cost structure adjustments in businesses, where we expect prolonged recovery periods, or maybe even permanent demand impacts from the pandemic. But as we always do, we will leave those decisions in the hands of our divisional leaders as they are in the best position to assess the pace and slope of the cut of the recovery in each of their respective businesses. Turning to slide 11. The financial benefits of our enterprise strategy, combined with the work done to optimize our capital efficiency, capital structure and capital allocation over the years, has put ITW in a very strong position going into this crisis. At quarter end, we have more than $1.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents on hand. At the end of Q1 and it's still the case. As of today, we have essentially no short-term debt. And we have not issued any commercial paper. Why you might ask? Simply put, because we don't need to cash. We have a $2.5 billion undrawn credit facility available to us, if needed in the future bring our total liquidity to about $4 billion as we sit here today. Our net leverage is only 1.7 times and our next maturity is pretty small, $350 million and not until September 2021. High quality of earnings and strong free cash flow are hallmarks of ITW. As you know, we consistently generate significantly more cash than we need for internal purposes. And our annual conversion rate from net income is consistently above 100%. We expect that to continue to be the case, as we manage our way through the pandemic. As evidenced by Tier 1 credit ratings that are the highest in our peer group, we continue to have excellent access to credit markets in the event that we needed. During this time of market volatility, it's also worth mentioning that our pension plans, have remained in great shape. Over the years, we have consistently funded and de risked our plans. And as we sit here today, our largest U.S. plan is funded at 104%. Turning to slide 12. So how do we think about and adjust our capital allocation approach during the pandemic? First, with regard to the dividend. We recognize the importance of ITW's dividend to our long term shareholders. We have a long history, with more than 56 years of growing the dividend. And we are part of a small group of so-called dividend aristocrats, and one of about 18 companies that has increased its dividend for more than 50 years. And we view the dividend as a critical component of ITW's total shareholder return model. Since 2012, we have increased the annualized dividend from $1.52 per share to currently $4.28 per share, a cumulative annual growth rate of 16%. Simply put, we remain strongly committed to our dividend and as we sit here today, we do not see a scenario where we would have to reduce the dividend. In terms of strategic optionality, we are clearly in a position of strength, with ample balance sheet capacity. And we're certainly open to the possibility that opportunities might emerge as a result of the pandemic. It could be in the form of more reasonable valuation opportunities for assets that we were already interested in, as well as some unique opportunities with quality companies that may not have the financial strength to weather the pandemic. Given our financial strength and ample capacity, we will be in a strong position to react to any high quality strategic opportunities that may emerge. We will continue to fully fund all internal investment and CapEx projects that meet our criteria, like we always have, but the number will likely come down in terms of aggregate spend in the near term, simply due to the fact that we don't need any capacity expansion projects for the next several quarters. Finally, I think, it comes as no surprise to anyone that we have suspended share repurchases until end markets stabilize and the recovery path becomes clearer. With that, I'll turn it back over to Scott. Scott Santi : Thank you, Michael. And as a priority four, which is all about leveraging our strengths to make sure that every one of our businesses are strongly positioned to fully participate in the recovery. In short, we are going to be there to serve every bit of our customers' needs as their businesses begin to reaccelerate and be well prepared to capture any share gain opportunities that may come our way.  Food equipment had a good quarter with organic growth up 2% year-over-year despite a tough comp of 5% organic growth last year. The service business was solid up 4% in the quarter. Equipment growth of 1% reflects double-digit growth in retail and modest decline in institutional and restaurants against tough year-over-year comps for both of those. Operating margin expanded 90 basis points to 27.5% with enterprise initiatives, the main contributor. Test and measurement in electronics had a very strong quarter with test and measurement up 6% with 13% growth in our Instron business. The segment also experienced a meaningful pickup in demand from semiconductor customers. Electronics was up 2%. Margin was the highlight as the team expanded operating margins 330 basis points to a record, 28.1% the highest in the company this quarter with strong contributions from enterprise initiatives and volume leverage. Also in the quarter, we divested in electronics business with 2019 revenues of approximately $60 million. In the face of an unprecedented demand contraction in Q2, as Michael commented earlier, we will still generate operating income in the hundreds of million dollars and generate over $500 million in free cash flow. We will manage discretionary expenses prudently, but we don't need to start cutting muscle immediately. And we certainly want to avoid doing so, before we have some level of indication as to the shape and slope of the recovery in each of our businesses. With this principle in mind, to this point, we are providing full compensation and benefits support to all ITW colleagues around the world. And we're going to do our best to sustain that level of support for all of our people through at least the end of Q2. We are doing it because we are in a position to support our people at a time of great personal and family stress and uncertainty. And we think that it's the right thing to do. But we're also doing it to protect the significant investment we have made in training and developing great ITW people and great ITW leaders over the past seven years. As Michael mentioned, it is likely that we will need to make some staffing adjustments to align with prolonged or permanently lower demand in some of our businesses as a result of the pandemic. So we are committed to being there for all of our people during the worst of this, and we will take the time to make whatever longer-term adjustments need to be made thoughtfully. The second principle is that we're going to lean into the upside by remaining invested in structure to capture incremental demand. Given the profitability of our core businesses in the strength of our financial position, what's the bigger risk for ITW, carrying more cost and it turns out we need for a few months or cutting too much and not being able to fully serve the needs of our customers and take share from our competitors as the recovery accelerates. Obviously, we believe short sheet and the upside potential of the recovery would be the far bigger mistake for ITW. And we're going to plan and execute our recovery strategies accordingly. The third principle is that we're going to leverage the strength of ITW to protect investment in areas of strategic importance to the execution of our long-term strategy. We're early in our planning around all these areas. But as one example, prior to the pandemic, we invested two plus years in our strategic sales excellence initiative that included significant investments in new sales and sales leadership talent. We have the financial capacity to protect these types of long-term strategic investments. And doing so is worth a lot more over the long-term to the company, there are a few extra detrimental margin points in the short-term. That being said, decremental margins should likely be in our normal 35% to 40% range in Q4. Between now and then, we're going to focus on making sure ITW is in a strong position to fully participate in the recovery. Turning to slide 14, this is just a reminder that our long-term strategic priorities remain unchanged that we are committed to achieving and sustaining ITW potential performance, and continuing on our quest to firmly establish ITW as one of the world's best performing, highest quality, and most respected industrial companies. Now let's move on to slide 15 to wrap things up. Once again on behalf of Chris, Michael and I, and our entire executive leadership team, we thank our ITW colleagues around the world for the exceptional job they are doing under the most challenging circumstances. As of right now, there's no way to know how severe this crisis will be, how long it will last, or how quickly our customers and then markets will recover. What I do know is that the strength and resilience of ITW\u2019s business model and our people put us in about a stronger position as an industrial manufacturing company can be in, to deal with that whatever will unfold over the coming weeks and months. I have every confidence that ITW will rise to the challenges we always have over the course of our 108-year history. Our strong financial position and margin profile give us the ability to make strategic moves now to position the company to fully participate across a range of recovery scenarios, and to come out the other side ready to continue on our path to ITW full potential performance. With that, Karen, I'll turn it back to you. Karen Fletcher : Okay. Thanks, Scott. As a reminder, please see the appendix in today's slide deck for the usual segment detail for the first quarter. So Julianne, let\u2019s open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Ann Duignan from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Ann Duignan : Hi, good morning, everybody. Appreciate being on the call. Scott, maybe you could talk a little bit about your various businesses and whether you would anticipate that any of the businesses might be permanently impaired rather than just cyclical and I'm thinking welding, oil and gas, I'm thinking through the equipment, you know, et cetera, et cetera. How are you thinking about that as we look forward? Scott Santi : I'd say and overall, it's just way too early to tell. I think, I don't see anything you know, we have a division that provides support equipment to the airline industry is probably among the ones that I would say would see kind of the longest tail in terms of recovery. But from where we sit today, as early as it is in this whole process, it's I don't \u2013 I don't see anything that that would be sort of obvious or apparent in terms of permanent change or damage, if you will, from this pandemic. There may be but we'll deal with it. Michael Larsen : I might just add Ann, if you specific to oil and gas, if you look at the enterprise level, our sales into oil and gas are in the no single-digits and maybe as you were pointing out, primarily in welding, maybe 15% to 20% of welding depending on what year you're in, primarily on the international side. But as Scott said, it's really too early to tell what the recovery path might look like in that part of the company. Ann Duignan : Perfect, thank you. And then maybe just to follow up on the strategic M&A and the opportunities to update at maximum participation when the recovery occurs, could you just expand on that a little bit? Like, it is interesting to hear you comment on that? Scott Santi : Well, I think there is no, this is no, nothing I would characterize as a change in strategy, we had certainly talked for some time about the addition of some incremental growth from acquisitions as a core part of our strategy. I think there's, you know, it's not rocket science to anticipate that there are going to be either from the standpoint of a reset on valuation and/or given the level of financial stress its going to be out there that there might be some opportunities emerge as a result in our own commentary is that we are going to preserve our ability to access those that doesn't change the criteria one but this is not a matter of looking at things that we would have not looked at otherwise, but the sort of relative availability of things that would fit \u2013 I would expect would be perhaps more enhanced as a result of the situation. Ann Duignan : So we shouldn't anticipate you stepping up and making a larger than expected acquisition in a new platform or anything like that. Is that what you're saying? That there's no change in the strategy, just the opportunities might be more? Scott Santi : Yeah, well, I'm not sure I would limit it based on size. I think it's a function of stick with that strategy. Obviously, we've talked about that criteria in the past and we\u2019ve got an opportunity that kind of business that has high value add content in terms of their products and the way their products impact their customers, and where we see a significant ability to impact the performance of a business through the application of our business model. That's what I'm saying is the same as it's always been. Whether that's big or small, will be a function of the quality of the asset less than the size. Ann Duignan : Okay. I appreciate. I'll get back into thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from John Inch from Gordon Haskett. Your line is open. John Inch : Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Hey, Scott, Michael. Scott Santi : Good morning John Inch : Good morning. And Chris, given that there's no centralized cost containment actions that you guys are announcing today, I'm wondering, if the detrimental as you've presented include assumptions that the businesses preserve respective cost containment actions or are they more of a kind of a worst case scenario? Scott Santi : I'm trying to interpret the question. I think, John, I think if I'm going to paraphrase here, I think you're asking, what is included from a restructuring standpoint for the balance of the year? John Inch : Sure. Recognizing -- recognizing that you're not doing it centrally? It's coming from the businesses. Chris O\u2019Herlihy: Yeah. Absolutely, I mean, I think the honest answer is until we know what the recovery path looks like, and the divisions have had a chance to really interpret, you know, division-by-division, what that path is, and therefore, what capacity and cost, adjustments need to be made. We don't know what the restructuring is going to be. But obviously, we have included in the numbers that we're showing you today, a placeholder for an educated guess I hope for what restructuring might be. But it really is. John, as you might appreciate, too early to tell at this point. Scott Santi : Yeah. And I think the sort of core planning mandate around this and everything we've just tried to articulate is we're going to spend the next couple of quarters really making sure that we're in the right position to fully support our customers and access any incremental growth opportunities that might emerge from this recovery phase. And we'll \u2013 we'll do what we always do. We'll adjust our cost structure smartly. We're not going to do it through some, either from on high we're going to do it business-by-business. That's no different than we've always done it. The difference now is that, we are have positioned from the standpoint of entry margins and the final cushion that we have is we can take the time to plan our way through it in a way that doesn't necessarily does our best to protect The upside potential next really all we're saying, I said in my comments that, we'll be back to our normal incremental by Q4. But there's really no benefit to us that I see of trying to as I said, when the \u2013 when the containment phase and you know, how fast we can cut costs is not is not something that we have to worry about, we have the luxury of building this position doesn't mean, we're not going to be smart. It doesn't mean, we're not going to have to adjust our cost structure over time, but we're going to do it from a position of much greater clarity business by businesses to how this is likely going to play out. That clarity doesn't exist today. It's very hard to see until we get much further down through Q2 and into Q3. John Inch : Based on the way you're set, yeah, well \u2013 I was going to say Scott based on the way you're standing up for your people, I bet you you're going to get an awful lot of people knocking, very qualified people knocking on your doors wanting to work for ITW is this whole thing progresses. Scott Santi : We\u2019re just trying to be the same. Thank you. John Inch : Well, no but it's other companies are not following this tax. So I think it's worth calling out. My question is, hold on. I don't have COVID, just \u2013 coming out of this, because there's been no broader centralized temporary cost actions, that you have to kind of get layer back because other companies are taught in leading model 2021. Please don't assume very high incremental because we have to layer in all these costs that have to come back that are temporary. Could you possibly infer that, I know you talked about the detrimental is going back to 30%, 35% in the fourth quarter because there's no big centralized temporary actions, could be incremental in 2021 be closer to 40% coming out of this, if not even a little bit higher? Scott Santi : I see no reason why they wouldn't be our normal 35 plus. John Inch : Perfect. That answers it. Thank you. Chris O\u2019Herlihy: Thanks John. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citibank. Your line is open. Andrew Kaplowitz : Good morning guys. Hope you're well. Chris O\u2019Herlihy: Thank you, Andrew. Same to you. Andrew Kaplowitz : As you know, one of the main topics that you're going to talk about at your Investor Day that was canceled by the pandemic was to give us more color on ITWs overall portfolio, in terms of its ability to outgrow in the markets. So when you look at the 30% to 40% drop in Q2, we know a lot of it is auto related, but even excluding auto, it appears you're thinking about 20% and 30% decline for the rest of the businesses. So are any of these businesses still expected to underperform their markets or is it really that ITW has simply levered to some end markets right now such as auto or food equipment when the markets are just challenged by the pandemic? Scott Santi : Well, I, I'd say a couple of things, specifically around Q2. One is, certainly in auto and -- what's going on in restaurants right now, food equipment and the whole sort of CapEx environment, why would most companies are certainly pulling back big time in any sort of CapEx until they have more clarity as to what the future will hold. What I would say also is in Q2 that's certainly a significant multiplier is all the supply chain, the brakes go on, there's a multiplying effect of both. Beyond just the consumption of whatever the products are. It's related to the reduction, radical reduction in inventories to supportive, significant double-digit drop. So I'm not sure there's a lot of comparisons to the market and that valid and Q2 for that reason. Let's get through it. Let the smoke clear a little bit and see how things are starting to normalize in Q3 before we make any assessments in terms of relative growth. Andrew Kaplowitz : And Scott maybe if I can follow up on that, you usually guide to run rates, so is that kind of what\u2019s -- and then maybe\u2026 Scott Santi : We used to give Q2 run rate we don\u2019t quit. Andrew Kaplowitz : So maybe you can talk about sort of what you're seeing in April and then, pecking order, you mentioned, we talked about food equipment, we know auto is going to be the worst, so any sort of more color on which markets may outperform or which markets may be weaker with them -- the understanding that auto and food equipment\u2026 Scott Santi : Yeah. Let me ask Michael address for April and sort of the relative Q2 performance across the segment. Michael Larsen : Yeah I think, Andy, as we pointed out the hardest hit segment as you might expect is the one that we're calling out specifically with automotive down 60% to 70%. And I think as you called out, that is a 10 point drag on our overall enterprise top line. So if you were to say ex-auto, we -- balance of the businesses is down in that 20% to 30% range. Food equipment certainly one of the more challenged businesses here in the short term, particularly in the restaurant side, without going into too much detail, but we're seeing a lot more resilience in food within on the institutional side, whether it'd be health care or education as well as on the retail side, as you might imagine. So, but overall food equipment will certainly be more challenge than the average, probably down in that 35% to 45% range here in the in the near term, and recovery will depend on all the things that you're aware of in terms of when these restaurants are able to open back up again, when we\u2019re able to co service the equipment and so forth. Welding certainly challenged on the CapEx side. We talked a lot about the oil and gas exposure their. Welding would be down probably in line with the average of the company and then from there, there's some pretty good resilience in places like testing measurements, specialties and will probably be down in that 10% to 20% range. So, I think this is as difficult of Q2 as certainly, we've seen and it happened that as you know, very quickly. And I'll just point back to the overall profitability of the company. I mean, even with these numbers I just went through, we are going to be very profitable. We're going to generate more than $0.5 billion of free cash flow. We'll have at the enterprise level, double digit operating margins. There'll be higher than some of our peers going into before this whole, pre COVID situation. So it's a real position of strength, even with this macro shock that we're dealing with, we'll get through the near term and, we'll be much stronger when we come out the other end. So, that's kind of my segment a little bit of detail for you. April is tracking. I think we had a forecast going into -- we developed early. April, we thought we'd be down 30% to 40%. And April is tracking. April will \u2013 April and May, will be difficult months. There are some indications that things are starting to improve. I think Scott mentioned by region, China, for example, we had a bottom probably in the month of February down in the mid 30s. And April was flat so, in the automotive business might be flat in Q2 here in China. So, there's certainly some early signs that things have bottomed here in April and May, like I said difficult and then we'll see June. But obviously, all of this with the usual caveats. This is a highly uncertain situation. But, I'd say, as we sit here today, I'm pretty confident that we're seeing the worst of it right now. And we'll get through this. And we'll see what the second half of the year is going to look like in terms of recovery. Andrew Kaplowitz : Appreciate the color guys. Scott Santi : Sure, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Jamie Cook : Hi, good morning and hope everyone is healthy. Glad everyone is healthy and well. I just want to ask the question on the market share opportunity. I thought that's very interesting, sort of coming out of the down turn here. So, when you think about your markets, your strategy will be more focused on certain businesses that you view is more attractive within your portfolio broad based and then historically, how has -- where you see the biggest opportunities in downturns historically? What was the type of market share that it ITW usually gets in just sort of how sticky is that market share? Thank you. Scott Santi : Well, I think this is certainly -- I'm not sure. Certainly, from my own perspective, how much past history is really relevant and valid. We're a very different company today than we were under -- in any prior contraction. And I would say, the other element is, this is a harder, faster, more challenging decline than any of us -- anybody's ever been through. So from the standpoint of the kinds of potential impacts it may have on a number of companies and what that might do ultimately to -- think about sort of the hard crash in a relatively robust kind of recovery, there's going to be a lot of -- you're going to have to be able to respond quickly all the way through the supply chain, not just your own capacity. So there's going to be a lot of challenges around. All of that, depending on different industries and how they ultimately recover in the pace. So I can't certainly predict or say that we have any view that one part of our company is going to be more ripe for those kinds of opportunities than others at this particular stage. What I am saying is, we're going to be prepared in every one of our businesses to be there, to be able to seize those opportunities if and when they emerge. And I think that's all I can say. We are -- I think we've done a lot of work on the portfolio, to say there's any part of our portfolio that we don't want to grow incrementally at this point, and it is not the way I would characterize it. I would also say that we're not going to -- we're not interested in superficial gains here. We're interested in share gains in areas where we're already focused. That\u2019s it. The way we're trying to serve and grow our positions in these markets for the long haul. So, we're not going to be looking for a quick sale and bailing out a competitor in an area that's not of interest to us long term. And that's a lot of what we're going through in the planning right now, is to not only make sure we have the capacity to support those incremental opportunities, but to make sure that our divisions have real clarity in terms of exactly where they're looking to grab those opportunities and where they're not. Jamie Cook : Okay. Thank you. I appreciate your insights. Operator : Your next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi. Good morning, all and just wanted to echo the earlier comment on kind of that refreshing approach on preserving the employee base and kind of being farsighted on this. It's certainly not very common, as what we've heard so far. Scott Santi : Thank you. Josh Pokrzywinski : I guess, Scott, just to follow up on Jamie's question there, when you think about what that means in terms of being able to attract more market shares as we exit. And it probably varies business by business, but is it competitors who have gutted the Salesforce, is it product development? What exactly does that -- maybe, it's probably not capacity. But what does that mean to you in terms of the means by which to do that? Yes. I like I said, I can imagine that. It's probably not a raw capacity issue. So where do you think ITW have the biggest advantage based on what you're doing today? Scott Santi : Well, yes, I think it's harder to sort of characterize in one description a range of scenarios, but I do think the productive capacity is actually a big part of it, that as these markets turn, to the extent you haven't kept cushion in your supply chain, cushion in your capacity. Again, you can have the machines sitting around, but if you don't have the people there, you don't have the suppliers there ready to go, think about a scenario where we're in the second quarter, businesses in an industry is going to be down 30%. If it's down only 15% in Q3, that's a sequential improvement at a clip like nobody ever attest to manage before. And so I think those are -- I wouldn't discount your ability to deliver and supply as a core part of where these opportunities might emerge. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. And then just specifically on Food Equipment. Obviously, a business that three or six months ago, and people would love to have had a contingency plan the way they are today. What percentage of the weakness would you just attribute to kind of customers being closed, i.e. when the lights come on, maybe there is a new normal, but that's not particularly robust, but kind of a step function improvement. I understand it's a fragmented market, so maybe hard to give visibility, but just any additional color you might be able to provide. Chris O\u2019Herlihy: Yes. So if we think about food equipment and specifically with the restaurant side of the business, 25%, 30% of our business, and the recovery there is going to not just depend on lifting of shelter and place restrictions, but also in terms of core shelter and place, what additional restrictions will be on the business in terms of occupancy and so on. Clearly, a very, very uncertain environment. It's very difficult to predict what that will look like. But for us, we are somewhat comfortable by the fact that the other parts of our business, as Michael mentioned, the institutional piece, particularly health care, higher education is doing quite well. Retail is doing quite well, as you would expect. The typical deli counter business is thriving right now. We are being slightly a little bit in terms of being able to put in installations because they are so busy, but the long-term demand trends there are pretty healthy. Scott Santi : And then service? Chris O\u2019Herlihy: And in service is the other business where we continue to, to Scott's point, keep our service organization fully employed here. I mean we've taken a huge investment over the years in ensuring that we had a highly developed, highly trained service force. And the last thing we want to do is let those folks go, acknowledging that even though capacity is down right now, that will recover in the medium term. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. Thanks Scott. Thanks, Chris. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Scott Santi : Good morning. Jeff Sprague : Good morning. Two from me. First, before we look any further forward, let's -- just looking back one more time on Q1, right? I mean, the margin improvement across the board on down revenues, it actually is pretty impressive. Just wondering how to put some context around this. We see kind of a big slug from the kind of the margin enhancement initiatives across the portfolio. Perhaps it's some of the PLS really shining through. I know every division is different, but perhaps we can focus on polymers or the electronics business where the margin performance was surprisingly strong. Michael Larsen : Yeah. Thanks for the kind words, Jeff. I mean I think this was a good example in Q1 of what Scott was talking about that nobody is sitting around in our divisions that are waiting for somebody to tell them what to do. They react quickly -- the team reacts quickly when they see changes in demand. And so I think with revenues down 9%, the fact that margins were flat up in five or seven segments, the big driver continues to be, for us, after seven-plus years, the enterprise initiatives at 120 basis points. And price cost, no longer an issue for us. And then, of course, the volume leverage, we were able to offset some pretty meaningful headwind there to hold margins flat. So we expect the enterprise initiatives to continue as we go through the year. With lower volume, the overall contribution might be a little less than what you've seen in Q1 and last year in the 100-plus range, but it will still be a meaningful lever within our own control as we go through the worst of it here in Q2 and then head into the recovery in Q3 and Q4. I don't know if you want to talk about anything specifically. But by segment, the biggest driver is -- remains enterprise initiatives in that 70 to 160 basis points range by segment. And like I said, we expect that to continue to be a meaningful contribution as we go forward. Jeff Sprague : Yeah. So maybe just to look at forward then, I mean, fully understand when revenues go down 30% or 40%, it does some pretty disruptive things to the decremental margins, and there's not a corporate-wide initiative. But it looks like you're implying 45% decrementals here in Q2. Wouldn't each one of these organizations, divisions individually, even though they're not cutting heads, right, they may be doing some pretty dramatic things on T&E and other discretionaries levers that they can pull. I know it maybe doesn't roll up cleanly to the parent that you can view with real clarity. But maybe just frame that, just kind of\u2026 Scott Santi : I can frame it. The big difference between Q1 and Q2 is the magnitude of the revenue decline, right? So we handled 9% decline in Q1, 7% organic. And certainly, those business level tactical adjustments, as Michael said, showed up very strong. The difference in Q2 is the magnitude of revenue decline is significantly greater. Those tactical adjustments are still there and ongoing. That's what when we talk about managing the business prudently, all of that is still in place. But we're also saying to our businesses, let's not react to this Q2 -- unprecedented Q2 that's not going to be reality beyond Q2. And we've -- as we've talked about a number of different levels here, we're going to preserve our ability to structure ourselves appropriately going forward and not react or overreact to the short-term conditions in Q2. Could the decrementals be better in Q2 if we wanted to drive something at that? Sure. But do we think that's the right thing to do for our company? Absolutely not. Jeff Sprague : So the corporate role here in Q2 is actually to give the divisions license not to do anything damaging to their business? Scott Santi : 100%? 100%. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Andy Casey from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Andy Casey : Hi, good morning, and nice to hear all your voices. Scott Santi : Good morning, Andy. Andy Casey : Question on the supply chain. Are you hearing about any suppliers that may run into liquidity issues? Chris O\u2019Herlihy: Yeah. So Andy, so with respect to the supply chain, no major issues to date for us with suppliers or some of the -- obviously, an issue we're managing very closely. We would feel certainly that our produce where we sell approach has served us pretty well here. We would also say that the fact that already centralized helps us to provide -- helps us as it provides 80 different kind of touch points, which enables us to kind of stay well informed and react quickly. So something we're rigorously managing, as we talked about in the presentation and not seeing any issues right now, but something we're very attuned to. Scott Santi : And I think that, we've always been a source-local company. So from the standpoint of the diversity of our supply base that we are not dependent on one source relationships of finance globally, that we've got some level of risk mitigation and ability to shift and or go down. Michael Larsen : Right. Andy Casey : And then you made mention of, Scott, I think, it was your rapid inventory reduction. I'm presuming that's broadly speaking in the distribution channel. If we look outside of auto, how deep a reduction in inventory are you actually seeing in the channel? And does that suggest -- who knows, when it happens, but does that suggest you may see a fairly big restock if end market volume starts to sequentially improve? Scott Santi : I would say that, we have almost no visibility in near-term, in terms of how inventories have been adjusted. I think it's a safe assumption to say that, anybody in the distribution business is certainly managing that aspect of their business very carefully. And ultimately, again, there are -- there's a sort of magnitude of decline and potentially magnitude of correction the other way that there are going to be factors here in terms of how companies are positioned to ultimately handle it. But I don't think we have any ability to say whether inventories are too high or too low still in the channel across most of our businesses at this point. Andy Casey : Okay. And then, if I could squeeze one more in. You kind of touched on it earlier. But, end-markets, specifically in Europe and North America, some other companies have talked about stabilization. I know it's granular, but in the last two weeks of April, outside of auto and food equipment, have you seen anything similar to that? Or is it just kind of still really, really weak? Scott Santi : It's still challenged. And I mean, I think the closest you can get to talking about something stabilized are the data points that we provided on China were like I said, you know, in February, our sales were down I think 36% was the number and in April were flat. So that's probably the best I can give you. I think as we look at the regional numbers here, for Q2, total company is down 30 to 40, North America will probably be at the lower end of that in terms of down in that 25% to 35% range. And Europe will be higher than that and then China, like we said, flat for the quarter, maybe a little bit better, but, not to get into a sort of pick and choose situation. But, I would say, often things are not as bad in some cases, as any of us expected. It's not terrible. It's a unique situation. But we've got parts of our portfolio that are certainly stabilizing. And I'm thinking of some elements of business that are certainly there. They're all under some challenge, but if I want to -- I don't know to look at that we're still serving customers. And yeah, we're still in business. So we'll get through it. Andy Casey : Okay, thank you very much. And good luck. Scott Santi : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Joel Tiss from BMO. Your line is open. Joel Tiss : Hey, how's it going, guys? Scott Santi : Good morning. Joel Tiss : I just wanted to, you know, most of them -- most of my questions have been answered, but I wonder if you're seeing any, sort of, pressure points or, you know, give us a little more granularity on some of the opportunities that for new rounds of enterprise initiatives or, you know, to further automate your factories and you know, that sort of thing like how does -- how do you evolve from what you're seeing and -- execute turning some of this pandemic into strength? Scott Santi : I don't know if that changes a whole lot. We are highly automated in certain parts of the company because that's the right thing for the business in terms of not just the cost productivity, but also the level of quality that we need to build in the product. We have, -- as we've talked about forever, we have never been constrained from the standpoint of capital investments. So I don't know that I have any view that says because of the pandemic, we're going to have a shift in strategy under -- within the framework of 80/20, front to back in our business model. I think certainly, that business model helps us a great deal as we work our way through. A lot of the issues and challenges that will come about, but it doesn't \u2013 I\u2019m trying to think about your question, I can't think of anything fine. Joel Tiss : I understand. As there were changes, I mean, those will be conceived at the divisional level, depending on local circumstances that that made sense for them given the operating environment that they're in. Scott Santi : Yeah. And I was going to say the -- all the projects and activities that add up to the enterprise initiative savings, those projects are still there. So, you know, nothing's really changed from that standpoint. Joel Tiss : And there's nothing like product line level that that you see some stresses that maybe you didn't see before that maybe there are businesses that don't fit anymore or need a little more restructuring than what we thought before? Or everything its kind of just unusual times and it's not a good -- not a good reason to make a different decision. Scott Santi : I think we're got to let the smoke clear a little bit here to answer your question. I don't know, I certainly -- will there be some businesses that there's some fundamental change in the overall demand profile based on the impact of the pandemic. I'm sure across 85 divisions; we\u2019ll have some of that. We\u2019ll have some others that will have -- as we've talked about a lot, some incremental growth opportunities that will have to support with some investments. So we'll get to all that stuff. It's really hard sitting here in \u2013 Michael Larsen : Historically. Scott Santi : \u2026in the early May, given all this going on there. We need to have any clarity view or that. Joel Tiss : Okay, well, thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from David Raso from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. David Raso : Hi. Good morning. Scott Santi : Good morning. David Raso : I\u2019m trying to think through the margin recovery potential for 2021. I'm trying to understand the 2020 cadence a little bit better. It sounds that you feel the second quarter will be the worst of it. And the decremental margins implied are 45. But if I look at your scenarios for the year, if I use the middle scenario, it implies the decrementals get worse in the second half. They're actually 49. And if you're saying the fourth quarter, we'll be back to 35, it's really implying a well over 50% decremental on the third. So I guess the question is why would it get worse on the decrementals because the comp isn't that different? And maybe the answer is, and Michael, you alluded to it, what's the placeholder for the restructuring? And is that mostly in 3Q? Thank you. Michael Larsen : You just answered your own question. So that's exactly right. David Raso : I was trying to have it quantified. Michael Larsen : I know it's a nice try. David Raso : So is the third quarter restructure, I mean, it's... Michael Larsen : It\u2019s a nice try. I mean, like I said earlier, we just don't know yet. I mean -- and this is not -- with this company is a bottoms-up company and the restructuring will be what our VP, GMs and division leadership teams decide that they need to do once they have a clearer view of what the demand picture is. At that point, we have plenty of capacity and funding for all the investments we want to make, and -- including some of the restructuring that maybe required as we go forward. So, -- but that's really the best I can give you right now. David Raso : All right, so no quantification, but it feels more 3Q heavy based by that math on the cadence of the decremental. Is that at least fair? Michael Larsen : That\u2019s fair. I think the math\u2026 David Raso : Thank you so much. Scott Santi : Yeah, thank you. David Raso : I appreciate the time. Thanks. Michael Larsen : Bye David. Operator : Your next question comes from Ross Gilardi from Bank of America. Your line is open. Ross Gilardi : Thanks for squeezing me in. I\u2019m glad to hear from you guys as well. Hope everybody is well. I would just love to hear ITWs view on onshoring more of your production to the U.S., more of your supply chain. What are your -- your western customers are doing a lot of international business, saying on that, particularly in China? And just your overall perspective, is there enough onshoring that could happen in the overall industrial economy in the next year or two that could make a difference in the actual pace of economic recovery in the States as you see it? Just any views on that would be really interesting. Scott Santi : Yeah, I can only speak for ITW in that regard, largely, which is that we have always been a produce where we sell company and we've talked about that often. And so from the standpoint of how any of this impacts our footprint from the standpoint of where we produce and where we source none of this changes any of that. I certainly think that there is likely to be, directionally, more movement for all the reasons you talked about amongst global manufacturers around localizing their production. I think there's certainly are going to be some lessons learned from the standpoint of the need to balance both lowest cost, the low-cost, lowest cost country sourcing, lowest cost with resilience, and redundancy. And so I absolutely think that will play itself out. From our standpoint, I don't know that, that presents any more or less opportunities. We're serving our customers globally. We'll certainly, perhaps, affect some of our supply points into those customers from a geography standpoint, but none of it that's going to have -- that I would say would result in any significant shift for us one way or the other. Ross Gilardi : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Unfortunately, we are out of time for questions today. I'd like to turn the call back over to Karen Fletcher for closing remarks. Karen Fletcher : Okay.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] For those participating in the Q&A, you'll have an opportunity to ask one question and if needed one follow-up question. Thank you. Karen Fletcher, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Karen Fletcher : Okay. Thank you, Julianne. Good morning, and welcome to ITW\u2019s Second Quarter 2020 Conference Call. I'm joined by our; Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi; and Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen. During today's call, we will discuss ITW\u2019s second quarter 2020 financial results and provide an update on our strategy for managing through the global pandemic. Slide 2 is a reminder that this presentation contains forward-looking statements. We refer you to the Company's 2019 Form 10-K, and subsequent reports filed with the SEC for more detail about important risk that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, including the potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. This presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures and a reconciliation of those measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release. Please turn to Slide 3. And it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi. Scott Santi : Thank you, Karen and good morning, everyone. Well, things are far from normal for any of us or our businesses at present. I\u2019m extremely proud of how the ITW team is managing through the unprecedented and challenging circumstances brought about by the pandemic. I want to begin by sincerely thanking my ITW colleagues around the world for the effort, dedication and selflessness that they continue to demonstrate daily and protecting the health and safety of their colleagues while continuing to serve our customers with excellence. As I have said many times, the power of the ITW business model and our decentralized entrepreneurial culture are never more valuable than during times of significant and rapid change. And we are leveraging both to position the company to participate across a wide range of recovery scenarios while continuing to execute our long-term strategy to achieve and sustain ITw\u2019s full potential performance. Over the last seven years, we have made significant progress and executing our strategy to take full advantage of our unique strengths to clearly established ITW as one of the world's best performing, highest quality and most respected industrial companies. And in doing so building a company that has both the enduring competitive advantages and the resiliency necessary to deliver consistent upper tier performance in any economic environment. Well, needless to say the resilience component of that equation is now being tested in ways that were hard for many of us to even imagine six to seven months ago. And as evidenced by our second quarter results, this company in our team of over 45,000 dedicated professionals are rising to the challenge. In the second quarter, in the face of an unprecedented 29% decline in revenues, ITW delivered $449 million in operating income, $681 million in free cash flow, and operating margins of 17.5%. We leveraged our flexible cost structure to reduce operating expenses by more than $140 million without any centralized cause takeout mandate from corporate, while providing full compensation and benefit support to every ITW team member, sustaining investments and key long-term growth strategies, and positioning for full participation in the recovery. As we outlined during our first quarter earnings call, we have an integrated four prong strategy for managing the company through the pandemic. Protect and support our people continue to serve our customers with excellence, maintain our financial strength and strategic optionality and win the recovery. These four priorities comprised the central near-term planning and execution focus for the whole of ITW, and for every one of our operating divisions. We'll come back to them at the end of our presentation. But first let me turn the call over to Michael who will provide you with additional detail on our Q2 performance. Michael over to you. Michael Larsen : Okay. Thank you, Scott, and good morning everyone. Let\u2019s turned to Slide 5. As Scott mentioned, priority number 3 for managing through the pandemic is to maintain ITW\u2019s considerable financial strength, liquidity and strategic optionality. In the second quarter we did just that. And going forward, we will continue to live on that priority. As we leverage our strong financial foundation and resilient profitability profile to position ITW for maximum participation in the recovery. On our last earnings call, we shared our expectation for an unprecedented level of demand contraction to the complete shutdown of wide swaths of the global economy. And indeed, organic revenues declined an unprecedented 27%. As expected, automotive OEM and food equipment were the hardest hit segments. Other segments fared much better, providing another proof point for the benefit of ITW\u2019s diversified high quality business portfolio. At the enterprise level, total revenues declined 29% as organic revenues declined 27% in foreign currency, and last year's divestitures further reduced revenues by about a point each. Nevertheless, our businesses still generated $449 million of operating income and delivered resilient operating margin performance of 17.5% with operating expenses down more than $140 million and enterprise initiatives contributing 100 basis point. As expected, free cash flow was strong at $681 million, an increase of 12% year-over-year and 213% of net income. Q2 cash flow performance did benefit from the delayed timing of U.S. income tax payments of $158 million, which were paid in the third quarter. Our divisions stepped up to their credit monitoring and collection efforts early in the quarter. And as a result, our receivable performance has continued to remain in line with historical norms. The balance sheet, and our liquidity remained strong throughout the containment phase as we ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of cash on hand, essentially no short-term debt, no commercial paper, a $2.5 billion undrawn revolving credit facility, Tier 1 credit ratings and total liquidity of more than $4.3 billion. As expected, ITW had more than enough financial strength and resilience to withstand the shock to the system that the global economy experienced in Q2. We were prepared for it, we managed our way through it effectively. And today we're strongly positioned for the recovery. With that, please turn to Slide 6, for a retrospective look at second quarter revenue, starting with organic revenue by geography. As you can see, the demand contraction with global as North America declined 26%, Europe was down 37%, and Asia Pacific was down 7%. On a positive note, China was up 1% after being down 24% in Q1, as the early phase of their recovery began to take hold. On the right side of the slide, we're sharing average revenue per working day by month. As we move through the quarter, and we compared it to last year, you can see that April was the bottom and then we experienced a sequential acceleration in May. And in June, as the global economy began to reopen. This trend has continued in July. Now, let's go to Slide 7 for segment performance. And on the left side, you can see the most and least affected segments in terms of organic revenue and operating margin. For comparative purposes, I should point out that these margin numbers are fully-loaded on operating margins, not segment margins. It is also notable that five of seven segments delivered operating margins above 20%, despite organic revenue declines ranging from 9% to 25%, and the two segments overcame the significant negative volume leverage to actually expand operating margin year\u2013over-year. Turning to the right side of Slide 7. As expected, given that most of our automotive OEM customers in North America and Western Europe essentially shutdown in mid-March and only began to restart production in May, June. Our automotive OEM business was the hardest hit. Overall organic revenues were down 53% year-over-year, although we did see a significant uptick in June that is continuing in July. North America was down 62%, Europe down 59% and China was the bright spot with organic revenue up 6%. Importantly, as order production continues to ramp up in Q3, our local close to the customer manufacturing positions remain fully resourced and in position to continue to serve our customers every step of the way, and with the same world class quality and delivery that they have come to expect from us. Turning to Slide 8, also as expected the second hardest segment was food equipment, as organic revenue declined 38%. North America organic revenue was down 33% and international declined 44%. Equipment sales were down 38% and service was down 37%. Institutional sales including healthcare facilities and hospitals were slightly more resilient down about 30%. And not surprisingly, restaurants QSR were down about 45%. Relatively speaking, sales to grocery retail customers held up better, down only 14% with some equipment orders being pushed out due to COVID concerns and retail service sales were flat with prior year. Test & Measurement and Electronics, Organic revenue declined 11% with Test & Measurement down 12% and Electronics down 9%. While demand for CapEx Equipment dropped sales were up double-digits in end markets tied to semiconductor healthcare and clean room technology. And despite negative volume leverage, operating margin improved 120 basis points to 25.7% with excellent cost management and enterprise initiatives as the main contributors. Turning to Slide 9. In Welding demand slowed significantly, as organic revenue declined by 25% with Equipment sales down 28% and Consumables down 21%. Industrial end markets declined 40% while commercial end markets were fairly resilient, down only 11%. That said despite a 29% of [higher] Revenues Q2 operating margin was 21.6%. Polymers & Fluids, organic revenue was down 14%. Polymers was down 20% in line with industrial and MRO trends. Auto aftermarket was down 14% with retail sales improving in a meaningful way as stores open back up as the quarter progressed. Fluids had the best performance with organic revenue down only 5% held by product sales into health and hygiene end markets. Operating margin was up 30 basis points to 23.1% driven by enterprise initiatives and strong tactical cost management. Moving to Slide 10, Construction, organic revenue was down 9% with North America which is almost half of the segment, up 1% with double-digit growth in the residential renovation market served through the home center channel. This strength was partially offset by a 21% decline in the North America commercial business and internationally as Europe was down 28%, reflecting a more restrictive quarantine protocol. Australia and New Zealand sales were down only 3%. Specialty organic revenue was down 16% with North America down 15% and the international side down 19%. Demand for consumables in our consumer packaging businesses such as Zip-Pak were up double-digits offset by orders for packaging equipment being pushed out and some lower sales into the appliance and aviation industry. So let's move to Slide 11 for an update on some full year 2020 performance scenarios. On our last call, we provided three financial scenarios to illustrate the fact that we have the financial strength and margin profile to withstand whatever comes our way over the near-term and therefore, our number 1 priority is positioning to play offense in the recovery. With Q2 in the books, we're updating these scenarios for a key operating metrics, organic revenue, operating margin and operating income. The caveats that will be discussed during our Q1 cost to apply i.e. this is the time of extraordinary and unprecedented uncertainty, and accepting any significant recurrence of major economic shutdowns. As you can see, we are narrowing the range of likely four year outcomes based on our second quarter performance and current demand trends across the company. And what stands out is that in all three scenarios, ITW\u2019s operating performance is strong in terms of operating income and operating margin. And while we're not providing formal guidance as we sit here today, we are tracking closest to the mid scenario. The second half organic revenue is down about 12%, which would translate into a full year organic decline of approximately 14.5% and operating margins of 20% to 22%. And in an unprecedented year like this, should this scenario hold, we would still make somewhere in the neighborhood of $2.5 billion of operating income and generate more than $1.8 billion in free cash flow. As demand recovers, we want to be in a strong position to fully support our customers as their businesses begin to re-accelerate. As a result, we expect an increase in working capital and therefore lower free cash flow of about $600 million in the second half of the year. Importantly, though, we're going to make sure that we're in a strong position to both respond to our customers needs, and take share from competitors who can throughout the recovery. As we discussed on the last call, we're going to make some fairly modest capacity and cost structure adjustments based on projects submitted by our division leaders who have now had a chance to better assess the pace and slope of recovery in each of their respective businesses. We currently projected that we will spend about $60 million in restructuring projects in the second half of the year, including $45 billion [indiscernible] to back projects that were already planned for 2020 that we placed on a temporary hold as the early stages of the pandemic unfolded. As a reference, we spent about $80 million on restructuring in 2019. And about $30 million of that was in the second half of the year. It is worth noting that the average payback for these projects is projected to be less than 12 months. Finally, just some a brief comments on capital allocation to let you know that our position has not changed from our last call. First with regard to the dividend we\u2019ve recognize the importance of our dividend to our long-term shareholders. We continue to view it as a critical component of ITW\u2019s total shareholder return model, and we remain strongly committed to the dividend. In terms of strategic optionality we are clearly in a position of strength with ample liquidity and balance sheet capacity and strong credit ratings. We remain open to the possibility that opportunities might emerge as a result of a pandemic and we're in a strong position to react to high quality strategic opportunities that are aligned with our enterprise strategy. Lastly, we suspended share repurchases until end market stabilized, and the recovery path becomes clearer. So let's move on to Slide 12. And I'll turn it back over to Scott to share some more thoughts on our recovery phase strategy. Scott, back to you. Scott Santi : All right. Thank you, Michael. So moving forward, while significant end market disruption and uncertainties remain, we will continue to leverage our financial strength and the performance power of our business model to prioritize playing offense in the recovery over playing defense in the contraction, and to ensure that every one of our businesses is strongly positioned to fully participate in the recovery. Job one is to protect our people while continuing to serve our customers with the world class quality and delivery performance that they expect from us. Thus far, our people have done a superb job on both fronts and across the company. We will remain intensely focused on these two mission critical imperatives. Second, we're going to lean in hard to the upside by remaining invested in staff to support anticipated demand two to three quarters out, so that we have ample cushion to both fully support our customers as their businesses re-accelerate and to capture incremental share gain opportunities that we expect might emerge along the way. In that regard core to the recovery planning process in every one of our 84 divisions is the identification and actioning of specific pandemic related share game programs and opportunities that are aligned with our long-term enterprise strategy. Finally, we will leverage our advantaged financial position to sustain the investments we've made to support the execution of our enterprise strategy. We are taking the long view and from that perspective when the recovery is an execution component of our long-term enterprise strategy. It is not a separate strategy. It is about every one of our divisions identifying specific opportunities to aggressively accelerate progress in executing key aspects of their enterprise strategy agenda, due to the effects of the pandemic. Things such as newer changing customer needs, competitors, distress, ability to stay invested, et cetera. In fact, we're already seeing areas of opportunity emerging in our businesses. And these are some of the early themes. First, ITW\u2019s undisrupted ability to supply and deliver during these times of tremendous volatility and disruption is a significant asset. In the last quarter, we landed new programs worth a combined $105 million annually with a handful of key customers based largely on our ability to provide immediate supply. Second, many companies including many of our existing customers are moving away from low cost country sourcing strategies and looking to localize their supply chains in response to risk and challenges exposed first by trade and tariff related disruptions, and now by the effects of the pandemic. Our long standing commitment to local produce where we sell manufacturing has uniquely positioned ITW to support existing and new customers in making this transition. Just recently, one of our businesses was awarded nearly $10 million in new business a result of one of their key customers moving to build more local supply capability. In addition, a number of our automotive OEM customers are implementing strategies to localize their supply chains and we are in a very strong position to support them in this regard. And third, we are already benefiting from remaining committed to our strategic sales excellence and customer back innovation investments. Our ability to stay the course means that the people that we have invested in, in these critical areas remain in place and that they are not distracted by downsizings, reorganizations, top down mandates or shifting priorities. They remain focused on serving customers, seizing new opportunities, and continuing to innovate. It's just one illustration, in the second quarter our new patent filings were up 24% over the last year. So in closing, on behalf of Michael and our entire executive leadership team, we offer our deepest thanks to our ITW colleagues around the world for their exceptional efforts and dedication always, but especially during this period of unprecedented circumstances and challenges. Well, there is obviously a lot that we will have to work our way through in the months ahead. I have no doubt that the strength and resilience of ITW\u2019s business model, our diversified high quality business portfolio and our people position us extremely well to seize the opportunities and respond to the challenge that lie ahead. With that, I'll turn it back to you Karen. Karen Fletcher : Okay, thank you, Scott. Julianne, let's open up the lines for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Well, our first question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citi. Your line is open. Andrew Kaplowitz : Good morning, everyone. Hope everyone is well. Scott Santi : Good morning. Michael Larsen : Same to you Andy. Thanks, Andrew Kaplowitz : Scott and Mike, maybe you can help us color on business conditions by region a little more. And China turning positive is encouraging, as you said. But for many companies in Q2, we saw some improvement maybe a little faster in Europe, in the U.S., you guys were down a little bit more in Europe. So maybe you can talk about what held you down in Europe. And then you mentioned you were down about 20% in terms of average daily sales in June, and then you continue to see improvement in July. In terms of the reason to decline did you continue at the same rate of recovery as you saw by month, in Q2 in July? Scott Santi : Hi, so let\u2019s start with your question on Europe, specifically, which represented 25% of our sales in the quarter and saw as you pointed out there most significant decline year-over-year at 37%. By far, the most significant decline was in the automotive business as you might expect down 59% followed by food equipment down 48% and then construction down 28%. In terms of the kind of the framework that we're providing for the second half year and your question around how the dynamics might play out by region, we're anticipating, again, in a very dynamic environment here, North America and Europe down both in that 10% to 15% range, year-over-year and then Asia Pacific and China as you pointed out better than that flat maybe slightly positive as we look at the second half year. A lot of \u2013 probably the thinking on how the second half plays out ties back to your first, the second question, which was around July and the trends, so. The trends that we saw, sequentially in the second quarter were certainly encouraging April, the bottom acceleration in May, June. And those trends have continued into July. I wouldn't read too much into one month year. I think this remains a really like I said, uncertain environment. And the best way to think about this is really this second half framework that we've provided as you look at how this might play out, but certainly encouraging kind of near-term demand trends that continued into Q2. Andrew Kaplowitz : Michae, just one follow up on how you thinking about forecasting auto OEM, obviously one of your tougher businesses but, relatively quicker recovery that we're seeing there. You mentioned the shutdowns impacting your business. But is it harder to adjust ITW\u2019s cost base in that business. And in the past, it's been hard to change move pricing around. So that what hurt you in the quarter? And do you expect that business would turn profitable again in Q3? Michael Larsen : Well, I think the short answer is no. I mean, I think, as you know, we're not an auto company, we're really benefiting in Q2 in the second half from this high quality, highly diversified portfolio. So we don't have to get the forecast 100% right in automotive, because we know we're going to have offsets, one positive or negative and other parts of the company where as you know, we're very much a read and react company. We don't have a lot of backlog. We don't have great visibility. Beyond, two to three weeks in auto for example, but we do have the ability to respond very quickly to changes in demand. We, expect a challenging second half in automotive certainly better than Q3. And then just did we transparent with -- what auto might look like in the second quarter based -- in the second half based on feedback from customers current demand trends, we're looking at being down about 15% in the second half of the year for automotive. Of course, a lot of that depends on how quickly production ramps up what auto sales do in the second half of the year, but maybe that gives you a sense for how that might play out. Scott Santi : Due to [indiscernible] I would add on the cost side as we were very intentional and that decimating the business and this was the hardest shutdown across our portfolio. And we clearly knew that was going to take place production stops from mid-March through mid-May. And ultimately we made a choice not to do anything that would impair that we also expected that once that those hard shutdowns were over that things would recover. Maybe not certainly not back to their prior demand levels but a long way from zero, which is where they were for those 60 days or so. So I think there was a lot of intention in -- if your reference point is to the fact we lost money in that business that was, we certainly could have mitigated some of that if we wanted to worry about that. But ultimately, our decision and our biggest concern was making sure that we were there to support our customers on the other side of that. Michael Larsen : And maybe just to -- you asked around what the second half might look like profitability we fully expect based on what we're seeing now that the business will be profitable in the second half and we will be returning to double-digit margins as we go through the year. This beginning recovery here in automotive. Andrew Kaplowitz : Thanks, guys. Stay well. Scott Santi : You too. Operator : Your next question comes from Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Jamie Cook : Hi. Can you hear me? Okay? Scott Santi : Yes. Good morning, Jamie. Jamie Cook : Okay, I guess just my first question. Can you just talk about any of the question on auto food was also the business that was hit harder. So can you just talk about the margin trajectories as we think about the second half of the year in that business. And then I guess my follow up question just is sort of on the market share opportunity. Can you talk about sort of early conversations with customers, if you think you'll be able to gain market share? And is that embedded, as you think about sort of the sales outlook for the back half of the year? Thanks. Scott Santi : Yes, so specific on food, we\u2019ll probably be the hardest hit segment here in the second half of the year. We're looking at potentially being down somewhere around 25%. But even with that sort of kind of unprecedented decline, we expect that business to continue to be profitable. And we expect margins to continue to improve from where they were in Q2 and being back into double-digit territory here in Q3 and Q4. Michael Larsen : I think in terms of market share rather than talking about specific customers, I think I'd go back to the themes that Scott talked about the fact that we have a high degree of confidence that they are real market share opportunities and their discussions with customers that are taking place every day and every single one of our divisions and we pointed to over $100 million of new business generated here in the second quarter just as a result of that the first element, which is our ability to continue to supply and deliver for existing and for new customers. So I think we -- that's, that's maybe how we think about the market share opportunities. Scott Santi : Yes. I think and I think the only thing I would add, Jamie, is it just in terms of impact on the balance of the year? We're not really that -- focused on that. We're looking for long-term opportunities that are sustainable ultimately the programs that I referenced will that have some incremental benefit in the back half, sure. But ultimately, we're not looking so I guess the point I'm trying to make is we're not looking for quick hits that are opportunistic. We're looking for opportunities to move faster on opportunities that we would want even in normal times, and expected certainly based on the second quarter, but certainly optimistic that those will continue to pop up as we move forward. Jamie Cook : Thank you. I appreciate the color. Operator : Your next question comes from Scott Davis from Melius Research. Your line is open. Scott Davis : Hi, good morning, guys. Scott Santi : Good morning. Michael Larsen : Good morning. Scott Davis : Couple of questions here, but Tests & Measurement margins were strong whether they're mix any support on mix there? Was it restructuring that the guys are doing on a localized basis so it\u2019s really quite remarkable to have mid 20s margins in a revenue environment like this? Scott Santi : Yes, I think it's -- I think I may have mentioned this, it's the continued execution on the enterprise initiatives contributing in a meaningful way to the all front-to-back projects really it carryover from last year since we put a halt on restructuring especially in the first half of the year. And then just really good, tactical, management of our operating expenses $140 million at the total company level and every -- in every segment, including in Test & Measurements, so. And then I think the other thing -- I wanted their top line was maybe a little more resilient than some of the other segments. We talked about the strength in semi healthcare clean room technology, and they certainly benefited in Test & Measurement. Scott Davis : Okay, that's helpful. And then, just a follow up, I mean in such a big demand hit in a couple of your businesses, obviously, but how many of your own facilities remain idle there? They are most -- I mean, I'd say they all back up and running in some level of capacity or do you still have a number of facilities that are 100% shut down? Scott Santi : We are essentially 100% open and all of our divisions are serving customer needs at this point, so. Scott Davis : Around the world. Scott Santi : Around the world, yes. Scott Davis : Okay. Super. Thank you guys. Scott Santi : All right, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from John Inch from Gordon Haskett. Your line is open. John Inch : Thanks. Good morning everyone. Hey, Michael did July I know it's not going to be definitive, but it is still exhibiting uptrend in terms of average daily sales? And are we both thinking about sort of the potential for channel restocking, kind of given the way markets have transcended and your own commentary for expectations around the back half? Michael Larsen : So, the first part, July is up sequentially from June to answer your question. I think in terms of the channel, we've talked about this before, John. We really given how short cycle we are and how our businesses are set up, really we're talking about very little backlog, we get the order today, we ship tomorrow we replenish the inventory the day after, we don't have great visibility to what the channel has in terms of inventory. They don't need to carry it out of inventory, because they know that if they place the order with us, we're shipping it tomorrow. So, it's not really a big driver in terms of how our sales might be reacting here. John Inch : Even in say construction products, I'm just -- I agree with you, obviously, but I was just curious if there might have been a little bit of pre-emptive build or anticipated build in the back half or something like that. Michael Larsen : No, we really don't need to and that's construction, every segment every division is run the same way here so, so the answer is no. John Inch : Okay, and then how are you guys thinking about the $140 million of cost saves, which is actually pretty impressive considering that we didn't touch employee comp. How are you thinking about that? Michael and Scott, maybe bleeding back into the organization this will be matched against kind of revenues. So you kind of keep the costs in check or how are you thinking about sort of the cadence of those jobs coming back over the course of the second half of next year? Scott Santi : Yes, John, everything other than the structural costs that we have already planned to take out this year, which are the kind of the front-to-back savings, those are structural savings, but everything else is essentially temporary. And so this was our response to current levels of demand as the recovery continues to take hold you in the second half of the year, the majority of these costs will come back in again. Certainly, we'll continue to remain our divisions, disciplined and focused in terms of cost management, but these are essentially temporary costs that with the exception of 80/20 projects will come back in as demand recovers. John Inch : That makes sense. I mean, we do see the 140 in terms of sales that\u2019s kind of a high watermark, and then maybe next quarter it's a little bit lower. I mean -- I'm not trying to be that precise. I'm just trying to understand that -- hey, we're going to keep these costs in for the rest of the year. And as you have said now, they might start coming back sooner. So just wondering, where do you guys fall out? Scott Santi : Well, I think given our margin profile, they're going to go -- they'll start to -- let's call it sort of sprinkle back in based on how the revenue recovers. So, I think as we've said throughout we are leaning into the investment side of the opportunity profile in the recovery, doesn't mean that we're going crazy, but ultimately, as Michael said the tactical cost savings in Q2 was in response to revenue levels that were down 29%. They will come all the way back in the third quarter, but they'll -- I think it -- I would assume a fairly linear sort of redeployment of some of those resources as things go forward based on in linear in line with revenue. John Inch : It makes sense. Thanks both very much. Scott Santi : Thank you. Michael Larsen : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Andy Casey from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Andy Casey : Thanks a lot. Good morning, everybody. Scott Santi : Good morning. Andy Casey : Within construction, you talked about U.S. non-residential down in Q2; I would assume that probably impacted some other segments like Welding as well. What are you hearing from your customers about the second half? Is it is it getting worse or is there really no change visible? Michael Larsen : Are you talking specifically on the commercial construction side, which is a fairly small portion of our business in North America or construction overall? Andy Casey : Construction over all ex-resi [ph] Michael Larsen : Yes, I mean I think we don't expect a significant level of improvement on the commercial construction side here in the second half based on what we're seeing so far the strong demand is really like we said on the residential side through the home center channel, that's where we saw significant growth in Q2 and we do expect that seems to be holding up fairly well here in the near-term, but not on the commercial side. Andy Casey : Okay, thank you, Michael. And then on business wins from your ability to deliver the $100 million is pretty impressive. Did that come from things like auto or was it more prevalent in -- what might be shorter cycle business wins? Michael Larsen : Sum of each, but I'm trying to -- auto was maybe a 20% of it. Andy Casey : Well, that's pretty good. Okay, thanks very much. Scott Santi : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Ann Duignan from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Ann Duignan : Hi, good morning, everyone. I appreciate the color on the half two outlook for automotive and food service so please directionally, could you give us some color on the other segments that you're contemplating in the backup for those businesses? Scott Santi : Yes, so and these are with all the caveats, again, in terms of being bottom up projections and back to -- we don't have a lot of backlog these are -- our business model is much more kind of a read and react. But, with all that said, I think on the Welding side, we still expect a fairly challenging second half particularly on the industrial side and probably down in the second half somewhere around 15% year-over-year. The Test & Measurement, Specialty businesses should perform a little bit better than that based on kind of current demand trends with some strength in consumer packaging. We talked about semi healthcare clean room those two segments could be down somewhere in the neighborhood of about 10%. And then construction as well as was Polymers & Fluids, maybe down in the mid single-digits, somewhere around that. But, I just want to make the point again around the real advantage that ITW have in terms of this highly diversified high quality set of businesses and the fact that there's room in these numbers because we know that some will perform -- have worse revenues that what I just told you and some will have better and if you put all that together that's what gives us the confidence in the second half scenarios that we laid-out in the in the presentation. But hopefully this is helpful in terms of additional transparency. Ann Duignan : Absolutely, and I appreciate everything you said. That we're not locking down two decimal points here just directionally, it's helpful to understand what you're thinking or seeing. And then just a quick follow up, you mentioned that automotive OEMs are pursuing more strategies of supply within country of demand, but I thought automotive OEMs had already gone that route. And so maybe you could give us some examples of where -- are there opportunities for OEMs to source locally again that are not already doing. I think last quarter you might have mentioned OEMs considering moving back from Mexico potentially is that an opportunity or I'm just curious as to\u2026\u2026 Scott Santi : I think -- without trying to think about how much I want to offer here out of -- from the standpoint of our need to obviously keep things our interactions with our customers confidential. But let me say that Europe represents probably an area from the standpoint of localization of some significant potential shift. Ann Duignan : Okay. I\u2019ll leave it there. Scott Santi : Not just U.S. Michael Larsen : Yes. Ann Duignan : Just U.S. And have you heard any comments from OEMs about relocating from Mexico to U.S. or is that just chapter in the supply chain? Scott Santi : I have not personally. No. Ann Duignan : Okay, we get that question quite frequently. So I appreciate your color. Thank you. I\u2019ll leave it there. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Good morning. Thank you, everyone. Scott Santi : Hey, Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Hey, two for me. First on the restructuring side. Certainly interesting, right $50 million, $45 million of it, you probably would have just eating on a pay-as-you go basis without even kind of pointing it out if we were in normal times. For the businesses given kind of hopefully or like a once in a lifetime pandemic shot on goal for restructuring came up with $50 million bucks. Scott Santi : I -- that's a shockingly low number. But I guess it's kind of a testament what you've told us before about how these businesses are operating. There's just not a lot of stuff laying around to do. Jeff Sprague : And any other perspective on that and, and how quickly these actions might pay back. Scott Santi : Well I think -- I think the perspective on your comments is just that, A, we've been working on sort of margin and operating efficiency for seven years. So there's -- and we can always get better. That's the $45 million, right. We're -- every year we're trying to be a little bit better. The other half of it, though, in terms of the $50 million -- the limited amount of incremental, that's pandemic related is goes back to what we said in the commentary, which is we're staying structured to support demand two to three quarters out. And we don't have any -- that's an advantage that we have given the margin cushion, given the cash flow profile. We expect the economy to revert to growth at some point, I can't tell you exactly when, but I think nobody's betting against the global economy long-term and we're going to stay, we're certainly not. And so $50 million is a response to the strategy that we've agreed on with all of our divisions, it says we're going to stay invested. And we're going to stay focused on making sure we can serve our customers and lean into growth as these businesses recover. And I'm not predicting necessarily a fast recovery; I'm just saying it's going to recover eventually. Michael Larsen : And then the other thing I'd add, the other thing I'd add to that, Jeff, maybe more from a modeling perspective is that of the $50 million, we expect that to be more weighted towards Q3, maybe somewhere around two-thirds of it in the third quarter. And then I think the overall payback on these projects, what's really encouraging is it's, it's projected to be less than 12 months, which supports again continued improvement as Scott referenced in -- on the margin front in 2021. And I'll just point you saw the enterprise initiatives again, here, this quarter, 100 basis points and a significant chunk of that where are these 80/20 projects, which is the bulk of what we're talking about that are driving your continued margin improvement. Jeff Sprague : And then secondly, maybe kind of a little bit more strategic Scott. But, very clear what you're saying about positioning to gain share to outperform in the recovery. But also just looking at your portfolio, right and sitting here kind of in the light of this pandemic and thinking about opportunities to kind of pivot in a different direction or a weakness exposed in a business that you haven't previously thought about, is there anything that really kind of comes to mind where you're thinking about kind of portfolio positioning that you might want to order as we look forward even if you don't want to [Indiscernible] Scott Santi : Yes, this would be the perfect place to disclose that. So\u2026\u2026.. Michael Larsen : I appreciate the question. I actually -- I sort of -- I think if anything is reinforcing our, the value of this diversified portfolio and let\u2019s just sort of focus on what happened at auto this quarter. I -- auto has been our fastest growing -- it\u2019s one of our fastest growing segments for the last five to seven years before we did the acquisition, we picked out sort of solid mid-20s margins. And I would honestly say that it's given the dynamics in the industry and the way we support that industry on a long-term basis, it's probably one of the segments that we think has the best long-term growth prospects. And the fact that we can absorb the kind of hit that we took in that business in the quarter and have that be offset by five of seven food equipments the other similar example. I think that's the kind of capability that allows us to stay invest where we want to stay invested the right the -- the sort of short-term ups and downs and not have to manage the portfolio based on some sort of\u2026. Scott Santi : In view of the future that we are guessing that. We started and end with, is there a lot of value-add that we can create in an industry, the margins ultimately are the proof point on that. And ultimately, we don't want to be in shrinking industries. But GDP, GDP plus a little bit industries are great businesses for us. And when we've got those characteristics, and we can sink our teeth into those industries for 10 or 15 or 20 years that's a great position. So I don't -- nothing has been exposed in my mind from this in terms of any part of our in one of our seven businesses that has created any problems for us or things that we would make any changes in any way. I think we clearly [Technical difficulty] that we didn't run seven businesses pretty well. They don't work on the same cycles. They don't -- they're all affected by the pandemic in exactly the same way. And all of that together says to me, it's more about word let's go find the eighth one at some point. Not about, we got to get out of one of these. Jeff Sprague : Yes, great. Thank you. Michael Larsen : So, that's the big announcement of today. Jeff Sprague : There are ways to what you ate [ph] there. Michael Larsen : Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from Joel Tiss from BMO. Your line is open. Joel Tiss : Hey. Scott Santi : Hey, Joel. Michael Larsen : Hey, Joel. Joel Tiss : Just a follow up on that that last idea you threw out there are acquisitions that they are popping off? Are they getting a little more attractively priced or anything you're starting to come a little closer on feeling like it's time to do something? Scott Santi : I will just comment and say that I think if you're a business that is not in distress during these times, this is not a time a good time to sell your business. So I think that the kinds of opportunities that may emerge are some quarters out and have less to do with sort of near-term financial distress and perhaps, relative to more strategic merits over the long haul. So, we're not spending a lot of time on, trying to try to build a pipeline right now at all because it's -- again, if you're a good quality business, this is probably not -- you're not going to sell with your numbers where they are today. Michael Larsen : Something came my way to [Indiscernible] that that we thought was a real fit, we would certainly be willing to take the real serious look at it. So it's not an issue of our-- ownership demand. It's more an issue probably of supply in the near-term. The kinds of things that we would want -- we would be interested in. Joel Tiss : Okay, and you given us a couple of a couple of pieces of some of the highlights on, acting to stay ahead of the curve and to benefit to win in the recovery. Can you kind of pull it all together? Staying there for your customers is one thing you've highlighted a couple times. Are there any other pieces that we should be thinking about? Scott Santi : Well, we talked about certainly supply chain localization, we talked about staying invested in our innovation programs, our strategic sales excellence. I don't think there's a whole lot beyond those broad categories that -- and I think there's probably some pretty good potential for some significant substance in those broad categories. This is not an easy period to manage your supply your cash flow during this kind of stress on the down and then on the recovery side. And there's a lot of disruption right now and so our ability to stay the course we have to believe is A, the either right thing to do for our customers long-term makes us even stickier with them, in fact they are taking -- count on us through thick and thin. And certainly there ought to be some opportunities where perhaps people we compete with in various businesses unable to do that it\u2019s on our consistent that may spin-off some opportunities for us. That's about as complicated as it is. Joel Tiss : Okay, okay thanks. And definitely your strategy is showing it's excellent during these times. So, thank you very much. Scott Santi : Thank you. Michael Larsen : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning. Scott Santi : Nigel. Michael Larsen : Good morning. Nigel Coe : Yes, so the comment about taking advantage of the stress I think is really interesting. It's not something that we hear from some other companies that we cover. So I'm just curious if you are seeing some real signs of your distress and with the competitors, and perhaps, food equipments and your pockets in the auto channel might be the more obvious places, but I'm just wondering if you're seeing that now was there something you expecting to see maybe from inventory shortfalls or an inability to ramp up me anymore color would be really helpful. Scott Santi : Yes, I would say, in the near-term, it's probably too early. Yes, right now volumes are still just starting to recover. We're not seeing that a lot of distress, a lot of the programs that I referenced in my commentary that are new are related to new opportunities. And that -- there's no I can try to think through the list. There's no competitor distress component to any of those. But there were people we competed with for those programs that we aren't able to commit to the same delivery, the delivery timetable we could that ultimately want us the business of that. So that I'm trying to make that distinction in the short run. But look, I would certainly say that there is from the standpoint of product availability, the impact of cash flow, working capital if this cycle starts to go to, if it gets in the growth mode. And there's going to be some cash flow constraints on people, their ability to fund working capital, if the rate we can certainly and keep up as things accelerate. I think that's more where those opportunities start to emerge. Nigel Coe : Right now, that's another question rather. And then my follow up is, it seems but when I look at your kind of -- your framework for revenues and ROI [ph] for this year, it looks like you're still planning for the detrimental around about gross margin rates in the back half of the year, correct me if I am wrong Michael. But does that imply that when you get on the other side of this and you don't have a lot of these discretionary costs come back in other do you have that your incremental can be higher on recovery? Normally you have 35% plus and price savings. Does that look more like a 40% plus, plus EF going forward or mean any color that would be good as well? Michael Larsen : Yes, I think that's a fair comment Nigel, I think that when the recovery when demand really starts to pick up here on a year-over-year basis, you're going to see some higher than usual incremental margins from ITW. I think in terms of the second half question, if you just look at the framework we've provided. And again, we're not really focused on managing to a decremental margin number here in the near-term. I think is -- as we said, is much more around positioning for the long-term, but decrementals, kind of in the low 40s for the second half, a little bit higher than that in Q3 as a result of the restructuring and then in Q4 like we said on the last call, we expect to be back in kind of a more normal decremental margin in the 35% to 40% area. But really the most important part of your question is when we do expect higher incrementals when things begin to accelerate here in a meaningful way. Nigel Coe : Great, thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Nathan Jones from Stifel. Your line is open. Nathan Jones : Good morning everyone. Scott Santi : Good morning. Michael Larsen : Good morning. Nathan Jones : I just wanted to ask a question on the food equipment side of the issue. You're seeing a lot of restaurants closing down permanently operating at lower capacity. What's your view on the likelihood that, there's going to be a fair amount of used equipment in the market, some customers here are going to be stressed. Maybe not looking to buy the high quality ITW equipment in the short-term here. And whether or not that could even have any impact the used equipment in the market on the institutional side of the business over the next few quarters here? Scott Santi : Yes, I think if you look at the product lines that we compete with, at the top tier, the used equipment market is not really an issue for us. It's much more an impacted mid tier competitors and not to people like ITW. In terms of where restaurants might end up? I think that's an open question. I mean, I think clearly, we've seen a meaningful decline in the near-term here on the restaurants and the QSR side and we'll continue to stay close to it and we'll be there to support our customers every step of the way, including with the service side of things, which is a really important part of opening these restaurants back up again that really starts -- service call to make sure that all the equipment is operational and done what it's supposed to do for our customers. So that's really how I would think about that. Nathan. Nathan Jones : That's helpful color. You just commented that you\u2019re not spending a lot of time building the M&A pipeline at the moment. You had suspended the their share repurchase program given, very strong cash flow, good outlook for free cash flow for the rest of the year. What are your thoughts about the timing of reinstating the share repurchase program? Scott Santi : Yes, I think that's a -- it's a fair question, just given how strong the free cash flow performance is and how strong the liquidity and the financial position of the company is. At this point, it's still early stages in terms of the recovery and our position is we're going to wait until this recovery path is a little bit clearer until we reinstate cash share repurchases. So we've -- for now we remain kind of on hold until we see how things might play out a little more clearly going forward. Nathan Jones : Okay, thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Your last question comes from Ross Gilardi from Bank of America. Your line is open. Ross Gilardi : Thanks, guys for squeezing me in. I mean, most of mine have been answered. And I don't know that you will answer this one. It's just a follow up on M&A and just your preferences with the current portfolio on what you might want to add to and I'm just wondering, as the relative attractiveness of the various end markets, shifted it all in this new environment and I'm, thinking specifically about food. I think this is an area that most of us from the outside might have assumed that rank higher in the packing order in terms of areas so might like to add to in the future. I don't think I'm going out on a big win there. In reality in this type of downturn, it's turned out to be your most cyclical business, whereas the market like construction, which is supposed to be most cyclical was down in the lease in the third quarter -- in the second quarter, I think because of what's happening at the home centers and consumers investing in the home and so forth. So really just asking, how is the -- has a relative packing order changed at all or the you just still look at this kind of the exact same way they would have before? Scott Santi : Well, I think your commentary sort of almost answered the question from my perspective, which is everything you said that nobody saw coming. And the next time we go through some contraction, I'm sure it will absolutely not be -- not work exactly this way. So I think in terms of relative attraction, what in every one of our businesses, every one of the seven, given the margin return on capital profile there that that if we had the right opportunities, we would certainly think about adding to all of them. And that's, again, we're taking a long-term view so that is dependant on where they are in terms their near-term relative distress. So, we wouldn't be afraid to add scale anywhere, but it's going to have to be -- we don't need to talk about scale in terms of the size of our position we don't -- we get no benefit from scale in terms of cost, given the way we run 80/20. So, we would only act if we had an opportunity to add to one of our positions -- really differentiated products access to a new market, a new end market, a new geography, etcetera. So there has to be some long-term benefit, but I don't think we chide away from any. I wouldn't necessarily rate any sort of higher priority lower priority across the seven. Ross Gilardi : Okay, got it. Just one quick housekeeping one just for I think for Michael. Yes Michael, on your scenario analysis applied the $60 million of restructuring spend in the$ 45 million from 80/20. Is that baked into your various margin scenarios or your margin scenarios excluding those costs? Michael Larsen : It is included. So we're -- as you become accustomed to. We don't adjust numbers here. So this is really these are the GAAP numbers that we're showing on the page and everything is included here including the restructuring. Ross Gilardi : what: Scott Santi : Thank you. Operator : We have no further questions. I'd like to turn the call over to Ms. Karen Fletcher for closing remarks. Karen Fletcher : Thanks. I just want to thank everybody for joining us this morning and stay well. Operator : Thank you for participating in today's conference call. All lines may disconnect at this time.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you.  Karen Fletcher, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Karen Fletcher : Okay. Thank you, Julienne. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to ITW's third quarter 2020 conference call. I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi; and Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen. During today's call, we will discuss ITW's third quarter 2020 financial results and provide an update on our strategy for managing through the global pandemic.  Slide 2 is a reminder that this presentation contains forward-looking statements. We refer you to the company's 2019 Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, including the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. This presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures and a reconciliation of those measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release.  Please turn to Slide 3, and it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi. Scott Santi : Thank you, Karen. Good morning, everyone. We saw solid recovery progress in many of the end markets that we serve in the third quarter, as evidenced by our revenue being up 29% sequentially versus the second quarter. In fact, demand levels returned to rates approximating year ago levels in five of our seven segments, with two of those, Construction and Polymers & Fluids delivering meaningful growth in the third quarter.  On the flip side, demand levels in our Food Equipment and Welding segments continued to be materially impacted by the effects of the pandemic, although we did see good sequential improvement in both in Q3 versus Q2. We talk often about the flexibility and responsiveness inherent in our 80/20 Front-to-Back operating system. And those attributes were clearly on display in our Q3 performance. Supported by our decision early on as the pandemic unfolded to refrain from initiating staffing reductions and to focus on positioning the company to fully participate in the recovery, our people around the world responded to a rapid acceleration in demand by leveraging the ITW business model to provide excellent service to our customers, while keeping themselves and their coworkers safe. Perhaps the most pronounced example was our Auto OEM segment, where our team executed flawlessly from both a quality and delivery standpoint in responding to demand levels that essentially doubled in Q3 versus Q2, and with a demand -- a very demanding customer base. Across all seven of our segments, our teams can cite numerous examples of how our ability to sustain high levels of service in the face of rapidly accelerating demand resulted in incremental business for the company in Q3. In addition to leveraging our best-in-class delivery capabilities, our divisions remain laser-focused on leveraging our strengths to capture sustainable share gain opportunities that are aligned with our long-term enterprise strategy. These efforts are just beginning to take hold. And I'm confident that they will contribute meaningfully to accelerating our progress towards our long-term organic growth goals. The operating flexibility that is core to our 80/20 Front-to-Back operating system also applies to our cost structure, which showed through our operating margin performance in Q3. Operating margin of 23.8% in the quarter included meaningfully higher restructuring expenses versus a year ago in two segments specific one-time items which Michael will provide more detail on in a few minutes. Excluding these factors, operating margin was 25.3% in Q3, the second highest in the history of the company. Overall, the pace of recovery in the third quarter exceeded our expectations heading into the quarter, as we delivered revenue of $3.3 billion, operating income of $789 million, free cash flow $631 million and GAAP EPS of $1.83. In addition, after tax return on invested capital improved to 29.6%, an all-time high for the company. It goes without saying that I could not be more proud of how the ITW team is managing through this challenging period. And I want to sincerely thank my 45,000 plus ITW colleagues around the world for their continued exceptional efforts and dedication in serving our customers and executing our strategy with excellence. In the face of unprecedented challenges and circumstances, our operational and financial performance over the last few quarters supports our decision to remain fully invested in the key initiatives supporting the execution of our long-term enterprise strategy and provides further evidence that ITW is a company that has both the enduring competitive advantages and the resilience necessary to deliver consistent upper tier performance in any economic environment. Moving forward, we remain focused on delivering strong results while continuing to execute on our long-term strategy to achieve and sustain ITW's full potential performance. I'll now turn the call over to Michael for more detail on our Q3 performance. Michael? Michael Larsen : Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Since the beginning of the pandemic, maintaining ITW's considerable financial strength, liquidity and strategic optionality has been a priority. Our objective was to fully leverage the strong financial foundation and resilient profitability profile that we have built over the last 7 years to position ITW for maximum participation in the recovery. And as the recovery progressed ahead of our expectations going into the quarter, we were ready to meet customer demand, and we delivered strong financial results.  Q3 revenue was up 29% or almost $750 million sequentially versus Q2. And on a year-over-year basis, organic revenue declined only 4.6% compared to a 27% decline in Q2. The impact of last year's divestitures was 1% and was essentially offset by 0.7% of favorable currency impact. Product line simplification was 30 basis points in the quarter. Despite the negative volume leverage and our decision to stay invested in our key strategic priorities, Q3 operating margin was 23.8%, down only 120 basis points compared to prior year. If you set aside the impact of higher restructuring expenses and 2 one-time segment items that I will describe in a moment, operating margin would actually have increased year-over-year to 25.3%. Strong execution on our enterprise initiatives was a big contributor once again at 120 basis points as all segments delivered benefits in the range of 70 basis points to 190 basis points. As expected, our decremental margins were a little higher than normal at 46% in the third quarter. Excluding the 2 one-time items that I just mentioned and the higher restructuring expense, our decremental margins would have been about 20%, significantly better than our historical decrementals of 35% to 40%. Operating income was $789 million and GAAP EPS was $1.83, with an effective tax rate of 21.3%, in line with last year's 21.6%. Solid working capital performance contributed to free cash flow of $631 million and a conversion rate of 108% of net income. On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow was $1.9 billion, with a conversion rate of 127% compared to 105% last year. We now expect free cash flow to end the year significantly above $2 billion. Our balance sheet remains strong. At quarter end, we had $2.2 billion of cash on hand, no commercial paper and a $2.5 billion undrawn revolving credit facility, Tier 1 credit ratings and total liquidity of more than $4.7 billion. In terms of our debt structure, you can see an increase of $350 million in the short-term debt, which is simply a reclassification from long-term to short-term as our 2021 bonds are coming due in less than 12 months. So in summary, a very good quarter operationally and financially as the recovery progressed well ahead of our previous expectations. Moving on to Slide 4 for a closer look at the third quarter recovery and response by each segment. You can see that every segment responded effectively to the increase in demand recovery and improved sequentially on both revenues and operating margin. I would highlight just a few things that Scott mentioned, including the fact that our Automotive OEM segment was able to essentially double their volumes in a quarter or just 90 days as operating margins swung from negative to 20% plus. In addition, 6 of 7 segments had operating margins, not segment margins, operating margins above 20%. FEG, Food Equipment was just below 20%, but we expect them to get above 20% in Q4 despite the fact that they are operating in a pretty challenging environment. Next to Slide 5, starting with a quick look at organic revenue by geography. As you can see, customer demand improved in every region. North America declined by only 5% in Q3 compared to down 26% in Q2. Europe also improved significantly, down only 8%, a sequential improvement of almost 30 percentage points. Asia Pacific turned positive this quarter, up 3%; and China was the standout, up 10% as the recovery continued to take hold. In China, specifically, Automotive OEM, Polymers & Fluids, and Specialty Products, all grew double-digits. So in summary, broad-based geographic recovery in the quarter. Now let's walk through each segment, starting with the one that experienced the most pronounced recovery, Automotive OEM. In a matter of weeks, our customers went from being shut down to operating close to full capacity and the team responded by leveraging their experienced workforce, local supply chains and flexible operating system to quickly ramp up and meet customer demand. Overall, organic revenue was still down 5% year-over-year, with North America down 10% and Europe down 5%. China, which had already turned positive last quarter at 6%, also improved sequentially and was up 15% this quarter. Lastly, as we discussed on our last call, we did initiate a few restructuring projects that were part of our 2020 plan pre-pandemic which led to a reduction in operating margins of 150 basis points to 20.8%. Turning to Slide 6. As expected, Food Equipment was the hardest hit segment in the quarter as organic revenue declined 20%, a significant improvement, though, from being down 38% in Q2. North America and international organic revenue were both down about 20%. Equipment sales were down 21% and service was down 17%. Institutional demand was down about 30% and restaurants, including QSR, were down a little bit more than that. On a positive note, retail, which includes grocery stores, grew more than 30% supported by the rollout of new products. Despite the significant negative volume leverage and higher restructuring expense, operating margin was still 19.6%. Excluding the higher restructuring impact, margins would have been 21.4%. And I think it's worth noting that in this most challenging environment, the segment generated almost $19 million in operating income. In Test & Measurement and Electronics organic revenue declined only 2%, with Test & Measurement down 6% and Electronics up 2%. While demand for capital equipment remains soft, the segment benefited from considerable strength in a number of end markets, including semiconductor, healthcare and clean room technology. As you can see from the footnote, the reported operating margin of 23.7% included 350 basis points of unfavorable impact from removing a potential divestiture from assets held-for-sale. Excluding this impact, the operating margin would have been 27.2%, which is a much more accurate representation of the underlying profitability of this segment. Given the current environment, we simply decided to defer this divestiture for now. Speaking of divestitures, let me make a broader comment on our portfolio management efforts and specifically the 2018 decision to divest 7 businesses that we determined no longer fit our enterprise strategy framework, with revenue of approximately $1 billion. We expect at that completion of these divestitures will improve our overall organic growth rate at the enterprise level by approximately 50 basis points and increase enterprise operating margins by 100 basis points. In 2019, we made good progress completing 4 divestitures with revenues of approximately $150 million. And we are seeing the benefits in our financials this year, including 20 basis points of operating margin impact. While the pandemic put a hold on our efforts this year, our view regarding the long-term strategy fit of the remaining divestitures has not changed. Accordingly, we will resume the sale process for these businesses when market conditions normalize. Okay. Turning to Slide 7. In Welding, demand for capital equipment was down year-over-year as organic revenue declined 10%. However, the commercial business, which accounts for about 35% of revenue and serves primarily smaller businesses and individual users, was up 11%. In industrial, customers were holding back on capital spending, and organic revenue was down more than 20% this quarter. Operating margin, though, was remarkably resilient at 27.9%. On a positive note, Polymers & Fluids reported record organic growth of 6% in the quarter. The automotive aftermarket business benefited from strong retail sales to grow 10%, with double-digit growth in tire and engine repair products. Fluids was up 6%, with strong sales in healthcare and hygiene end markets. As a result of the volume leverage and strong incremental margins of 78%, operating margin expanded by 250 basis points to a record 26.6%. Moving to Slide 8. Construction had a remarkable quarter, benefiting from continued strong demand in the home center channel to deliver record organic growth of 8%. All geographies were positive, with North America up 12% with double-digit growth in the residential and renovation market, offset by commercial construction down 10%. Europe was up 6% with double-digit growth in the Nordic region, and Australia and New Zealand revenues grew 3% and were positive for the first time in more than 2 years. As a result of the volume leverage and strong incremental margins of 59%, operating margin expanded by 300 basis points to a record 28.1%. And some of you may remember that when we launched the enterprise strategy in 2012, Construction had the lowest operating margins in the company, seemingly stock right around 12%, certainly good performance in the industry, but not really ITW caliber. The fact that the Construction segment delivered the highest margins inside of ITW in Q3 at more than 28% is, therefore, pretty remarkable. Specialty organic revenue was down 5%, with North America down 4% and international revenue down 7%. Demand for consumer packaging remained solid but was offset by lower demand in the capital equipment businesses. Operating margin was 25.2% and included a one-time customer cost-sharing settlement. Excluding the impact of this one-time item, operating margins would have been 28%. Let's move to Slide 9 for an updated look at our full year 2020. As I mentioned earlier, the demand recovery in Q3 exceeded the high end of our expectations going into the quarter, and as a result, we're updating our financial outlook for the year. As we sit here today, we expect organic revenue for the full year to be down 11% to 11.5%, operating margin to be in the range of 22% to 22.5% and operating income in the range of $2.7 billion to $2.8 billion. As I mentioned, free cash flow performance continues to be strong, and we expect to end the year well above $2 billion. As you think about Q4, keep in mind the typical seasonality from Q3 to Q4 and that Q4 has 2 less shipping days. Also, please note that we expect a slightly higher tax rate in Q4 versus Q3 and our full year tax rate is expected to be in the 22% to 23% range. With respect to our outlook for 2021, we expect to reinstate annual guidance when we release full year 2020 results early next year.  With that, Karen, back to you. Karen Fletcher : Okay. Thanks, Michael. Julienne, let's open up the lines for questions, please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jamie Cook : I guess two questions, sort of one strategically as we're getting through COVID, can you sort of speak to where you had a good opportunity to grow faster than the market or where you -- which markets do you see best positioned to grow faster than the market as you sort of take advantage of the opportunity right now and update on how the M&A is trending? And then I guess my second question, as we think about 2021, understanding you don't want to talk about incrementals yet outside of volumes. Is there anything that you can help us with headwinds versus tailwinds? I guess you don't have some of the salary cuts that other people will be comping or structuring. I'm just trying to think of the puts and takes and your ability to put up outsized incrementals. Scott Santi : Well, maybe let me take the sort of strategic questions and then ask Michael to comment on your second question. What I would say overall is this is very much a dynamic situation that's still playing its way out. We are certainly responding from a tactical standpoint, pretty well at this point. Our ability to remain invested is certainly and with the mission of focusing on, making sure we serve our customers extremely well through this period and also that we are in position to seize opportunities that come our way. We remain focused on that. I think at this point, it's way too early to sort out the sort of priorities of the rank order of opportunities other than -- I'll refer back to the comment I made in my opening remarks that every 1 of our segments can point to solid examples in the third quarter of where their ability to have immediate availability to respond to a customer need resulted in incremental business for the company. It remains a priority, but I think the situation in the near-term is just too dynamic in terms of having any real view at this point of what parts of the company have more opportunity than others. But I think the thing we want to be clear about is we are focused on it and expect those opportunities to continue to play out as we go forward. From an M&A perspective, although I would really say at this point is what we've said in the past is from the standpoint of the long-term strategy of the company, we remain very open to the good opportunities that come our way. But I would also marry that up with the fact that in this environment, sort of the flip side of our own experience on the divestitures, this is not a particularly good time for quality business to sell. We're not in the market for discussed assets. We're interested in bringing quality companies into the company, into ITW that we think we can at fit our strategy and ultimately, that we can help even better companies. And in this kind of environment, this is not necessarily a great time to sell. So on a medium to long-term basis, as we have said repeatedly in prior forums, it remains a core part of the overall growth strategy and profile of the company. But from a tactical standpoint, short-term, it's not a big focus right now. Michael Larsen : And then on your second question, Jamie, as we've talked about before, the planning process inside of ITW is very much a bottoms-up planning process, and we simply haven't gotten through that process yet with our businesses. And so I can't really comment in great detail. I will -- I promise that when we provide guidance on our next earnings call, I'll be able to address your specific questions in a lot of detail. And then I'll just point to the obvious ones at this point that the comparisons in terms of year-over-year growth are obviously what they are, which is fairly easy. And then specific to your question around incrementals, our long-term incrementals are still in that 35% to 40% range. I will say that, as you saw this quarter, in both Polymers & Fluids and Construction that when we get a reasonable amount of organic growth, the incremental margins tend to be significantly higher. It's certainly in the near term. And so you may see some of that when we get into detail for 2021. Operator : Your next question comes from John Inch from Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead. Your line is open. John Inch : Hey, Scott, what are you and your auto team saying toward the prospects to return to sustainable growth in North America and Europe? In other words, how much pent-up demand cyclically is creating for a runway do you think beyond sort of a quarter or two of what the pent-up stuff for kind of backtracking? And I'm just wondering if you also think -- a couple of companies have commented on this, and it seems intuitive. The public is avoiding mass transit in big cities and driving more as they did in China during their experience. Do you think that adds some juice to the potential recovery in auto next year? Scott Santi : Certainly, potentially, I would say our thinking on that is not yet particularly deep. We're still in the tactical mode. I think beyond what you -- the situation that you just talked about or the shift in demand related to this COVID experience on a medium basis that might result from what you talked about there, we also are looking at dealer inventories that remain at 5-year plus lows. There's certainly -- so I don't know that in our own thinking, we're sort of out -- yet, long-term, we'll do some of that as part of our planning process. And as we think about how to -- we want to adjust our positioning around that sort of trend long-term. But I do think that based on just the sort of more current conditions in the marketplace that certainly Q4 we expect to be solid and into Q1 at this point. And then -- and we'll have a better view when we announce our results and have our 2022 plans -- 2021 and '22 plans baked in early January. John Inch : That's fair. I just wanted to also just follow that up and stick with the auto theme. I've got a couple of context of OEs. And what they tell me is right now, there's pretty substantial problems with supplier quality. A lot of it may actually have to do with the fact that a lot of workers are booking off time, and they're just not coming into work. And it's creating a lot of stress in the system for requirements for the OEs to work overtime and do rework and stuff like that. Is this -- firstly, are you seeing quality issues with respect to your own supply chain who feed ITW's plans? And secondly, is this actually, I'm wondering, creating an opportunity because you guys can leverage 80/20 to drive some incremental share just based on the fact that you can fulfill with quality versus perhaps what others are doing? I realize your auto business is kind of program-by-program. So that's why I'm kind of asking the question. You're not Delphi or whatever. Just -- there's something going on there. Scott Santi : No, it's program-by-program, but we are not sole-sourced in a lot of the programs that we participate in. So certainly, some of the issues that you talked about were absolutely present, and we're part of our overall results in auto in the third quarter, and we expect that to certainly continue to be an incremental opportunity. There are certainly lots of parts of the auto OE supply chain that we don't participate in. So we're not going to solve the problem. But certainly, in the areas that we serve our customers, we are laser-focused on making sure they're aware that we stay in -- that we remain in a very strong supply position that we're there to help them to the best of our ability, deal with some of the issues that you talked about. And from a quality standpoint, we've talked in the past about the fact that this company operates with localized supply chains, strong commitments to long-term relationships with our key suppliers. And going back to the second quarter, our plan throughout has been to make sure that we -- that supply chain for us remains in position, robust and ready to flex with us. That's not a new thing for us, that's inherent in our business model and the way we operate. And so far, I actually should have probably also thank our supply base in my opening comments because they've been remarkable to-date. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Maybe a question first for Michael, just around the free cash flow outlook. I think you've mentioned on the previous call that you should have a big step down in second half free cash, $600 million or so. But in Q3, certainly, the free cash flow looking pretty robust. So just wondered if you had any updated thoughts around sort of working capital management and what kind of pressures that could put on the cash flow? And how well do you think you're managing that working capital now as the sales are starting to improve? Michael Larsen : Yes. It's a good question, Julian. I mean I think as a result of the fact that the recovery progressed ahead of our expectations into the quarter, our free cash flow performance was also significantly better than what we expected going into the quarter. And we expect something similar here in the fourth quarter. Like I said, year-to-date, we're at $1.9 billion. And we should end the year significantly above $2 billion. I will say this, I think that the working capital performance inside the company, given the recovery in Q3 was pretty remarkable, the teams did an excellent job focusing on -- particularly on the receivables side.  Early on, we put some focus on our credit and collection efforts. And as a result of that, if you look at our -- you can\u2019t see that from the outside, but inside the company, when you look at our past due performance, we are right in line with where we are historically, which given the pressures here during the pandemic is quite remarkable. So you should expect Julian continued strong free cash flow performance, and we expect to end the year well above 100% as we -- if things stay the way they are here in the fourth quarter. Julian Mitchell : And then just a quick follow-up, perhaps for Scott. You mentioned the very low inventories in the Auto OEM vertical. Just wondered, looking across the disparate portfolio at ITW, how do you characterize the state of inventories at channel partners and customers when you're looking at the other businesses, are you seeing much restocking, for example, in general? Scott Santi : Yes. We've talked about this in the past. We have very little visibility there. The auto comment I made was more around dealer inventories, which is obviously a step or move and their approaches there are certainly their own and it's a number that's reported and is obviously very visible.  In terms of most of our other channel partners, given the fact that you order from us today, we ship it to you tomorrow, there's very little buffer in terms of inventory. So I think from the standpoint of destock-restock, it's not a big factor for us really ever. Operator : Your next question comes from Andy Casey from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Andy Casey : A question on the outlook, if I take the midpoint of the numbers that you provided, it seems to imply Q4 revenue kind of flattish with both Q3 and last year. But the margins are expected, if I'm doing the math right, to decline to about 22% to 23% from Q3 to just to $25.3 million and then last year\u2019s 23.8%. Is that entirely mix or should we consider something else? Scott Santi : Yes. I think the major driver of the guidance we're providing or the framework we're planning for Q4 is really the fact that if you go back and look historically, Q4 is -- tends to be lower than Q3 from a revenue and margin standpoint, really primarily as a result of the fact that there are 2 less shipping days in the fourth quarter. What I can tell you in terms of the underlying sales trends, that we -- obviously, significant sequential improvement here in -- as we went through the third quarter, those have remained on trend as we sit here in October. So that's certainly encouraging. And then the margin performance, again, it's -- you should -- there's nothing unusual here in the fourth quarter.  I will say that I pointed to some one-time items here in the third quarter. Obviously, we don't expect those to repeat in the fourth quarter. So hopefully, we've provided enough information here for you to put together your own view of what the fourth quarter might look like with your own assumptions. But what's reflected on the page in the deck is really our current view as we sit here today for the full year. Andy Casey : Okay. And then if I may, last quarter, you gave us some information about market share win benefit to annualized revenue. Would you be willing to share where the company stands on that metric, meaning did it increase this past quarter? And if so, by magnitude, about how much? Scott Santi : Yes. I think what we gave you last quarter was just a couple of 2 or 3 real examples that had already started to play out as we were reporting our results. This is not a list that we're keeping inside the company. This is certainly a major focus across all 7 of our segments. I guarantee that our segments are tracking it very diligently. But at this point, I would assume that certainly continuing to broaden out and it would just be impossible given the thousands and thousands of customers that we have that if we were keeping a running tab of all this stuff and reporting on and it just wouldn't -- it wouldn't be practical nor would it be accurate, probably. Operator : Your next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Andy Kaplowitz : Scott or Michael, if you look at a couple of your segments in the quarter, such as Construction or Polymers & Fluids, the growth rates we rarely ever see in these segments, we know much of the growth is coming from strength, for instance, in construction renovation or auto aftermarket. But you've also done a lot of PLS in these segments which you mentioned are helping the margin side. So are we also seeing the fruits of the labor on the revenue side, too? Or is this just pandemic-related recovery? What could that mean for the sustainability of growth in these particular segments in 2021? Scott Santi : Yes. My answer to Andy is that some of both. There are certainly certain market sectors or product categories within both of those segments that are benefiting from some pandemic-related demand. We actually talked about that very question with the leaders of both of those businesses. And beyond those sort of pandemic-related benefits in the near-term, both of their results also reflect a solid progress in terms of improving the overall growth posture and profile in those two segments. Andy Kaplowitz : Scott, that's helpful. And then maybe about Food Equipment, could you give us more color in the sense you mentioned institutional was up -- was down 30% with restaurant down a little more than that, but grocery stores were up 30%. As you look out over the next few quarters, do you see continued recovery in institutional and sustained strength in grocery? And can you see your Food Equipment sales continue to recover if the restaurant facing portion of the business stays weak? Scott Santi : Yes. And so we think that the recovery will probably be on the slow side of things. It will take a while. As you look across the portfolio, Food Equipment is probably the segment where the recovery for obvious reasons will take a little bit longer. Yes, I can give you a little bit of detail maybe on the quarter in terms of the end markets. The institutional side, down about 30%, which was the same as in the second quarter. Within that, healthcare is doing slightly better. And the drag really is on the lodging side, as you might expect. Restaurants, QSR did improve sequentially versus the second quarter. And then obviously, a big improvement here on the retail side. Supported -- part of that was market and part of it was new product rollout share gain. And so that's why that business was up almost 40% on the retail side. But to answer your question, this will be -- as we sit here today, we think this will be a fairly slow recovery in Food Equipment. In the near term -- I think in the long-term, our view hasn't changed in terms of how attractive this business is, both in terms of our ability to grow above market and our ability to do so at a very attractive margin. And I think you saw in the quarter here for this business to already be back at 20% operating margin and generating $90 million of income, given the environment that they're dealing with. It's a pretty remarkable accomplishment. So near term, slow, but long-term, we are very bullish on this business. Operator : Your next question comes from Ann Duignan from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Ann Duignan : Most of the short-term questions have been answered at this point. I thought maybe I could ask about the Automotive business in terms of what you're seeing out there for future programs. I know you bid on platforms many years in advance. And are you beginning to see more RFQs or RFPs coming out for electric vehicles and electric platforms? And how does that change the dynamics within the team, especially maybe in Europe ahead of the U.S.? Scott Santi : Yes. I'd say a couple of things. In terms of new program activity, generally, things certainly got pushed out as the -- just based on the pandemic impact. And so a lot of that activity in the second quarter pretty much disappeared as you would expect, but then in the third quarter has picked up nicely in terms of our engagement with our customers around their future platforms and areas of opportunity for us to participate. And we've talked about the -- on the EV question, we've talked about that a lot. We remain pretty agnostic from the standpoint of internal combustion versus EV from the standpoint of the overall opportunity profile for ITW in terms of the types of solutions where we can add value. In fact, it's still slightly higher on EV on a per vehicle basis. And as you would expect, on a relative basis, it's not as big as the volume of projects on the internal combustion side at this point, but certainly from the standpoint of the growth in the number of projects that we're engaging on in EV for all the reasons you would expect, that is certainly coming up the curve fast. Ann Duignan : And then you talk about China and what you're seeing there beyond just Automotive? We read a lot about what's going on in Automotive in China. But maybe you could talk us through what you're seeing in the other segments in China, specifically? Michael Larsen : Yes. So maybe just to take a step back. So if you go back to the first quarter, our sales in China were down 24%. In the second quarter here, flat, positive 1%. And then in Q3, as the recovery continued to take hold, that business actually grew 10% year-over-year. Auto is actually not the fastest-growing business in China, but auto was up 15%, and so as was specialty. And then our Polymers & Fluids business was up 30% here in the third quarter in China. And then as you'd expect there's still a slower recovery on the Food Equipment side down kind of in the mid-single-digit range. So -- but certainly encouraging trends and as the recovery continues to take hold in China. Operator : Your next question comes from Scott Davis from Melius Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Scott Davis : The results obviously in Construction were really amazing overall. And can you give us a little bit of color on whether you put up those numbers despite maybe some product shortages, where the product shortages? What -- and I guess, kind of a natural follow-up is that what role did the price play in the strong results? I assume you might have been able to get a little bit of price given the supply demand environment. Michael Larsen : Yes. And the results in Construction were driven by our ability to supply some of the most demanding customers that we deal with. So there were no shortages. And as Scott said earlier, I mean, I think a lot of credit to the operating team and a lot of credit to our own supply chain, our local supply chains and their ability to respond and meet some really strong activity at -- in the home centers. If you look at -- the residential renovation business was up almost 20% in Q3 after a strong Q2. And so -- but like I said, this was -- because all the way back to our decision I think to not initiate aggressive headcount reductions in Q2 and focus instead of winning the recovery, and that's what you're seeing here in Construction, our ability to supply and take care of customers and do so at record margins, which, by the way, are not driven by price. They're driven by a range of things in this quarter, and particularly, the volume leverage was certainly helpful. The enterprise initiatives continue to contribute in a big way, and price was really not a factor in this. Scott Davis : Is price something that you generally put through towards kind of the end of the year, most regular cycle on price? Or is it more opportunistic? Michael Larsen : Well, it's more a planned process. It's an annual cycle -- yes. It's certainly not something that you -- that we are in a position to be very tactical about it. The goal is to -- Scott offset any raw material cost inflation and there is very little of that in the current environment. And so price was really not, to answer your question, a significant factor here. Operator : Your next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Golden Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Joe Ritchie : Maybe just starting off from just on kind of the near-term and thinking about that 4Q implied growth number. Michael, I think you mentioned in your prepared comments that there's going to be 2 less shipping days. I just want to be clear, in the 2 less shipping days, is that on a year-over-year basis? Or is that versus just 3Q? And does that account really for the deceleration? Michael Larsen : Yes. It's versus the third quarter. I think there's 64 days in Q3. There are 62 in Q4. And that is exactly the same set up as last year. So on a year-over-year basis, there's no -- and I would add, and it\u2019s very tactical, but some of those shipping days between Christmas and the New Year holiday are typically let's just say not very robust. So I think probably more than 2. Scott Santi : And I think maybe, Joe, what you're really asking is, are you seeing -- are you implying that things are decelerating? And I think that's certainly not the case. I think we have not seen anything to suggest that things are slowing here in the fourth quarter. Joe Ritchie : Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then I want to dig into the Food Equipment segment for a second. You mentioned the retail part of your business was up 30%. And some of that was driven by product rollouts. I'd love a little bit more color on what you're doing there specifically and whether there was any benefit that you saw from just pent-up demand for not being able to potentially shift in 2Q? I'm just trying to understand that 30% number in Food Equipment? Scott Santi : Yes, some of that. I think in Q2, it was a little difficult to get in there with the product rollouts. But this is part of the annual cycle in Food Equipment where we roll out new products with added features. And so I also think it's -- if you were to ask our team, they would certainly suggest that there were some pretty significant share gains here in the third quarter as a result of these new products being rolled out. So hopefully, that answers your question. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Maybe just 1 more around the kind of short-term tempo. So it looks like you didn't really see any like inventory whipsaw effect. And Scott, you explained clearly how your business operates. But did you get a sense that everybody was caught off guard here in Q3, and there's just a fair amount of catch-up from Q2 and Q3? So it may not be an inventory effect per se, but it's just kind of a snapback that does, in fact, create somewhat down as we move into Q4. It sounds like you're not seeing that yet, but just wondering your kind of antenna on the ground, is there any sense that there's that kind of dynamic that play here? Scott Santi : This is not going to be a helpful answer, but it's really hard to tell, Jeff. I think at this point, this is obviously a fairly unprecedented situation on so many respects. All we can do is stay in position -- somebody better pet the dog. That's not here. But some of it may very well be a factor. It's just impossible to tell. All we can do is what's within our control, which is to stay in position to serve our customers we're -- third quarter was certainly the first part of the recovery from a completely unprecedented complete shutdown of wide swaths of our customer base and the economy. And so I wouldn't certainly rule out any and all of the above in terms of impacting the conditions right now, and we'll see how they play out from here. But all we can tell you is what -- I back to what Michael said earlier, is at least through -- obviously, through the third quarter and through October, we've seen no pulling back. Jeff Sprague : Yes, I'm doing my part here to help the economy, you've got a construction guy showing up and my dog is barking at him. So can you also just give us an update on your thinking on share repurchase here? It sounds like M&A is probably sliding to the right. The cash is obviously gushing. It doesn't look like you did anything in the quarter, maybe I'm wrong, but what's your current thinking? Michael Larsen : Yes. So at this point, our primary focus is really on running the business and getting our plans together for next year. And so we suspended the buyback back in Q1. We\u2019ve done -- we spent $706 million, somewhere around $167 a share. And we're essentially done for the year. And our focus really is on running the business and getting our plans together. And then when we kind of give you our thoughts on what 2021 might look like, we'll give you an update at that point also on share repurchases. Operator : Your next question comes from Stephen Volkmann from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Stephen Volkmann : Just a couple of quick follow-ups, if I could. In terms of the strategy to sort of win the recovery, it seems like maybe automotive might be amongst the most fertile ground as you're able to fill orders that maybe competitors can't. And I'm just curious -- maybe it's way too early for this, but is it potentially possible to think about your historical wins relative to the auto build increasing? Is it too early to think about that? Scott Santi : Well, I think it would be -- I think what I would say Jeff is this gives us an opportunity to demonstrate to our customers the value equation -- I'm sorry, Steve, Jeff was the last one here. Sorry, Steve. The dog is still following me. My apologies. The -- what I was saying is I think this is a phenomenal opportunity for us to demonstrate the value equation around ITW's role in the auto OEM supply chain from the standpoint of a comprehensive -- our ability to serve you through thick and through thin. And so I would expect that our customers experience with us through this particular period will certainly be contributing to our ability to -- as we go forward to secure more business based on the sort of full range of the value-add that we can bring, including our ability to supply when things are dicey. Stephen Volkmann : Okay. Alright. Fair enough. And then just quickly on Specialty Product. I think, Michael, you mentioned something about cost sharing. I'm just curious if there's any detail there, anything we should be thinking about going forward? Michael Larsen : This is a one-time item, and it relates to an agreement with a customer that for obvious reasons I can't give you a ton of detail on. I think the important thing, this was a one-time item, and you're not going to see it again. Operator : Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Nicole DeBlase : So maybe we can start with just the cadence of the quarter. Did you see continued improvement throughout the quarter? Or was the organic growth kind of similar across each month? Scott Santi : Yes. I think the sales trends in Q3 were pretty strong right out of the gate in July. I think we talked about that on our last earnings call. And really remain that way through August, September. And so far, what we've seen of October. Nicole DeBlase : Okay. Okay. Got it. And then just an update on the restructuring. I know that on the last call, you guys kind of noted that you expected to spend around $60 million in the back half. But given that top-line is kind of coming in probably better than you would have expected, is $60 million still the plan for the second half? And if so, can you maybe parse out what was done in 3Q and what you expect to do in the fourth quarter? Scott Santi : Yes, you're right, Nicole. It's -- we now expect it to be a little bit lower than the $60 million that we talked about on the last call. Let me just -- first that, just a reminder that the projects that we're doing this year are essentially the projects that were in the pre-pandemic plan, if you like. And there's very little specific tied to the pandemic from a restructuring standpoint. And part of the reason for that is, obviously, the recovery is now progressing at least in the third quarter at a pace that exceeded our expectations. So we have done $37 million year-to-date. And we expect to end up somewhere around $50 million for the full year. Nicole DeBlase : Okay. And that probably means then that you guys were kind of expecting 1 to 1 payback as we think about the impact to 2021. So I also suspect that the stock is more like $50 million for next year. Is that fair? Scott Santi : Yes. I mean -- I think the payback, as we've talked about before on these projects, and these are really the projects that are coming out of our Front-to-Back process are typically less than 12 months. So that would be a reasonable assumption. Operator : Your next question comes from Mig Dobre from Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Mig Dobre : Just a quick question on margin here, especially sort of the margin algorithm going forward. As I'm looking at gross margins, it was very nice to see them above 42% again. And I'm wondering here, just conceptually, as volumes, we get back to volume growth at a point in time, do you see some opportunity to continue to expand, to drive gross margin? Or is this mostly a exercise of leverage on SG&A in terms of driving incremental margin? Michael Larsen : Well, I think we've demonstrated over the last 7 years that we have a pretty good track record in terms of continuing to drive improvement in our cost structure, both on the variable side as well as on the SG&A side. So we would expect both. And I should have said this upfront, as we begin to think about 2021, I mean -- and that is -- and the enterprise initiative specifically, they didn't -- we didn't talk a lot about that, but they contributed 120 basis points of margin expansion here in the third quarter. Year-to-date, we're above 100 basis points, and we're 7 years into this. And so I think it's certainly a lot of positive momentum going into not just fourth quarter but also into next year, as these enterprise initiatives continue to contribute to our margin improvement in a meaningful way, both variable and on the SG&A side -- on the fixed cost side. Mig Dobre : And then my follow-up, going back to Welding, and I appreciate the color that you guys gave there. I'm wondering if you can provide a little bit more in terms of kind of what you're seeing going forward. Arguably speaking, some of your customers in areas like heavy equipment and such might be seeing some of these production schedules bottom out. Do you have any sense for how demand might progress here? And at what point in time we could be seeing this segment return back to growth? Michael Larsen : Well, I think, Mig, as you look at Q4, I think Q4 will -- if that's your question, will look a lot like Q3, probably. I think we haven't done the plans yet for next year. And when we get together, next year, we'll give you a little more color by segment, including Welding. But it's really a little too early to tell at this point. So I mean, as I said upfront, the comparisons year-over-year are going to be relatively easy. So just on that basis, that's certainly helpful as we think about next year. But we'll give you a better answer, Mig, when we provide guidance for 2021, okay? Operator : Your last question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : Obviously, you\u2019ve covered a lot of ground here. I did want to go back to restructuring. That $50 million this year, does that support the 100 basis points for next year? Or does that provide some upside potential to that number? Michael Larsen : Well, I -- I'm not going to let you pin me down on the number yet for next year because we haven't gone through the specific projects and activities that support that number for next year. But I think it's reasonable to assume a meaningful contribution again next year from our enterprise initiatives, and which includes 80/20 work as well as the work that's being done on the strategic sourcing side. So that's probably the best I can do right now is expect another meaningful contribution from the enterprise initiatives next year. Nigel Coe : And then a quick one on tools. Obviously, very impressive performance. And I was surprised because I think I'm right in saying that you have exclusively a pro channel that's very limited exposure to there. So it seems like this is all driven by new residential construction. Renovation would have been -- seems still quite anemic. Is that the case? And what are you seeing in terms of new build versus renovation trends? Michael Larsen : I think your view let's change your assumptions. So renovation, we've got a lot of exposure. And so our residential construction exposure is bolt-on new and remodel, and the remodel is really where the strength -- a lot of the strength was in Q3. Scott Santi : Yes. That's exactly right. Just to add maybe a little more color, Nigel, since you had to wait until the end to get your question in. We did see some builder activity also picking up in other parts of the business. So hopefully, that's helpful. Operator : I would now like to turn the call back over to Ms. Karen Fletcher for any closing remarks. Karen Fletcher : Okay. Thanks, Julienne. Thank you, everybody, for joining us this morning. Have a good day. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Thank you. Karen Fletcher, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Karen Fletcher : Okay. Thank you, Julianne. Good morning and welcome to ITW's Fourth Quarter 2020 Conference Call. I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi; and Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen. During today's call, we'll discuss ITW's fourth quarter and full-year 2020 financial results and provide guidance for full-year 2021. Slide 2 is a reminder that this presentation contains forward-looking statements. We refer you to the Company's 2019 Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, including the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our businesses. This presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures and a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release. Please turn to Slide 3, and it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi. Scott Santi : Thank you, Karen. Good morning, everyone. The ITW team closed out 2020 with another quarter of strong operational execution and financial performance. From my perspective, the highlights are the Q4 revenues got back to year-ago levels despite food equipment being down 17% and net operating income, operating margin and after-tax ROIC were all Q4 records for the company. It was a pretty solid finish to the year that needless to say, provided some unique and unprecedented circumstances and challenges, and indicates good momentum as we head into 2021. While it was the challenges brought about by the pandemic that dominated our attention in 2020, it was the collection of capabilities and competitive advantages that we have built and honed over the past eight years through the execution of our enterprise strategy that provided us with the options to respond to them as we did. Early on as the pandemic unfolded, we refocused the entire company on only two core imperatives. A, to protect the health, safety and well-being of our people, and B, to continue to serve our customers with excellence. And in my view, we executed extremely well on both. Our manufacturing, operations and customer service teams around the world deserve special recognition for their extraordinary efforts and leadership in support of these two key pandemic priorities. Their dedication and commitment to keeping themselves and their colleagues safe while continuing to deliver excellent service to our customers was truly inspiring and there is no question that we differentiate ourselves with many of our key customers, as a result of our ability to sustain our normal rock-solid quality and delivery performance throughout 2020 as a result of their efforts. We also did our best to take full advantage of ITW's position of strength as we've thought through, how we should manage the company through the pandemic. Back in the spring, as we analyzed and stress-tested the Company's performance across a wide range of scenarios, it became clear that the financial and competitive strengths that we had built up over the past eight years have resulted in a very strong and very resilient company. And as a result, we didn't have to just pull out our old recession playbook and hunker down. And for ITW, this was a unique opportunity to react smartly and to stay focused on the long-term. This conclusion led to two key decisions that we made regarding how we're going to manage ITW through the pandemic crisis. First, we chose to leverage the strong financial foundation that we've built over the last eight years to reinforce our commitment to our people. First, by providing full compensation and benefits support to all ITW colleagues through the entirety of Q2 when the economic effects of the pandemic were at their most widespread and severe. And by deciding that we would not initiate any enterprise-wide employment reduction mandates or programs at any point in 2020. These were not obvious or easy decisions given the unprecedented and uncertain circumstances but we believe that they were the right decisions for our company. And I know that our people will remember them. These decisions also turned out to be the right ones for us operationally, given the pace of demand recovery that we saw beginning in Q3. Second, we chose to leverage our position of strength by implementing our Win the Recovery agenda and mindset across the Company. Win the Recovery was not an opportunistic new strategy. What it was and is a commitment to staying the course and continuing to prioritize the execution of our long-term enterprise strategy despite the unique and unprecedented challenges brought about by the global pandemic. Win the Recovery for us did not mean ignore the pandemic. As across the company, we had to read and react to the realities of the near-term situation as we always do but it does mean that we are committed to protecting key investment supporting the execution of our long-term strategy and that we have from very early on, given our divisional leadership teams to mandate to continue to think long-term and to remain aggressive through the pandemic. For 2021, our Win the Recovery posture and mindset continues on and serves as the central theme driving the 2021operating plans for every one of our 83 divisions. Before I turn the call over to Michael for more detail on our Q4 performance and our 2021 guidance, let me close by thanking all of our ITW colleagues around the world for their exceptional performance and dedication in the face of the most challenging and unprecedented circumstances of the past year. The performance that they delivered in 2020 provides another proof point that ITW as a company that has the enduring competitive advantages, resilience and agility necessary to deliver consistent top tier performance in any environment. Like many of you, I'm sure we are hopeful for a return to somewhere in the vicinity of normal at some point in 2021 and with that getting back to giving our full attention to taking ITW all the way for the company's full potential. Between now and whenever that is, we will continue to leverage the full breadth of ITW's capabilities and competitive advantages to keep our people safe, continue to serve our customers with excellence and execute our long-term enterprise strategy. Michael, over to you. Michael Larsen : Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 4. In the fourth quarter, we continue to see solid recovery progress in many of the end markets that we serve as evidenced by our revenue being up sequentially 5% versus the third quarter. The increase is 8% when you adjust for equal number of days when historically our revenue per day has increased by 1% from Q3 to Q4. Overall, we delivered revenue of $3.5 billion, operating income of $883 million, an increase of 7% year-over-year, operating margin of 24.4%, free cash flow of $705 million, and GAAP EPS of $2.02. After-tax return on invested capital improved to 32%. And as Scott mentioned, operating income, operating margin and after-tax ROIC were fourth quarter records for the company. Revenue in all major geographies improved sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, North America organic revenue declined 3%, International revenue grew 1%, Europe was down 2%. Similar to Q3, China was the bright spot with 11% growth. As we've talked about before, the operating flexibility that is core to our 80/20 Front-to-Back operating system also applies to the cost structure, which was on full display through our operating margin performance in Q4. We improved operating margin by 170 basis points to 25.4%, the second-highest margin rate in a quarter in the history of the company. And like I say, grew operating income 7% to $883 million, the highest fourth quarter ever. The biggest driver of our margin improvement remains our enterprise initiatives, as the ITW team executed on projects and activities that contributed 130 basis points in Q4. The impact was broad-based with all segments delivering enterprise initiatives benefits in the range of 80 to 170 basis points. GAAP EPS was $2.02, up 2%, but keep in mind, the Q4 last year had $0.11of one-time gains from divestitures. If you exclude those gains, EPS was up 7%, the same as operating income. Working capital performance was excellent and free cash flow of $705 million was solid with a conversion rate of 110% of net income. Finally, the effective tax rate was 22.1%, down slightly from last year. In summary, a strong finish to a challenging year and very good momentum as we head into 2021. Let's move to Slide 5 to review fourth quarter's recovery and response by segment. We updated this slide from our last earnings call with Q4 information and you can see that our segments continue to respond effectively to the increase in demand recovery and improved sequentially on both revenue and operating margin. I would just highlight a few things to illustrate the resilience and adaptability of our businesses. You can see the rapid recovery in our end markets, relative to the Q2 bottom, but down 27%. In Q4, three of our segments experienced demand levels that were higher than a year ago. The most pronounced recovery has been in automotive OEM, which is more than doubled since Q2 and grew 8% year-over-year in Q4, as did construction products. Polymers and Fluids grew 7% while demand in three segments, Test & Measurement and electronics, welding and specialty products was only slightly lower year-over-year. As you would expect food equipment continues to be impacted by the effects of the pandemic, although we are seeing some sequential improvement. Overall, you can see the benefit of having a high quality diversified portfolio and the fact that we're back to demand levels of a year ago with total revenue essentially flat year-over-year despite one of our core segments being down organically by 19%. On the right side of the page, you can see the operating flexibility that I just talked about and how to also apply to our cost structure and ultimately shows up in our operating margin performance. At the bottom, in Q2, we still delivered solid operating margins of 17.5% and only two segments were below 20%. In Q4, were almost 800 basis points higher at 25.4% despite no volume growth year-over-year and every segment is back about 22% including Food Equipment and six out of seven segments achieved record fourth quarter operating margins. Let's move on to Slide 6 for a closer look at individual segment performance, starting with automotive OEM. The team has continued to execute exceptionally well from a quality and delivery standpoint in responding to customer demand levels that have more than doubled since Q2. In Q4, organic growth of 8% year-over-year was the highest growth rate since the first quarter of 2017. While North America was flat in Q2, it was more than offset by strong demand in Europe, which grew 10% and China, which grew 20%. As expected, food equipment end markets remained challenged in Q4, organic revenue was down 19%, a little better than the third quarter, and demand in Q4 was similar to Q3 when you look at it by geography and the end markets. North America was down 20%, international down 18%, equipment sales were down 20% and service was down 18%. Institutional demand was down about 30% with restaurants down a little bit more than that. And not surprisingly, the bright spot throughout the year, continue to be retail with organic growth of 8%. Moving to Slide 7 for Test & Measurement and Electronics. Q4 organic revenue declined 3% with Test & Measurement down 8% against the tough comparison of plus 6% in Q4 '19. Electronics was up 3% and while demand for capital equipment remains sluggish, the segment benefited from considerable strength in several end-markets, including semiconductor, healthcare and clean room. As you may have seen on January 19, we announced that we had entered into an agreement with Amphenol to acquire MTS's Test & Simulation Business. The Test & Simulation Business is very complementary to our Instron business, which we highlighted during our 2018 Investor Day and some of you may have visited our facility outside of Boston. MTS's Test & Simulation business has similar organic growth potential and there is substantial opportunity for margin improvement through the application of the ITW business model. Pre-COVID revenues in fiscal year 2019 were $559 million with operating margin of 6%. We expect to get the business to generate ITW caliber operating margins by the end of year five and generate after-tax ROIC in the high teens by the end of year 10. As you saw in the announcement, we expect the acquisition to close in the middle of 2021 and we're very much looking forward to welcoming the MTS Test & Simulation team to the ITW family. Moving on, please turn to Slide 8. In welding, where we saw a meaningful pickup in demand as organic revenue improved from being down 10% year-over-year in Q3 to only being down 2% in Q4. Our commercial business which primarily serves smaller businesses and individual users and accounts for 35% of the revenue in this segment remained strong and grew 12% year-over-year. Our Industrial business showed signs of strong recovery from being down 23% in Q3 to down only 5% in Q4 as customer activity and equipment orders gained strength. Overall organic revenue food equipment was flat versus prior year and much improved versus a 10% decline in the third quarter. Polymers & Fluids delivered strong organic growth of 7% with fluids up 16% with continued strong demand in end-markets related to healthcare and hygiene. The automotive aftermarket business benefited from strong retail sales with organic growth of 5% and polymers grew 4% with solid demand for MRO and automotive applications. Moving to Slide 9. Construction continues to benefit from strong demand in the home center channel and delivered organic growth of 8% in Q4. Growth was strong across all geographies with North America up 10%, double-digit growth in the residential renovation market offset by commercial construction, which represents only about 15% of North America revenue down 11%. Europe grew 9% and Australia/New Zealand grew 5% due to strong retail sales. Specialty organic revenue was down 3% this quarter with North America down 2% and international revenue down 4%. Demand for consumer packaging remains solid, but it was offset by lower demand in the capital equipment businesses. So that concludes the segment commentary and let's move on to the full year 2020 summer results in Slide 10. And in the face of unprecedented challenges that included temporary customer shutdowns across wide swaths of our end markets during the year, organic revenue was down 10%. Still we delivered operating income of $2.9 billion and highly resilient operating margin of 22.9%, only down 120 basis points year-over-year despite no major cost takeout initiatives on mandates, and with the strong contribution of 120 basis points from our Enterprise Initiatives. After-tax ROIC was 26.2% and free cash flow was $2.6 billion. Throughout the pandemic, one of our priorities was to maintain our financial strength, liquidity, and strategic optionality, and as you can see, we did just that in 2020. ITW's balance sheet is strong and we have ample liquidity. We did not have a need to issue any debt or commercial paper in 2020 and we ended the year with total debt to EBITDA leverage of 2.5 times, which is only slightly above our 2.25 times target. At year-end, we had approximately $2.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents on hand. With 2020 behind us, let's move to Slide 11 for a discussion of our guidance for 2021. So starting with the caveat that we continue to operate in a fairly uncertain economic environment, we have based our guidance as we always do on the current levels of demand in our businesses. Per our usual process, we are projecting current levels of demand into the future and adjusting them for typical seasonality. The outcome of that exercise is a forecast of solid broad-based organic growth of 7% to 10% at the enterprise level. Foreign currency at today's exchange rates is favorable and has 2 percentage points revenue for total revenue growth forecast of 9% to 12%. At our typical incremental margins of 35% to 40%, we expect GAAP EPS in the range of $7.60 to $8 a share, up 18% at the midpoint. We're forecasting operating margin in the range of 24% to 25%, which is an improvement of more than 150 basis points year-over-year at the midpoint. Enterprise Initiatives are a key driver of operating margin expansion in 2021, as are expected to contribute approximately 100 basis points. Restructuring and price costs are expected to be approximately margin neutral year-over-year. We're closely monitoring the raw material cost environment and embedded in our 2021 guidance are the known raw material cost increases in commodities such as steel, resins and chemicals. Given the differentiated nature of our product offerings across the company, we expect to be able to offset the impact of any incremental raw material cost increases that might arise in 2021 with pricing actions on a dollar for dollar basis. We expect strong free cash flow in 2021 with a conversion rate greater than 100% of net income. I wanted to provide a brief update on our capital allocation plans for 2021. Top priority remains internal investments to support our organic growth efforts and sustain our core businesses. Second, we recognize the importance of an attractive dividend to our long-term shareholders and we view the dividend as a critical component of ITW's total shareholder return model. Third priority, our selective high-quality acquisitions to supplement our portfolio and reinforce or further enhance ITW's long-term organic growth potential. I should point out that the guidance we're providing today is for the core business only. After the MTS Test & Simulation acquisition closes, we'll provide you with an update, but we do not expect a material impact in 2021. In line with our capital allocation, we returned surplus capital to shareholders and we are reinstating share repurchases with a plan to invest approximately $1 billion in 2021. We expect our tax rate for the year to be in the range of 23% to 24%. Finally, when it comes to portfolio management, we have decided to defer any divestiture activity until next year. And instead, focus on our time and efforts on the recovery in 2021. While our view regarding the long-term strategic fit of the remaining divestitures hasn't changed, we also believe that given their expected performance this year, they will be more valuable in 2022. Let's turn to Slide 12 and the forecast for organic growth by segment. With the caveat again and the environment remains fairly uncertain, we are providing an organic growth outlook for each segment and based on current levels of demand, we are forecasting solid broad-based growth as every segment is expected to improve their organic growth rate in 2021. At the enterprise level, it all adds up to solid organic growth of 7% to 10%. To wrap it all up, ITW finished a challenging year strong, as we continue to fully leverage the capabilities and competitive advantages that we've built over the past eight years through the execution of our enterprise strategy. Our strong operational and financial performance in 2020 provided further evidence that ITW is a company that has both the enduring competitive advantages and resilience necessary to deliver consistent upper-tier performance in any environment. Looking ahead to 2021, we have good momentum from Q4 heading into the year and our solid guidance reflects the fact that we remain focused on delivering strong results while continuing to execute on our long-term strategy to achieve and sustain ITW's full potential performance. With that Karen, I'll turn it back to you. Karen Fletcher : Okay. Thank you, Michael. And Julianne, let's open up the lines for questions, please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citi. Please go ahead, your line is open. Andrew Kaplowitz : Good execution as usual. So it's been a couple of years now since your last Analyst Day, so maybe you could update us and you are in terms of the goal of finishing the job related to enterprise strategy. It seems like your performance in the second half of '20 and the 7% to 10% growth guidance you've got for '21 is reflecting full organic growth potential versus your end markets. But maybe give us some color around that and how you're thinking about enterprise strategy coming out of the pandemic? Do you still see 100 basis points of margin improvement per year through at least 2023? Scott Santi : Well, I'd say a couple of things, Andy. First of all, this has been a process throughout the entire journey where the sort of further we go with that, the more opportunity we find to continue to improve. And I think one of the remarkable things from our perspective is eight years into this, I don't see that slowing up any. And so we are focused on continuing to move forward to get better every year, get a little bit better this year than we were last year. Within the framework of this, the strategy that we've laid out and I think there remains ample room to continue on that path for a number of years. We also have some performance goals out there. You're right, it's been a couple of years, but two years ago, it's when we update those goals, and we remain absolutely on track and committed to delivering on those goals. And as we get closer to that, we'll figure out what the next step is - steps are. Andrew Kaplowitz : Thanks for that, Scott. And then is it right to think that generally, you should see more margin improvement from the segment with the largest growth projections for '21? And could you give us, I know you talked, Michael, I know you talked about price versus cost, you sometimes have sort of these lags in some of the segments like auto OEM, do we get concerned about that at all? And any other color on [prices cost] [ph] you could give us? Michael Larsen : Well, I'd say, Andy, we - based on our bottoms-up planning process, we expect every segment to improve on their margin performance in 2021, as Scott said, a little bit better every year as we march towards our full potential. I think one of the remarkable things, when you look at the margin performance by segment is how the range has narrowed and we're - as we sit here today, the low-end is food equipment at 22% and the high-end is welding at 29%, very different range from when we started this strategy eight years ago. And I think the fact that we have businesses, delivery margins in the high 20s just gives us further confidence in the long-term goals that we've laid out for the company. So the big driver in 2021 remains Enterprise Initiatives. Those are broad-based in every segment will make progress on 80/20 and Strategic Sourcing, and certainly, we expect that also a meaningful contribution from volume leverage as we go through the year here. But I wouldn't single any segment out as having more margin improvement potential than others. I think we expect all of our segments to continue to make progress towards their full potential. Andrew Kaplowitz : Appreciate it, guys. Michael Larsen : Yes, Andy, and I can give you a little bit on price costs. So certainly, like I said, we are closely monitoring the raw material cost environment, we are seeing inflationary pressures in commodities such as steel, resins, certain chemicals, by segments, automotive, construction, and polymers and fluids is probably where we're seeing the more significant increases. In all of our segments, the plan is to offset those cost increases, the ones that we know about and the ones that may arise this year with price on a dollar for dollar basis. As you know, in automotive, just given the nature of the industry that is a process that takes a little bit longer, but we're confident that over time, we're going to be able to offset any raw material cost increases with price, just given the differentiated nature of our product offerings in each one of these segments, so. Operator : Your next question comes from Nicole DeBlase from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, your line is open. Nicole DeBlase : Can we just start with the outlook for auto OEM? When you think about the 14% to 18% that you forecasted for 2021, how does that look in the context of some of these semiconductor supply chain issues that we're seeing? And I guess are some of those hiccups embedded in your outlook? And with that said, if you could talk maybe a little bit about the potential quarterly cadence for the auto business, I know you guys don't give quarterly guidance, but in this case, it could be kind of a weird year. Michael Larsen : Yes. So thank you, Nicole. I... Scott Santi : I can tell you one thing on the quarterly cadence that Q2 is going to be a lot better this year than with last year. That's the one thing I know for sure. I agree with that. Michael Larsen : So just on the - there's a lot of talk about the shortage of semiconductor in the automotive OEM space. What I can tell you is, and this is true across all of our businesses, we've not seen a slowdown in demand and strong momentum going into the year, certainly carried through January. It is possible, though, that we may see some production slowdown here in Q1 at some of our customers, whether that will impact the demand, their demand for our products, I think remains to be seen. We view this right now as more of a timing issue and so certainly, this could put a little bit of pressure on the auto business here in the first quarter. But as we sit here today, we would assume that we're going to catch that up in Q2 or the second half of the year. In terms of the quarterly cadence for the auto business. I think you saw the strong performance here in the fourth quarter, up 8%. Like I said, we've not seen anything to suggest that that demand is slowing down while we're looking at the January results. So we expect, given how we've planned the business to be off to a pretty good start with positive organic growth and margin improvement in the first quarter that typically sequentially that builds as we go through the year. Q2 will be, as Scott said, the biggest quarter and the second half, the comps start to get a little bit more challenging, the build numbers are a little bit different but that's probably as much as I can give you on the automotive business and kind of how this might play out by quarter. Nicole DeBlase : No, thanks. That was actually super helpful. Maybe just as a quick follow-up, when you think about the guidance that you put together for just the full company organic growth in 2021, thinking back to last year when you guys were really talking about opportunities to outgrow as we move into recovery mode, have you factored in some of that margin improvement into - sorry, market and market share improvement over peers into the 2021 guidance? Scott Santi : Well, I - the only way that it's - that's factored in at this point is, it's embedded in the impact of those efforts have already made in our current run rates. So we are not baking in any further acceleration, it doesn't mean that we don't have a lot of intention around continuing to as we've talked about before, be aggressive as the recovery continues to accelerate, but from the standpoint of our normal planning practice, we are - what's embedded in our organic growth forecast is exactly what Michael said earlier, the current run rates - daily run rates projected through full-year 2021 with whatever the normal sort of seasonal impacts are quarter-by-quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Please go ahead, your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Two questions. One, kind of following up on that last thread, fully understand your methodologies here kind of this rolling forward current trajectory. But when you look at the segments, are there one or two kind of either way positive or negative that, I know your astute business sense and long history with these businesses would suggest are likely to be potentially better or worse than kind of the exit rate here as we exit 2020? Michael Larsen A - Michael Larsen : Well, I'm trying to think about that question. The obvious one to point to is food equipment that depending on sort of pace of vaccine penetration and recovery. That's obviously, where even at that 8% to 12% growth rate for the year, we're well below 2019 levels of demand let alone incremental growth opportunities we have. So that from the standpoint of the one with the most outside leverage that's clearly the case. I don't know that there is anything else that I would say would really stand out, I think the capital equipment business, as you would expect, so welding and test and measurement, that as businesses get more comfortable with both the pace and trajectory and sustainability of the recovery that their comfort level with investment would - and our confidence in the future would certainly stimulate more, perhaps more demand in those sectors, maybe as I think about your question, but I think that would be the two areas that, should things continue on in the positive direction, they are the significant benefit from continued broad-based - the broad-based momentum that we're seeing. Jeff Sprague : And also thinking about kind of cyclical versus structural growth, Scott. Right. So the effort to kind of pivot the businesses, the whole ready to grow, but not growing, and the ones that we're outgrowing, do you think there will be measurable outgrowth across most of the portfolio? So like you said, we don't know quite what the world is going to hand us in 2021, but I just wonder your confidence and visibility on our growth, you mentioned new products and food equipment for example, I'm sure there are things in other segments. Maybe you could just provide a little additional color there. Scott Santi : Yes, I think that's where the proof is got to be in the project and that's what we've been working on. And so I, certainly in 2020 and '21, I think to try to get any sense of sort of what the market baselines are given the - just the overall volatility in all the, let's say the corresponding supply chain impacts on demand and inventory levels and all that stuff, it's really, it's almost possible to tell, but I would absolutely expect that our ability to stay focused and aggressive on the growth agenda through all of this, I won't say a better payoff but I'd say it's payoff is what we're all about. That's what we've been doing all this stuff for. So I won't tell you that every one of our 83 divisions are all the way there, but I guarantee you that I can say that 90% of them are in great position, are doing all the right things, have stayed focused and have stayed aggressive through this, we're not in that, we're not using the ready to grow and not growing categories anymore. I'll put it that way. It's - I think we're well past that point. Operator : Your next question comes from Ann Duignan from JPMorgan. Please go ahead, your line is open. Ann Duignan : Maybe you could talk a little bit about your outlook for construction products that might have expected organic growth to have been up a little bit more in 2021 but perhaps it's just on the back of strong renovation in 2020, but just some color there in terms of regional and sub-sectors, that would be helpful. Scott Santi : That's exactly what I told our EVP, Ann. Just so you know. So what I'd tell you, Ann is that obviously, a strong year for the construction business and finishing Q4, up 8% on a year-over-year basis, a lot of strength in the home centers that we've talked about really since the beginning of the pandemic, and we expect that to be just given the comps that the growth in the home centers would be in the low single-digits. We - there are some encouraging signs around housing starts. And then we have a great portfolio of highly differentiated products. So you put all of that together, I think our view is we should be able to grow in the mid to high single-digits here in 2021. And as I said, we're off to a good start here in January, so. Ann Duignan : And any differentiation regionally that you'd like to comment on? Michael Larsen : No, I think it's pretty - I think the comps are a little bit easier in Europe, maybe in North America but we, really on a global basis, we had a good year. But, so that's really all that I would point to. Ann Duignan : Okay. And then as my follow-up perhaps, similar question on welding, just different customer bases and maybe different regions, what you\u2019re seeing - I will hand it over. Michael Larsen : Yes. So I think welding, strong finish to the year good momentum going into 2021 and I'd say a pretty solid outlook for all end markets, maybe with the exception of the oil and gas piece, which is somewhere in the 15% to 20%, it's probably closer to 15% of total revenues that is expected to remain soft as we go through the year. But the commercial business has been strong all year and no signs of that slowing down the industrial side. So this is what Scott talked about with CapEx may be picking up as this recovery path is a little clearer. We're expecting a solid year in the welding business with again continued progress on the margin side, despite the fact that they put up almost 29% here in the fourth quarter. Operator : And your next question comes from John Inch from Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead, your line is open. John Inch : Picking up on a couple of the themes of the past few questions. Do any of the businesses, Scott and Michael, stand out based on call it internal changes, they may have pursued in 2020 that position them in your minds really favorably for 2021 and this could be everything from, I don't know, like acceleration of enterprise initiatives, new products line up that they've got ready to kind of tee up here, maybe new customer sort of supply line or existing new customer channel initiatives or anything like that that you might call out? Scott Santi : Yes, I can't really think of anything, particularly given the environment we're in, other than point to what we've been talking about throughout, which is we stayed focused on implementing those, the relevant changes, strategic changes business by business along the lines of what you're talking about throughout this entire - throughout the entirety of 2020. So I think if anything, the most significant part of what we accomplished in '20 is we stayed ready, we stayed prepared, we stayed in position and we kept moving the ball. And so I don't know that there is any big shifts that I can point to as much as the fact that we stayed in there and kept moving forward while dealing with the pretty unusual set of near-term circumstances and I expect that that will pay significant dividends, particularly if the rate of recovery continues on as we're seeing right now. John Inch : Well, Scott, how significant as we think in the next couple of years in recovery, are new products or the introduction of new products going to play in terms of the drive to faster growth? Like was this an opportunity? I mean we don't have a view inside the company, right? So, was this an opportunity for yes to do realignment cost-cutting and so forth up to the centralized level, but for the folks to basically say, you know what, let's push on this initiative for that initiative or launch that as part of kind of your overall emphasis to take share which was stated kind of going on? Scott Santi : Yes, relative. New products are core - it's a core I want to - of our business model, customer back innovation we have been - there has been no change in terms of the central nature of that as our strategy. We're banging out a couple of thousand patents a year. Year in, year out, that certainly continued on in 2020 as it always has. So I don't know that there has been any inflection or change in terms of our posture there. It is, in my view, it's the only way we outgrow our markets over the long haul. We're going to get some penetration from our service capabilities from our ability to attract new customers, but in the end, innovation, new products, new technologies, or existing products is the key and core driver ultimately of our, I believe they outgrow our markets consistently over time. That's not a new concept here. Michael Larsen : And I would just add financially speaking, John, our internal investments, new product, our top priority from a capital allocation standpoint, then if you look at our new product investment in 2020, it was the same number as in 2019 as we stayed invested in these projects and strategies to drive above market organic growth. Historically, we've achieved about a percentage point of organic growth every year for new products and that's kind of we're counting on in every segment as we move forward. John Inch : Makes sense. If I could just sneak in one more. You return to M&A, the two obvious challenging verticals have been commercial aerospace, and oil and gas. Are there, like - are you guys perhaps thinking you guys are contrarian thinkers? Are these possibly going to present opportunities for M&A? Like would you consider an aerospace deal? And in terms of oil and gas, would that be off-limits just because of ESG considerations, which you obviously don't have today? Scott Santi : Yes. I just go back to our, basically two criteria. One is that we - It has to - we have to - if we're going to make that kind of an investment in terms of not just to our capital, but our time, effort and energy, it has to be in something that we have a lot of conviction about that can support or further accelerate the company's long-term growth potential. And we have to also have significant potential for margin improvement from 80/20. If you look at MTS and that absolutely checks both of those boxes. So I don't - we don't have anything that in my view as off-limits, if those criteria are met and I'll just leave it at that. I am not good at that, but I will also say, as more we\u2019re leaning in super harder on one particular sector or another. I think as we've talked about before, we have demonstrated ability to perform and execute across seven businesses today. So ultimately, it's much more a function of the individual characteristics of the asset that we're talking about than it is any sort of outside-in view of, we want to - we need to get growth year or play for a certain theory about long-term end-market growth. Operator : Your next question comes from Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, your line is open. Jamie Cook : I guess just two follow-ups. One, I know you talked about sort of supply chain and as it relates to the automotive sector. I guess one, do you have anything in your guidance embedded for supply chain, potentially higher freight costs or whatever that's - you're managing for? And I guess my second question, when you first laid out your strategy in 2020 to go after market share during COVID, you talked about potentially your competitors having issue, there is demand, ramps or even managing through the downturn. Can you talk about whether some of the supply chain issues are impacting your competitors and whether it's sort of in line with what you thought greater than what you would thought? I'm just trying to size that potential opportunity. Thank you. Michael Larsen : Yes, so, Jamie, on your first question, we are seeing an increase in freight cost. It is not one of the largest, categories when we look at where we're seeing cost pressure, but it is any known increases in terms of freight and logistics are embedded in our plan, in our guidance here today. I think in terms of market share, as a result of being able to maintain delivery and quality, if we were to talk to our segments, they would all be able to come up with lots of examples from their divisions where that is the case. And it's not just in one segment, it's really across the Board. We've been able to pick up share now. So I would just say, we're not doing this with the short-term focus that these have to be sustainable market share gains and they have to be at ITW caliber margins for us to be interested in pursuing them. So it's probably the best answer I can give you on that one. Operator : Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead, your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Maybe my first question really for Michael around the free cash flow outlook. CapEx was down substantially, I think almost 30% in 2020. What slope of recovery do we see there? And how much of a working capital headwind should we expect as well? I suppose the end-point here is to try and understand relative to that $2.6 billion of free cash last year, what the delta is this year in the context of the earnings guidance? Michael Larsen : Yes so, Julian. You're right. Some of the capacity expansions that were planned for 2020 were obviously pushed out as a result of the global pandemic, not as a result of anybody at corporate saying you can't invest in your business. This was really our divisions deciding to defer these capacity expansions and as the recovery progresses, those - that CapEx spend will return to normal levels, which is the assumption that's embedded for 2021. We also had in our free cash flow forecast and assumption that we will build up some degree of inventory receivables, working capital to support almost double-digit growth across the enterprise. So we have about $125 million of working capital coming in and that is included in our numbers here and you put it all together, we expect to deliver another strong year from a cash flow perspective at 100% plus conversion from net income. Julian Mitchell : And then maybe my follow-up on the uses of that good cash flow and the big cash balance at the end of December, maybe for Scott. I think Scott you've sounded somewhat reticent on M&A at the last earnings call. And then, today we see that buyback placeholder and heard Michael's comments around deferring divestments into 2022. So just wondered what your latest thoughts were on the M&A appetite if you are more or less optimistic on acquisitions today versus a few months ago. Scott Santi : Yes. What we talked about last call was really around the fact that what we're interested in is quality assets that we can help good companies, so we can help become even better companies and the fact is that during times of maybe disruption that those good companies if we got inside of [indiscernible] time for them to sell their businesses. So the reticence was not from a financial perspective, it was just a statement of reality that the kind of assets that we are interested in acquiring are not available. We - our interest in adding quality assets to ITW that fit our strategy and that meet the criteria that I talked about that was in my response to an earlier question. That doesn't go up and down, that is always there. We have plenty of capacity whether we have cash on hand, whether we have - we need to use the balance sheet, that's just a timing issue. Yeah, we have so much cash. We have the ability to improve these assets we buy, we generate great returns, it's just a matter of the - we're also very disciplined. So we find - we come across an opportunity that we think fits, it's not a situation on what - is it the right time or not, it's at the ample capacity to do it. So we're going to just low our standards because we have been sitting on some cash right now. I think that's the best way I can characterize it. MTS is a compelling hit, it has characteristics that are very similar to our Instron business that we bought back in 2005, entry margins are roughly the same, I think it's around to a couple of points higher, similar end market characteristics, it's a terrific fit that it wouldn't matter what time - what year - where we were in the cycle or what time of year it was, we have another MTS like opportunity, we will take full advantage, do our best to take full advantage of it and that's the best way I can I think say. Michael Larsen : And maybe I'll just clarify something, Julian. I mean I think given our track record here as we just talked about in terms of consistently generating strong free cash flow given the strong balance sheet, I don't want you to interpret the fact that the buybacks are coming back, as we don't have capacity to do M&A, because that is certainly not the case. I mean we have ample liquidity as Scott said if the right opportunity comes along, we're going to be certainly looking closely at things. So I wouldn't read anything into buybacks coming back. We are in the fortunate position where - when I talked about the four priorities from a capital allocation standpoint, for us, it's not A, B, C or D, it's really, we can do all of the above. We have the capacity, the financial strength, the balance sheet to do all of the above. Operator : Your next question comes from David Raso from Evercore. Please go ahead, your line is open. David Raso : You mentioned on normalized cost, you'd match the higher cost dollar for dollar, just obviously price, people and cost is not helpful to the margin. So when I think at the full-year guide, the revenue guide, the organic is to 8.5. How much of that is actually coming through with your margin, meaning what percent of the 8.5 prices is simply priced being naked at by cost? Scott Santi : Well, so we don't really look at it that way, David. So let me try to answer your question, maybe a little bit differently. So I think what I heard you say is we will offset any material cost increases with price on a dollar for dollar basis. Michael Larsen : And then I think add a clarification. That means an incremental from here. That doesn't mean necessarily in our plan. Scott Santi : Correct. Yes. Scott Santi : That's what we have. That's where you're going with. Scott Santi : So that's where I was going. So any incremental cost increases that we may see as we go through the year will be offset with price dollar for dollar. Obviously... Michael Larsen : And that really reflects the timing front? Scott Santi : Yes. Michael Larsen : That's the problem with delay. Scott Santi : In the long term, we will. Yeah. We will catch up and we typically get more than that. I think what you're talking about is that in the - if that does mean if you do the math, which I'm sure you've done that can be slightly dilutive to operating margins as we go through the year, but that's not what's in our planning today and our plan today is we are positive price ahead of cost and any cost increases that are coming through will be offset dollar for dollar, that can be a slight lag. We talked a lot about some of the challenges in automotive, so that's probably the best I can answer your question. David Raso : Now just well, the incrementals are still impressive at 40% and I was just - that's in the guide and I was just curious, are they even higher than that in a way or in a core fashion? Because say 2% of the revenue growth was coming in it at no incremental rate coming at a price versus cost. But overall you're saying add it all up, we're still getting 40% incrementals, if cost go up from here, yes, that might be a bit dilutive on the margin. Just given there might be just pricing cost. That's all I was trying to get at. I mean the 40% is still very. Just trying to get - underlying. Scott Santi : That's correct, yeah. David Raso : And when it comes to the M&A pipeline, I mean, obviously, all the facts that are out there and the money in Washington private equity, the MTS business that you bought, somewhat you found something that fits well obviously the margins aren't tremendous but, I think you've probably got it at one time or less, the sales, are you finding with all the facts out there and so forth that you can still find businesses like this that are maybe a little off the radar or it's just going to be a little more challenging to put the money to work. Just give them maybe people are bidding up assets otherwise want to just give in. Scott Santi : Yes, I think it's not a matter of finding things that are off the radar. The ultimate advantage we have even in a competitive market is the margin improvement potential, so that our ability to pay whatever the multiple is, there are certainly our financial modeling. I'm not suggesting we can pay any multiple but certainly, our ability to pay market multiple and then triple or quadruple the underlying earnings and knowing that we can do that with a high degree of certainty over some period of time is ultimately what allows us to be competitive. So that's, why we've said all along is we're not going to pay for a full - buying or acquiring a fully margin business is not interesting for us because it takes that competitive advantage off the table and from a return standpoint, it makes it all about where you right about the growth rate, 10 years out, which is a pretty challenging thing to get right. So we can compete in the right circumstance and we just proved it. I think. David Raso : I'm sorry. Please. Scott Santi : No, you go ahead, please. David Raso : Well, just seeing for MTS, and I know it's kind of a framework for hopefully future deals you can do, when you think some amortization of the intangibles that are coming in that 6% margin of MTS with a 19. So we think the margin might have been down in '20, what's the level set for us when we think of modeling that say from mid-year and on? What's the starting point for all in the margin amortization, the base we're coming off of and then the ramp to the 20% plus over five years? How much is there a step function in the first full year and then it's kind of, linear from that? Scott Santi : So they didn't close on the deal first and they do all your accounting and when - and hopefully that'll be mid-year. And so when we get on the earnings call, hopefully for Q2 will be able to give you a lot more detail in terms of the questions that you're asking. Our current view based on what we are - what we have modeled is that there is not going to be a material impact in year one, and then the implementation of the business model takes some time. We didn't buy the business obviously for the potential year one. This is a long-term investment and one we are very pleased with and we see a clear path to get it to ITW caliber margins and returns over the timeframe that we discussed. So, but if you could wait until we get the deal closed and we'll provide all the detail here. Michael Larsen : I'll help you with this part, if you want me, which is just figure the margin is steady sequential improvement year-on-year, just like we run the company. There is no big step change. And so the path from 6% or whatever the starting point is to the ITW average is side by side. It\u2019s just a better model than some hockey stick in the early period, if that helps. Operator : Your next question comes from Stephen Volkmann from Jefferies. Please go ahead, your line is open. Stephen Volkmann : Great, thanks for fitting me in. I'll be real quick, Scott, if you gave us a couple of quarters ago a number that you thought you had won some new contracts because of your win with downturns kind of strategy. Any update to that kind of for the full-year 2020? Scott Santi : Yes, I'll go back to what Michael said that at that point we can count on because that was we've just started, we are a couple of weeks into and there were some obviously visible specific opportunities that we were aware of, at this point, it's far too broad base, it's not something that we're sort of tracking across the company necessarily. Stephen Volkmann : Okay, all right, fair enough. And then... Scott Santi : Nor should we given the volume, yeah. Stephen Volkmann : Understood. And then Mike, I think you said PLS is 50 basis points of headwind in '21, isn't that kind of what we should consider sort of normal and the run rate for the foreseeable future? Michael Larsen : Yes. I think like I would look at this, it has still potential, we had modeled 30 basis points as kind of the ongoing run rate, so you're pretty close here. Stephen Volkmann : Okay, that's all I have. Scott Santi : You're right. We modeled 50 here for 2021. That's correct. Operator : Your next question comes from Ross Gilardi from Bank of America. Please go ahead, your line is open. Ross Gilardi : Thanks for squeezing me in. Just on the EPS guide, I wanted to clarify why wouldn't the low end be $8 plus when you just turned over $2 in the fourth quarter, you're guiding to $9 to $12 revenue growth. There isn't a lot of seasonality in your business in a normal year. So why wouldn't $2 at a minimum being like an appropriate quarterly run rate? For EPS in the first half and if that's the case, are you taking in a meaningful second-half slowdown? I mean any help you can give us on how your guidance is - looks first half versus second half? Scott Santi : Yes, so Ross, let me say, first I hope you're right. And second, I'll just go back to what I said in the prepared remarks, in response to one of the questions earlier is that how we have modeled the topline is really using current levels of demand in our - in what we're seeing in our businesses. We're projecting that into the year. If you go and look at kind of historically how a typical year unfolds at ITW in terms of the earnings in the first half versus the second half. It is remarkably consistent. So I think that's probably a good start to help you maybe understand a little bit better, how the things might unfold kind of first half, second half, but to be very clear, again, we are not taking into any of our guidance that demand is going to slow in the second half, we're also not taking in that demand is going to accelerate. So to the extent you have a more positive view in some of the segments, you can certainly model that and see what answer you get, but we are assuming that, like I said, the demand stays, revenue per day stays where it is, adjusted for seasonality projected into 2021. Ross Gilardi : Which is on that, Mike. I mean, if you're saying you're just taking current demand, I mean it just gives us current $2 in the fourth quarter. Michael Larsen : Yes, but you have to look at maybe, Ross we'll take this one offline and I can walk you through how the historical trends, okay. Ross Gilardi : Okay. Michael Larsen : I'm not sure how else to answer your question. So, and again, I'm not giving you quarterly guidance, we're giving you full year and I think there's enough information if you look at the historical trends to figure out how things might play out in a quarterly basis. Operator : Your last question will come from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is open. Joe Ritchie : Two quick ones from me and I know we'll get more details on MTS later, but just given the PLS is part of the framework and equation for you guys like it hasn't, we think about MTS is like revenue trajectory, will there be some PLFS you think at the beginning? And then growth from there, like how should we think about that? Michael Larsen : Yes. Again, Joe, as I said earlier, we will provide more of the detailed update once the deal has been closed, but you should assume the PLS is a significant component of the overall ITW business model that we will be implementing, so. Scott Santi : And it dampens every first couple of years. Michael Larsen : It happens in the first, the way it's modeled in the first two to three years all the PLS gets done. And then from there are now, you should see the accelerated growth rate with a higher margin profile that we talked about earlier. Joe Ritchie : And then maybe my last question, I might actually going to ask about it because I don't think I've ever asked the question on polymers and fluids on a conference call. But the growth rate has really picked up in the segment in the last couple of quarters, and obviously, you have a good outlook for 2021. Just maybe talk a little bit about how you feel about the - either new product introductions or sustainability about growth rate just given the segment has gone through several years of PLS and then it seems like it's now a turning growth. Michael Larsen : Yes, I think you're right, I mean, we've done a lot of - team's done a lot of PLS over the years, a big focus on organic growth, we continue to see certainly good progress in terms of new products. I talked earlier about on average at the company level, we get a percentage point from customer back innovation, we're actually getting rate that's doubled at in polymers and fluids, so certainly the team has executed well on the organic growth framework and made progress on strategic sales excellence. And I think it certainly helped that some of the end markets were quite favorable in Q4, and the outlook for '21 is pretty good in areas such as health and hygiene. We are seeing a recovery in MRO applications and the retail side related to automotive aftermarket has been solid too, so I will pass on your comments to the polymers and fluids team. Joe Ritchie : Okay, great. Thank you. Scott Santi : I'll be throughout, if they got a question. Karen Fletcher : Okay. I think we are out of time. So I'll just say to everybody, thanks for joining us this morning. And if you have any follow-up, just give me a call. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for participating in today's conference call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] Karen Fletcher, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Karen Fletcher : Thank you, Christie. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to ITW\u2019s First Quarter 2021 Conference Call. I\u2019m joined by our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi; and Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen. During today\u2019s call, we will discuss ITW\u2019s first quarter financial results and update our guidance for full-year 2021. Slide 2 is a reminder that this presentation contains Forward-Looking Statements. We refer you to the Company\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. This presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release. Please turn to Slide 3, and it is now my pleasure to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi. Scott Santi : Thanks, Karen. Good morning, everyone. In Q1, we saw continued improvement in both the breadth and pace of the recovery, with six of our seven segments delivering strong growth in the quarter, with revenue increases at the segment level ranging from 6% to 13%, and that is with one less shipping day in Q1 of this year versus last year. At the enterprise level, organic growth was plus 6% in Q1 or plus 8% on an equal days basis, and that was despite the fact that our Food Equipment segment was still down 10% in the quarter. The fundamental strength of our 80/20 front-to-back business system and the skill and dedication of our people around the world, combined with the Win the Recovery actions that we initiated over the course of the past year allowed us to meet our customers\u2019 increasing needs while at the same time delivering strong profitability leverage, as evidenced by our 19% earnings growth, 45% incremental margins and 120 basis points of margin benefits from our enterprise initiatives in the quarter. Despite rising raw material costs and a tight supply chain environment, we maintained our world-class service levels to our customers while also establishing several all-time Q1 performance records for the company, including earnings per share of $2.11, operating income of $905 million at an operating margin of 25.5%. Based on our first quarter results and our normal practice of projecting current demand rates through the balance of the year, we are adjusting our 2021 guidance. For the full-year, we now expect organic growth of 10% to 12%, operating margin in the range of 25% to 26% and EPS of $8.20 to $8.60 per share, which at the $8.40 midpoint represents 27% earnings growth versus last year. At the midpoint of our revised guidance, 2021 full-year revenues would be up 1% versus 2019 and EPS would be up 9%. Now stating the obvious, there is still a lot of ground to cover between now and the end of the year, and the near-term environment is certainly not without its challenges. That being said, I have no doubt that we are well positioned to respond to whatever comes our way as we move through the remainder of the year and to continue to deliver differentiated performance in 2021 and beyond. And with that, I will turn the call over to Michael to provide more detail on the quarter and our updated guidance. Michael. Michael Larsen : Alright. Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. The solid demand momentum we had coming out of the fourth quarter continued to gain strength across a broad cross-section of our business portfolio in Q1. Our operating teams around the world responded to our customers\u2019 increasing needs, as they always do, and delivered revenue growth of 10%. Organic growth of 6% was the highest organic growth rate for ITW in almost 10-years. And as Scott mentioned, Q1 had one less day this year. And on an equal days basis, organic revenue grew 8%. Organic growth was positive across all major geographies, with China leading the way with 62%, North America was up 4% and Europe grew 1%. Relative to Q4, the new trend that emerged in Q1 was a meaningful pickup in demand in our CapEx-driven equipment businesses, Test & Measurement and Electronics, which grew 11%; and Welding, which grew 6%. GAAP EPS of 2.11 was up 19% and an all-time EPS record for continuing operations. Operating leverage was a real highlight this quarter with incremental margins of 45% as operating income grew 19% year-over-year. Operating margins improved to 25.5% in the quarter, an increase of almost 200 basis points as a result of volume leverage and a continued strong contribution of 120 basis points from our enterprise initiatives, partially offset by the margin impact of price cost. Excluding the third quarter of 2017, which had the benefit of a onetime legal settlement, operating margin of 25.5% was our highest quarterly margin performance ever. As you know, supply chains around the world are under significant pressure, and ITW\u2019s operating teams certainly had to deal with their fair share of supply challenges and disruptions in the quarter. By leveraging our produce where we sell supply chain strategy, our proprietary 80/20 front-to-back business system and supported by the fact that we were fully staffed for this uptick in demand due to our window recovery initiative, we were able to maintain our normal service levels to our customers. And once again, our ability to deal with the impact of some pretty meaningful supply chain challenges and disruptions and still take care of our customers, with strong levels of profitability, speaks to the quality of the execution at ITW. In the quarter, we experienced raw material cost increases, particularly in categories such as steel, resins and chemicals. And across the company, our operating teams have already initiated pricing plans and actions that will offset all incurred as well as known but not yet incurred raw material cost increases on a dollar per dollar basis, as per our usual process. As a result, price cost is expected to be EPS-neutral for the year. As you know, given our high-margin profile, offsetting cost increases with price on a dollar per dollar basis causes some modest dilution of our operating margin percentage and our incremental margin percentage in the near-term. In Q1, for example, our operating margin was impacted 60 basis points due to price costs. And our incremental margin would actually have been 52%, not 45%, if it wasn\u2019t for this impact from price costs. For the balance of the year and embedded in our guidance are all known raw material increases and the corresponding pricing actions that have either already been implemented or will be. Again, EPS-neutral for the full-year. At this early stage in the recovery, our 25.5% operating margins are already exceeding our pre-COVID operating margins. Four of the seven segments delivered operating margin of around 28% or better in Q1, with one segment, welding, above 30% in a quarter for the first time ever. I think it says a lot of our operating teams, that when faced with the challenges of the global pandemic, they stayed focused on our long-term enterprise strategy and continue to make progress towards our long-term margin performance goal of 28% plus. After-tax return on capital was a record 32.1%. And free cash flow was solid at $541 million with a conversion of 81% of net income, in line with typical seasonality for Q1. We continue to expect 100% plus conversion for the full-year. As planned, we repurchased 250 million of our shares this quarter, and the effective tax rate was 22.4%, slightly below prior year. So in summary, the first quarter was solid for ITW with broad-based organic growth of 6%, strong profitability leverage, 19% earnings growth, 45% incremental profitability and record operating margin and EPS performance. So please turn to Slide 4 for the segment performance. And the information on the left side of the page summarizes the organic revenue growth rate versus prior year by segment for Q1 this year compared to Q4 last year. And it illustrates the broad-based demand recovery that we are seeing in our businesses. And obviously, there is a positive impact as the easier comparisons begin on a year-over-year basis. With the exception of Automotive OEM, every segment had a higher organic growth rate in Q1 than they did in Q4, and six of our seven segments delivered strong organic growth in the quarter, with double-digit growth in Construction Products, and Test & Measurement and Electronics, which were also the most improved segments in this sequential view, going from down 3% in Q4 to up 11% in Q1. Welding improved eight percentage points, growing 6% in Q1, providing further evidence that the industrial CapEx recovery is beginning to take hold as visibility and confidence is coming back. At the enterprise level, ITW\u2019s organic growth rate went from down 1% in Q4 to up 6%. And I would just highlight that this is 6% organic growth with one of our segments, Food Equipment, while on its way to recovery is still down 10% year-over-year. As we go through the segment slides, you will see that this robust organic growth, combined with strong enterprise initiative impact, contributed to some pretty strong operating margin performance in our segments. So let\u2019s go into a little more detail for each segment, starting with our Automotive OEM. And the demand recovery in the fourth quarter continued this quarter with organic growth of 8% and total revenue growth of 13%. North America revenue was down 2% as customers continue to adjust their production schedules in response to the well-publicized shortage of certain components, including semiconductor chips. We estimate this impacted our Q1 sales by about $25 million, and it is likely to continue to impact our revenues to the tune of about $50 million in Q2 and another $50 million in the second half of the year. As you can appreciate, the situation is obviously pretty fluid, but as we sit here today, that is our best estimate, and that is also what we embedded in our updated guidance. Looking past the near-term supply chain issues affecting the auto industry, we are pretty optimistic about the medium-term growth prospects as consumer demand remains strong and dealer inventories are very low by historical standards. By region, North America being down in Q1 was more than offset by Europe, which was up 4%, and China up 58%. And finally, the team delivered solid operating margin performance of 24.1%, an improvement of 320 basis points. Please turn to Slide 5 for Food Equipment. So revenue was down 7%, with organic revenue down 10%, but like I said, much improved versus Q4. And there are solid signs that demand is beginning to recover, as evidenced by orders picking up and a backlog that is up significantly versus prior year. Overall, North America was down 6%, with equipment down only 1% as compared to a 22% decline in Q4. Institutional, which represents about 35% of our North American equipment business was down 7%, with healthcare about flat and education is still down about 10%. Restaurants, which represents 25% of our equipment business, was down in the mid-teens, with full-service restaurants down about 30%, but fast casual up low single digits. Retail, which is now 25% of the business, was up more than 20% as a result of strong demand and new product rollouts. International was down 15% and is really a tale of two regions. As you would expect, Europe was down 22% due to COVID-19-related lockdowns. And on the other hand, Asia Pacific was up 44%, with China up 99%. Overall equipment sales were down 4% and service down 19%. Test & Measurement and Electronics delivered revenue growth of 14% with 11% organic growth. Test & Measurement was up 7% with continued strength in semiconductors and healthcare end markets now supplemented by strengthening demand in the capital equipment businesses as evidenced by the Instron business growing 12%. The electronics business grew 16%, with strong demand for team room technology products, automotive applications and consumer electronics. Operating margin of 28.4% was up 330 basis points. Moving to Slide 6. As I mentioned earlier, we saw a strong sequential improvement in Welding as the segment delivered organic growth of 6%, the highest growth rate in almost three-years. The commercial business, which serves smaller businesses and individual users, usually leads the way in a recovery, and Q1 was their third quarter in a row with double-digit growth, up 17% this quarter. The industrial business continued its sequential improvement trend and was down only 1% with customer CapEx spend picking up and backlogs building. Overall, equipment sales were up 10% and consumables were flat versus prior year. North America was up 7%. And international growth of 4% was primarily driven by recovery in China and some early signs of demand picking up in oil and gas. Solid volume leverage and enterprise initiatives contributed to a record margin performance of 30.3%, which, as I said, marked the first time an ITW segment delivered operating margins above 30%. Polymers & Fluids delivered organic growth of 9%, with polymers up 16%, driven by strength in MRO applications particularly for heavy industries. The automotive aftermarket business continued to benefit from strong retail sales with organic growth of 9%, while fluids, which has a larger presence in Europe was down 1%. Operating margin benefited from solid volume leverage and enterprise initiatives to deliver margins of 25.7%. Moving to Slide 7. Construction was the fastest-growing segment this quarter with organic growth of 13%. North America was up 12%, with continued strong demand in residential renovation and in the home center channel. Commercial construction, which is only about 15% of our U.S. sales, was up 3%. European sales grew 19% with double-digit growth in the U.K. and Continental Europe. Australia and New Zealand grew 7%, with strength in both residential and commercial markets. Operating margin of 27.6% was an improvement of 420 basis points. Specialty revenues were up 10% with organic revenue of 7% and positive growth in all regions. North America was up 6%; Europe, up 5%; and Asia Pacific was up 24%. Demand for consumer packaging remained solid at 6%. So please turn to Slide 8 for an update on our full-year 2021 guidance. And per our usual process, and with the caveat that we are only one quarter into the New Year and a significant number of uncertainties and challenges are still in front of us, we are raising our guidance on all key performance metrics, including organic growth, operating margin and EPS. In doing so, we have obviously factored in our solid Q1 results. And per our usual process, we are projecting current levels of demand exit in Q1, into the future and addressing them for typical seasonality. And as discussed, we have made an allowance for the estimated impact of semiconductor chip shortages on our Auto OEM customers. The outcome of that exercise is an organic growth forecast of 10% to 12% at the enterprise level. This compares to a prior organic growth guidance of 7% to 10%. Foreign currency at today\u2019s exchange rates adds two percentage points to revenue for total revenue growth forecast of 12% to 14%. As you saw, we are off to a strong start on operating leverage and enterprise initiatives, and we are raising our operating margin guidance by 100 basis points to a new range of 25% to 26%, which incorporates all known raw material cost increases and the corresponding pricing actions. Relative to 2020, our 2021 operating margins of 25% to 26% are 250 basis points higher at the midpoint and they are almost 150 basis points higher than our pre-COVID 2019 operating margins of 24.1% as we continue to make progress towards our long-term performance goal of 28% plus, as I mentioned earlier. Our incremental margins for the full-year are expected to be above our typical 35% to 40% range. Finally, we are raising our GAAP EPS guidance by $0.60 and or 8% to a new range of $8.20 to $8.60. The new midpoint of $8.40 represents an earnings growth rate of 27% versus prior year and a 9% increase relative to pre-COVID 2019 EPS of $7.74. A few final housekeeping items to wrap it up, with no changes to : one, the forecast for free cash flow; two, our plan to repurchase approximately $1 billion of our own shares; and three, our expected tax rate of 23% to 24%. As per usual process, our guidance is for the core business only and excludes the previously announced acquisition of the MTS Test & Simulation business. The process to close the acquisition by mid-year remains on-track. And once the acquisition closes, we will provide an update. As we have said before, we do not expect a material financial impact to earnings in 2021. So in summary, a quarter of quality execution in a challenging environment, and as a result, we are off to a solid start to the year. So with that, Karen, I will turn it back to you. Karen Fletcher : Okay. Thank you, Michael. Christie, let\u2019s open up the lines for questions, please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Jamie Cook : Hi congratulations on a nice quarter. Two questions obviously, the organic growth that you saw in the quarter was fairly strong. I\u2019m just trying to understand how much of it is sort of just end markets recovering versus sort of structural market share gains that ITW has been able to achieve? I guess that is my first question, if you can help us on that. And then my second question, the incrementals that you are putting up, the 45%, and then 52% if we adjust for price cost. This is above your targeted range with supply with COVID, costs and inefficiencies and things like that, I\u2019m just wondering if we should rethink, at some point, your targeted incrementals? Thank you. Michael Larsen : Okay, Jamie. So I think on the first one, it is a little too early to tell. I mean I think we certainly feel very good about how we are positioned with our Win the Recovery strategy and the fact that we stayed invested, giving us the ability to capture market share as we have talked about. So I think it is a little too early to tell how much of that growth in Q1 is really market versus market share gains. And I will just add to that, we have also seen an uptick from the contribution of our customer-back innovation efforts. And so again, that is a result of being able to stay invested in those. And then I would point to our supply chain and our ability to maintain our service levels, where maybe others are struggling a little bit more. So I think anecdotally, there are certainly lots of evidence, if you were to ask our divisions and our segments that we are picking up share. And again, we are going after sustainable, high-quality, profitable market share gains, not opportunistic. And so we feel really good about the start to the year on account of those things. I think on the incrementals, I agree with you, that was a real bright spot, significantly above our normal range of 35% to 40%. At these early stages in the recovery, we expect to be able to maintain the incrementals above the typical range. So 40% plus is what we are planning for and also embedded in our guidance, as you saw today. If you do the math, that is where you end up. I think it is a little premature to update kind of the long-term incremental margin expectations. I think we are comfortable with kind of long-term in the 35% to 40% range. We are certainly making a lot of improvement to the cost structure of the company. But let\u2019s revisit that at a later stage in terms of what we think the long-term incrementals might be on a go-forward basis. For now, if you think kind of beyond this year, I would still stick to the kind of the 35% to 40%. Jamie Cook : Okay. Thank you and congratulations. Michael Larsen : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeffrey Sprague : Impressive. Scott, I was wondering if you could just update us on what you are thinking on M&A. Obviously, you got this MTS deal coming. I\u2019m sure you could have taken a shot on goal at well build if you wanted to get passed there. Maybe just how you see the pipeline kind of going out this year. And I understand these things are always kind of idiosyncratic and have their own timing. But do you see a likelihood that the pace of activity on M&A could be picking up for you over the next six to 12-months? Scott Santi : Well, I think we are really happy with the MTS acquisition, that we have got some work to do, obviously, just to get it closed. All of it is basically standard, new team. But that is I think a great example of where I think acquisitions supplement our core growth focus, which is really owning great businesses that deliver great value to their customers and that we can grow organically. And MTS certainly adds and supplements our capabilities in terms of the Test & Measurement space and our ability to do so. I\u2019m not going to comment on your specific reference or any other deals that others have announced recently, but I would say that we - our appetite for additional MTS-light deals remains certainly strong. I can\u2019t remember exactly the term used, Jeff, but I think the phrase opportunistic is the right way to think about it. It is a combination of, ultimately, what we are interested in doing, what fits with the availability of assets that fit that profile. And that includes both their strategic attributes, the attributes that they offer in terms of our ability to improve their inherent financial performance and all at a value that we think makes sense for us and our shareholders and in terms of return on not just the capital, but the time, effort and energy that we are going to expend. So that is sort of the generic strategic narrative around it. My personal view is I absolutely think, on average, one to three MTS kinds of deals a year seems to be a reasonable - something that absolutely is achievable. We are not going to try to sort of force a deal every year on that. So some years are going to be zero because the circumstances are not going to present - the circumstances that we are looking for are not going to present themselves. But I think there is lots of room for other similar kinds of deals to be additive to what we are doing in a relatively consistent way over, let\u2019s say, the 5-year period. I think I will stop there. Jeffrey Sprague : Thanks. I appreciate that. And also just wondering, outside of auto, which is kind of plain to see, Ford announcements and everything else. Are you seeing these sorts of - it sounds like your own supply chain, you are feeling pretty good about, but other things going on at customer levels that may cause top line disruption to you over the balance of the year? Scott Santi : I think it is hard to project the balance of the year. I would say, for sure, in the second quarter, there are broader issues than just automotive at play. And I would also say that it is absolutely fair that we are having to work a lot harder in terms of securing our own sources of supply than we would under normal circumstances. So we have, for a number of reasons, I think, been able to counter punch our way through a much more challenging supply environment in the first quarter and through the second quarter, I think we are going to be able to do the same, broadly speaking, partly because we source local, that is - we know our suppliers. We source where we produce. And I think partly because of the fact that we stayed invested. We hang on to our people, so we are not having to add people back to support this uptick in demand. But I don\u2019t want to -- no one should take from that, that it is been smooth and easy the whole way through. So we are in it with everybody else and certainly having to work harder than normal to sustain our ability to supply. But I think so far, I feel like we have been able to, as I said, counter punch our way through it pretty well. And I would also say beyond the automotive space, there are certainly some pockets where we have some other - some of our customers being impacted by some of their own supply chain issues. Plastics remain tight in a number of areas. I don\u2019t think anything is sort of concentrated and significant as in auto, but it is certainly a scramble right now on a lot of levels. Jeffrey Sprague : Yes, understood. Thanks for the color, I appreciate it. Good luck. Scott Santi : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Scott Davis : Hi good morning guys and Karen, I would echo Jeff\u2019s comments on exceptional numbers is going to become the usual here. Anyways, not a lot to pick on here. One of the comments you just made, Scott, on price or maybe it was Mike, price cost neutral, is that a comment that you would make across the entire portfolio, that segment by segment, you expect to be in a cost-neutral position this year or are there certain segments perhaps that take a little longer to get price or could be behind yes. Michael Larsen : I mean, I think the one obvious one, Scott, is the auto business, where just given the nature of the business and how the contracts are structured, getting price takes a little longer and requires a funnel of new products that are coming in at more attractive margins. So that is the one where, in the near-term, we are seeing the most significant pressure on margins from a price cost standpoint. And the other six segments, I think there is, given the differentiated nature of the products and services that we provide, we have a long history of being able to offset any cost increases with price. There is typically a little bit of a lag. I will tell you, we learned some things when we went through this in 2018. We are definitely much more, say, focused and on top of things earlier on. And our divisions are taking the actions that are required to kind of stay ahead of things this time around. So while there is certainly some pressure here, you saw 60 basis points of margin percentage impact and seven percentage points of incremental margin impact. The overall goal here is to offset on a dollar-for-dollar basis, and we are confident that we will be able to do that for the year and in total, even with the pressure and the difficulty in automotive. Scott Davis : Okay, that is helpful. And just as a follow-up, I\u2019m just going to jump on the bandwagon of what Jeff was asking about on M&A. I would think that given the success you have had in kind of multiple different types of businesses, your assets, your confidence in going after a bigger asset and implementing 80/20 and really driving value perhaps way above what the - world could do or other strategic would perhaps widen that scope of ability to be able to do deals on the larger side. How do you guys think about that and applying 80/20 when you think about an M&A model? Scott Santi : Yes. I don\u2019t think size is a barrier at all or a limitation or something that would scare us away. I would point to MTS as being - it is not quite $0.5 billion in annual revenue. So it is not a small business by any stretch. I would tell you a couple of things. One is that we have never been more prepared from the standpoint of discipline around integration, the quality of practice around our 80/20 front-to-back operating system, the depth of talent. This is all a result of the last nine-years of work on this. So all of that certainly is just additive to, I think, our ability to - if we find the right opportunity to do a really good job with it. So it is not an issue of - size doesn\u2019t scare us. I think sometimes what does happen is the larger the size, there tends to be it is a time to sort of a pure play. This is the part of the business. We want it all. The bigger the asset, the more sort of nonstrategic, non-desirable stuff you have to deal with sometimes. But that is also just sort of part of the tactics. But again, I don\u2019t think it is big or small that is the driving benefit to us as much as does it really fit with what we are good at, does it fit an area of the market we think has long-term above market organic growth prospects, et cetera. And whether it is large or relatively small, and by that I mean division size, those would be equally attractive options to us. Scott Davis : Makes sense. Thank you Scott, good luck folks. Scott Santi : You bet. Thanks. Michael Larsen : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Inch with Gordon Haskett. John Inch : Scott and Michael, China, up 62% core. Have your factories and operations been able to keep up with that level of demand, which I get the premise of some compares, so it is not completely volume-driven, which presumably this is going to be up as much in the second quarter, just given it compares as well. Anything you would call out there? Because I understand the point that your factories are local and so forth, but that is a very high-growth rate. And I\u2019m just curious how kind of the quarter played out. And did you have to leave any sales on the table that maybe kind of get picked up later even? Scott Santi : Yes. I actually probably can\u2019t answer that last piece other than to say that the business for us that is really of the biggest scale in China is auto. And they did a phenomenal job, if you look at the kind of volume. Now that is a big number year-on-year, but remember that China was way down in the first quarter last year. So from the standpoint of the sequential, I don\u2019t have that. I don\u2019t know, maybe you have, Michael, from Q4 to Q1, it wasn\u2019t a 58% jump, right. But I would say, overall, our decision to hang on to our people and just be ready for this has certainly given us an ability to respond. That if we were having to not only source scramble for raw material, but also scramble for people, it would certainly be a more difficult challenge than it was. John Inch : That is fair. I\u2019m curious, so we all know sort of the constraints around semicon and auto, Scott, you already talked about. I mean, I have sort of alluded to these questions in the past about the post-COVID world, demand is going to surge pretty aggres8sively. And I\u2019m curious, we have already started to see that, as evidenced by your own very healthy, robust results. Have your operations experienced any meaningful pinch points as global demand has come back that may have been surprising or that provides, per se, lessons learned, Scott, Michael, but you are applying as presumably, this is not a one or two quarter phenomenon. This is going to carry forward for a little while here. Is there anything you can share with us in terms of how you are thinking about sort of operations and just playing to the market share wins that sort of thing? Scott Santi : Yes. I\u2019m trying to think about how to sort of tackle that one, John. Maybe the place to start is, inherent in our system is, we always talk about the fact that we produce today what our customers bought yesterday. So what makes that work is the fact that we are always carrying surplus capacity, on the order of magnitude of 15% to 20% over what current demand is. Because that demand comes, it is an average on a daily basis. So the only way we can produce today what our customers bought yesterday, as that number moves up and down, is to make sure that we have ample extra capacity to flex. So that sort of helps us as things accelerate, we do have a cushion to lean on. We also have - our supplier base is connected into that system in a way that they are also carrying that kind of ability to flex. Now it works really well. It doesn\u2019t work perfectly, certainly with - we have our sort of rubs and issues along the way, and I\u2019m sure we will. But there are things that we can overcome and work our way through. But maybe that is the best answer. I don\u2019t know if that totally addresses it, but we start with a sort of level of flex that certainly helps us respond and add even more capacity as we are pivoting into kind of an environment where the economy is starting to tick off. John Inch : Well, maybe an example, it is going to be Food Equipment. That seems obvious that that is going to come back pretty aggressively in the second half, touch wood. Is there anything you are doing with respect to your operations to make sure that you actually don\u2019t, say, lose share because -- or lose a sale because you can\u2019t fulfill a product demand or something like that? Scott Santi : Yes, I\u2019m completely comfortable that they know exactly what to do. I mean, again, we have hung on to all of our people through this. We have hang on to all of our capacity. We are locked and loaded and ready to go. I have no doubt about it, into equipment, and everywhere else in the company. John Inch : Got it. Great, thank you very much. Scott Santi : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Ann Duignan : Ho g good morning everybody. Could you dig a little deeper into your comments around capital, like equipment demand picking up? I mean, I know you talked about it in places like Welding. But just a little bit more color by region, by application, by segment. Would just like to hear from you in terms of what specifically you are seeing, because that is a big change. Michael Larsen : Yes. I think, Ann, as you are saying, that was kind of the new trend that showed up here in the first quarter. We did see orders and backlog starting to build last year on the equipment side. But really in Q1 here, if you look at the businesses that had the most significant improvement relative to historical run rates, they are Test & Measurement, as I mentioned, and Welding. And so those are businesses that are more driven by investment in CapEx. And I think as the visibility to the recovery and the confidence in the recovery takes hold, our customers are placing orders for larger equipment. And we saw a little bit of that also in Specialty Products, on the packaging equipment side. And it is really a broad-based trend. So I don\u2019t really have the breakdown for you on a global basis, but really across the board, we saw really nice pickup in demand for the CapEx-driven products and those three businesses in particular. And I think we are off to a good start here in April. So I think we saw good momentum coming into Q1, kind of sustained that. March was a strong month. And April, everything is on-track here. Ann Duignan : Okay. I appreciate the color on that. And then just back to the whole maintaining your employee base and we see what a difference that makes this year. I mean, I don\u2019t think that, that should be understated given that almost every other company we cover mentioned their inability to attract labor as an issue. So congratulations on that but what about your customers? I mean, is there any risk that your customers have to defer orders? I mean, it is kind of counter to what you just talked about. But if your employers like the restaurants, for example, if they cannot hire, is there any risk that they will have to defer orders as we go through the year just because they can\u2019t get labor? Scott Santi : Yes. I would be pretty certain it is going to have some impact in terms of the overall pace of the recovery in a number of areas. My personal view, Ann, is that is maybe not even such a bad thing in terms of extending the duration of the recovery and sort of managing the pace a little bit in the short run. So even with this auto, auto is a real extreme example of that, not so much on labor, but from semiconductor chips. Michael talked about the fact that consumer demand for autos is strong. Dealer inventories are at, I think, around the world, historic lows. So the fact that all of that is not trying to be satisfied in two quarters and it actually gets spread out, and so I just use that same analogy in places like Food Equipment, as I don\u2019t think it is necessarily a terrible thing that there are some limitations, either labor or other things, as we move through the recovery in some of our sectors. It doesn\u2019t mean demand isn\u2019t going to grow. It is not going to be this feeding frenzy of satisfying in a relatively short period of time. I don\u2019t know exactly how it is all going to play out, but I don\u2019t think some of those limitations in the near-term are necessarily bad things for the long haul, if that makes sense. Ann Duignan : Yes. No, I completely agree with you. It is kind of a forced rationalization of the industry. So yes, I appreciate the color. I will get back in line. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Andrew Kaplowitz : Scott or Michael, you mentioned Welding margin now above 30%, which I think is a new record for you. And as you know, Welding isn\u2019t close to fully recovered yet. If I go back to 2018, your margin at similar levels of revenue was approximately 28%. So if we step back and try to ingest that improvement, understanding that we haven\u2019t changed the long-term 28% target for the company over the last couple of years, but does it give you confidence that maybe the whole company can even do better than that over time? Michael Larsen : Andy, the easy answer to your question is, with the types of incrementals that our segments are putting up - the enterprise level is 45, welding was also 45, the answer is that margins will continue to improve just from the volume leverage alone. And then we know that there is still a ways to go to reach our full potential from an 80/20 front-to-back implementation standpoint as well. You see these enterprise initiatives continue to come in at 120 basis points at the enterprise level. Maybe a little bit less than that in Welding, but still a significant contribution from the initiatives. And so I have said this many times, and I will continue to say this. I mean, and then it is based on the bottoms-up planning that we do. We expect that all of our segments will continue to improve their operating margin performance, like I said, as demand recovers. And maybe more importantly, we still have a lot of things within our own control here that regardless of what happens from a demand standpoint, we can continue to improve the margin performance... Scott Santi : While they grew at an accelerated rate organically. Michael Larsen : While growing... Scott Santi : That is the yin and the yang of the... Michael Larsen : That is right. That is right. We can do both, right. And then what I said in my comments is what is really encouraging, I think, is that with everything going on last year and right now, with supply chain as well, the fact that our teams leverage this Win the Recovery strategy, stayed focused on executing a long-term enterprise strategy, and we are sitting here really you could argue one quarter into the recovery, and we have a clear path in front of us as we continue to make progress towards our 28%. You said 28%. I thought my comments I may have said 28% plus. That we continue to make progress towards our long-term margin goal of 28% plus. Andrew Kaplowitz : Very helpful, guys. And then we talked a little bit about Food Equipment on the call already, but maybe just focusing on it. Obviously, reopening is happening faster, at least in the U.S. now. And you do have this large institutional business that could benefit from significant stimulus that already has been passed, especially for school cafeterias. So have you seen any of that money start to flow to that business or have you seen accelerating improvement in your restaurant business yet? Michael Larsen : Not yet is the answer. I mean, like I mentioned, we are starting to see a pickup in orders and backlog. As you know, these businesses are not really backlog-driven. But the quoting activity is solid, and it is reasonable to assume that there will be a pickup on the institutional side as we move forward, including for schools. So I think that is part of what is encouraging is we are not firing on all cylinders yet. We put up some pretty good results here in Q1 and we still have Food Equipment, as you mentioned, down 10% organic, with a strong recovery ahead of it. So I think that is really encouraging. Andrew Kaplowitz : Thank guys, I appreciate it. Michael Larsen : Welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Nicole DeBlase : Can we talk a little bit about, just returning to the issue of price cost. I know you guys said that it is a 60 basis points impact on margins in the first quarter. If we look at the full-year, how does that kind of flow from here? Maybe what is embedded for price cost headwinds in the full-year margin guidance? Michael Larsen : Yes. So let me start by saying I would be a little cautious on Q2. There is a little bit of a timing issue here. And just given how high our margins are, I think these price cost pressures will remain with us, particularly in the near-term. So Q2, this will be dilutive to margin percentage, again, EPS-neutral on a dollar-for-dollar basis. So it is purely a margin percentage, incremental percentage impact. So 60 basis points in Q2 -in Q1. Something around that same level, maybe a little worse than that in Q2, based on what we know today. And then it should begin to improve in the second half of the year. And maybe for the full-year, we end up somewhere around 50 to 60 basis points of margin impact. Nicole DeBlase : Okay. Got it. Understood. And the selling days impact that you guys had in the first quarter, does that normalize throughout the year, like I think a lot of companies have talked about the selling days impact reversing in 4Q. Is that how it is for ITW as well? Michael Larsen : It is not, no. we have 64-days in Q2 and Q3 and 52-days in Q4, which is the same as we had last year. So this was purely a Q1 issue. If you remember, last year was a leap year. So I hate bringing this up. That is how the calendar works. Nicole DeBlase : Okay. Thanks guys. I will pass it on. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mig Dobre with Baird. Mircea Dobre : Thank you and congrats on a really strong start to the year. I guess my question, Michael, maybe for you. I was observing that SG&A has been relatively flattish year-over-year on really nice, strong revenue growth in Q1. And I\u2019m just sort of wondering here kind of how you constructed your outlook for the full-year, because you are obviously guiding for your revenues now above pre-COVID levels, above 2019 levels. I\u2019m sort of wondering if it is fair for us to sort of expect that SG&A is going to remain relatively muted or are you essentially kind of baking in a return to more normalized, call it, pre-COVID levels? And I\u2019m talking about the full-year run rate here. Michael Larsen : Yes. So I would say, Mig, I mean, I would expect somewhere around - as our sales grow, obviously, the cost to support those sales, including things like commissions, are going to grow. And those costs are pretty correlated. And I think the last time I looked at it here a few days ago, I would assume something around 17% of sales in SG&A. And so that is maybe from a modeling standpoint, the way to look at it. I would just point to the fact, I mean, what we talked about earlier, the fact that we didn\u2019t have lots of people leave the company last year, and now we are hiring and a ton of costs are coming back in. That is not what I\u2019m talking about here. These are simply primarily sales commissions and costs like that, that are going to grow in line with - as the top line of the company grows this year in the low teens. So that is what you would expect to see. Mircea Dobre : Got it. That is helpful. So around 17. I mean, that is basically going to be a bit higher than what you have done in Q1. That is probably the volume ramp that you are sort of talking about as the year progresses? Michael Larsen : Yes. I mean I think the one thing I know for sure is that there is going to be a big ramp-up here in Q2. Mircea Dobre : Right. And then my follow-up, and folks have been asking about the Food Equipment business, and I will, too, but I guess I will ask it this way. If I look at your business, it seems to me that this vertical, this segment is really the one that is probably been transformed the most by COVID In terms of sort of the end customers having to operate differently, having to think about doing business differently. And I\u2019m sort of wondering where that leads you strategically longer term, right? Because the industry is consolidating, you obviously have an important market position and really good product. How do you think about the next five-years from an innovation standpoint, from ability to gain share and, more importantly, you sort of stepping up to the plate and consolidating the industry as well because there are a lot of smaller players that are still out there. Scott Santi : Yes. Well, I would be happy to try to address some of that. Let me start at the end of your question first. We are not interested in consolidation. We are not an economy scale company. We are not going to buy anything to consolidate. We are going to own great businesses that deliver value for their customers through the performance of the products and services that they offer. And so whether the industry consolidates or not, ultimately, we compete based on our ability to deliver superior value to the customers that we choose to target in those industries. And so that is essentially all I will say our businesses are very well positioned in this space. We expect that they will continue to grow at an accelerated rate with best-in-class margins and returns in that industry. And absolutely, to your point, we will have to continue to evolve and innovate as our customers evolve and innovate based on COVID or anything else in terms of what happens in that industry. And I think I will just leave it there. Mircea Dobre : Alright. Thanks for the color. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies. Stephen Edward : Great. I just had one quick follow-up back on sort of your incremental margin discussion, Michael. If I remember correctly, I think the plan, obviously, dollar-for-dollar on price cost sort of in year one. But then as we move forward, I think the goal is to recover the margin on top of that. So why wouldn\u2019t we have a higher incremental margin in 2022 than kind of your base case? Michael Larsen : I think that is a good question. I think on price cost, I mean, what we are talking about right now is this pretty significant increase in raw material costs and offsetting those dollar-for-dollar with price. And in the near-term, as I said, that puts pressure on margins. I think once you get past the surge in raw material costs and those start to kind of stabilize or maybe even come down a little bit as expected, frankly, for some of these commodities in the back half of the year, you are holding on to the price and you are going to end up in a favorable position again from a price cost standpoint. That is kind of how this has played out historically. And historically, that is what is been embedded in that 35% to 40% incremental margin rate that we have been able to put up. I think once we go through - there is kind of the planning for 2022, I will give you a better feel for the ability to maintain incremental margins either above the historical range or in the historical range. But as we sit here today, like I said earlier, for modeling purposes, I would stick to the 35% to 40% for now. And we will give you an update as we go through the year here. But clearly, this year and in Q1 and in the near-term, really strong incremental margin performance. I don\u2019t know if I said this, but we are above the range of 35% to 40%, so 40% plus, and that is with price/cost for the full-year. Headwinds are somewhere around four to five percentage points to the incremental margin. So really strong performance here as the recovery takes hold. Stephen Edward : Right. Yes. I certainly agree with that. It just seems like maybe you get that four or five percentage points back next year. But I will look forward to your update whenever you are ready. Michael Larsen : Okay. That is fair. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS. Steven Fisher : I just want to confirm that you have not baked in any cyclical increase in daily run rate of sales demand into your guidance. I imagine you are going to say you haven\u2019t. But just in an accelerating economic growth environment, it seems like your approach would be particularly conservative at this point. Michael Larsen : Yes, I think that is for you to decide. I think the argument you are making is not unreasonable. I think what we do is we give you kind of the outlook for the company at current run rates. And if you think that Food Equipment is going to come back stronger or you think the auto issue is a bigger issue, then you can certainly make those adjustments to your model. And as you know, ITW is this is a pretty predictable company certainly at the enterprise level. And so you can get pretty close to the models that we are looking at. And so we think this is the best way to communicate the outlook for the company and being very transparent. And then it is for you to decide kind of segment-by-segment how you think things might play out based on whatever data points that you look at. Steven Fisher : Fair enough, that is what I thought you would say. I just want to confirm. And then what have you assumed for divestitures and kind of approximate timing on that, if any new updates there. Michael Larsen : Yes. So really no new update, I mean, as you recall, we put those on hold last year really to focus on the recovery here. And the most important thing we have to do is get the organic growth rate and demonstrate that we can grow consistently above market. The view was that working on divestitures is really a distraction from that. And by the way, we believe, and it is playing out that way, as these businesses are going to be more valuable when we kind of reinitiate the process, which will probably be somewhere at the end of this year, early next year. So from a strategic standpoint, these are still businesses that we are that are not a great fit for ITW, that are a much better fit, frankly, with other people, we think. And so that view has not changed, but we have kind of deferred all the activities to later this year or early next year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Maybe just a question perhaps for Michael around the free cash flow. There is been a lot of P&L-related questions. So the free cash flow, I think, was flattish in Q1 year-on-year. The net income was up a good amount. So it seems like maybe there is some working capital headwind, receivables, perhaps something there. Maybe just help us understand sort of what impact the component and supply chain issues are having on your own sort of working capital management and any cash headwinds associated with that. And how we should think about CapEx this year kind of catching up or ramping back up for ITW. And I understand that, that conversion rate metric should fall year-on-year because you are in a growth year now. Michael Larsen : Yes. I mean, that is exactly what is happening. I mean, we are - clearly as the top line grows 10%, you are going to see, at least in the near-term, a corresponding increase in inventory levels, which is part of what Scott talked about as demand grows, inventory levels are going to grow. The same thing with receivables. The fact that receivables are growing is actually -- as you know, it is a good thing. I think what we keep an eye on is the working capital metrics around inventory months on hand are all trending in the right direction. I will just point out that if you can see you are looking at from the outside, but when we look at our receivable aging and our bad debt, we are below pre-COVID levels in a meaningful way. So I think the teams really did an excellent job managing working capital overall, including receivables last year. And I think we talked about in the last call, working capital headwinds, somewhere around $125 million was in the plan for this year. The growth is a little bit stronger, so it might be a little bit more than that, but it is not going to change. We still are confident we will get to 100% plus conversion rate. But the goal here really is - we generate plenty of cash. The goal here is to grow the company. It would make no sense for us to try to hold back on inventory levels at this point. So on CapEx, as you know, last year, some of the capacity expansions were deferred. A lot of those are coming back now. CapEx will be somewhere around 2% of sales, which is where it has been historically. That is not a set number. That is an outcome of how we allocate capital. So if you pencil in somewhere around $300 million, that is directionally, that is probably where we will end up. That is up. I think last year, we did $236 million or something like that. So we are definitely expanding. And you saw the CapEx number moved up a little bit here in the first quarter. And that is really as these capacity expansions we are adding equipment, we are adding injection molding machines in auto and other places to support our customers as demand recovers. So. Julian Mitchell : Great, thank you. Michael Larsen : Sure. Operator : Joe Ritchie, your line is open. Joseph Ritchie : Thanks for squeezing me in everybody. So my first question, maybe just focus on organic growth for a second. You raised the outlook for the year. I\u2019m curious, were any segments not raised? So for example, like some of the headwinds that you talked about in Auto OEM and the maybe slower start to the year in Food Equipment? Michael Larsen : Yes. So all segments, except for Auto OEM, and this is based on the [run rate ratio,] right? So this is a pure mathematical, based on demand, one of the demand exit in Q1, six of seven segments are higher in terms of the organic growth forecast for the year. And in particular, the CapEx-driven businesses as we talked about, right so Test & Measurement, Welding. And then in auto, some of these supply chain issues and the allowance we made in our guidance, they are probably towards the low end of the range that we gave back in January. I think the range back then was 14 to 18. And we are probably at the low end of that. Auto builds are still projected to be up 12% for the year. So we will see. That is the one area where there is quite a bit of uncertainty particularly. And I will just maybe reiterate this, be a little cautious around the second quarter here and not get too excited. But medium term, we are very encouraged by the underlying consumer demand as well as inventory levels, as we talked about, in that segment. Joseph Ritchie : Got it. That makes sense. And then maybe my one follow-on, either for Scott or Michael. As you think about you guys used to always talk about your content on a regional basis in the auto segment. I\u2019m just curious, does that change at all with the uptick that we are seeing in EVs? Scott Santi : We talked about it from a long-term opportunity perspective, it is actually roughly equivalent. it that we do around the power-train now that obviously wouldn\u2019t exist, but there is a whole range of new sort of applications in the EV space. So I think the last time we looked at it, it was on a per car basis neutral to maybe a little higher with EV. Michael Larsen : Higher, actually, yes. Scott Santi : $2 versus maybe 5% to 10% higher. So net-net, we are pretty agnostic. I think the other thing that we have said in the past, this is not sort of current data, but roughly I think it was less than 1/4 of our sales would go away if every car was EV tomorrow, basically 20% or 25% of our revenues are at risk. 75% of what we do today goes in either place, and there is certainly plenty of new applications to replace that other 20% or so over time, plus a little bit. Joseph Ritchie : Got it. That is helpful. Have a good weekend everyone. Scott Santi : Alright. Thank you. Michael Larsen : Thank you. Karen Fletcher : Thanks, Joe. I think we are out of time now. So I would like to thank everybody for joining us this morning. Feel free to call me with any follow-up questions. And that concludes our call today. Operator : Thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference call. All lines may disconnect at this time.",

My name is Adam, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you.  Karen Fletcher, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Karen Fletcher : Thank you, Adam. Good morning and welcome to ITW\u2019s Second Quarter 2021 Conference Call. I\u2019m joined by our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi; and our Vice Chairman, Chris O'Herlihy. Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen is recovering from a sports related injury and is not able to participate in today\u2019s call. We certainly wish Michael all the best and look forward to seeing him next week.  During today\u2019s call we will discuss ITW\u2019s second quarter financial results and update our guidance for the full year 2021. Slide two is a reminder that this presentation contains Forward-Looking Statements. We refer you to the company\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. This presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release. So please turn to slide three, and it\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi. Scott Santi : Thank you, Karen, and good morning everyone. In the second quarter we saw continued recovery momentum across our portfolio, and we delivered strong operational execution and financial results. Revenue was up 43% with organic growth up 37%. We saw double digit growth in every segment and geography. Earnings per share of $2.45 was up 143%, 108% if you exclude the one-time tax benefit of $0.35 that we recorded in the quarter.  In this strong demand environment and in the face of a very challenging supply conditions, our teams around the world leveraged our long held close to the customer manufacturing and supply chain approach, and the benefits are staying fully staffed and invested through our win and recovery positioning, to continue providing world class service levels to our customers, while also continuing to execute on our long term strategy to achieve and sustain ITWs full potential performance.  We're certainly encouraged by our organic growth momentum as order intake rates remain pretty much strong across the board, and during the second quarter we saw multiple examples of how our ability to sustain our differentiated delivery capabilities by remaining fully invested through the pandemic resulted in incremental share gain opportunities for our businesses. While there is no doubt that the raw material supply environment is as challenging as we have experienced in a long time, maybe ever in my 38 years and ITW, we are as well positioned as we can be to continue to set ourselves apart through our ability to respond for our customers.  We worked hard over the last nine years the position ITW to deliver differentiated performance in any environment, and I have no doubt that the ITW team will continue to execute at a high level as we move to the balance of the year and beyond.  Now for some more detail on our performance in the second quarter. As I mentioned, organic growth was 37% with strong performance across our seven segments. The two segments that were hardest hit by the pandemic a year ago led the way this quarter with Automotive OEM up 84% and Food Equipment up 46%. By geography, North America was up 36% and International was up 38%, with Europe up 50% and Asia Pacific up 20%.  GAAP EPS of $2.45 was up 143% and included a one-time tax benefit of $0.35 related to the re-measurement of net deferred tax assets in the U.K. due to a change in the statutory corporate tax rate there. Excluding this item, EPS of $2.10 grew 108%. It was a Q2 record and was 10% higher than in Q2 of 2019. Operating income increased 99% and incremental margin was 40% at the Enterprise level. Operating margin of 24.3% improved 680 basis points on strong volume leverage, along with 150 basis points of benefits from our enterprise initiatives. Year-to-date our teams have delivered robust margin expansion with incremental margins for our seven segments ranging from 37% to 48%, inclusive of price cost impact.  Speaking of price cost, price cost headwind to margin percentage in the quarter was 120 basis points. While the pace of raw material cost increases accelerated in the second quarter, our businesses have been active in implementing pricing actions in response to rising raw material costs since early in the year. Consistent with our strategy to cover raw material cost inflation with price adjustments on a dollar for dollar basis.  In Q2 we ended up just short of that goal due to some timing lags, and as a result net price cost impact reduced EPS by $0.001 in the quarter. We continue to expect price cost impact to be EPS neutral or better for the year, and I\u2019ll come back and provide more color on the price cost environment a little later in my remarks.  In the quarter after tax, return on invested capital was a record at 30.8%. Free cash flow was $477 million with a conversion of 72% of net income on adjusted for the one-time tax benefit I mentioned earlier. And that was due to the additional working capital investments necessary to support our strong organic growth.  We continue to expect approximately 100% conversion for the full year. We repurchased 250 million of our shares this quarter as planned, and finally our tax rate in the quarter was 10.1% due to a one-time tax benefit. Excluding this item, our Q2 tax was 23%.  Now moving to slide four for an updated on price cost. We continue to experience raw material cost increases, particularly in categories such as steel, resins and chemicals. And now project raw material cost inflation at around 7% for the full year, which is almost 5 percentage points higher than what we anticipated as the year began. And just for some perspective, this is roughly 2x of what we experienced in the 2018 inflation TerraCycle.  We learned a lot from that experience and as a result of the timeliness and pace of our price recovery actions, are well ahead of where we were in 2018. As I mentioned, we expect price cost impact to be EPS neutral or better for the full year, with pricing actions more than offsetting cost increases on a dollar for dollar basis. Price costs will continue to have a negative impact on our operating margin percentage, however in the near term as we saw in Q2 the net impact will likely be modestly higher in Q3 versus Q2 before it starts to go the other way. For the full year we expect price cost impact to be dilutive to margin by about 100 basis points, which is 50 basis points higher than where we were as of the end of Q1.  That being said, margin benefits from enterprise initiatives and volume leverage will provide us with ample ability to offset the negative affect of price cost and margin percentage, and deliver strong overall margin performance for the year. And beyond the near term price cost impact, we remain confident that we have meaningful additional structural margin improvement potential from the ongoing execution of our enterprise initiatives.  With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Chris for some comments on our segment performance in Q2. Chris. Chris O'Herlihy : Thank you, Scott, and good morning everyone. Starting on slide five, the table on the left provided some perspectives on the growth momentum in our businesses when we look at sequential revenue from Q1 to Q2.  I would expect the pace of recovery in our Auto OEM segment has been dampened by the well-publicized shortage of semi-conductor chips, despite very strong underlying demand, and for that reason we added a role to the table to show portfolio demand trends ex-auto. Our Q2 revenue ex-auto increased 8% versus Q1. This year Q2 had one more shipping date in Q1, so on an equal day basis our Q2 versus Q1 revenue growth and ex-auto is 6%, which is 2x of our normal Q2 versus Q1 seasonality of plus 3%. In addition, we added more than $200 million of backlog in Q2. Both of these factors show that demand accelerated meaningfully in Q2 across our portfolio.  Now let\u2019s go into a little more detail for each segment, starting with automotive OEM. Demand recovery versus prior year was most evident in this segment with 84% organic growth. This of course was against easy comps versus a year ago when most of our customers in North America and Western Europe were shut down from mid-March to mid-May. North America was up 102%, Europe was up 106% and China up 20%.  We estimate that the shortage of semiconductor chips negatively impacted our sales by about $60 million in the quarter. Operating margin of 18.8% was up 26.6 percentage points on volume leverage and enterprise initiatives. Price cost was a significant headwind of more than 200 basis points due to the long recycle time required to implement price recovery actions in this segment. Given the ongoing semiconductor chip supply uncertainty, we now expect full year organic growth in automotive to be approximate 10% versus our original range of 14% to 18% at the beginning of the year. To be clear, this is not lost revenue, but simply delayed into next year. Furthermore, the slower than expected growth in auto is offset by strength elsewhere in the enterprise.  Please turn to slide six for Food Equipment. In Food Equipment organic revenue rebounded 46% with recovery taking hold across the board and the backlog that is up significantly versus prior year. North America was up 39% with equipment up 42% and service up 33%. Institutional revenue was up more than 30% with health care and education growth in the low to mid-30s and lodging up in the mid-20s. Restaurants were up about 60% with the largest year-over-year increases in Food Service and QSR.  Retail grew in the mid-teens and continued solid demand and new product rollouts. International recovery was also robust at 58% with Europe up 66% and Asia Pacific up 29%. Equipment sales were strong 66%, with service growth of 39%, which continued to be impacted by extended lockdowns in Europe. Operating margin was 22% with an incremental of 46%.  Test & Measurement and Electronics revenue of $606 million was a Q2 record with organic growth of 29%. Test & Measurement was up 20%, driven by solid recovery in customer CapEx spend and continued strength in semicon. Electronics grew 38%, continued strength in consumer electronics and automotive applications, and the added benefit in timing of some large equipment orders in Electronic Assembly. Operating margin of 28.1% was 240 basis points \u2013 was up 240 basis points and a Q2 record.  Moving to slide seven, welding growth was also strong in Q2 at 33%. Equipment Revenue was up 38%, and consumables growth of 25% was the time in positive territory since 2019. Our industrial business grew 52% on increased CapEx spending by our customers and the commercial business remained solid, up 26% following 17% growth in the first quarter. North America was up 38% and International growth was 13%, primarily driven by recovery in oil and gas. Polymers & Fluids organic growth was 28%, led by our automotive aftermarket business up 33% on robust retail sales. Polymers were up 34% with continued momentum in MRO applications and heavy industries. Fluids is up 8% with North America growth in the mid-teens and European sales up low single digits. Operating margin was an all-time record of 27.3% with strong volume leverage and enterprise initiatives partially offset by price cost.  Moving to slide eight. Construction organic grew up to 28% reflected double digit growth and recovery in all three regions. North America was up 20% with 16% growth in residential renovation and with 26% growth in commercial construction.  Europe grew 61% with strong recovery versus easy comps in the UK and Continental Europe. Australia and New Zealand organic growth was 13% with continued strength in residential and commercial. Operating margin in the segment of 27.6% was up 390 basis points and was a Q2 record. Specialty organic revenue was up 17% with North America up 15%, Europe up 24% and Asia Pacific up 14%. Our Flexible Packaging business was up mid-single digit against tougher comps than the rest of the segment. The majority of our businesses were up double digits, led by appliance up more than 50%. Consumable sales were up 19% and equipment sales up 12%.  And with that, I'll turn it back to Scott. Scott Santi : Thanks Chris. Let's move on to slide nine for an update on our full year 2021 guidance. We now expect full year revenue to be in the range of $14.3 billion to $14.6 billion, up 15% at the midpoint versus last year, with organic growth in the range of 11% to 13% and foreign currency translation impact of plus-3%.  This is an increase in organic growth of one percentage point at the mid-point versus the updated guidance that we provided at the end of Q1, driven largely by the incremental revenue impact of pricing actions implemented in Q2 in response to accelerating raw material cost increases.  While demand momentum accelerated in Q2 versus Q1 as we noted earlier in our presentation, we are admittedly being conservative in not projecting that forward in our guidance at this point in time, given the significant supply chain disruptions that continue to challenge many of our customers in auto and otherwise. We are raising our GAAP EPS guidance by $0.35 to a range of $8.55 to $8.95 to incorporate the one-time tax benefit realized in the second quarter. The mid-point of 875 represents earnings growth of 32% versus last year and 13% over 2019. Factoring out the one-time Q2 tax side in the mid-point of our 2021 guidance is 10% higher than 2019.  With regard to margin percentage as discussed earlier, the incremental cost increases that we saw in Q2 will result in full year margin dilution of 100 basis points versus the 50 basis points that we project [Audio Gap] to a range of 24.5% to 25.5%, which would still be an improvement of more than 200 basis points year-over-year and an all-time record for the company. And again, we expect zero EPS impact from price cost for the full year. We expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 100% of net income factoring out the impact of the one-time, non-cash, tax benefit we recorded in Q2. Through the first half we have repurchase 500 million of our shares and expect to repurchase an additional 500 million in the second half. Finally we expect our tax rate in the second half to be in our usual range of 23% to 24% and for our full year tax rate of around 20%.  Lastly, today\u2019s guidance excludes any impact from the previously announced acquisition of the MTS Test & Simulation business, which we expect to close later this year. Once that acquisition closes we\u2019ll provide you with an update. And with that, I'll turn it back over to you Karen. Karen Fletcher : Okay, thank you, Scott. Adam, lets open up the lines for questions please. Operator : Yes ma'am. [Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Andrew Kaplowitz : Best wishes to Michael! Scott Santi : Thank you. He\u2019s on short term IR, but he\u2019ll be back next week. Andrew Kaplowitz : Excellent! So Scott or Chris, you mentioned the raw material cost inflation. We know when you said inflation will be as usual better for the year. Do you see the inflationary pressure stabilize enough where you can have a handle on these increases that you sort of put into the guide. So when you look at Q3 and Q4, you have confidence in your forecast. And then in \u201822 you talked about last quarter, what\u2019s the probability that these price increases are pretty sticky so you could exceed that 35% to 40% longer term incremental you have. Scott Santi : Well, on the first question I think we're very confident that we will cover whatever, you know all the increases that have already been incurred and anything subsequent to that, I would not be comfortable describing the environment as stabilizing at this point, but ultimately I think we have demonstrated. We\u2019ve looked back over the last \u2013 you know going back to 2017 and even in \u201818 and certainly this year, you know sort of on a quarterly basis worst impacts on price costs and inflationary environments have been a $0.001, you know may be $0.02 one quarter. So I think we're fully comfortable that we\u2019ll be able to read and react to whatever might happen from here that the EPS impact of the company will be negligible for the full year, but I think as I said, I don't \u2013 it's not based on an assumption that things are going to stabilize from here for sure. I don't think we're seeing \u2013 we\u2019ve seen enough evidence of that and normally I\u2019d predict things are going to continue to reach forward either. I think its wait and see. Chris O\u2019Herlihy: We saw a significant pickup in the case of inflation in Q2, yeah. Andrew Kaplowitz : Guys maybe I could just ask the question specific to auto in the sense that you know you give us the numbers, you know now 10% for the year. I think this quarter you said 200 basis points to price risk cost. As you know there is always a lag before you can catch up there. So should we assume incremental margin is still getting a little worse before it gets better in that business, and how long would you surmise it takes to get on top of price risk costs in that business? Chris O\u2019Herlihy: Well, price versus cost in auto is always going to be challenging given the, you know the nature of the industry. I would say in terms of incremental in the second quarter in auto we had a 47% incremental, an impact of 47% incremental you know for the first half of the year. So incrementals are strong in auto no double, but there is no doubt that the structure of the industry, the structure of the pricing agreements, it does take a lot longer. Hard to say how long it will take for us to catch up there with that. Andrew Kaplowitz : Thanks guys. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with J.P. Morgan. Ann Duignan : Hi! Good morning. A - Scott Santi : Good morning. Ann Duignan : Maybe you could talk a little bit more about both, construction products and Test & Measurement where you said you delivered or you did deliver a record Q2 operating profit footprint. Can you talk about how sustainable those margins are going forward? Was there anything in Q2 mix or anything that we should be aware of that would result in those margins diminishing from here or are those sustainable at these levels? Chris O\u2019Herlihy: Yes, so we\u2019ll say the construction margins are very sustainable. We\u2019ve been improving via the construction for a long time now and certainly for the last few quarters here we've been in the mid to high 20s in terms of margin and construction. So despite the price cost environment, we\u2019re seeing nice organic growth in construction. We are getting nice price realization and so we\u2019re then starting to expect the margins there to be sustainable.  Surely in Test and Measurement margins again you know currently in the high 20s here and have been like that for a long time. The segment that we like in terms of level of differentiation, I believe it\u2019s our customer problems. So we don\u2019t see any issue with sustaining margins in either Test & Measurement or Construction. Ann Duignan : Okay. [Cross Talk] Go ahead, sorry. Scott Santi : I was going to add some color commentary that I think I was adding up the time when Chris was reading the comments, but I think we said all time record margins for Q2 and Q3 of our seven segments despite the price cost environment. And I\u2019ll just circle back to a comment I made, which is you know there is still room to run in terms of structural margin improvement across the company. We got 150 basis points of enterprise initiative benefit in this quarter. So there is, you know these are certainly sustainable improvements and performance and we expect to continue to do better as we go forward. Ann Duignan : Okay, I\u2019ll leave it there in the interest of time. I appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies. Stephen Volkmann : Hey! Good morning guy. Maybe just following up on the comment about Enterprise Initiatives, you know you're talking about I think 100 basis points for the year, but you did 150 this quarter, I think 120 if I have my number's right. Last quarter you\u2019ve been over overachieving. Did those slow down for some reason or is there a chance that you did better than 100 this year? Chris O\u2019Herlihy: Yeah, I mean, I think we are saying 100 plus, so we will do better than 100 this year. And there's still a lot of interest on our price initiatives bought on sourcing and in \u201920. You know these are all initiatives and activities that are very granular within out segments. Within each division there is a host of activity that we are working on. And actually have been working on not just this year, but even starting last year, so we entered the year with a fair bit of tailwind in terms of enterprise initiatives. So we would expect to do a 100 plus for sure. Stephen Volkmann : And then maybe just following up on this price cost kind of question, just curious about how you think about the policy here. I mean it doesn't feel like there's a lot of pushback on pricing in any of the kind of verticals that we touch. You know why not price $4 plus margin, you know why kind of create that headwind? Scott Santi : Well, I don't know. You know the headwind from my perspective is a percentage headwind, it's not an earnings headwind. You know the overall position that we wanted, we\u2019ve created an incredibly profitable economic engine and the most important job we have is to grow it organically, and so from the standpoint of \u2013 to the extent we don't have to go up as high as other people do, we are leveraging that strong position and we can translate that into incremental share, that\u2019s the preferred option.  I don\u2019t want our people fighting over the next incremental. We ought to get the cost for sure, but then let\u2019s get on to talk with our customers about how we can help them improve their business you know operationally, technically from a sales standpoint and so that\u2019s basically it. We can certainly do more to get all distraction and try to price optimize in the short term, but I don\u2019t think that services our long term interest very well. We make plenty money, you know this is not a... Stephen Volkmann : Fair point, thank you. Take care. Operator : And your next questions from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeff Sprague : Hey, thanks. Good morning everyone. A - Scott Santi : Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Good morning. Could we just drill a little bit into the kind of the whole availability issue? We talked about you know price cost and obviously it's tied to the availability of supplies, but outside of auto which is very visible and obvious, are there clear places in your portfolio where either you're struggling to meet demand because of availability in your supply chain or your feeling on the customer side, perhaps you can deliver, but they don't want it, because they've got problems elsewhere down the line. Just wonder if you could give us some perspective on that, and any color on to what degree if any it may, just wondering the top line here in the quarter or into the balance of the year. Scott Santi : I\u2019ll give you some overall color and then certainly let Chris giving some segment level, sort of business levels specifics if some things come to mind for him.  I would say, in terms of overall color, as we talked to our businesses around the world, there's no question that it is a daily battle that maintained supplier division as we service our customers. I would absolutely contend that we are doing better than most for a couple of reasons : One is the fact that we have long head, localized supply relationships with local manufacturing facilities, serving our customers locally. And then the other fact is what I \u2013 we talked about in our remarks, the fact that we kept all our people though the pandemic. We have not to scramble to bring people back.  So normally our supply chain manufacturing operations function in a very simple automated way. It\u2019s definitely taking a lot more, let\u2019s call it boot force for now, but I think we are not hearing any big issues from a standpoint of our own ability to supply our customers. It doesn't mean that there's not an occasional you know $2 bracket that shows up late and there is a couple of other machines that can\u2019t go on just making that out, but that\u2019s \u2013 I'm sure that\u2019s the case, but ultimately given the service level that we are now entering, you know as a standard part of our operating practices I would say that \u2013 I\u2019m very comfortable saying that we are working a lot harder than we normally have to, but ultimately performing pretty well.  I would say that the supply chain area beyond auto is much more of an issue for us on the demand side than the supply side and I\u2019d point to a couple of things, but we are seeing a lot of sort of timing changes in terms of orders and requirements, not because we can't deliver something, but because another supplier can deliver something to a customer. And I\u2019d also points to the $200 million of backlog, and we've talked about this before.  You know we should \u2013 basically today is what our customers ordered yesterday and so we operate with very little backlog and the fact that we built a couple of hundred million of backlog, I can\u2019t analyze every dollar of it, but my contention would be that that's a lot more to do the \u2013 for the customer delays than it is our own ability to supply.  And with that we\u2019ll see the $60 million in auto plus the $200 million in backlog, that\u2019s another 10 percentage points of organic growth in the second quarter. You know again, I\u2019m not necessarily contending that all of it could have gone, but my bet would be most of it and that\u2019s the only thing\u2026 [Cross Talk] Chris O\u2019Herlihy: Yeah, it\u2019s the only thing I would say is just our, this cost comps, I think all over its going to be 18-24, because here it really creates a lot of the packages for us in terms of more sort of simplified and streamlined cost offerings. Obviously it results in simplification of raw materials and components and that simplification and focus also extends to our suppliers. The key part of our strategy and its worked for us for many years is to have these you know very strong and long lasting supplier partnerships and we are a key customer for most of our raw material suppliers. This becomes really, really important when supply chains become constrained and releasing that work to our benefit here in the last 12 months. Jeff Sprague : Great! And just a second question. Just on the M&A pipeline, obviously you don't have the deal until you've got something to do it now. But you know can you give us a sense of how active your pipeline is? Have you been able to cultivate things, you know maybe handicap the odds of some of the things kind of coming in your strike zone? Scott Santi : Well, I would tell you that we are excited about MPS. We are working hard to get that one finished off and you know that is what's kind of $50 million of annualized revenue, so that\u2019s you know certainly enough work to do for a little while anyway. I don\u2019t want to unnecessarily comment on the pipeline as much as to say we remain and will remain very interested in adding high quality businesses to the company, but so the timing of all that is always a subject of the quality of what opportunities present themselves.  So there\u2019s a lot of stuff going on, but it\u2019s not a matter of how big or small the pipeline is; it's more we're looking for a much narrower set of criteria than I think, so it's more a function of the quality of what\u2019s there than the quantity. Jeff Sprague : Okay, understood, thanks. I\u2019ll pass this on. Operator : And your next question comes from a line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning everyone. A - Scott Santi : Good morning Joe. Joe Ritchie : So I know that, I know you guys guide to organic growth trends, you know really not improving or declining and that\u2019s your power house, that\u2019s just in your policy going forward. I guess when I think about each of the different segments and how you're thinking about the sequentials from here, I don't really think about a lot of seasonality in your business, but maybe perhaps the construction business right, being a little bit seasonally weak during the fourth quarter. How are you thinking about sequential revenue for the segments throughout the rest of the year? We see obviously you've given us the auto guide, but really the other segments? A - Scott Santi : Yeah, you know I covered that I think overall in my comments, but you know we have sort of camped down the run rate that you know in terms of the guidance relative to run rate. You know Chris talked to you about the fact that in the second quarter we saw organic growth rates accelerate by a net 3 percentage points of beyond seasonality, and we basically did project that signal manning forward through the balance of the year because of the supply risk involved, the supply chain risk to our customers, so we\u2019re playing that pretty conservative. And I think that ultimately is going to have more to do with the pace of the organic from here than you know trends of demand. There\u2019s plenty of demand out there. It\u2019s a matter of can our customers get enough raw material to support it. Joe Ritchie : Got it. And maybe Scott just following on that, like is there \u2013 you know you had mentioned about involving the Food Equipment business. Is it like where you're building backlog right now, is that \u2013 are you seeing that as more kind of like a 2022 opportunity, just given what you're seeing from a supply chain standpoint or does he expect some of that to convert in the second half. Scott Santi : I'd say some of it is to convert. I think the only one you know that's probably you know definitely into 2022 is the loan that Chris mentioned and not where this, you know this dip sort of doesn\u2019t look like it's going to get resolved any time soon. But I'd say most of the \u2013 the rest of that backlog, that $200 million, I would expect that to \u2013 given our customers can take it, because they can get the other components of things they need, that should certainly convert in the back half.  I think our \u2013 you know it just doesn't make sense to up the revenue guide when you know everyone is so supply constrained right now. That I can't say it any more simply than that and that's how we see how things play out. It just doesn\u2019t make sense to take things too far from where they are now in terms of run rate until we see how that all \u2013 how the supply issues play out in affecting our customers willingness to, you know the ability to take what they\u2019ve ordered from us and with more. But I would say it is definitely you know from simpler border rates and the overall demand is definitely enough there to do you know well better than what's in our guide is this pricing situation. It's you know significantly better from here forward. Joe Ritchie : Okay, yeah \u2013 no, that's helpful. I guess maybe one follow-up on price cost. I know we talked about it a little bit. You did mention that 3Q is expected to get a little bit worse from 2Q because they\u2019ll be put through some pricing actions in 2Q. So on this I guess I\u2019m just wondering, does this take a little bit of time for some of the pricing actions to take hold or why would the headwind get worse than 3Q? Chris O\u2019Herlihy: Yeah Joe, I mean the only reason it\u2019s getting worse in Q3 is because of the pace of inflation in Q2. We saw significant pick-up in pace in Q2 and obviously there\u2019s a little bit of a lag, so we see a little bit of a worsening in Q3 based on what we know today, based on the cost increases we see and the known price increases, we see a little worsening in Q3 from Q2, only on the base of the pace of inflation in Q2. Joe Ritchie : Got it. Okay, great. Thank you both. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Jamie Cook : Hey! I guess just two questions, one following up on the revenue outlook. Understanding why you\u2019d guide sort of conservatively, but is there any way you can help us understand just what you're seeing in terms of percentage increases on the order intake rate, like by segment just to help us sort of understand what's out there, and to what degree are you concerned? Is there any sort of double ordering that's happening as customers are worried they can't get stuff? And then I guess my follow-up question, obviously the organic growth is performed very stronger. There's particular segments or customers where you are more sort of confident that some of these, you know this organic growth is associated with you know market share wins that are actually you know sort of sustainable from here on. Thank you. Chris O\u2019Herlihy: So in terms of you know acceleration of organic growth, you know we're seeing it. Obviously we talked about all our work, it's going in a different way, but certainly in Food Equipment, Test & Measurement, electronics and welding you know are certainly growing faster than we expected earlier in the year, so we\u2019re seeing a nice acceleration there.  And you know we have no reason to believe that it's not sustainable based on our conversation with our customers, the order patterns and so on and you know obviously as we want to talk about the factor \u2013 it\u2019s already busy here in terms of this winged recovery initiative you know over the last 12 months and you know it is still kind of early to quantify this.  We\u2019re feeling pretty good about how we\u2019re positioned and we \u2013 as you know we're very intentionally remain fully staffed to serve our customers, protect the investments and people and in addition to the customer backed innovation and suite of excellent and certainly there\u2019s a lot of anecdotal evidence out there that would say that that is turning into share gains and if I ever just maybe highlight some, get the sort of examples and like sort of equipment where you know high level product availability, maintaining service level excellence as Scott talked about and being able to respond in supply where a competitor could not is enabling several share gain and incremental wins from competition in large chains, both in food service and food retail. Another example might be in farmers [ph] influence, automotive aftermarket. Staying invested here we will sustain our sales and innovation focus, coupled with high service levels means we grew as I mentioned in the commentary, automotive aftermarket grew by 33% in the quarter and this is well above customer point sales growth indicating that we are getting share in a meaningful way. And in our measurements and construction in our roofing businesses, in association of 45% in the quarter, again we\u2019d see very clearly we're gaining share there on competition who have certainly been supply chain and operationally constrained, extending delivery times and so on and we continue to maintain differentiated service levels. So again, somewhat anecdotal, somewhat early in the window recovery strategy, but certainly ample evidence that we seem to be regaining share, and these are just a small selection of illustrative examples of tech products that we\u2019re making across our seven segments. Jamie Cook : Okay, thank you. Anything on the order intake if you can share with us just what you're seeing, that you saw that by segment. A - Scott Santi : You know we saw in acceleration the three segments that I mentioned in\u2026 [Cross Talk]. Jamie Cook : I was just trying to get numbers. You know I mean if you can\u2019t, that\u2019s fine. A - Scott Santi : Yeah, orders pretty much equalize shipments for last because of what I said, you know what we \u2013 what \u2013 our customers\u2019 orders we shipped the next day, I would say that also your closer to about \u2013 I think you used the term double dip ordering in terms of customers trying to hedge you know orders more because they can\u2019t get supply. I actually can\u2019t say that we\u2019re not seeing any of that, but I would say that it would be much lower for us because of the fact that our service levels are so good and our customers understand you know in terms of orders shipped.  So you know some maybe certainly ordering more than they would normally, because they are concerned about things, but I will think that even in terms of our service levels we wouldn\u2019t \u2013 there wouldn\u2019t be anything \u2013 that wouldn\u2019t be a significant part of the overall demand picture for us. Jamie Cook : Okay, thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : Thanks, good morning and best wishes to Michael, hoping he gets a speedy recovery. Scott Santi : Thanks Nigel. Nigel Coe : That\u2019s okay. I want to go back to the supply constraint. Where are you kind of most \u2013 and I thought of automotive which was predictable, but where are you most concerned? I\u2019m thinking about maybe electronics perhaps tools you know with the barriers, but what are you monitoring most closely in terms of not just for Illinois Tool Works but for your, you know your supply chain, which business or geography are you most concerned?0 A - Chris O\u2019Herlihy: Yeah, I would say electronics in general you know have been fairly constrained, so that impacts segments like well in Food Equipment, Test & Measurement and electronics will be one that I would call out. The [inaudible] obviously has been across the board in terms of steel, resins, chemicals and electronics, but in terms of supply chain constrains, electronics and certainly you know steel related business. Scott Santi : But beyond that I don't think there's anything that really concentrates up. You know I think again the color from our businesses, you know it's something different every day, but you know it\u2019s not a \u2013 you now it takes a lot more work and it's not even the big dollar stuff. It's again the $2 bracket, but it is a real offer right now, significantly more than\u2026 [Cross Talk] Nigel Coe : And then [inaudible] the two best offices because of the high volume service plan. I wouldn\u2019t think it could have created a big issue for you, but maybe address those two points and because that you know it could change very quickly, so I\u2019m just wondering you know what impact from the spot purchases and the 3x betting. Scott Santi : Spot purchases, if you can explain that a little more Chris. A - Chris O\u2019Herlihy: I think given another company would purchase them with some hedges\u2026 A - Scott Santi : Yeah, we don\u2019t have it and we don\u2019t forward by. So you know everything \u2013 the current costs are flushing through right now, yeah. Chris O\u2019Herlihy: And the second part of your question is I think related to freight and logistics, is that correct? And so with freight and logistics, I mean obviously there's no impact for us, but I don\u2019t see a less of an impact than some of our peers maybe on the basis that the produce what we sell \u2013 the produce and so what we sell, the philosophy that we\u2019ve long had that certainly mitigated the impact of freight and logistics on our cost structure and availability. Nigel Coe : Thanks guys. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Scott Davis : Hey, good morning guys. A - Scott Santi : Good morning Scott. Scott Davis : Hope Mike feels better. There must be a good story, backstory to the sports injury. Scott Santi : It\u2019s his to tell. Scott Davis : Hopefully he didn\u2019t join some sort of football team or something, you know the over 50 football team. Anyways, I only have one question. It\u2019s just on MTS. When you bring in MTS, how do you \u2013 how do you cadence 80/20? You know I mean how do you bring in a deal of this size, kind of bring 80/20 in without really disrupting it. Is there kind of a playbook there you guys can walk through and help us understand? A - Scott Santi : Yeah, absolutely Scott. So obviously you know we\u2019ve completely reinvigorated 80/20 of the last two years with this front to back process and the fact that we \u2013 the process that we will employ on MTS is exactly the same process that we have employed on our 84 divisions across the company.  So we can\u2019t really decide on what to do, we can\u2019t really decide on how to do it and we can\u2019t really decide on what the outcome should be when we get it done properly. Coupled with the fact that we\u2019ve built a tremendous amount of capability in the company, our folks can go in and help you know guide MTS on the 80/20 journey.  So we feel very confident in the playbook, we feel very confident in our capability. We think the raw material in MTS are fantastic with respect to 80/20 opportunity, that\u2019s one of the key attractions for us and when we bought it. The other thing I\u2019d say is that we got a very similar business in our portfolio, in Test & Measurements and this time where we\u2019ve done this successfully before. So we are very confident that we can do this and do this successfully. Scott Santi : [Cross Talk] It\u2019s probably a three to five years process, and part of that is not disrupting the business. Chris O\u2019Herlihy: It\u2019s really the pace that makes sense, we are in no rush here. Scott Davis : Okay, super helpful. Good luck! Thank you. Scott Santi : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Mig Dobre with Baird. Mig Dobre : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Going back to your comments on pricing, obviously a lot changed over the past three months and can you maybe clarify for us what impact pricing had to your adjustment, to the overall organic growth guidance? Scott Santi : For the year? Mig Dobre : Yes, please, thanks. Scott Santi : Yeah, it's 1%. Mig Dobre : Okay, I'm presuming then that. Chris O\u2019Herlihy: That was the 1% we added to organic, yeah. Mig Dobre : Okay, that's kind of what I figured, but I just wanted to confirm. So you know if this is impacting the back half of the year primarily, then at lease presumably you\u2019ll have a couple of points of growth just from pricing in the back half.  If I look at the implied guidance, credits, the high-end we are talking about growing something like 7% organically, a couple of points of that is just your incremental price, and I mean look Scott, you were talking earlier, saying hey, I'm trying to take a conservative approach here, but at least to me when I'm adjusting out for this pricing element and I think about the comparisons that are still you know fairly easy relative to the prior year, it just strikes me that you really are being conservative here in terms of how you're thinking about your business progression on a fixed price, on a core basis.  So just to kind of clarify this, is it that there\u2019s some lack of clarity as to where maybe demand is going to be because of what's happening with the supply chain, or is it that you're having some second thoughts with regards to how you're going to be able to convert revenue given your, some of the destruction that you're having to deal with. Scott Santi : It\u2019s the former not the latter, if I understand you correctly. Taking a risk for us by far is customer supply chain, and what that does to their demand patterns from here on out. It is \u2013 as I said before, it's about as volatile of a situation as I've seen in my career at ITW, and so I don't \u2013 I'm not trying to be mysterious about it. I think until we see that start to stabilize, it\u2019s just really hard to be comfortable sort of raising \u2013 I know we are serving the demand we have today really well and sort of run rate from the standpoint that our customers are able to sustain, and I think we are comfortable continuing to \u2013 our ability to do that will continue on for the back half.  There is a lot more orders and a lot more demand and that\u2019s again why we built backlog, that\u2019s \u2013 there is not a demand question. If we had, we \u2013 our customers had sort of unimpaired supply chains right now, we would have probably had 10 more points in the second quarter on this. It\u2019s not a fact, that\u2019s just my opinion. But you know just looking at the backlog, and so I think demand is certainly much stronger right now given the pace of the recovery, it\u2019s just the matter off from the standpoint of all the supply chain issues and the risks for our customers. Their pace of being able to \u2013 you know what they ultimately need from us. As I said it\u2019s just hard to justify going up with a lot of confidence from here, but it\u2019s more their supply side than their demand side, if that makes sense. Mig Dobre : Yeah, I think it does. The follow up to all of this is that we're starting to think about 2022 and you know if we're using your framework for the back half of \u201821 as a starting point and thinking about 2022. It begs the question as to how well growth is likely to look like next year, right, because there\u2019s nothing we can do when pricing normalizes next year, so you won't have the kind of tailwinds you have this year on that. Scott Santi : We are not thinking about \u201822 much yet, but I would just you know say as a general rule, a lot of the supply chain disruption I think just pushes, adds to the duration of the recovery. I think there is plenty of business now, and because all of it can't be satisfied, a point of demand now and Chris will gave an example of auto.  This $60 million we couldn't ship in audio in the second quarter, that's not going away, that\u2019s just getting pushed out. We got dealer inventories at all-time lows, you know I forget what it was, less than a month, maybe less than a month I think I saw you know and so to the extent, I don't think it's necessarily the worst thing in the world that all this demand that\u2019s there right now can\u2019t be fully serviced, because it\u2019s going to allow us to \u2013 again this recovery duration gets extended by another two to four quarters maybe. We\u2019ll think harder about that as we get to that part of the year. Mig Dobre : Okay, that's helpful. Lastly from me, on the top of M&A you talked about portions of your business that you consider for divestiture before, that you\u2019ve taken a step back on that this year. I'm sort of curious as activity has picked up multiples are pretty good. Will you reconsider this at a point of time down the like, maybe 2022? Scott Santi : Yes. Mig Dobre : Okay, thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from a line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Hi! Good morning. Maybe just a first question \u2013 good morning. Maybe just a first question around the free cash flow. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s been touched on yet. You know your inventories and receivables are up each sort of 100 million plus sequentially. Just wondered how you see working capital playing out in the second half and what we should think about that as a sort of cash flow item for the year as a whole.  And also sort of more broadly on the CapEx side of things, you know how much is your CapEx coming up this year and have you revised at all your sort of median term CapEx planning assumptions because of these constraints? Scott Santi : I think the best way to model our working capital requirements is our months on-hand and days sales outstanding. Sort of we managed the metrics on those. Generally speaking months on hand runs roughly 2.5 months, DSO I can\u2019t remember off the top of my head, but whatever the average is, 60-ish maybe, so that\u2019s where [inaudible] going to go.  Sales go up, month on hand is not going to go up, but the dollars invested, so today we stated that month on hand id going to go up. The same with receivables in terms of DSO. So it\u2019s not a \u2013 it\u2019s something that happens automatically. We don\u2019t have to sort of force that to happen, but as sales go up, inventory is going to go up and the month on hand is a function of that\u2019s how 80/20 works. There is some element of it, that give us you know we want X amount of inventory to be able to product the ability to react and respond to our customers, you know order today shipped tomorrow kind of system.  So I think that\u2019s the best guidance I can give you on working capital. It\u2019s just not let through and whether that\u2019s cash flow, it\u2019s not going to be \u2013 you know when you are jumping up as much as we did in Q2, where Q1 is going to obviously require some incremental working capital.  And then the other question, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m trying to do my best Michael impersonation here as I can, so I\u2019m trying to think hard. Julian Mitchell : No, no it was just around the capital spending and sort of the rate of [Cross Talk] Scott Santi : So CapEx, I think the plan for the year was up like $300 million or so. Karen Fletcher : $300 million is our target. Scott Santi : Yeah, for the year. So there is no incremental CapEx. We did differ some incremental capacity investments last year because of the pandemic, we didn\u2019t need them. Those are certainly all coming back on, but those are \u2013 you know we operate with another element of 80/20 as we want to be front end loaded on capacity, that\u2019s how we serve our customers. So as business continues to go forward, we will continue to invest and stay in that sort of increment, you know meaningful increment ahead of current demand, but that wouldn\u2019t be again something out of the normal of what we always do and it wouldn\u2019t be some big sort of lump coming through. Julian Mitchell : That\u2019s clear, thank you. And then just a quick follow-up on the auto OEM margins. Is the point that, you know after that step down sequentially in Q2, there is sort of 19%-ish level is a good base line or flow in the current sort of demand and cost environment. And so from here they move up sort of slowly given what\u2019s going, but 19 is where they should have bottomed out for now. Chris O\u2019Herlihy: Yeah, that\u2019s a fair assumption. But we are seeing a bottom out here and I think it will be a slow recovery, based on what we are seeing today, a slow recovery from here on out. Scott Santi : You must remember prior peak margins in auto, because it was probably 23 maybe. And so, there is still lot of item recovery to go in auto from where we were then and so I\u2019d say low to mid-20s is certainly achievable over time. Julian Mitchell : Thank you very much. Scott Santi : Sure. Operator : And your final question comes from the line of Joel Tiss with BMO. Joel Tiss : Hey there! Scott, you shouldn\u2019t be so hard on yourself. I think you guys sound a little less annoyed by how dumb all our questions are than usually. Scott Santi : Now you know where the [inaudible] of the group is. Joel Tiss : So, I have like one topic and just two different angles on it. One, can you give us any sense if you think the food industry is kind of distracted with all the consolidation that's going on? And then can we have a little more color on kind of what customers are back? You know our large pieces of your end markets still not really there; I'm thinking like airports and cafeterias and things like that. Can you just give us a little more, a little more detail around sort of the share gains and where the customers are? Thank you. Chris O\u2019Herlihy: Yes, so I don\u2019t know about this distraction from consolidation. I can tell you we are not distracted and we are basically focused on trying to win the recovery here, serve the needs of our customers with innovate new products and so on. So generally I think we're seeing some real nice recovery in food faster than actually than we thought at the beginning of the year. We are certainly seeing the benefit of staying invested in food.  Even obviously on price cost, in fact there\u2019s some uncertainly, but obviously that\u2019s \u2013 some of that relates to the fact that the price cost environment, some of these are pricing actions here in the second half.  We\u2019re concerned about the end markets. I mean basically with food, we are back to about \u2013 by the end of this year we expected back over 90% of the 2019 number, so faster than we though. And in terms of end markets, we are seeing a nice pickup in instructional, restaurants coming back, we mentioned restaurants being up 60%.  In terms of stuff that\u2019s coming back a little slower, I would say service if we point to serve in Europe as an example. Obviously with significantly lockdowns we are still dealing with over there, we\u2019ll probably come back a little slower there, but at least for the half. We think we\u2019ll see that pick up here in the second half, but generally most end markets are coming back. Lodging is a little slower I would say and transportation, right and airlines. Scott Santi : Transportation, for sure. Joel Tiss : That\u2019s great. Thank you very much. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. I'll now turn it back over to Karen. Karen Fletcher : Okay, thanks Adam. We appreciate you joining us this morning and if you have any follow-up questions, please let me know. Have a great day! Operator : Thank you for participating in today's conference call. All lines may disconnect at this time.",

[Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Karen Fletcher, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Karen Fletcher : Thanks, Tammy. Good morning, and welcome to ITW's Third Quarter 2021 Conference Call. I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi; and Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen. During today's call, we will discuss ITW's third quarter financial results and update our guidance for full year 2021. Slide 2 is a reminder that this presentation contains forward-looking statements. We refer you to the company's 2020 Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. This presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release. Please turn to Slide 3, and it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi. Scott Santi : Thank you, Karen. Good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, we saw continued strong growth momentum in 6 of our 7 segments and delivered excellent operational execution and financial results. Revenue grew 8% with organic growth of 6% and earnings per share of $2.02 was up 10%. At the segment level, organic growth was led by welding at plus 22%; food equipment at plus 19%; Test & Measurement and Electronics at plus 12% and specialty products at plus 8%. Our automotive OE segment continued to be impacted in the near term by auto production cutbacks associated with the well-publicized supply chain challenges affecting our auto customers. In Q3, auto production cutbacks ended up being significantly larger than what was projected heading into the quarter. And as a result, our auto OEM segment revenues were down 11% in Q3 versus the minus 2% we were expecting as of the end of June. In a very challenging environment, our teams around the world continue to do an exceptional job of executing for our customers and for the company. In Q3, our people leveraged the combination of ITW's robust and highly flexible 80/20 front-to-back operating system. The company is close to the customer manufacturing and supply chain capabilities and systems and our decision to stay fully staffed and invested through the pandemic to sustain world-class service levels for our customers. They also executed appropriate and timely price adjustments in response to rapidly rising raw material costs. And as a result, we were able to fully offset input cost increases on a dollar-for-dollar basis in Q3, resulting in 0 EPS impact from price cost in the quarter. And, by the way, our teams also managed to continue to drive progress on our long-term strategy, execute on our Win the Recovery positioning initiative and deliver another 100 basis points of margin improvement benefit from enterprise initiatives. Moving forward, we remain very focused on sustaining our growth momentum and on fully leveraging the competitive strength of the ITW business model and the investments we have made and continue to make in support of the execution of our enterprise strategy. Before turning it over to Michael, I want to thank all of our ITW colleagues around the world for all their efforts and for their dedication to keeping themselves and their ITW colleagues safe to serving our customers with excellence and to driving continued progress on our path to ITW's full potential. Michael, over to you. Michael Larsen : Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. As Scott said, demand remained strong in Q3 with total revenue of $3.6 billion an increase of 8% with organic growth of 6%. Growth was positive in 6 or 7 segments, ranging from 3% to 22% and in all geographic regions, led by North America, up 9%; Europe, up 1% and; Asia, up 5%. China was up 2% versus prior year and up 6% sequentially. GAAP EPS of $2.02 was up 10% and included a onetime tax benefit of $0.06. Operating income increased 7% and operating margin was flat at 23.8% despite significant price cost headwinds. Enterprise Initiatives were real positive again this quarter at 100 basis points, as was volume leverage, which contributed more than 100 basis points. Thanks to a great effort by our businesses, price cost was EPS-neutral in Q3 but still dilutive to operating margin percentage by 200 basis points as raw material cost increases further escalated in the third quarter. Throughout 2021, our businesses have quickly and decisively responded to raw material and logistics cost inflation with pricing actions in alignment with our policy to fully offset these cost increases with price on a dollar-for-dollar basis. And we've talked about this before, but given the current environment, I'll remind you that we don't hedge. So current cost inflation is always moving through our businesses in real time. After-tax return on invested capital was 28.5% and free cash flow was $548 million. Free cash flow conversion was 86% as our businesses have been very intentional about adding inventory to both support our growth and to mitigate supply chain risk and sustained world-class service levels for our customers. Overall, for the quarter, then strong growth in 6 of 7 segments and excellent operational and financial execution across the board. Let's go to Slide 4 for segment results. And before we get to the segment detail, the data on the left side of the slide illustrates our strong Q3 results with and without automotive OEM. I wanted to highlight 2 key points. The first is the benefit we derive from our high-quality diversified business portfolio in terms of the strength, resilience and consistency of ITW's financial performance. which is enabling us, in this case, to power through significant near-term headwinds in our largest segment and still deliver top-tier overall performance. The second is the accelerating growth momentum with strong core earnings leverage we're generating across the company. Excluding our auto OEM segment, given the issues affecting that market right now, the rest of the company collectively delivered organic growth of 11%. Operating income growth of 14% and an operating margin of 25% plus in Q3. As you can see on this slide, if you eliminate the price/cost impact, our core incrementals were a very strong 52% in the third quarter, which points to the quality of growth and profitability leverage that define the core focus of our business model and strategy. Now let's take a closer look at our segment performance in Q3, beginning with automotive OEM on the right side of this page. Organic revenue was down 11%, with North America down 12%, Europe, down 18%; and China, up 2%. And as Scott mentioned, supply chain-related production cutbacks were much larger in Q3 than what we and most, if not all, external auto industry forecasters were expecting heading into the quarter. While conditions in the auto market are obviously very challenging in the near term, but really good news from our standpoint is that the eventual and inevitable recovery of the auto market will be a major source of growth for ITW over an extended period of time once the current supply chain issues begin to improve and ultimately get resolved. Between now and whenever that is, we will remain fully invested and strongly positioned to support our customers and seize incremental share gain opportunities as production accelerates coming out the other side of this situation. Turning to Slide 5 for Food Equipment, and organic revenue growth was very strong at 19% and the Food Equipment recovery that began in Q2 continues to gain strength. North America was up 18% with equipment up 20% and service up 14%. Institutional revenue, which is about 1/3 of our revenue, increased more than 20%, with strength in education, up over 40% and health care and lodging growth of around 20%. Restaurants were up almost 50% with strength across the board. Strong demand is evident internationally as well with Europe up 20% and Asia Pacific, up 23%. Equipment sales led the way up 26% with service growth of 8%. In our view, this segment is in the early stages of recovery as evidenced by revenues that are still below pre-COVID levels. Test & Measurement and Electronics organic revenue was strong with growth of 12%. Test & Measurement was up 15%, driven by continued strength in customer CapEx spend and in our businesses that serve the semiconductor space. Electronics grew 8% and operating margin was 26.8%. So moving to Slide 6. Welding demand continued to be very strong with organic revenue growth of 22%. Equipment revenue was up 25% and consumables grew 18%. Our industrial businesses increased 32% in the commercial business, which sells to small businesses and individual users grew 18%. North America was up 24% and international growth was 12% with continued recovery in oil and gas, which was up 9%. Welding had an operating margin of 30% in the quarter. Polymers & Fluids organic growth was 3%, with demand holding steady at the elevated levels that began in Q3 of last year. And as such, had a tough comp of plus 6% a year ago. In Q3, growth was led by the Polymers business, up 8% with continued strength in MRO and heavy industry applications. Automotive aftermarket grew 4% with sustained strength in the retail channel. And Fluids was down 5% due mostly to a decline in pandemic-related hygiene products versus prior year. Margins were 24.2% with more than 250 basis points of negative margin impact from price cost driven by significantly higher costs for resins and silicone. Moving to Slide 7. And a similar situation with construction, where organic growth was also up 3% and also on top of a strong year-ago growth rate of plus 8%. All 3 regions delivered growth with North America up 2%, with residential renovation up 1%, on top of a plus 14% comp a year ago and commercial was up 10%. Europe was up 8% and Australia and New Zealand was up 2%. Specialty organic revenue was up 8%, driven by continued recovery in North America, which was up 15%, and international was down 4%. Equipment sales were up 10% with consumables up almost 8%. Let's move on to Slide 8 for an update on our full year 2021 guidance. As you saw in the press release, we're updating our GAAP EPS guidance to a range of $8.30 to $8.50 which incorporates the impact of actual and anticipated lower automotive customer production levels in Q3 and Q4 versus our previous guidance on July 30. We now expect the Automotive OEM segment revenue to be down about 15% in the second half, including being down 20% in Q4 versus the forecast of roughly flat second half auto OEM revenues that was embedded in our previous guidance. All other segments remain on track or better versus our previous guidance. Our $8.40 midpoint equates to earnings growth of 27% for the full year. We now expect full year revenue to be in the range of $14.2 billion to $14.3 billion, which is up 13% at the midpoint, with organic growth in the range of 11% to 12%. Of that organic growth rate of 11% to 12% volume growth, including share gains are 8% with price of 3% to 4%. For the full year, we expect operating margin of approximately 24%, which is up 100 basis points versus last year. And the fact that we're expanding margins at all in this environment is pretty strong performance, considering that we now expect raw material costs to be up 9% or more than $400 million year-over-year, which is more than 4x our expectation coming into this year. Our businesses are on track to offset raw material cost increases with pricing actions on a dollar-per-dollar basis, which, as you know, is EPS neutral but margin dilutive. As raw material costs and consequently, price have gone up more than what we predicted in our previous guidance, we now estimate margin dilution percentage impact from price cost for the full year at about 150 basis points versus our previous expectation of 100 basis points. These margin headwinds though, will be offset by strong volume leverage of about 250 basis points and another solid contribution from enterprise initiatives of more than 100 basis points. Free cash flow is expected to be approximately 90% of net income as we continue to prioritize sustaining our world-class service levels for our customers in this challenging environment, and as such, we will continue to invest in additional working capital to support our growth and mitigate supply chain risks. Our updated guidance is based on an expected tax rate for Q4 of 23% to 24% for a full year tax rate of approximately 19% to 20%. And as per usual process, our guidance excludes any impact from the previously announced acquisition of the MTS Test and Simulation business. We are awaiting one final regulatory approval and expect to receive that and close the transaction in Q4. So in summary, this will be a record year for ITW with double-digit organic growth, margin expansion, strong cash flow and EPS growth of 25% plus. We expect this strong demand momentum to continue in Q4 and well into next year with an additional boost from automotive OEM likely at some point in 2022 as the supply chain issues there begin to improve. ITW remains very well positioned to continue to deliver differentiated best-in-class performance as we leverage our diversified high-quality business portfolio, the competitive strength of ITW's proprietary business model and our team's proven ability to execute at a very high level in any environment. With that, Karen, I'll turn it back to you. Karen Fletcher : Thanks, Michael. Operator, can you please open up the lines for questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeffrey Sprague : And maybe just on - so to start. Could you speak to what, if any, kind of maybe whipsaw effect that's going on as it relates to inventories. Just really trying to think about kind of how and when your sales might fully recouple with production? Or do you feel like they are fully coupled at this point? So any kind of nuances there to be aware of as we try to get out of this point. Scott Santi : Yes. I don't know a whole lot of nuances. I know that our customers expect us to be able to - as we've talked many times before, we work today, we ship tomorrow. In the auto space, we are certainly giving quarterly guides from our customers in terms of their production forecast. And obviously, those have been more volatile than normal of late. But I would say that we're not - there may be a little bit of inventory cushioning going on if you look at sort of build rates relative to our sales I think our sales were actually higher than production declines in Q3 by sort of an incremental margin about 3 percentage points. I don't know the exact number. But - so there may be a little bit of cushion building there just given the overall environment. But I would say once this thing starts to turn around, that we should see a pretty immediate effect. Jeffrey Sprague : And Scott, would you speak also just to the activity of your M&A pipeline. It looks like we're close to getting MTS done. Are you working an active pipeline at this point? Scott Santi : We've talked about this many times before. We are a very interesting opportunity to require. We get things run by us all the time. We have a very clear and well-defined view of what fits our strategy and our financial criteria. And so there are things that are continuously being evaluated. But it's just a matter of the right opportunity presenting itself as we go forward, and that was certainly the case with MTS, and I expect that there will be others at some point. But I would not speculate as to one. Jeffrey Sprague : And just one quick house cleaning one for Michael. The unallocated cost has kind of been running higher all year and bumped up a little bit more? Like what's going on there? And what should we expect? Michael Larsen : Yes, I think during the last four quarters, we're averaging about $30 million or so. And there are certain costs that we don't allocate out to the segments, example is health and wealth are costs are going up year-over-year. And there's really a laundry list of things there. I would assume that we'll stay somewhere in that 30% to 40% range on a go-forward basis. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Scott Davis : I love your slide deck. 6 real slides, 15 minutes of prepared comments, that's best-in-class from what I can tell. I appreciate the brevity and the information. Anyways, just switching gears a little bit. I mean it's a little bit of a hard to perhaps measure, but your comment maintaining world-class service levels. When you think about your on-time deliveries kind of today versus where they were few quarters ago versus perhaps pre-pandemic? Are they back up to kind of comparable levels? Did they ever slip that much? I'm sure your competitors - some of your competitors probably had major problems. Scott Santi : Yes. It is a bit of a summation of a number of different cases, but I would say, certainly, there are a number of our businesses that have sustained their traditional order and they ship tomorrow kinds of service levels throughout this environment, although I have had to certainly work a lot harder with a lot more brute force given the environment to make that happen. In some other cases, I'm thinking about, we've gone from ship tomorrow in order today to ship in a week. But I'm also thinking of cases where we've got people we compete with in certain markets that are now quoting deliveries into next year. So I think from a standpoint of relative advantage, I think we are - again, without 84 different cases, I can't necessarily excite every exact one of them, but my bet is that we are - that the relative advantage that we have is actually increased in that regard in terms of our ability to deliver in our service level to our customers in this pandemic period. Scott Davis : And does that make it, Scott, easier to get price than given the value promise that you have in delivery and predictability and such that your customer doesn't have to hold a lot of extra inventory because they can have some faith that you guys are going to be there for them. Scott Santi : I would imagine that's certainly part of it. I think the overall dimension of the value add in terms of the IP relationship as we try to outserve to give our customers the best overall value prop in terms of both the performance of the products we supply them, the service we delivered put around those, and it's not just the delivery service, it's service those businesses where we have service positions like food equipment. And so I think in all of that, I think all of our customers are well aware of their raw material environment. So I think from the standpoint of overall value delivery, our value to them, to the environment that we're in and the fact that we're just trying to recover on a dollar for dollar, we're not trying to get the margin back. I think, as we said before, because we're interested in and expanding our relationships with those customers, I think all of that speaks to the fact that we've been able to recover dollar for dollar. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Jamie Cook : Good job given the challenging environment. I guess just my first question, just on the margins on the construction business. You were up, the margins were down a little. So just trying to get some color there and when we can see sort of margin recovery. And then my second question, can you just give us an update on sort of what the opportunities are sort of the M&A pipeline and could help - could that further supplement the growth opportunity going forward? Michael Larsen : Jamie, I think you may have missed it. We just talked about the M&A pipeline a few minutes ago with Jeff. So I'm going to skip that. Jamie Cook : I'm sorry [indiscernible]... Michael Larsen : It's okay, don't worry about it. I mean I think in terms of construction as we look at kind of the margins on a year-over-year basis, good enterprise initiative contributions, good volume leverage. And then the headwind is really on the price/cost side. So we talked in this segment, in particular, steel costs are a significant headwind. Obviously, offset with price on a dollar-for-dollar basis, like are in line with our policy here but still margin dilutive pretty significantly at over 300 basis points here in the third quarter. I think once the timing in terms of when is that going to be - when is that impact going to start to diminish is difficult to say. What we can say with a high degree of confidence is and also at this point to our track record, our ability to read and react to whatever cost increases come our way and respond appropriately and decisively with price. I think kind of that track record speaks for itself, and we'll continue to do that. And we're certainly hopeful that the worst is behind us, but we're not counting on that as we look forward. And so you'll probably see a little bit of margin pressure in construction again here in Q4 relative to Q3. Q4 has some - we've got a couple of less shipping days, seasonality, typically, we go down in Q4 relative to Q3. But I'd say in terms of the long term, structurally, construction margins are going to be back in the high 20s at some point here once these near-term issues get resolved. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Andrew Kaplowitz : So I know it's early to talk about '22, but maybe just big picture. Given the growth momentum in your businesses. Ex auto, up 11%, and auto potentially reflecting in '22, as you said. At this point, what's your conviction level that ITW can deliver, let's say, continuing above trend levels when we think about our longer-term goal of 3% to 5% organic growth. And maybe dovetailing with that, are any of your businesses actually snapping back faster than expected. Food equipment comes to mind that may continue to lead growth going into '22? Michael Larsen : Well, I think, Andy, like we said, I mean, we certainly have some really good momentum in our businesses in Q3 and Q4, if you kind of set the auto situation aside, those businesses are up 10% organically. And like you said, there's some really positive momentum, particularly in the more CapEx-oriented businesses. So welding, test and measurement, food equipment, and then I think like we said, once the automotive production challenges get resolved, I think we're set up really well for a strong recovery down the road. We think potentially in 2022, we'll see some positive momentum as well in automotive OEM. So we've not rolled up the plans yet fully embedded the plans fully for 2022 yet. But - and until we've done that, I don't really want to go comment too much. We'll give you a full update in February, like we always do when we provide guidance. But certainly, in terms of demand the volume leverage that goes with that, the momentum on still on enterprise initiatives 9 years in. Our ability to deal with whatever cost and supply chain issues come our way. I think we're really well set up for 2022 and beyond. Andrew Kaplowitz : Michael, that's helpful. And then you mentioned Q4, I mean there is some normal seasonality. You mentioned less shipping days. Obviously, you're forecasting EPS in the middle of the range to be down a little in Q3. Is there anything else going on? Is it maybe a lag in how costs still hit the P&L in auto and maybe polymers and fluids? And then would you say that Q4 maybe is the peak negative margin impact from materials and resins and that kind of stuff. Michael Larsen : Well, I hope so. We're not counting on it. I think if they don't go up anymore. Yes, look, what I can say just on the materials, I think the rate of increase - from Q2 to Q3, we saw a big step-up in our raw material cost inflation. I think it's unlikely we'll see the same thing here in Q4. I mean, we're already through October. But beyond that, who knows, I think, like I said, it's a typical seasonality for us. We go down from Q3 to Q4, revenues are down. Margins are down. We've got 2 less shipping days. Automotive OEM, we said down 20% year-over-year. The other 6 segments will all have positive organic growth. Margin performance in those segments will be similar to Q3, if not a little bit better. And then you just need to adjust for the tax rate, the discrete item, we gave you the detail on that in Q3 versus Q4. And then there is a little bit of currency headwind, which is really more of a rounding, but we have a little bit more currency headwind in Q4 than Q3. So - you put all of that together, you get to what hopefully is a risk-adjusted pretty good outlook for the fourth quarter, and we'll see where we go from here. So... Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Ann Duignan : I'm laughing because it's like 20 years later. Perhaps just digging a little bit more. I know you've talked a lot about the momentum going into 2022, but you said in your nice brief opening comments, that other than automotive, some of your other businesses were actually doing better than you had expected. If you could just expand on that a little bit. And then on the food service equipment side, particularly on institutional, is there any risk that there's some pull forward of demand, a lot of institutions curtailed by the federal government with COVID aid. I mean, are you hearing anything about that driving demand on the institutional side. So broadly, first and then maybe a little bit more on the drivers of demand in Food Equipment. Michael Larsen : Yes. I think your first question kind of, I think, was what improved here relative to expectations. I mean food equipment and welding, certainly test and measurement. We did talk about on the last call, we had some onetime equipment orders in Q2. If you take those out, the momentum is really strong as well in the test and measurement business on the back of strong demand on the semiconductor side. So I'd point to those 3 as the strongest. In terms of the institutional side, we really don't think that there's a significant impact there. I mean from pull forward, overall, in the institutional side was up, like we said 20%, education was up 40%, but health so was health care. Health care was up 20%. So we don't really think that there's a significant impact. And we certainly haven't seen anything slowing down on the institutional side or really any of the other kind of end markets within Food Equipment. Ann Duignan : Okay. And then just following up on the Food Equipment side, are you seeing any changes in the types of equipment being demanded coming out of COVID, thinking about the changes to quick serve or to any restaurant side. Any notable like secular or structural changes in the types of equipment that are being ordered? Michael Larsen : Not really, Ann. No, I think this is very similar to kind of our normal product mix, if you like. So there's no real impact from that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joseph Ritchie : Can we spend a minute just talking about auto OEM margins and pricing - So my understanding is that historically, you guys price when you win your platforms, and it's difficult sometimes to get back and try to get price from auto OEMs? And so what I'm trying to understand, I guess, is like at what point do we start to see kind of the equation turn positive for you from a price cost perspective and thinking about the potential recovery for those margins longer term? Scott Santi : Yes, our - structurally derived under normal circumstances that generally, the pricing is much more sort of contractually negotiated in the auto space relative to the rest of our businesses. What I would say in regards to this current situation is the delta of inflation, raw material cost is certainly one where we're having discussions about with our customers about needing to adjust that. And we're not clearly the only ones in that respect with our auto customers. So we're working through that. I would say it's certainly - it remains the segment with the biggest lag in terms of our ability to recover, but ultimately, those - we're going to - our approach there is the same as it is in the rest of the company is that we're going to expect to get full recovery on the dollar amount of inflation that we're seeing. And I'd say the margin issue there is sort of the price cost is somewhat of an issue in the short run, but it's much more value. There's a lot of volume leverage there. And as we start - shipments start improving, volumes start to recover given some of the supply chain snacks get resolved, then we'll have - there's nothing that I see that won't get us back to sort of prior peak in terms of auto margins and have them go up from there as we grow that business. Michael Larsen : Yes. And if it helps, Joe. I'll just add, if you're a little worried about margins here in the near term in auto. I mean, I think we just did 17%, which I think is in this industry is probably top-tier performance, if not best-in-class. And I think in Q4, we expect maybe the typical step down from Q3 to Q4, but margins will still be solidly in the mid-teens. Overall, for the company, I think what we're - what's implied in our guidance is operating margins for Q4 and that 22%, 23% range. And so hopefully, that helps you quantify anything that you may be worried about in terms of the margin performance here. Joseph Ritchie : Yes. No, that's really helpful. I appreciate that color from both of you. And I guess just my one follow-up is just on MTS. It's funny, like I almost had forgotten that you guys had acquired the company or to or in the process of acquiring the company. I guess - can you elaborate a little bit on what's taking so long? I think I think you've got announced in the first quarter. And then... Scott Santi : Yes, I don't want to do that, Joe. We're at the I don't know, 2-yard lines. So let's just leave things where they are, and we'll get it over the goal line here soon. Joseph Ritchie : Okay. Is there anything you can tell us about the accretion from the business? Because we have it kind of sized like roughly $500 million business with like high 20s type gross margin. So any thoughts on potential accretion into 2022 if it closes this year? Michael Larsen : I think in year one, kind of we've said EPS neutral, we think that's still the case. I mean there's going to be a little bit of purchase accounting upfront here. And we didn't buy this business for what it's going to contribute to EPS or not in 2022. This is really much more of a long-term play. In terms of size, you can go back and look pre-COVID. I mean, your numbers are about right, a little over think it was $560 million in '19. The purchase price of $750 million is what we disposed entry margins, 6% EBIT in a space that we know quite well, and I think you're familiar with the Instron business. So we're really excited about getting this over the goal line and welcoming the MTS team to the ITW family and get to work. The one benefit is we've had a lot of time to get ourselves organized around integration planning and everything we've seen has confirmed what we saw in due diligence in terms of the raw material and how well we think this business is going to perform over the next 3,5 years plus. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Just wanted to follow up on the near-term organic growth outlook. So it looks like, I think, implied volume growth year-on-year is maybe down in Q4 for ITW overall year-on-year. If you've got sort of pricing up mid-single digits. I just wanted to check that that's roughly the right way to think about it on volumes? And is that auto OE-related anything else where the volumes are soft? And how confident you feel in that overall sort of market share recapture effort? Michael Larsen : But to answer your question, it's all automotive OEM here in Q4 with revenues down 20%. The other 6 or 7 businesses are performing like we said at a really high level combined. If you just look at the other 6 segments, organic growth is almost 10% in Q4, or projected to be 10% margins, 25% plus, similar to what they - these businesses did in Q3. And so it's really this near-term issue in auto OE that's making the numbers look a little different than what we normally do. Julian Mitchell : Understood. And then just circling back on the divestment aspect. I think you discussed acquisitions a couple of times. In the recent past, you've talked about divestments maybe being on the table next year. And certainly, we've started to see some other industrial companies divesting assets now because valuations are very, very elevated. Just wanted sort of your latest thoughts on that divestment aspects, clearly multiples are high, just wanted sort of if you are planning to wait a bit more just to let the operating profit keep growing. Michael Larsen : Well I think this is a reminder to - so you said we pulled back on these planned divestitures right when COVID hit. That was not a good time to sell these businesses and we had a few other things going on and we really - And I think we said this, we thought these businesses would be worth more coming out the other side, and that's absolutely going to be the case, not just in terms of the underlying performance of these businesses. It's significantly better than before. And then you're right, we expect multiples have certainly gone up. And so we think that early next year will be a good time to kind of relaunch some of these processes. If you go back to when we announced this program. this plan in 2018, we've got a little less than half of the divestitures completed at this point. So we've got another $300 million to $500 million worth of businesses here, revenues that we're taking a close look at. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : And Michael, good to have you back on the call. I want to just maybe ask Joe's question on a slightly different way. I know you have a multi-year contracts with the OEMs. But just given the extreme pressure on inflation, do you have any mechanism to pass along that by surcharges, et cetera? So just curious. And the spirit of my question is that if we do see volume recovering to maybe not 2022 but 2023 are we still going to be little bit under water on sort of the inflation recovery assuming you can't try to all the contracts in the . Michael Larsen : Scott talked about the contractual nature of the industry and so it's taking a little bit longer to get those prices adjusted and it's hard for us to say as we sit here how that going to play out next year. I think what happens ultimately - and we can go back and look what happened in '18 which was the last kind of inflationary cycle and then how we got way ahead of those cost in '19 and that's eventually how this will play out. Exactly when that happens is difficult to say. I'll just bring up the point in terms of the benefit we have from not being an auto company but being a multi-industry with a high quality diversified set up businesses that are differentiated and demonstrated again this year that every business can get price when faced with some pretty unprecedented levels of inflation, and that will be no different on a go-forward basis. We'll be - I think we're really well positioned to read and react in all of our segments, and then auto will take a little bit longer. So I think maybe that's the way to think about it. Scott Santi : Yes. Maybe just the one thing I'd add is that these are - while we talk about sort of the contractual elements of these relationships. They're also partnering with it. These are cooperative relationships. We've been partners with our customers for a long time. So I think given the environment, whether - and I don't think it's the contractual provisions that are the ultimate obstacle, it's about what's fair for both parties and each of us working together in the current environment. So I wouldn't overly - I don't know if this is word contractualize these relationships. These are long-term relationships with partners who need us and we want to do our best to serve them. And so there's - it will all be worked out. Michael Larsen : And maybe I'll just add, the price/cost equation is one element of the margin expansion here at ITW. I mean, if you look at the volume leverage that we're getting with just a little bit of organic growth, and look at the incremental margins here, once price cost starts to settle down a little bit. And then we still have the enterprise initiatives. So. I wouldn't get too negative on the price cost side as you look into next year. And again, in February when we get together and give you guidance, we'll give you a lot more detail on this. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Ms. Karen Fletcher. Karen Fletcher : Okay. Thanks, Tammy. I just want to thank everybody for joining us this morning for our short and efficient call, and have a great day. Operator : Thank you for participating in today's conference call. All lines may disconnect at this time.",

[Operator Instructions] Thank you. Karen Fletcher, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Karen Fletcher : Thank you, Brent. Good morning, and welcome to ITW\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2021 Conference Call. With me today are Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi; and Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen. During today\u2019s call, we will discuss ITW\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2021 financial results and provide guidance for full year 2022. Slide 2 is a reminder that this presentation contains forward-looking statements. We refer you to the company\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. This presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release. Please turn to Slide 3, and it\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi. Scott Santi : Thanks Karen and good morning, everyone. In Q4 ITW team delivered another quarter of excellent operational execution and strong financial performance. Six of our seven segments combined and delivered 12% organic growth while our auto OEM segment continued to be impacted by near term limitations on auto productions due to component supply shortages and as a result was down 16% in the quarter. At the enterprise level we delivered organic growth of 5%, GAAP EPS of $1.93, operating margin of 22.7% and free cash flow of $695 million or 114% of net income. Throughout the entirety of 2021, our teams around the world did an exceptional job of delivering to our customers while responding quickly indecisively to rapidly rising input cost and aggressively executing our win the recovery strategy to accelerate profitable market penetration and organic growth across our portfolio. As a result for the full year, we generated organic growth of 12% with each of our seven segments delivering organic growth ranging from 6% to 18% and despite a seemingly constant rise of input cost increases, we expanded operating margin by 120 basis points to 24.1% with another 100 basis points contribution from enterprise initiatives. GAAP EPS was an all time record at $8.51, an increase of 28% versus the prior year. And in 2021, we also raised our dividend by 7%, returned $2.5 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases and closed on a very high quality acquisition in the MTS test and stimulation business. Most importantly we delivered these results while continuing to drive meaningful progress on our path to ITW\u2019s full potential through the execution of our long term enterprise strategy. As you may recall, early in the pandemic we made the decisions to remain fully invested in our people and in our long term strategy. The people that we retained in the marketing innovation and capacity investments that we continue to fund as a result of that decision are fueling the results that ITW is delivering today and have the company very well-positioned to continue to accelerate organic growth, add high quality bolt on acquisitions and sustain our best in class margins and returns in 2022 and beyond. I want to close by thanking all of our ITW colleagues around the world for their exceptional efforts and dedication. Their performance throughout 2021 provides another proof point that ITW is a company that has the enduring competitive advantages, the agility and the resilience necessary to deliver top tier performance in any environment. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Michael, who will provide more detail on our Q4 and full year 2021 performance as well as our 2022 guidance. Michael? Michael Larsen : Thank you, Scott and good morning everyone. The strong growth momentum that we experienced in the third quarter continued into the fourth quarter as revenue grew 5.9% year-over-year to $3.7 billion with organic growth of 5.3%. The MTS acquisition added 1.3% and foreign currency translation impact reduced revenue by 0.7%. Sequentially, organic revenue accelerated by 6% from Q3 into Q4 on our sales per day basis, as compared to our historical sequential of plus 2%. By geography, North America grew 9% and international was up 1%. Europe declined 2% while Asia-Pacific was up 7% with China up 2%. GAAP EPS of $1.93 included $0.02 of headwind from the MTS acquisition and related transaction costs. Operating margin was 22.7% to 23.1% excluding MTS. As expected in the fourth quarter, we experienced price cost margin headwinds of 200 basis points, the same as in the third quarter. Our businesses continued to respond appropriately and decisively to rising raw material costs and in the fourth quarter and the full year, we were positive on dollar for dollar basis. Overall for Q4 excellent operational execution across the board and strong financial performance in what remains a pretty uncertain and volatile environment. Okay, let\u2019s go to slide 4 for segment results starting with automotive OEM. As expected organic revenue was down 16% with North America down 12%, Europe down 29% and China down 3%. Despite these near term pressures on the top line, operating margin was resilient and remained solidly in the mid teens. While supply chain challenges continue to persist for the industry in the near term, we are confident that the inevitable recovery of the auto market will be a major contributor to organic growth for ITW over an extended period of time as these issues ultimately get resolved. Food equipment led the way this quarter with the highest organic growth rate inside the company at 21%. North America was up 22% with equipment up 26% and service up 15%. Institutional growth of 28% was particularly strong education and restaurants were up around 50%. International growth was strong and on par with North America at 20% mostly driven by Europe up 23% with Asia-Pacific up 9%. Both equipment and service grew 20%. Turning to slide 5 for test and measurement and electronics. Organic growth was 11% with electronics up 4% and test and measurement up 17% driven by continued strong demand for semiconductors and capital equipment as evidenced by organic growth rate of 17% in our Instron business. Scott said in December, we closed on the MTS acquisition which we\u2019re excited about as it\u2019s a great strategic fit for ITW and highly complementary to our Instron business. We acquired the Instron in 2006 and today it is a business growing consistently at 6% to 7% organically with operating margins well above the company average. We\u2019re confident that MTS has the potential to reach similar levels of performance over the next five to seven years through the application of the ITW business model. Moving to slide 6. Welding delivered broad based organic revenue growth of 15% with 30% operating margin in Q4. Equipment revenue grew 14% and consumables were up 16%. Industrial revenue grew 18% and the commercial business grew 8%. North America was up 15% and International growth was 14% driven by 18% growth in oil and gas. Polymers and fluids organic growth was 3% with 8% growth in polymers with continued strength in MRO and heavy industry applications. Fluids was down 5% against the tough comp of plus 16% last year when demand for industrial hygiene products surged. Automotive aftermarket grew 4% with continued strength in retail. Onto slide 7. Construction organic revenue was up 12% as North America grew 22% with residential renovation up 23% driven by continued strength in the home center channel. Commercial construction which is about 20% of our business was up 21%. Europe grew 2% and Australia and New Zealand was up 10%. Specialty organic growth was strong at 7% with North America up 10% and International up 2%. With that let\u2019s go to slide 8 for a summary of 2021. Operationally, the teams around the world continue to execute with discipline in a challenging environment as they sustained world class customer service levels, implemented timely price adjustments in response to rapidly rising raw material costs and executed on our win the recovery initiatives to accelerate organic growth across the portfolio. As a result, revenue grew 15% to $14.5 billion with broad based organic growth of 12%, 14% if you exclude auto OEM where growth was obviously very constrained due to two component shortages at our customers. Operating income increased 21% and operating margin was 24.1%. Incremental margin was 32%, which is below our typical 35% to 40% range due to price costs. Excluding the impact of price cost, incremental margin was 40%. GAAP EPS increased 28% and after tax ROIC improved by more than 300 basis points to 29.5%. Free cash flow was $2.3 billion with a conversion rate of 84% of net income, which is below our 100% plus long term target for free cash flow due to higher working capital investments to support the company\u2019s 15% revenue growth and the strategic decision that we have made to increase inventory levels on select key raw materials, components and finished goods to help mitigate supply chain risk and sustained service levels to our key customers. Moving to slide 9 for our full year 2022 guidance. So, we\u2019re heading into 2022 with strong momentum and the company is in a very good position to deliver another year of strong financial performance with organic growth of 6% to 9% and 10% to 15% earnings growth. For our usual process, our organic growth guidance is established by projecting current levels of demand into the future and adjusting them for typical seasonality. As you can see by segment on the next page, every segment is positioned to deliver solid organic growth in 2022 with organic growth of 6% to 9% at the enterprise level. Our total revenue growth projection of 7.5% to 10.5% includes a 3% contribution from MTS partially offset by 1.5% of foreign currency headwind at today\u2019s exchange rates. Specific to MTS, guidance includes full year revenue of $400 million to $450 million. The expectation that margins are dilutive at the enterprise level by approximately 50 basis points and finally, consistent with what we\u2019ve said before EPS neutral. Operating margin excluding MTS is forecast to expand by about 100 basis points to 24.5% to 25.5% as enterprise initiatives contribute approximately 100 basis points. We expect price cost headwind of about 50 basis points. Incremental margin is expected to be about 30%, including MTS and our core incremental margin excluding MTS is in our typical 35% to 40% range. We expect GAAP EPS in the range of $8.90 to $9.30 which is up 10% to 15% excluding onetime tax items from last year. The tax rate for 2022 is expected to be 23% to 24% as compared to 19% in 2021. We are forecasting solid free cash flow with a conversion rate of 90% to 100% of net income with further working capital investments to support the company\u2019s growth, mitigate supply chain risk and sustain service levels to our key customers as needed. Our capital allocation plans for 2022 are consistent with our longstanding disciplined capital allocation framework. Priority number one remains internal investments to support our organic growth efforts and sustain our highly profitable core businesses. Second, an attractive dividend that grows in line with earnings over time remains a critical component of ITW\u2019s total shareholder return model. Third, selective high quality acquisitions such as MTS that enhance ITW\u2019s long term profitable growth potential, have significant margin improvement potential from the application of our proprietary 80 :20 front to back methodology and can generate acceptable risk adjusted returns on our shareholders capital. Lastly, we allocate surplus capital to an active share repurchase program, and we expect to buyback $1.5 billion of our own shares in 2022. In addition, we have reactivated our previously announced divestiture plans and in 2022, we will reinitiate divestiture processes for five businesses with combined annual revenues of approximately $500 million. While these businesses are performing quite well, coming out of the pandemic, they operate in markets where growth expectations are not aligned with ITW\u2019s long term organic growth goals. When these divestitures are completed over the next 12 to 18 months, we expect approximately 50 basis points of lift to ITW\u2019s organic growth rate and operating margins. Given the timing uncertainties associated with these divestiture transactions, 2022 guidance assumes we own them for the full year. Finally, last slide is Slide 10 with the organic growth projections by segment. You can see that based on current run rates we\u2019re expecting some solid organic growth rates in every one of our seven segments with organic growth of 6% to 9% at the enterprise level. For automotive OEM, our guidance of 6% to 10% is based on a risk adjusted forecast of automotive production in the mid single digits plus our typical penetration gains of 2% to 3%. With that Karen, I\u2019ll turn it back to you. Karen Fletcher : Thanks, Michael. Brent, let\u2019s open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from a line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi Group. Your line is open. Andrew Kaplowitz : So Mike, I know you mentioned that you\u2019re predicting to run rate growth as you usually do. But it looks like polymers and fluids are the only segment where you actually forecast the business to reaccelerate in 22 versus Q4 levels. Maybe you could talk about what you\u2019re seeing there and then it seems like your CapEx businesses continue to be quite strong. Are you seeing customers step up CapEx in 22? And how does that factor into the forecast if at all? Michael Larsen : Yes, I think polymers and fluids is really the growth rate for 2022 is established the same way as the other segments, which is based on current levels of demand inside of the segment today projected into 2022 and adjusted for typical seasonality. So that\u2019s where you get to that 5% to 9% range for polymers and fluids. On the CapEx question I\u2019d say, we definitely continue to see very strong demand in our capital equipment businesses. We talked about an acceleration from Q3 into Q4 with revenue per day of 6%, when normally we\u2019re only up 2% and we expect really that strong demand to continue into 2022. Again, we\u2019re not assuming an acceleration in 2022. It\u2019s based on current run rates but based on the trends we\u2019re seeing, it\u2019s possible that we fully expect that demand will continue at these levels. We\u2019ve seen nothing in Q4 to suggest that demand is slowing down in any one of our segments. Andrew Kaplowitz : Appreciate that. And then you delivered mid teens margins in auto in Q4 which I think was in line with expectations. But as you know, steel prices have begun to come down. So can you give us more color and how to think about margin in auto in 22 and when you talk about your ability, I think he talked last quarter about maybe being able to re-price some auto OEM contracts. So have you had any success in doing that? Michael Larsen : Well, I think on auto margins, they\u2019ve been remarkably resilient, considering that we\u2019ve been down 15% to 20% in Q3 and Q4 and we\u2019re still in that mid to high teen level. Obviously, as auto production comes back, we\u2019re going to get positive volume leverage in the business. Price cost remains a significant headwind and it\u2019s not so much steel is really more on the resin side in the auto business and we expect that those headwinds will continue in 2022 in the auto business. As we\u2019ve talked about before getting priced takes a little bit longer in the in this space, just given the contractual nature of the industry. And we are continuing to partner with our customers as we renew contracts and add new content to vehicles and so I do think that longer term structurally auto margins will go back to levels that we\u2019re at historically which is in the low to mid 20s. When exactly that happens really depends on when volume comes back and when we get ahead of these price cost headwinds that are pretty significant at this point. Andrew Kaplowitz : Appreciate it, Michael. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Nicole DeBlase : Maybe we could just start with thinking about the quarterly cadence of revenue and margins. I totally appreciate that you guys don\u2019t historically do specific quarterly EPS guidance. But if you could talk a little bit about maybe the price cost impact, how things kind of look versus normal seasonality, just because 2022 seems like it could be a bit of a strange year again? Michael Larsen : Yes, you\u2019re right, I think it\u2019s likely to be another strange year. If you look at it historically, our first half versus second half in terms of the EPS that we generate for the full year, we are typically 49% in the first half and 51% in the second half. Yes 49% and 51% will be good. That\u2019s one way to do that. So we\u2019re 49 and 51, historically, we think this year based on current run rates, and how we think price cost might play out, we\u2019re more like a 47 :53. So it\u2019s close. But the plans are a little more backend loaded than typical. The one thing I\u2019ll just call out is, if you look at Q1 specifically, in Q1 last year, there were no significant chip shortages in the automotive space. So that auto was up 8% last year in Q1. We still expect the auto business to be down here in the first quarter of 2022. Not as much as in Q4, but still a down quarter in automotive. And so that\u2019s really what\u2019s driving this more backend loaded plan that I talked about. I think I just add on price cost we\u2019re going to continuing to work that our teams are doing a good job. It\u2019s going to take a little bit of time to catch up here even though we are the lag that we historically have seen has become smaller as we\u2019ve learned some things in the past and are doing a better job responding with timely and appropriate price adjustments as we deal with this really unprecedented raw material cost inflation. I might just add, we\u2019ve also not really seen anything to suggest that those inflationary pressures are slowing down. Nicole DeBlase : Got it, that\u2019s very clear. And just a quick follow up on the price cost situation. Is the expectation that we kind of enter 2022 with a similar headwind to what you experienced in the fourth quarter and then you exit with a price cost tailwind? Michael Larsen : So I think the expectation is that price costs will be margin dilutive 50 basis points for the year. And that consistent with our past practice, and all of 2021, the goal was to be EPS neutral or better and I think slightly positive is where we ended up as we said in Q4. But to be honest with you, it\u2019s a really uncertain environment here. I mean, if there are further raw material cost increases we are going to read, we\u2019re going to react to those raw material cost increases with further price and that will put further pressure on the margins. So it\u2019s really difficult to predict what will end up for the year. In our guidance here in our model is 50 basis points of headwind. Scott Santi : It\u2019s good to say that the net 50 basis points include all existing and known price increases. But I think just put up a bit of emphasis on your point. Subsequent increases that we don\u2019t know about today that occur then certainly affect that level of margin dilution as we go through the year. Michael Larsen : So yes, there\u2019s no assumption here that things are getting better or worse. This is based on what we\u2019re seeing in our businesses today, based on incurred known and future costs and corresponding price increases. And it\u2019ll be I think, again in 2022, as you said, a strange year, a pretty dynamic year from that perspective too. Nicole DeBlase : Thank you. I\u2019ll pass it on. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open. Jeffrey Sprague : I wonder if you could just provide a little bit more color on what\u2019s going on at the customer level on supply chain and the nature of the questions, Scott, in particular gone back to Q2, but also in Q3 I think had some issues of just being able to deliver to customers, despite your own ability to deliver. Was that an impact in Q4 and do you see that sort of situation continuing into the early part of this year? Scott Santi : The way I would respond to that is, I think those issues in terms of customer impacted demand, customer supply chain impacted demand are better known today. So in Q2 it was sort of emerging situation, it was volatile. I would say that the sort of order the shipment, the timing of all that has been adjusted around a more known set of issues that our customers. So it\u2019s less of us of a surprise, it\u2019s hard to say it had any incremental impact in Q4 because it was just basically embedded in our plan, by that point, in our run rates in our plan so I think overall thing that I would say is we\u2019re not seeing any evidence that things are improving in a dramatic fashion from the standpoint of all of the supply chain constraints. It\u2019s still there are issues all over the place. We are reacting to those internally very well. Our customers are still challenged the automotive is just the most visible representation of that, but that these sorts of issues are applying to all customers of ours across all seven of our segments. But it\u2019s still given the growth rates, the net-net of all of it is still very positive in terms of underlying demand. And if everybody had everything that access to every component, and every bit of raw materials that they might want right now, I couldn\u2019t even guess sort of the incremental delta on that, but it\u2019d be meaningful. Jeffrey Sprague : Could you provide us some context on what your aggregate realized price was in 2021 and what\u2019s embedded in your guidance for 2022? Scott Santi : So we provided kind of an estimate. And that\u2019s really what this is, at best is an estimate of the breakdown between price and volume for full year 2021. I think we said price of 3% to 4%, roughly for the full year and organic growth in that 8% range. So that\u2019s what we talked about in the last call that\u2019s where we ended up. And while I fully appreciate the question, I\u2019m not sure I can be really helpful in terms of the guidance here for 2022 because as I said, price versus volume and these are estimates at best. And so in our opinion, the performance metric that really matters most is organic growth, which of course, includes both price and volume. And we try to be very transparent in terms of providing fully organic growth guidance at the enterprise level for the segments. And we report actuals as we go through the year both for the enterprise and for the segments, but that\u2019s really as much granularity as we can give you with a high degree of confidence. Jeffrey Sprague : Great, and maybe just one last one for me. I mean, the auto guide you gave is pretty clear builds plus your normal content. So there\u2019s no kind of bullwhip effect in the channel like we heard at 3am there was a lot of disconnect between build rates and what was in the channel and some real disconnects between the two. But it sounds like from your vantage point, and relative to your supply chain, everything is sort of evened out. Is that correct or there\u2019s maybe some noise first half versus second half? Scott Santi : No I think that\u2019s a fair way to characterize it. And maybe just to be clear, if you look at kind of third party leading industry, I hesitate to call them experts, but forecasts at least are suggesting builds for the year 2022 somewhere in that 9% to 10% range. What we have embedded in our guidance here is basically half of that. So we are somewhere in the mid single digits as our base assumption for automotive bills. They are plus 2 to 3 percentage points of penetration gains, which are essentially locked in at this point. And so hopefully that\u2019s a fairly conservative assumption. It is also a little backend loaded. So I think like I said, we expect auto to be down at least in Q1 and then was gradual improvement from there as we go through the year and hopefully these supply chain issues get resolved and automotive like we said will become a really meaningful contributor to the overall organic growth rate of the company once those bottlenecks get resolved. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Your line is open. Scott Davis : I think a lot of the good questions have been asked but can you tell us again, when you were talking about divestitures in your commentary, I kind of zoned out for a second. Yes I don\u2019t know what was going on. But can you remind us kind of the periodicity and the size and timing of that? And then, I\u2019m just kind of curious, are there MTS type acquisitions out there that you have in your sights that could offset some of that? Scott Santi : So just to kind of summarize on the divestitures real quick. So we\u2019ve begun the previously announced divestiture plans. We\u2019ve kind of reinitiate, the process for five business units here, with combined annual revenues of about $500 million and we expect the process could take anywhere between 12 to 18 months to get these completed. And of course, as you know, there\u2019s a fair bit of uncertainty around the timing of these. And so, in our guidance today is embedded that we\u2019re that we own these businesses for all 2022. And we\u2019ve also not included any kind of onetime gains on sale that might flow through. The positive impacts of the company, obviously, the onetime gains on sale is one thing, but really the kind of the structural benefit is approximately 50 basis points improvement in the overall organic growth rate of the company, and 50 basis points of improvement in the overall operating margin of the company. So that\u2019s kind of the addition by subtraction effect with the divestitures. And essentially, if you wanted to, you could say that we\u2019ve added a really high quality asset with MTS and we were replacing these divestitures with a business that we know can deliver the type of performance that we\u2019ve seen in our Instron business through the application of the business model. In terms of the pipeline of deals, I mean, I think we remain disciplined, but also opportunistic and to the extent that other opportunities come along that have the same characteristics that we\u2019ve talked about many times and we\u2019re going to certainly be leaning in on those and when that might, when these things might come to fruition that\u2019s always a little bit of there\u2019s some uncertainty around that, just like there\u2019s some uncertainty around the timing of these divestitures. Scott Davis : Okay, thank you for that. I\u2019ll pass it on. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is [Indiscernible] on for Jamie. We were wondering if there\u2019s any way you could quantify the market share gains they\u2019ve been talking about and how sustainable they are? And then in terms of price cost, if you could give us any color on option for 1H versus 2H and if you\u2019re hedged at all? Thank you. Scott Santi : So let me take a shot at this. I mean, I think on the market share gains, I mean, I think at the core of these when the recovery initiatives that we\u2019ve talked a lot about is the goal of accelerating our organic growth efforts and gaining significant market shares at a time when competitors in many cases were not able to stay invested in their people, in their new products, in their capacity expansion plans, not able to maintain service levels at the same level as ITW. And so we are hearing across the company, from many, many of our divisions, lots of anecdotal evidence that we are gaining market share. It\u2019s difficult to quantify. It\u2019s an estimate at best and it\u2019s not one that we\u2019re confident reporting on externally, but I think there\u2019s a lot of evidence inside the company that we are gaining share. I\u2019ll just point to our 12% organic revenue growth last year with the challenges in auto and then 6% to 9% organic this year and maybe when we get to a point where the market growth rates stabilized, maybe we\u2019ll be able to talk a little bit more about what our above market organic growth rates are. But we\u2019re highly confident that we\u2019re making good progress on our organic growth efforts. On your first half versus second half on price cost, I think we just talked about this. I mean, it remains a pretty uncertain environment. If things stay the way they are price cost will be a headwind in the first half and it\u2019ll be maybe neutral in the second half. And for the full year, we ended up somewhere around 50 basis points of margin dilution impact. And to answer your question, we do not hedge. So the costs that are flowing through our P&L today are essentially today\u2019s costs. And there\u2019s a whole host of reasons why we think that\u2019s a much better way of dealing with these costs real time maybe a little bit different than what you\u2019re seeing at other companies. But that\u2019s the quick answer on your hedging question. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Tami Zakaria with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tami Zakaria : Hello, everyone. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. So my first question is your inventories saw a notable increase in the fourth quarter. How much is that is related to the MTS acquisition? And how should we think about its impact on margin and cost absorption as we look into the first quarter and the rest of the year? Scott Santi : So I think, the inventory increase this year, which, like I said, that was a strategic decision to really secure supply for our customers and mitigate any risk around supply chain about 100, a little over $100 million came from MTS here in the month of December as we closed in the transaction. The specific impact from MTS on margins this year is 50 basis points. And I don\u2019t know if that was exactly your question or you had something else in mind. Tami Zakaria : I think that that\u2019s helpful. I do have another follow up question on MTS actually. So when do you expect MTS to be margin accretive? Scott Santi : Well, I would say we\u2019re not in a rush. We\u2019re going to be very deliberate and thoughtful in terms of how we implement the business model like we always do. I might just add, we\u2019re really excited about MTS because the business model never been more powerful than it is today. And so we\u2019re excited about what it can do. I think what we said was it\u2019ll take about five to seven years to get to ITW caliber, margins and organic growth rates that are in line with what we\u2019re seeing in the instrument business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning. This is [Indiscernible] on for Julian. So first question around, it seems like the 22 guide implies around 30% incremental. You guys have talked a lot to kind of the MTS impact and test and measurement and some price cost impact in the first half in auto. Is there anything else to call out the other segments regarding margin expansion costs throughout 22, could you help us? Scott Santi : Well, I\u2019ll just say 30% incrementals that is including the impact from MTS, actually if you adjust for that incrementals for 2022 are in line with our historical kind of 35% to 40% range. And I think as you look across the segment, there\u2019s really nothing unusual going on in terms of margins I think consistent with kind of the bottoms up planning process that we do at ITW. Our segments have all told us that they expect to do a little bit better in 2022 than they did in 2021 despite the fact that they are all operating at best in class levels relative to the markets and the competitors in those markets. So nothing unusual, we expect. Like I said overall 100 basis points of margin improvement, which is what we typically do. The enterprise initiatives are, it\u2019s great to see I think in page 10 another strong contribution from 80 :20 and strategic sourcing that\u2019s pretty broad based across all seven segments, so nothing unusual. We really expect based on what they\u2019ve told us continued progress certainly on organic growth, as you can see on page 10, in the slide deck and also on operating margins. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thank you. That\u2019s really helpful. And then just maybe one more follow up on capital deployment and the portfolio definitely more active and kind of this year in guiding for next year. Should we assume, though, in terms of when we think about priorities, just given the buyback guide for 1.5 billion can you just talk about how you prioritize M&A versus share repurchases kind of over the next 12 months, probably 18 months? Scott Santi : Well, I think we\u2019re really fortunate that we are in a position to do both. And so these are not mutually exclusive. I went through the four priorities, they are 1.5 billion, I mean, something really unusual would have to happen for us to not complete that program. It\u2019s really the allocation of our surplus capital. And there\u2019s plenty of room for more MTS type acquisitions to the extent that they become available. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Joe O\u2019Dea with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Joe O\u2019Dea: I wanted to start just on supply chain, I think it\u2019s been clear that it\u2019s not getting better, but I\u2019m curious about not getting worse. And so the degree to which over the past three or four months, your confidence level and some stabilization and how that allows you to operate a little bit better and then just in general if you do have any better visibility into when things start to improve a little bit I think some of the semiconductor comments and improve timing of shipments maybe but anything you could touch on visibility to improvement? Scott Santi : I think from the standpoint of the tactical issues now, I would certainly say that the environment is pretty stable but that just means that we\u2019ve gotten used to this environment, that there is, there are new issues popping up everywhere. I think, from the standpoint of the tactics that we\u2019ve our businesses employed to continue to serve our customers at a high level in this environment. We have certainly learned some things. Michael talked about our willingness to use our balance sheet to support inventory and investments. We have talked about the fact that our localized supply chains have really come up big for us here. Our long term relationships with our key suppliers all of those things it certainly helped us operate in this environment. We\u2019ve got in, I\u2019m not going to say comfortable, but we\u2019ve gotten used to operating in this environment. But I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any sort of the set of issues that we\u2019re confronting on a daily and weekly basis are shrinking dramatically at this point. In terms of forward visibility I think our mode is not the guess and not the look ahead, I think we are I react company. We are well positioned to do that. You can read the same sort of industry level stuff that we read. And it\u2019s interesting, but until it actually shows up, we\u2019re not counting on it. And we\u2019ll continue to read and react to the conditions on the ground as we always do. That being said, it obviously at some point is going to start to improve in a material way. And at that point things certainly get easier. We get the turn even more of our attention to leveraging the strong market positions into consistent above market growth. Joe O\u2019Dea: That\u2019s helpful. And then just a second one, when you talk about kind of the focus on when the recovery, I imagine that none of those folks who have lost share are all that happy about it. And at some point your focus becomes kind of sustained the victory. But what are the tools that you have in place? What\u2019s your confidence level that the share gains through these disruptions are sticky game? Scott Santi : Well, our focus in these games is really with our biggest and best customers that were our biggest and best customers before the pandemic. And I think in all of these cases what this pandemic provides us and this is true across the portfolio is an opportunity to demonstrate how ITW is different that we were there for our customers in a time of significant stress and challenges. And I think there is we are not looking for opportunistic sort of transient opportunities in this. We are looking for opportunities where we can truly leverage what is an advantage position and an advantage operating model in ways that ultimately proved to our biggest and best customers as I said, what the ITW difference is. And I expect that our ability to perform the way that we have and there\u2019s as Michael said, there\u2019s plenty of sort of anecdotal evidence of this. We are winning business today because of our ability to supply and not just supply, but supply these little items of high quality products. So I think as we said at the outset, this is a real opportunity for ITW to demonstrate some pretty fundamental core differences in our capabilities in the markets that we serve and in our people, in our business model, in my view, have absolutely stepped up to the challenge. Joe O\u2019Dea: And just to confirm my understanding correctly, the bigger portion of kind of the share wins would be better penetration at existing customers not so much about new customers? Scott Santi : Yes. That\u2019s the first priority in this environment, absolutely, taking care of our existing key customers. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mig Dobre with Baird. Your line is open. Mig Dobre : Thank you for taking the question. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to go back to the discussion on pricing. And I certainly appreciate that there has been quite a bit of pricing that you had to put through in 21 and it looks like 22 is not going to be much different. I\u2019m curious your view as to what happens when raw material inflationary pressures abate? How are your contracts structured or your conversations with your customers? Do you think these pricing increases actually stick and are there any differences various segments, one versus the other? Scott Santi : Well, I think given the differentiated nature of our product and service offerings across the company, I think, first of all, we\u2019re very pleased that we\u2019ve been able to make the appropriate price adjustments to offset these really unprecedented raw material cost increases. And I think if and when those costs start to stabilize or come back down I mean, there\u2019s certainly going to be individual discussions with customers, but we don\u2019t expect that we\u2019ll have to adjust pricing in a meaningful way, certainly not in a way that you\u2019ll see in the financials that we report. Mig Dobre : And then, my follow up is more of an operating question. You haven\u2019t really talked much about the Omicron spike and what that might have done to your own internal operations. I\u2019m presuming there was some absenteeism in various manufacturing sites related to this. And I guess my question is this, now that we\u2019re maybe two years into this pandemic how have you changed the way you do business internally and the way you operate from a just pure output and resilience standpoint? With the question really being if we are seeing yet another wave, say, for instance, in three, four months how are you prepared to handle that relative to, frankly, what you\u2019ve had to go through over the past couple years? Thank you. Scott Santi : Well, all I could do is point to our, the way we\u2019ve executed through the various waves to this point. I think there is have we had to adjust to the challenges of the pandemic from a people a safety standpoint, let alone a production standpoint, absolutely. That\u2019s been going on now for coming up on two years. So I don\u2019t, I think the way the company has responded we talked a lot about resilience, and that\u2019s certainly part of it. But we are a manufacturer. We\u2019ve got to have in our people are key to our ability to execute. And so we have done everything we need, everything within our power to keep our people safe, to keep our production lines running to be able to serve our customers. Have we learned things in the process? Of course, like a lot of companies have. This is not a normal environment as you all know, but ultimately I\u2019m very comfortable that we are negotiating our way through these challenges in a really strong manner and will continue to do so. We\u2019ll deal with whatever comes our way. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : I wasn\u2019t on the call, I apologize if I\u2019m going over stuff that you\u2019ve already covered. But I\u2019m just curious, really in terms of, this is a very little of a question, but corporate expense number came in a little bit heavier than what we had modeled. And I know that you\u2019ve been pushing more centralized costs over the last couple years. Just wondering what drove that and what we should be assume for 2022? Scott Santi : So, I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re talking about the unallocated number that\u2019s a little bit higher in Q4 at $56 million, I think Q3 was $43 million and the difference is the MTS transaction costs. So kind of a onetime and I think for modeling purposes for next year, I would assume somewhere in that $30 million to $40 million range. Nigel Coe : Okay, so the one time production costs coming through there okay, that that\u2019s very clear. And then again, sorry, if you\u2019ve got this for the free cash conversion like 100%, I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s working capital investments as you recover, but anything else that would be helpful? Scott Santi : No, it\u2019s just the investment in inventory. I mean, I think, obviously higher receivables with higher 15% revenue growth, and then the inventory to support our customers in a challenging supply chain environment. So we think that\u2019s a pretty smart use of our balance sheet. So that\u2019s what. Operator : There are no further questions. Thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference call.

At this time, I\u2019d like to welcome everyone to the ITW Q1 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Karen Fletcher, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Karen Fletcher : Thank you, David. Good morning everyone, and welcome to ITW\u2019s first quarter 2022 conference call. I\u2019m joined by our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi; and Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen. During today\u2019s call, we will discuss ITW\u2019s first quarter financial results and update our guidance for full year 2022. Slide 2 is a reminder that this presentation contains forward-looking statements. We refer you to the company\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. This presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release. So please turn to slide 3, and it\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi. Scott Santi : Thanks Karen, and good morning, everyone. We have talked often about the fact that the core focus of our enterprise strategy is to leverage the performance power of the ITW business model to consistently deliver top-tier performance in any environment. And our teams around the world continue to do an exceptional job of doing just that as evidenced by the 11% organic growth and 23% operating margins that they delivered in Q1. In the quarter we saw continued strong demand almost across the board while input cost inflation and supply chain issues remain challenging to say the least and our business has responded. Across the company, we continue to leverage the advantaged supply capabilities inherent in our 80/20 front-to-back operating system to support our customers and execute our Win the Recovery strategy to accelerate profitable market penetration and organic growth across our portfolio. Many of our businesses continued to receive strong feedback from their customers that their current delivery performance is truly differentiated and that they are being awarded additional share as a result. And despite another step-up in input cost inflation in Q1, we more than offset cost increases on a dollar-for-dollar basis in the quarter. Looking ahead at the remainder of 2022 based on our first quarter results and projecting current demand, supply rates and all-known cost increases through the balance of the year, we are raising our guidance for full year 2022 organic growth to 8.5% at the midpoint and GAAP EPS of $9.20 at the midpoint, which is 14% earnings growth year-over-year and would be an all-time record for the company. While the near-term environment certainly has its challenges, we remain focused on delivering differentiated service to our customers, differentiated financial performance for our shareholders and continued progress on our path to ITW's full potential. Now I'll turn the call over to Michael, who'll provide more detail on the quarter and our full year outlook. Michael? Michael Larsen : Thank you Scott and good morning everyone. In Q1 demand was strong across the board and supported by our advantaged supply position, ITW grew revenue by 11.2% to more than $3.9 billion. Organic growth was 10.6% and the MTS acquisition contributed about $100 million, or 2.8% to revenue. Foreign currency translation reduced revenue by 2.2%. GAAP EPS of $2.11 tied last year's Q1 record. Foreign currency translation reduced GAAP EPS by $0.05. By geography, North America grew 13%, international grew 7% with organic growth of 7% in Europe, and China grew 1%. Six of seven segments delivered positive combined organic growth of 14%, while Automotive OEM was down less than 1%. Orders remained strong across the board. And while we're doing significantly better than many of our competitors in terms of lead times and delivery performance, we grew backlogs again in the first quarter. Sequentially from Q4 to Q1, organic revenue grew 6% on a sales per day basis, as compared to our historical sequential of minus 1%. And while we're on the topic of sequential improvement GAAP EPS of $2.11 grew 9% relative to Q4 2021. Operating margin was 22.7%, 23.4%, excluding 70 basis points of margin dilution from the recent MTS acquisition. Enterprise Initiatives contributed 90 basis points. And as we always do our business teams reacted appropriately to higher cost inflation by adjusting selling prices. And as a result, we remain positive on a dollar-for-dollar basis. Price/cost was still dilutive to operating margin by 250 basis points. After-tax ROIC was 27.6%, 29.8%, excluding the impact of the MTS acquisition. Free cash flow was $249 million with a conversion rate of 38%, which is below our typical 80% to 85% in the first quarter. As we've talked about before, the lower conversion rate is due to intentional working capital investments that support our strong growth momentum mitigate supply chain risk and sustained service levels to our key customers. And down the road once supply conditions begin to normalize, so will our working capital needs resulting in our typical strong cash flow performance. As planned, we repurchased $375 million of our shares in the first quarter and the effective tax rate was 23.1%, 70 basis points higher than Q1 last year. So, overall, for Q1 an excellent start to the year, characterized by strong broad-based demand supported by our differentiated supply position, as we delivered organic growth of 11%, operating margin of 23%, and GAAP EPS of $2.11. Moving to Slide 4. We're including an analysis of our current operating margin performance. Reported Q1 operating margin was 22.7%, but there are three factors pressuring our margins in the near term starting with 250 basis points of margin dilution impact from price cost. At some point in the future when raw material costs begin to normalize, we expect the margin impact from price/cost to turn positive and that we will fully recover the margin differential. Second, Q1 was also the first full quarter of the recent MTS acquisition, which as expected diluted margins by 70 basis points. As we've talked about before, it will take us a few years to fully implement the ITW business model on MTS and get the business growing organically at ITW caliber margins and returns. Finally, we had slightly higher restructuring associated with 80/20 front-to-back projects, which impacted margins by 20 basis points. And the point here is that our core operating margins are currently running around 26%-plus, which is closer to what we would expect from ITW in a normal environment and not far from our pre-pandemic target of 28%-plus and also further evidence of our continued progress on enterprise strategy driven structural margin improvement through the pandemic. If you recall 2019 pre-pandemic margins were right around 24% versus 26% on a core run rate basis here in Q1. And as we've said before, we have full confidence in our ability to deliver sustained above-market organic growth at 30% to 40% incremental margins. And as a result, we will continue to expand operating margins as we grow. Moving on. Automotive OEM was the only segment that didn't grow this quarter with organic revenue down a little less than 1% much improved compared to being down 16% in Q4 2021. By geography, North America grew 3%, Europe was down 11% and China grew 12%. You'll remember that the segment is up against a pretty tough comp of plus 8% organic growth in Q1 last year as the impact on auto production from chip shortages didn't fully materialize until Q2. At this point and for guidance purposes, we do not expect an improvement in the chip shortage situation until 2023. As a result, our guidance assumes that automotive production and our associated automotive OEM revenues are essentially capped at current Q1 levels through the balance of the year. Turning to slide 5 for Food Equipment, which led the way with the highest organic growth rate this quarter at 28%. North America was up 23% with Equipment up 24% and Service up 21%. Restaurants were up over 40% with strength across the board and institutional growth was almost 10% led by education and lodging. International growth was strong at 36% with Europe up 45% and Asia Pacific up 4%. Both Equipment and Service revenues increased around 36%. In Test and Measurement and Electronics, organic growth was 8% with Test and Measurement up 10% and Electronics up 6%. Strong demand for semiconductor-related equipment continued to drive organic growth in the mid-teens, while demand for capital equipment also remained strong with Instron, for example, up 6%. Finally, as expected the MTS acquisition diluted operating margin by about 400 basis points. Excluding the MTS impact margins were 26% versus 26.4% in Q4 2021. Moving to slide 6. Welding organic revenue grew 13% with Equipment up 10% and Consumables up 17%. Industrial grew 14% and the Commercial business grew almost 10%. North America was up 12% and International growth was 17% including 18% growth in oil and gas. Europe was up 20% and Asia Pacific was up 15%. Due to strong operating leverage and a solid contribution from enterprise initiatives, Welding operating margin was a record 30.8% an all-time quarterly record for an ITW segment and another proof point that as we deliver organic growth with best-in-class margins there's plenty of room for further margin expansion in all seven segments. In Polymers and Fluids, organic growth was 13%, as automotive aftermarket grew 17%. Polymers was up 11% with continued strength in MRO and heavy industry applications. Fluids grew 6%. On a geographic basis North America grew 15% and International was up 9%. On to Slide 7. Construction delivered strong organic revenue growth of 21% as North America grew 32% with Residential up 36% and Commercial up 15%. Europe grew 16% and Australia and New Zealand was up 10%. While construction margins were impacted by rising steel costs, operating margin was still a solid 24.7% with strong volume leverage and a meaningful contribution from enterprise initiatives. Specialty organic growth was 1% with North America up 7%, while International was down 9%. With that let's turn to Slide 8 for an updated view of our full year 2022 guidance. And based on our Q1 results and projecting current levels of demand through the balance of the year as per our standard approach to guidance, we are now projecting organic growth of 7% to 10% and total revenue growth of 8.5% to 11.5%. Due to the higher revenue growth projections, we're raising GAAP EPS by $0.10 to a range of $9 to $9.40 and the midpoint of $9.20 represents, 14% earnings growth and puts the company on track for another year of record financial performance. Operating margin guidance is unchanged with strong volume leverage and 100 basis points of contribution from enterprise initiatives. When it comes to price cost our operating teams will continue to more than cover inflation on a dollar-for-dollar basis. And as usual, our guidance includes all known costs and price increases as we sit here today. We expect strong free cash flow growth of 10% to 20% year-over-year with a conversion rate of 85% to 95% of net income. As we've talked about before this is below our target of 100%-plus. Because of our decision to invest in the working capital necessary to support the company's strong growth mitigate supply chain risk and sustained service levels to our key customers. Finally, we are on pace to repurchase 1.5 billion of our shares and we continue to expect an effective tax rate of 23% to 24%. So, in summary Q1 was another quarter of high-quality execution in a very challenging environment and as a result, we're off to a solid start on raising both our organic growth and EPS guidance for the full year.  So, with that Karen, I'll turn it back to you. Karen Fletcher : Okay. Thanks Michael. David let's open up the lines for questions please. Operator :   [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Your line is open. Scott Davis : Good morning, guys. Scott Santi : Good morning. Scott Davis : Thanks for making an uneventful quarter versus what we've seen in some other places. Scott Santi : You're welcome. Scott Davis : A couple of little things here. I mean first your guidance implies kind of - or perhaps doesn't imply, but you're not forecasting additional inflation. Does that mean that you've seen kind of some plateauing in the supply chain price increases and materials etcetera? Michael Larsen : Well -- so let me just -- it's a good question. So let me just explain kind of how we are modeling price cost because I think there's an opportunity to maybe clarify a few things. So, what we are doing consistent with our past approach around price/cost is we're including in our guidance today. all known cost increases and all of the associate price increases. Those are the two things that we know today. And based on that you saw the actuals of 250 basis points of margin headwind in the first quarter, but actually positive on a dollar-for-dollar basis. As we project into the future based on what we know today, that 250 basis points is going to become less of a drag on a go-forward basis and maybe even turn slightly positive in the back half of the year, okay? So that's kind of -- that's what we know. What we don't know and that's to your question what are the additional cost increases going to be? We don't know as we sit here today, we have not seen anything to really suggest that inflation is slowing down. But we do know that our operating teams will offset any cost increases with price on a dollar-for-dollar basis. And so therefore, EPS-neutral which is a really important point here. But obviously, that will create additional top line growth, but it will also put pressure on margins as this additional top line growth comes through at essentially no incremental margin if that makes sense. So, hopefully that answers your question. So that's what's embedded here. Everything we know as we sit here today is included in our guidance. Additional inflation will be offset on a dollar-for-dollar basis. And to the extent that happens that will put some further pressure on margins. And so hopefully that answers your question. Scott Davis : That's totally fair. Is there any way to disaggregate the content growth in auto versus kind of potential inventory builds versus sell-through et cetera? Just any color there will be helpful... Scott Santi : I'd say at this point, that would be really tough, just given all that's going on. Michael Larsen : Yes, I agree with that. I would just add. I mean, I think it's a tough number and it doesn't make a lot of sense on a quarterly basis. I think in terms of long term, we're highly confident that we're outgrowing the underlying market by two to three percentage points. What exactly that was in one quarter versus the other is a little bit more difficult to ascertain, especially in the current environment. But on a full year basis, certainly, the way these plans are set up is for two to three percentage points of outgrowth on an annual basis. Scott Davis : Okay. Sounds good. Thank you, guys. Appreciate the color. Scott Santi : Sure. Thank you. Operator : Next we'll go to Tami Zakaria with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tami Zakaria : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So I wanted to get some clarity on the improved organic growth guidance you're raising it by one point. And is that a reflection of better-than-expected first quarter performance versus your internal expectations or does it embed improved organic growth you're seeing quarter-to-date? And if the latter, which segments are driving that? And is it solely coming from incremental pricing or are you expecting volume improvement as well? Michael Larsen : Yes. So Tami, our growth projection is based on the Q1 actual results that we are reporting today. And then we are projecting based on historical run rates into -- through the balance of the year. So there's really no assumption here, no economic forecasts or an underlying assumptions, things are going to get better in the back half or worse than the back half of the year. It's based on again revenue per day in Q1 and projected into -- through the balance of the year. Tami Zakaria : Got it. And so, you're not embedding any pricing benefit into the updated guidance? Michael Larsen : No. I think the only pricing that is included in our guidance is what we know as of today. So we know, what price increases we have actioned and announced and so that is known. But any further increases beyond that would not be included in our guidance as we sit here today. Tami Zakaria : Got it. Super helpful. If I can ask one more follow-up? Scott Santi : Sure. Tami Zakaria : Have you seen any slowdown or impact in your business in the European markets since the war in Ukraine broke? Ask another way have you do you feel the demand environment has changed since then? Michael Larsen : Well, so I think in Q1 I think Europe was up 7%. I think we're seeing -- we saw some pressure. In -- if you look at the automotive numbers the sales numbers -- we saw a lot of strength on the food equipment side to offset that. I think and if you kind of look at the projection for the balance of the year, I think it adds up to somewhere in the low single-digit type growth rate in Europe. Just to maybe comment or put it down, I think so far through April, everything appears to be on track including Europe. Tami Zakaria : Great. Thank you so much. Michael Larsen : Sure. Operator : Next we'll go to Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning everybody. Scott Santi : Good morning Joe. Joe Ritchie : I guess my first question I want to just touch on China, I know it's a relatively small part of your business. I saw that it grew double-digits in the auto business. But maybe just provide some color on what you're seeing on the ground there with the COVID shutdowns and how that's impacting your business if at all? Michael Larsen : Yes, I mean I think just to kind of dimensionalize it. China is about 8% of our revenues and I think we -- at this point, we've not seen -- we're obviously not immune to what's going on in China. But like I said so far through April, everything appears to be on track including in China. Joe Ritchie : Okay. Good to know. And then I guess just a follow-on question. You guys price/cost negative 250, but only down 100 basis points for the year. I mean it's fair to say I think like where you're seeing the most acute pressure in the auto OEM segment. So, I guess, just maybe confirm that that's correct or if you're seeing other pressure across other parts of your business as well? And then just within that improvement that you're seeing, how much of it is already like baked into the pricing of those auto contracts that come through as the year progresses? Michael Larsen : So ,everything that we know is baked in Joe. So and I think the -- it's fair to say that the inflationary pressures are real across all seven segments. They are a little more pronounced as you can see it in the margins in auto, maybe construction this quarter I mentioned that as well as Polymers & Fluids. I think there is a little bit of a -- we're still catching up to some extent. So, the 250 basis points of headwind will be better starting in Q2 based on what we know today somewhere closer to 200 and then from there in the back half if things stay the way they are like I said earlier we're starting to turn positive. And we're beginning -- I think the important point is we're beginning to recover the margin impact that we've had over the last four or five quarters now. So, I think once we get through this cycle like I said in the prepared remarks and when things do begin to normalize down the road from a supply chain and from a cost standpoint that is when the margin recovery begins. And so we're taking to some extent this is a -- we described it as a near-term pressure here in Q1 and over time we'll begin to recover those margins again. Joe Ritchie : That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Next, we'll go to Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good day, everyone. Just first on auto Scott or Michael. Is the idea that you're capped here what you're hearing directly from your customers, what you can see on kind of forward build schedules, or is this just for lack of a better term a dose of caution given the uncertainty? Michael Larsen : It's a combination of things. I think Jeff, if you go back to our last call the -- what was baked into our guidance at the time was half of the IHS growth build forecast of 9%. So we were basically at somewhere around 4% to 5% builds. And that's where IHS is today. So I think there's actually not a big change relative to where we were three months ago. And what we're basically based on various data inputs including from our customers, we thought the best way to update kind of forecast the auto business is to say that revenues stay where they are which is somewhere around $760 million in Q1 and that's what we've assumed for Q2, Q3 and Q4. So -- and then ultimately, I mean we still believe that down the road, when these supply chain issues get resolved and automotive production recovers, this segment is going to be very well set up as a strong contributor to the overall organic growth rate of the enterprise. But we just think it's going to take a little bit longer based on everything that we are seeing and hearing from our customers. Jeff Sprague : Understood. And then just back on price. Understanding that what you know is embedded in the guide, but if we think about the point addition to the organic growth guide, I suspect all of that maybe even more than 100% of it is price. Could you just give us a little color on that? Michael Larsen : So I think you tried this on the last call to get me to tell you a little bit more about price versus volume. So -- and just to reiterate, these are our best estimates. So I can't give you a lot of detail other than I can tell you that the -- there is volume leverage on the 1% revenue growth increase and that's really the 10% -- $0.10 a share that we're adding to our guidance, okay? So it is not -- from that you can infer, it's not all price. It's a combination of things. Jeff Sprague : Great. Understood. Thank you for the color. Michael Larsen : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Next, we'll go to Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is open. Andy Kaplowitz : Good morning, everyone. Michael Larsen : Andy. Andy Kaplowitz : Scott or Michael, so I know you probably don't want to update us on your segment revenue growth expectations. But outside of auto where you already gave a specific guide, it looks like Food Equipment & Construction accelerated versus your run rate specialty products maybe weakened a bit. Is that a fair characterization of where revenue growth is moving versus your original forecast? And can you give a little more color regarding what you're seeing in specialty products that's maybe holding down that business a bit segment? Michael Larsen : Yeah. I think the -- I heard your first part. What the second part was what did you say slowdown? Andy Kaplowitz : Specialty. Michael Larsen : Specialty. Yeah, I think specialty is really more of a timing issue related to some specific equipment projects in Europe and a few projects in China. So I think that's really more of a timing issue than anything else. I think if you just kind of take a step back I think you pointed out the right ones, in terms of a lot of strength in certainly Food Equipment, but also Welding. Test & Measurement there's some -- up against some difficult comps. Construction, there's certainly a lot of positive momentum, really across the board. And what does not come across and we've talked about this before, we're not a backlog-driven company. But in the segments that are more exposed to the capital equipment space, so that would include Test & Measurement, Welding, Food & Equipment, we are building significant backlog and really despite the fact that we are performing, like I said, at a high level relative to our competitors, we're building substantial backlog. That's not showing up, obviously, yet in our revenues. Andy Kaplowitz : And, Michael, you obviously had -- you had a large number in construction, specifically, you mentioned North American renovation, I think, up in the low 30% range. It's been going on for a while here, but this is a big number and you're getting stronger despite sort of concerns about rising rates. So are you taking share there? Is it just a lot of activity and sort of visibility going forward here in 2022? Michael Larsen : Well, I think as you know, I mean, there's still a lot of strength in the US housing market and that's where you saw these residential remodel numbers up 36%. And included in that is also some meaningful share gains, based on what we're seeing in portions of that business, where it's difficult to supply the market, we are taking advantage of our supply position to take share. The commercial side, 15%, that's a smaller part of the business. And then, really, on a geographic basis, it's not just North America, but it's also Europe, up 16%. For example, the UK up 20%; and then Australia and New Zealand still delivering a solid 10%. So it's pretty broad-based and again, we're modeling based on run rates. And so, we have not seen anything to suggest that the market is slowing down at this point. Andy Kaplowitz : Appreciate the color. Michael Larsen : Sure. Operator : Next we'll go to Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning. Michael Larsen : Good morning. Nigel Coe : And thanks for leaving a lot of time for -- yes, good morning. It's actually great that you give so much time to Q&A. So thanks, I wish all other company to do this. So, I know you don't like to talk about price. And I know Jeff took a crack at the question. But if I just put through the margin dilution from price/costs and it seem as neutral, then I get to a 9%, 10% type price impact. Is that the kind of scale of pricing we're seeing here? And is the message that pricing gets better from here through the year? Michael Larsen : Well, what does get better from here, if things stay the way they are, is price/cost as we talked about. And so, we're going from significant margin dilution here in Q1 of 250 basis points to maybe even slightly positive in the second half of the year. So that's -- and that's based on everything that we know today. And Nigel, it's not that we don't want to -- so the issue around price is that, it is an estimate at best. And it is not -- especially with -- in such a dynamic environment it would be very difficult to sit here and give you a number with a high degree of confidence and we\u2019ve not done that historically. And like, I think, we talked about on the last call, we're not going to go down the path of breaking out price versus volume any further. So that's the best I can do here for you. Nigel Coe : Okay. No, that's fine. And then, just turn to page 4 as my follow-up the margin bridge. Enterprise was I think 90 bps of tailwinds. So if we put that in as sort of a tailwind to that bridge there would have been 90 bps elsewhere so -- as an offset. So, I'm assuming that productivity in the plans, et cetera, is that fair Michael? And how do you see sort of productivity, labor productivity, et cetera, improving through the year? Michael Larsen : Well, I think that's productivity. I'm not sure exactly how you get there. I mean I think there's 90 basis points of enterprise initiatives that's not on here. Scott Santi : That's embedded in the 26.1%. Michael Larsen : In the 26.1%. And so, is the -- any other productivity gains. There's a couple of things that are nodding here is there's some margin dilution from increased sales commissions. When you grow your revenues double-digit, your commissions are going to go up. But broadly speaking, what we try to do is give you a fairly accurate representation of these near-term pressures and therefore, what our core operating margins are running at, which is somewhere around 26%-plus in the current environment. And as we just talked about these price/cost pressures normalize, that's where we would expect margins to head as we continue on our path to our target of 28%-plus. Nigel Coe : No, that\u2019s very clear. Thank you very much. Michael Larsen : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Next, we'll go to Mig Dobre with Baird. Your line is open. Mig Dobre : Good morning, everyone. So, Michael a question for you. I think I heard you mention that in the second quarter, the price/cost headwind moderates to the tune of about 50 basis points. So when we're thinking about year-over-year margin, is it fair to still embed roughly 200 basis points of year-over-year compression in Q2 and then things get better in the back half basically? Michael Larsen : Yeah. I think that's what I said. Yeah, I think that's a -- based again with the caveat that we are in a very dynamic uncertain environment. But to the extent that -- based on what we know today that is -- that would be correct. Mig Dobre : Okay. And then, sorry to keep beating up this topic on price. It's just that this environment, it's not something I've encountered in my career well frankly before. But when we're looking at PPI data, I mean we're seeing some pretty material increases in Food Equipment in Welding. And I'm sort of wondering if your business is sort of kind of keeping up with this industry data as well or if there are some divergence that we need to be aware of, because it would seem that most of the growth is really coming from pricing not volume if volume grows at all in 2022? Michael Larsen : Yeah. I mean, I... Scott Santi : We wouldn't share that view. Michael Larsen : Yeah. We don't agree with that one. Two, I'm not quite sure what you're -- what data you're looking at. So it's a little bit difficult for me to comment. All I can do is report the actual results for our Food Equipment business, for example. And I think we give you a fair bit of detail including by end market. And beyond that I can't really -- like I said before, we don't report price versus volume and so I'm not sure I can help you. Mig Dobre : Understood. Maybe one last follow-up. I'm curious as to how you're thinking about this pricing dynamic longer term? Because to your point eventually we're going to start to see material costs coming down, do you expect to be able to keep the pricing gains that you have had in this environment, or is it fair to assume some pressure is weakened about 2023 and beyond? Thank you. Michael Larsen : Well, so, I think let me just start by saying that our customer relationships are strategic long-term relationships. We're not trying to maximize price. We're trying to serve our customers and make sure that we get paid for offering a really differentiated product service or solution. So we've always had pricing power in these businesses. I think ultimately, these are going to be discussions with customers when costs start to normalize and there might be a few exceptions, but by and large, we expect to hold on to these price increases to recover the margins like I said earlier. So that's typically what happens. If you go back and look in time, we're going to end up with a period where we recover that margin percentage and we don't expect the current cycle to be any different. Mig Dobre : Okay. Thank you. Michael Larsen : Sure. Operator : Next, we'll go to Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is now open. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Good morning. Maybe just wanted to try and understand the sort of earnings framework for the year a little bit. So it looks as if sort of operating margins are set to go up by about 300 basis points between kind of Q1 and Q4 with a flattish dollar revenue. Is that all simply the price cost removal of the headwind? Is there any other kind of major moving parts? And also to that point, are you sticking to that kind of 47-53 first half second half EPS split? Michael Larsen : Yeah. So let me address that. I mean, I think, we're still in that 46% to 47% in the first half and the balance in the second half. And the big driver really is, what we've talked about it feels like for a while here is price/cost beginning to turn positive, based again on the assumptions that we're making in our guidance. So that's the drive. Now historically, we do 49%, 51%. So it's a couple of percentage points. So, but it is a little bit more back-end loaded. We expect that as we go through the year, sequentially starting in Q2 margins will improve and so will revenues. And that's just based again on kind of historical run rates. And so we expect a steady kind of improvement in Q2, Q3 and in Q4 including on the margin side. Whether it's exactly the number you laid out, I can't really comment. But directionally that's \u2013 that is the right way to look at it. Julian Mitchell : Thanks, Michael. And then switching to the balance sheet, which I don't think has been touched on yet, and maybe some customer element as well. But your inventories are up, I think almost sort of 50% year-on-year, and up 10%-plus sequentially in Q1. Just kind of trying to understand, when do you think that starts to level out? And this major sort of inventory build that you're seeing how assure you that you're not seeing the same phenomenon across your customers and channel partners, as well with obviously some risk to that, if we do see final demand slowdown? Michael Larsen : Well, so I think if you look at our inventory levels, we were running at about three months on hand. Our historical is two months. And so we have an extra month of inventory on hand. And I think we've been very clear about why that is. It's to mitigate supply chain risk, it's to take care of our customers and ultimately to win this recovery and take share at a point where our competitors are maybe not able to service our customers. So that's the vast majority of these inventory increases, just kind of maybe a little housekeeping. If you look at our conversion rate here in Q1 the difference between the 38% and the 80% to 85% is about $300 million of working capital very intentional investments. We believe a really smart use of our balance sheet. And you saw the top line growth, right at 11% organic this quarter. That I would argue would not have happened if we've not taken this approach starting really last year to make a conscious decision to invest in inventory. And then, obviously, receivables will go up as you grow double-digit. Ultimately, we don't see any reason why structurally when supply chain begins to normalize both from an availability standpoint and also from a cost standpoint that we will go back to two months on hand. And at that point if that happens you'll see these free cash flow numbers will deliver above-average performance, until we're back to kind of normal levels. So we view this really as a temporary increase in working capital. How quickly that will come down, depends on a lot of things, including what you're talking about and -- which is inventory in the channel where we really don't have a lot of visibility. Other than I can tell you, for the most part the channel does not carry a lot of inventory because they're used to the fact that we will take care of them when they need products. So there's no incentive for them to carry a lot of extra inventory. So, that's probably the best I can give you Julian. Julian Mitchell : That's perfect. Thank you. Operator : That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Thank you for your participating in today's conference call. All lines may now disconnect.",

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the ITW Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]  Thank you, Karen Fletcher, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. Karen Fletcher : Thank you, David. Good morning, and welcome to ITW's Second Quarter 2022 Conference Call. I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi; and Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen. During today's call, we will discuss ITW's second quarter financial results and update our guidance for full year 2022. Slide 2 is a reminder that this presentation contains forward-looking statements. We refer you to the company's 2021 Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. This presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures and a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release. Please turn to Slide 3, and it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi. Scott Santi : Thank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. The ITW team delivered another quarter of strong operational execution and financial performance with organic growth of 10.4%, operating margin of 23.1%, after-tax return on invested capital of 27.8% and GAAP EPS of $2.37. In the second quarter, we saw continued strong demand across our portfolio, supported by our 80/20 front-to-back driven operational capabilities. Our teams continue to do an exceptional job of delivering for our customers and aggressively executing our Win the Recovery strategy to accelerate profitable market penetration and organic growth. As a result of our advantaged operational execution and delivery performance, we are being rewarded with meaningful additional share by our customers as evidenced by our 10.5% organic growth in the first half of this year. While input cost inflation and supply chain issues remain challenging, we did see some stabilization on both fronts in Q2. In fact, for the first time in 2 years, price/cost margin dilution headwind improved sequentially from negative 250 basis points in Q1 to negative 160 basis points in Q2 as our businesses continue to do an excellent job of adjusting price to offset input cost inflation, and the pace and magnitude of input cost increases moderated somewhat. Importantly, our teams delivered these strong operational and financial results while continuing to drive meaningful progress on the execution of our long-term enterprise strategy. And they delivered another 90 basis points of margin improvement from enterprise initiatives in the quarter. Based on our first half results and projecting current demand and supply rates through the balance of the year, we are maintaining our guidance for full year 2022, with organic growth of 8.5% at the midpoint, margins in the range of 24% to 25% and GAAP EPS of $9.20 at the midpoint, which would be an all-time record for the company. Excluding onetime tax items in both years, this represents EPS growth of 12%. While the near-term environment remains challenging and the global macro is certainly uncertain, ITW remains strongly positioned to continue to deliver differentiated performance for our shareholders, differentiated service to our customers and continued progress on our path to ITW's full potential performance through the back half of the year and beyond. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Michael, who will provide more detail on the quarter and our full year outlook. Michael? Michael Larsen : Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. In Q2, quarterly revenue grew 9% and exceeded $4 billion for the first time since 2012, with strong organic growth of 10.4%. The MTS acquisition contributed 3% to revenue. Foreign currency translation was a 4% headwind. Despite $0.10 of year-over-year EPS headwind from foreign currency translation and $0.05 of higher restructuring expense, GAAP EPS was $2.37, the second highest quarterly EPS ever. By geography, North America grew 14% and international grew 6%, with 6% growth in Europe and 3% growth in Asia Pacific. China organic revenue was down 4%, and we estimate that the China lockdowns reduced our organic growth rate by about 1 percentage point at the enterprise level, which we fully expect to recover in the second half. Operating margin was 23.1% with operating leverage of 200 basis points and 90 basis points of enterprise initiatives. Margin headwinds included 50 basis points each from the MTS acquisition and higher restructuring expense related to 80/20 front-to-back projects. And the margin dilution impact from price cost was 160 basis points. Free cash flow was $420 million, an increase of 69% versus Q1. So we remain committed to intentional working capital investments to support growth, mitigate supply chain risk and sustain service levels for our key customers. The routine resolution of a U.S. tax audit resulted in a onetime tax benefit of $0.16. And as you may recall, in Q2 last year had a $0.35 onetime tax benefit. As a result, our Q2 tax rate this year was 18.3% as compared to 10.1% last year. Excluding these onetime tax benefits, the effective tax rate was 23.9% this year and 23% last year. Please turn to Slide 4 with a look at price/cost and the beginning of the improvement trend on margin dilution that Scott mentioned. Thanks to our business's decisive price actions throughout this inflationary cycle, we have stayed ahead of inflation on a dollar-per-dollar basis. And the seemingly endless barrage of cost increases over the last 12 months appear to have leveled off such that we are beginning to recover the margin dilution impact. Based on all known costs and price increases, this positive trend is projected to continue such that the margin impact is expected to be neutral in the second half. Throughout this 2-year inflationary cycle, while we have more than covered cost increases on a dollar-for-dollar basis, we have absorbed as much as 250 basis points of margin dilution impact. As raw material cost inflation begins to moderate on a year-over-year basis, we are confident that we're going to recover this margin impact, hopefully, starting in 2023. Moving on to the segments. Automotive OEM delivered solid organic growth of 6% with 18% growth in North America. Europe was down about 1% and China was down 11%. At this point, and consistent with our prior guidance, we do not expect a meaningful improvement in the chip shortage situation impacting auto production until 2023. In effect, our guidance assumes that automotive production remains around current levels for the second half. While we are getting positive signals from several of our customers in terms of preparing for a Q3 and Q4 ramp-up in auto production, we are taking a more conservative approach to our guidance per our usual process. And even with revenue around current levels, keep in mind that the year-over-year comps ease in the second half, which sets the Automotive OEM segment up as a meaningful contributor to the overall organic growth rate of the enterprise through the balance of the year. Operating margin was 17% when excluding 270 basis points of 80/20 front-to-back restructuring impact this quarter. As supply chain issues get resolved down the road and auto production ramps up, we're confident that we'll see some strong organic growth rates for an extended period of time and a return to the segment's historic margin rates in the low to mid-20s. Let's turn to Slide 5 for Food Equipment, which led the way this quarter with an organic growth rate of 25%, record quarterly revenues of $614 million and operating margin of 24.7%. North America grew 27% with double-digit growth in every major category and end market. Both restaurants and institutions were up around 40% and retail growth was in the mid-teens. International revenue grew 23%, with Europe up 25% and Asia Pacific up 11%. Orders remain very strong in this segment. Test & Measurement and Electronics revenue grew 15%, with organic growth of 1%, which, as you know, is uncharacteristically low for this segment and entirely due to the timing of a large equipment order from an Electronics customer in Q2 last year. Adjusted for that order, segment organic growth would have been about 7%, which is a more accurate representation of how strong the order intake is. Test & Measurement organic growth was 8%, with continued strong demand for CapEx as evidenced by Instron growth of 5%, as well as continued strength in semiconductor-related end markets. Moving to Slide 6. On another positive note, Welding's organic growth was also strong at plus 22%, with equipment up 24% and consumables up 19%. Industrial grew 29% and the Commercial business was up 19%. North America, which is about 80% of our sales, grew 25%. Oil and gas was up 8%. Sequentially from Q1, revenue was up 8% with continued strong order intake. Operating margin improved 80 basis points to 29.3%. Polymers & Fluids grew 10% organically, with Polymers up 25% on continued strength in MRO and heavy industry applications. Automotive aftermarket was up 4% and Fluids grew 3%. On a geographic basis, North America grew 8% and International was up 13%. While sequential revenue grew from Q1, we did see some slowing demand in our automotive aftermarket business as consumers are dealing with rising inflation and gas prices. On to Slide 7. And Construction delivered strong organic growth of 15%, with continued strength in North America, which was up 29%. U.S. residential grew 34% and commercial was up 20%. While Europe and Australia and New Zealand were up 5% and 4%, respectively, the international businesses started to show some signs of slowing in their order rates towards the end of the quarter. Specialty was the only segment that didn't grow, with organic revenue down 2% as supply chain constraints caused a delay in the delivery of some larger international equipment orders that are now on track for the second half. On a geographic basis, North America was up 5%, while International was down 13%. Okay. Let's turn to Slide 8 for an update on our full year 2022 guidance, which remains unchanged. Per our usual process, our guidance is based on our actual results year-to-date and a projection of current levels of demand through the balance of the year. As a result, our organic growth projection of 7% to 10% remains unchanged. The acquisition of MTS is projected to add 3% to revenue, and based on current foreign exchange rates, the headwind from foreign currency translation is now 4% versus a prior expectation of 1.5%. We are maintaining our full year GAAP EPS guidance range of $9 to $9.40. And compared to our prior guidance on May 3, the onetime favorable tax benefit of $0.16 in Q2 is offset by $0.20 of additional EPS headwind from foreign exchange, which is now embedded in the outlook. Our operating margin guidance is unchanged at 24% to 25%, with about 100 basis points contribution from enterprise initiatives. Price/cost margin dilution impact is unchanged at 100 basis points, which implies that the second half margin dilution impact is about neutral as compared to 200 basis points of headwind in the first half. Finally, there's no change to free cash flow generation or share repurchases of $1.5 billion, and our tax rate for the full year is expected to be in the range of 22% to 23%. We've often talked about the fact that ITW is a company that can deliver top-tier results in any environment, and this year is no exception. We're obviously not immune to the macro challenges and uncertainties that may lie ahead, but we remain confident that ITW is very well positioned to continue to deliver differentiated best-in-class performance as we leverage our diversified high-quality business portfolio, the competitive strength of ITW's proprietary business model and our team's proven ability to execute at a very high level in any environment. With that, Karen, I'll turn it back to you. Karen Fletcher : Okay. Thanks, Michael. David, let's open up the lines for questions, please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Andrew Kaplowitz : Scott or Mike, could you give us a little more color on underlying demand trends you're seeing in your more consumer versus capital goods businesses? I know you mentioned just tough comparison Electronics, some slowing in auto aftermarket. But obviously, we all have increased focus on macro slowdown. Are you seeing signs of moderating demand as consumer demand still holding up? Michael Larsen : Go ahead, Scott. Scott Santi : I was going to say, I think Michael told you exactly where we're seeing it, which is a couple of pockets. One is the auto aftermarket business for reasons that are pretty logical related to the gas prices and consumers' discretionary spending in that arena and then the other is our international construction businesses that we did see a little bit of a pullback. Those 2 -- those businesses combined represent, I think, less than 15% of the company's overall revenues. And for the other 85%, we see things remain very strong. Andrew Kaplowitz : That's helpful, Scott. And then Michael, I think you had talked about 200 basis points of price/cost impacting in Q2, and I think it read out of $160 million. So maybe you can give us a little more color on how you're thinking. I know you said neutral for the second half of the year, but obviously, commodity prices have come down pretty significantly lately. So how long does it take for that to read through? And is there maybe some upside to that second half neutral forecast? Michael Larsen : Well, I think I explained, Andy, can how we do this. I mean, based on all the known price and cost increases as we sit here today, we expect -- Scott Santi : And decrease -- Michael Larsen : And decreases in certain cases. That's all of those things are cost decreases. All of those things are baked into our assumption today. And when you project that in a pretty mechanical calculation, so there's no assumption here that things get better or worse, it's based on what we know today, that margin dilution impact is essentially neutral here in the second half of the year. And that's how you get that 200-basis point swing in the second half of the year relative to the first half of the year. Operator : Next, we'll go to Tami Zakaria with JP Morgan. Tami Zakaria : Just a quick follow-up on what you said earlier. I think you mentioned some weakness in international construction end markets. Is that focused on both resi and non-resi for you? Scott Santi : Yes. The biggest positions we have in both of those markets is by far residential. So I think they mostly speak to what's going on in those markets in the residential side in both Europe and Australia. Michael Larsen : Yes. And I would just add to that. I mean, we are also seeing a lot of strength in other parts of the company. So while less than 15% may be experiencing a little bit of a slowdown some of the other segments, Food Equipment, Welding, Test & Measurement, Electronics are off to a really strong start here in Q3. If you just look at our July numbers overall for the company, on a year-over-year basis, we're up 18%. So that is the highest monthly organic growth rate that we've seen all year. Sequentially, from June, we are up in July, where typically we are down and actually, 5 of 7 segments are growing double digits. So there's a lot of strength in other parts of the company that at least for the month of July are offsetting some of the slowing we've seen in the parts of the company that we've talked about. Tami Zakaria : That is super helpful color. And along the same line, has your expectation for overall organic growth in Europe changed since the beginning of the year? The reason I ask it seems like some people are thinking Europe would be in a recession in the back half. Does that alter your expectation for the region in the near term? A \u2013 Michael Larsen : I think we are pretty close to where we were on our last call, which I think we said we expect kind of low single-digit type growth rates in Europe based again on current run rates. As you know, we\u2019re not assuming any change in the macro other than kind of what we\u2019re seeing today. We are in Europe, I should say, we are hearing some positive \u2013 we are getting some positive signals, like I said in the script, from our automotive customers in terms of potential ramp-up in production here in September and in Q4. And likewise, that\u2019s not baked into our guidance as we sit here today. So I hope you get the sense there\u2019s a lot of puts and takes across the company. And overall, we\u2019re on track to a really strong second half for the company. Operator : Next, we'll go to Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeff Sprague : Before my question, can we just clarify, Michael, interesting color on July, thanks for that. When you say in July the 85% that's not under pressure is up 18% or the total company is up 18%. Michael Larsen : The total company. Yes, on an EBITDA basis, the auto company is up 18% here in July. Jeff Sprague : That's interesting and surprising. Good to hear. I'm just curious on Welding. I would have guessed perhaps that seeing that stronger number in Welding that maybe oil and gas would have been stronger than up 8%. So it sounds like it must have been pretty broad-based strength across most of the markets that you can kind of see into. So maybe you could give a little bit of color there what's going on in Welding, both from a vertical market standpoint? And any color on what's going on maybe in the channels? Michael Larsen : Yes. I mean, as you know, 80% of our business is North America, and that's where the strength was, up 25%. And really, you heard equipment up 24%, consumables up 19%, strength in industrial and commercial. And then the international side was up 8%. And that's where our primary oil and gas exposure resides. Europe was up 20%. And then the China business was down, which was the lockdowns again. So down about 6%. And we, like I said earlier, are fully expecting to recover that here in the back half of the year. But a lot of strength in the North America business for sure. And I would be remiss if I didn't point out the margin performance of north of 29% operating margin. So a really strong quarter for the welding business, and Q3 is looking really good so far. Scott Santi : And just maybe a little additional color. The real strike there in Q2 is the Industrial side. I think, Jeff, part of your question was related to the channel, and that's not a product -- a category of products that typically is inventory in a significant degree of the channel. These are larger, more complex products, machines and systems and they are typically sold into end users for specific projects. So there's not a lot of channel inventory at any point on those products. Operator : Next, we'll go to Scott Davis with Melius Research. Scott Davis : Just to be clear, guys, I know you don't disclose price explicitly, but is price still going up and net realized price still going up? Michael Larsen : We are still -- there is a lag here, as you know, from the time we see the cost increases to the price is being realized. That is somewhere between 1 to 2 quarters, and we are still in catch-up mode here in the second half of the year. Obviously, on a margin basis, we talked about that and also on a dollar basis. Scott Davis : Okay. That's what I thought. I just wanted to clarify. And then what -- I know, obviously, the FX has a translation impact, but it can have a trade impact. Can you remind us what businesses you are doing much export -- Scott Santi : We do almost -- yes. Sorry to cut you off, Scott. I'll let you finish your question. I was just going to say, we are producing locally to sell locally. We do very little cross-border commerce, either on the input side or the export side. There's a little bit here and there, but less than 5% of our revenue. It's something like. Yes, it's something like 2% of our imports are from China. I mean, it's really de minimis. We are produced where we sell a company. Our suppliers are local, our customers are local so our exposure is largely translation. So we are sourcing in the same currency that we are producing and selling in the vast majority of cases. Operator : Next, we'll go to Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo. Joe O'Dea : I wanted to start on the consumer and sort of the less than 15% that you were talking about. And I think you've talked previously where maybe over half of revenue kind of broadly tied to consumer. But can you help kind of segment that a little bit in terms of where you might have consumer exposure that would be a little bit more tied to something like overall consumer confidence and where you would have exposures that or a little bit more maybe durable in terms of demand trends and not as tied to what we would think about as sort of pressures related to a broad consumer slowdown? Scott Santi : I think, Joe, we really highlighted the 2 big ones, which is construction, residential and then the automotive aftermarket business. The other one maybe that I would add is in our specialty business, we do a fair amount of consumer packaging. So beverages and resealable closures for things like cheese and other food products that I think have generally proven to be pretty resilient during times of economic contraction, consumer staples basically. Joe O'Dea : And then on supply chain, I mean the PMI yesterday for July, I mean, still showing very extended lead times. I think you talked to stabilization, but I'm assuming that means exactly that, not that things are getting better. Can you talk about sort of any visibility that you have into timing of supply chain starting to improve a little bit from a point of stabilization? Scott Santi : What I would say overall is we have no visibility to any improvement. We are not planning on it. I'm sure that it will get better at some point. I think we have been -- our business has been very resilient in terms of working their way through various issues and challenges, computer chips, you name it. And we are finding a way to serve our customers, and that's that remains, I think, the posture that we have. And until it changes, we're not changing what we're doing and I think we're on it, but it's still not easy. Operator : Next, we'll go to Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies. Stephen Volkmann : I was wondering maybe if we could just go back to the price/cost margin dilution chart. I'm assuming there's some sort of a linear relationship here and that 3Q is probably still a small headwind and the exit rate at 4Q is probably a tailwind. Is that a reasonable expectation? Michael Larsen : I think as we sit here today, I think that's a reasonable expectation, yes. Stephen Volkmann : And so Michael, I'm trying to think a little bit further into '23 and just rather than think about volumes, they'll be whatever they are, but you're going to have a few things kind of moving here in terms of sort of price/cost and dilution from MTS and some of the restructuring that you've done. Any way to start to think about what incremental margins in '23 might look like sort of when all is said and done? Michael Larsen : Yes. I think you're right, Steve. There is a lot going on. What I can tell you is that as we kind of peel back the onion on our incrementals, so adjusting for all the things you just talked about, MTS, restructuring and price/cost, we are right back at our core incremental margins in that 35% range right now, and we wouldn't expect anything different in 2023. Obviously, we haven't done the planning yet, but that's kind of long term what you should expect from us is incrementals in that 35% range. Operator : Next, we'll go to Mig Dobre with Baird. Mig Dobre : I've been doing this for a while, but my name is always butchered on these earnings calls. Maybe to kind of follow up on Steve's question here thinking about '23. I'm curious, as you're looking at the amount of pricing that you had to put through this year. Is there a good way to think about the carryover that's going to go into '23 relative to '22 from a top line perspective, contribution to the top line? Michael Larsen : I think it's a little too early, Mig. I mean, clearly, there will be some carryover. But to try and quantify that right now for you, I don't think would be helpful. Scott Santi : We've got to get it to our planning process, which is really we're talking about November-ish before we'll have a reasonable view on that, and I think that's the appropriate time. Michael Larsen : Yes. I mean, I think the only thing I would point back to is what I said in these prepared remarks is that if you add up the price/cost margin dilution impact during this cycle over this year and last year of about 250 basis points, the expectation is that as things begin to normalize, we will recover that margin impact over time. Now how exactly that will play out and the timing around that is not entire clear as we sit here today. But there will be -- I think it's reasonable to assume that some of that impact will be in 2023. Mig Dobre : Okay. I guess, if I may follow up on this. I'm trying to probe a little bit about your degree of confidence that the business overall will be able to outgrow industrial production as we're thinking '23 and beyond. This has been a big topic, right, over the past few years. You talked about winning the recovery and investing through the downturn. So I'm curious if you can maybe update us a little bit on your degree of confidence that we can continue to see out growth. Scott Santi : Well, I don't know exactly what I can do to reassure you other than to tell you that it continues to be the #1 dominant priority of every member of ITW from China to Europe to North America to South America, and it is, certainly, we think we've got a terrific opportunity going forward. We have done a lot of things in terms of investing and positioning ourselves to execute on it and the proof will be in the pudding. But it's already happening. Michael Larsen : Yes. I agree with that, Mig. I mean, I think if you look at the results we put up so far, and granted there's some recovery in here, but last year, organic was up 12%. The first half is up 10% organic this year. I think relative to peers, we're certainly closing the gap compared to where we were kind of just a few years ago. So I think yes, the proof will be in the organic growth rate numbers that we're going to put up. But I also will tell you there is a high degree of confidence that we are making significant progress. Lots more to do, but certainly, we are headed in the right direction here for sure. Operator : And we'll take our final question from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Sorry about that. Just wanted to clarify on the margin outlook because I suppose the margin rate or the margin guide for the year implies the fourth quarter margins are maybe up 300, 400 basis points year-on-year or something. Just wanted to confirm that, that's roughly the right way to think about the back half guide. And maybe what are the main drivers of that big fourth quarter margin uplift? Michael Larsen : Yes. I mean, the big driver for the second half here is what we just talked about, which is 200 basis points of price/cost margin dilution impact in the first half, that's not projected to repeat in the second half. So that's probably the biggest driver. I think you also have to factor in -- if you just run rate -- if you just take our current revenues and project those into Q3 and Q4 because the comps are easing on a year-over-year basis, we'll be putting up some meaningful organic growth rates with all the operating leverage and the incrementals that are returning to something a lot closer to our historical incrementals in the back half of the year. And so those are kind of the big drivers here, less price/cost margin headwind and significant organic growth year-over-year with more normal incremental margins in that 35%, maybe plus range for the back half of the year. Julian Mitchell : I understand. And then just a follow-up on free cash flow. I think your sort of 90% odd conversion guide for the year on free cash, that implies, I think, sort of 50% growth in the free cash year-on-year in the second half. So just help us understand how do you get that monstrous sort of free cash flow expansion. Is that just a mass of sort of inventory destock because supply chains are easing? Maybe just any color around that because it is a big move for a sort of a company. Michael Larsen : It's a little bigger than usual. I mean, as you know, historically, our second half cash flows are always significantly higher than the first half. It's a little bit more this time. We've talked about the fact that we've been very intentional in terms of our working capital investments to support the growth that we're seeing double-digit growth at the top line, mitigate supply chain risk, which is still a reality and then sustain the service levels for our customers. So we will carry whatever inventory we need to do those things. If you look at our months on hand, we're running right around 3 months on hand. And we really only need a slight improvement in that in the months on hand to get to those free cash flow numbers. So as we sit here today, we do have a line of sight to a ramp-up in the second half. But like I said, we think it's a smart use of this balance sheet to support everything we're trying to do from an organic growth standpoint by taking care of our customers. And I will say this, if we come in at the low end of the range, it won't change anything in terms of our capital allocation plans for the year. We'll still do the buyback. We'll still do, obviously, investments. We'll still do the dividend. And so there's really no trade-off here. But obviously, we'd like to hit the free cash flow number, and we have line of sight to doing that for the back half of the year. And we are obviously aware that it's a little bit more of a ramp than what we normally have. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the ITW Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Karen Fletcher, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Karen Fletcher : Okay. Thank you, Rob. Good morning and welcome to ITW\u2019s third quarter 2022 conference call. I am joined by our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi and Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen. During today\u2019s call, we will discuss ITW\u2019s third quarter financial results and our updated guidance for full year 2022. Slide 2 is a reminder that this presentation contains forward-looking statements. We refer you to the company\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. This presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures and a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release. Please turn to Slide 3 and it\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi. Scott Santi : Thanks, Karen and good morning, everyone. In what remains a very dynamic and challenging operating environment, we were pleased with our Q3 performance. On the top line, we delivered 13% revenue growth with 16% organic growth from our base businesses. While we did see some softening in channel inventory reduction actions in our businesses serving the construction, auto aftermarket, commercial welding and appliance markets, five of our seven segments delivered double-digit organic growth, led by automotive OEM, up 25% and food equipment, up 23%. With regard to margins, we were glad to see our incremental margins in Q3 return to our normal 30% plus level for the first time in five quarters as the impact of volume growth, enterprise initiatives, pricing actions and some moderation in the pace of input cost inflation drove incremental margin of 39% and a 130 basis point improvement in operating margin in our base businesses. We have lost roughly 250 basis points of margin due to price/cost during this period of rapid inflation, which we fully expect to recover over time once the current inflationary environment stabilizes and it was certainly good to see a nice solid first step in that direction in Q3. On the bottom line, strong growth and margin performance resulted in GAAP EPS of $2.35, up 16% versus Q3 of last year and that 16% growth includes $0.13 of negative impact from currency. Excluding currency, earnings per share were up 23%. Looking at our current performance, our decision to stay invested in our long-term strategy and in our people during the pandemic and the quality of our team\u2019s execution of our recovery strategy coming out of it are fueling the strong organic growth and financial performance that we are currently delivering. While the economic outlook is becoming increasingly uncertain, demand remains solid across the majority of our business portfolio. And as a result, the company is well positioned to deliver a strong finish to what has been a very strong year. With that, I will now turn the call over to Michael who will provide more detail on the quarter and our updated guidance. Michael? Michael Larsen : Thank you, Scott and good morning everyone. In Q3, revenue grew 13% to $4 billion, with strong organic growth of 16%. The MTS acquisition contributed 3% to revenue. Foreign currency translation was a 6% headwind compared to a 4% headwind last quarter. And despite $0.13 of year-over-year EPS headwind from foreign currency translation, GAAP EPS was $2.35, an increase of 16%. Excluding MTS, incremental margin in our base business was 39%, which as Scott said, was a welcome return to our normal historical incremental margin rates. As a result of our strong revenue and margin performance, operating income increased 16% to $983 million, which was an all-time quarterly record. Operating margin was 24.5%, with operating leverage of almost 300 basis points and 110 basis points of enterprise initiatives. Excluding 60 basis points of margin impact from the MTS acquisition, operating margin expanded 130 basis points to 25.1%. Free cash flow was solid at $612 million, an increase of 46% versus Q2 and 12% year-over-year. The conversion rate of 84% is lower than our typical Q3 performance as we remain committed in the near term to intentional working capital investments to support double-digit organic growth, mitigate supply chain risk and sustain service levels to our key customers. Finally, share repurchases in Q3 were $500 million and our effective tax rate was 24% versus 21% in the prior year. With that, let\u2019s turn to Slide 4 and starting with organic growth by geography. We delivered growth in the mid-teens across all major geographies, led by North America up 17%. Europe, which represents about 23% of our sales, grew 14%, led by automotive OEM up 26% and food equipment, up 15%. China grew 15%, led by Test & Measurement and Electronics, up 32% and automotive OEM was up 29%. Price/cost was accretive to income in Q3 and slightly dilutive by 40 basis points to margin. As we have said before, our business teams around the world have done an exceptional job of adjusting price to offset cost increases throughout the most significant inflationary cycle in over 40 years. And should the pace of raw material cost inflation continue to moderate, we expect price/cost to be accretive to income and slightly accretive to margin in Q4. As Scott mentioned, throughout this unprecedented 2-year inflationary cycle, the company has absorbed as much as 250 basis points of margin dilution impact from price/cost, which we expect to fully recover of the succeeding six to eight quarters after input prices stabilize. Moving on to the segments. Automotive OEM delivered strong organic growth of 25%, with North America up 21% and Europe up 26%. China was up 29%, which included some sequential recovery from the lockdown impact in Q2. When looking at these year-over-year growth rates, keep in mind that the comparisons are against the Q3 last year when the chip shortage led to a low point for auto production. We continue to make good progress on our content per vehicle growth as evidenced by our year-to-date organic growth rate of 9% compared to auto builds of 7%, in line with our long-term market outgrowth target of 2 to 3 percentage points. Consistent with our guidance all year, we do not expect a meaningful improvement in the chip shortage situation impacting automotive production until next year. And we continue to take a more conservative approach to our guidance, which assumes that automotive production essentially remains around current levels through the balance of this year. And as we have said before, as supply chain issues eventually get resolved down the road, we remain confident that the automotive OEM segment is well positioned to be a very meaningful contributor to the overall organic growth rate of the enterprise for an extended period of time. And as that plays out, we also expect that the automotive OEM segment returns to its typical historical operating margin rates in the low to mid-20s. Turning to Slide 5. Food Equipment delivered strong organic growth of 23% as North America grew 30% with double-digit growth in every major category and end market. Growth in institutional markets was 50% plus with strength across several categories, most notably lodging. Restaurants were up around 40% and retail growth was in the mid-teens. International revenue grew 14% with Europe up 15% and Asia Pacific up 9%. Test & Measurement and Electronics revenue grew 29%, with organic growth of 17% as Test & Measurement grew 20% and Electronics was up 14%. Growth was broad-based with continued strength in semiconductor and CapEx spending as evidenced by organic growth of 13% in the Instron business. Moving on to Slide 6, welding grew 14% organically, with equipment up 13% and consumables up 15%. Industrial was the standout with organic growth of 32%. The commercial side of the welding business, which sells to smaller businesses and individual users, was down 10% due to lower demand and inventory destocking in the channel. However, due to the strength on the industrial side, North America still grew 14% and international grew 12%. Sales to oil and gas customers were up 12% in the quarter. Operating margin improved 150 basis points to 31.5%, which was a new record for the Welding segment. Polymers & Fluids grew 8% organically, with Polymers up 21% on continued strength in industrial applications. Softening demand due to higher gas prices and the impact on consumer discretionary spend impacted the automotive aftermarket business, which was up 2%. Fluids was up 5% and overall North America grew 5%, international was up 14%. Construction delivered organic growth of 17% with continued strength in North America, which was up 35%. U.S. residential grew 42% and commercial was up 17%. That said, we did see some signs of slowing towards the end of the quarter and we expect that to continue in Q4, which we have reflected in our updated guidance. The international side of construction is slowing, with Europe down 1%. Australia and New Zealand was up 7% against an easy comparison. Specialty growth was essentially flat as product line simplification activities resulted in the elimination of a product line in one of our consumer packaging businesses. Excluding PLS, the segment would have been up 3%. Demand in our appliance components division slowed, which we have reflected in our updated guidance. On a geographic basis, North America was down 2% and international grew 4%. Looking on Slide 8 for an update on the year and starting with the top line, we are raising our full year organic growth guidance to 11% to 12% due to the strength of our Q3 organic growth performance and projecting current levels of demand, which remains strong across most of our businesses. But we are also anticipating further slowing in the end markets we talked about, including global residential construction, automotive aftermarket, commercial welding and appliance components, that combined represent about 20% of total company revenue. The MTS acquisition is expected to add 3% to revenue and at current exchange rates, currency translation will reduce revenue by 5%, resulting in total revenue for the year up 9% to 10%. For Q4, we are well positioned to deliver a strong finish to a very strong year with organic growth of approximately 10% and GAAP EPS growth of about 40%. In Q4 and consistent with our previously announced plan to divest certain business units, we completed the sale of a division within the Polymers & Fluids segment, with an estimated after-tax gain of $0.45 per share. We have included this Q4 gain in our updated full year guidance. And per our usual process, we have narrowed the range for the year with one quarter to go and updated our guidance to reflect current foreign exchange rates, which results in additional foreign currency headwind versus our prior guidance. So as a result of including the gain on sale and updating guidance with current foreign exchange rates, our updated full year GAAP EPS guidance range is $9.45 to $9.55. We are projecting operating margin of approximately 24% for the full year, which includes approximately 100 basis points contribution from enterprise initiatives, about 200 basis points contribution from volume leverage and estimated 100 basis points of negative margin impact from price/cost and about 50 basis points of margin dilution from the acquisition of MTS. We expect free cash flow conversion of approximately 80%, which, as we have talked about, is below our typical 100% plus conversion rate due to the intentional near-term working capital investments that support the company\u2019s double-digit revenue growth, mitigate supply chain risk and sustained customer service levels. And finally, share repurchases are now expected to be $1.75 billion for the full year, an increase of $250 million versus prior guidance. Looking forward, we are obviously not immune to the macro challenges and uncertainties that may lie ahead. But through the execution of our enterprise strategy, we have positioned this company to deliver top-tier results in any environment, as reflected in our differentiated performance at the depth of the pandemic and in the very dynamic and challenging conditions that have characterized the recovery over the last 2 years. We remain confident that the combination of the powerful competitive advantages we derive from ITW\u2019s proprietary business model, our high-quality business portfolio and our team\u2019s proven ability to consistently execute at a very high level ahead well prepared to continue to outperform in whatever economic conditions emerge in 2023 and beyond. With that, Karen, I will turn it back to you. Karen Fletcher : Okay. Thanks, Michael. Rob let\u2019s open up the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Davis from Melius Research. Your line is open. Scott Davis : Good morning, Scott and Michael and Karen. Scott Santi : Good morning. Scott Davis : I am not very good at math, but just thinking through this with your guidance on the full year on price/cost, I think it implies that you are actually going to be in meaningful positive territory on price/cost in Q4. Is that \u2013 am I reading that right? Michael Larsen : That is correct. So we are going \u2013 we\u2019re expecting that if inflation stays where it is, and so based on the known increases and decreases and based on the price that we expect to realize in the fourth quarter, that price/cost will be accretive on an EPS basis and also, for the first time in a while, accretive on a margin basis as well. Scott Davis : Okay. That\u2019s super helpful. And how do you \u2013 I mean, it seems like we\u2019re walking into a construction recession, but how do you guys \u2013 I mean, are you planning \u2013 how do you plan for that, given 80/20 and just the business model that you have? It\u2019s not like you\u2019re going to go do a bunch of restructuring. But how do you get ahead of that so that you can limit the impact of it? Scott Santi : Well, we\u2019ve talked about this before, but one of the fundamental elements of 80/20 is that we are \u2013 that we have a very flexible cost structure. So we are \u2013 we do a lot of outsourcing upstream. We want to assemble. We want to control the manufacturing elements that really matter from the standpoint of control of quality-controlled delivery. But we don\u2019t necessarily have to bend all the metal. We don\u2019t have to necessarily do all the upstream work. And so what that gets us fundamentally, in fact, we prefer not to, and what ultimately that gives us is a relatively flexible cost structure. So we are a read and react company. Our businesses are going to respond to whatever the demand is that sits right in front of them. We\u2019ve talked about that before. We don\u2019t do a lot of forward forecasting. We are producing today what our customers bought yesterday. And as demand rates start to decline in places like construction, then those adjustments will take place real time. Scott Davis : Okay, that\u2019s a helpful reminder. Thank you, guys. I appreciate it. Good luck. Scott Santi : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tami Zakaria from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tami Zakaria : Hi, good morning. How are you? Scott Santi : Good. Good morning. Tami Zakaria : So I have two quick ones. The first one is, can you comment on which end markets you\u2019re anticipating for this slowdown? Meaning the 10% implied fourth quarter organic growth, are you currently run-rating above that but you\u2019re anticipating further slowdown and hence, you\u2019re guiding to about 10%? Michael Larsen : Yes, that\u2019s correct. So this is not our typical run rate. This has been adjusted with some anticipated further slowing in the end markets that we talked about. Tami Zakaria : Are you able to share like what the current run rate is? Michael Larsen : It is higher than the 10%. Tami Zakaria : Got it, got it. Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then the second one, can you comment on the price versus volume you saw in the third quarter? Because the last time you raised organic growth guidance earlier this year, I think you had mentioned that you saw some volume pickup. Did that sustain? Like what\u2019s the expectation for price versus volume in the fourth quarter? Michael Larsen : Yes. So as you know, Tami, we don\u2019t report price and volume separately. But what I think we can tell you is that we are seeing, in Q3, we saw meaningful volume growth across the company, including particularly in \u2013 if you look at the strength in Auto, Food Equipment, Test & Measurement, you\u2019re not going to put out numbers like that without a meaningful contribution from volume. Tami Zakaria : Got it. And you expect volume to sort of sustain in most of these end markets in the fourth quarter as well? Michael Larsen : Yes. I think that\u2019s the reason. Obviously, this is a very dynamic environment but there is a lot of strength in the businesses that I just talked about that more than offset some of the slowing we\u2019re seeing at about 20% of the company. So I think we\u2019re really well positioned for a strong finish here in Q4. And if you look at the implied guidance, we\u2019re looking at organic growth, like we said, double digit. We\u2019re looking at margin improvement of more than 100 basis points, GAAP EPS growth of 40%, 15% excluding the divestiture gain that we talked about earlier. So a really strong finish to what\u2019s been a very strong year for the company. Tami Zakaria : Okay, perfect. Thank you so much. Michael Larsen : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Your line is open. Andy Kaplowitz : Good morning, everyone. Scott Santi : Hi, Andy. Andy Kaplowitz : Scott, maybe just focusing on construction for a second, last quarter, you mentioned some potential incremental weakness in Europe and Australia. It seems like those are hanging in there. Obviously, North American residential up 42%, you talked about a little bit of weakening. So is this just strong share gains for ITW that have held up these businesses within construction? I know you mentioned you saw some slowing late in the quarter. Maybe give us more color to the rate of that slowing going forward? Michael Larsen : Well, I think what we\u2019ve seen is primarily a slowdown on the residential side, which is about 80% of our business. And we talked about softening on the international side here on our call last quarter. And so we did see Europe down 1%. I think that\u2019s pretty broad-based, UK, Continental Europe at this point, given some of the challenges, that\u2019s probably what you would expect. Australia and New Zealand is also slowing here. And as the comps get a little more difficult, you\u2019re going to see those growth rates start to come down. I think in North America, there is still a fair bit of, obviously, strength in the business. And then late in the quarter, we\u2019re really starting to see the order rates starting to come down on the residential side, so\u2026 Scott Santi : Yes, I think the only thing I would add is that it is among the most interest rate-sensitive end markets that we serve. And so you\u2019re seeing in the housing start data and a lot of other things that the rapid pace of interest rates rising is certainly starting to bite in the housing market. It\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019ll just point to the fact that it remains a very strong, very profitable business for us, and it points to just the value of the diversified portfolio is we\u2019re going to see some pressure in some places, but we\u2019ve got plenty of other places that are more than picking up and that\u2019s really by design. That\u2019s how we\u2019re trying to position the company ultimately to outperform in any environment. Andy Kaplowitz : Totally understand. And then maybe just backing up, what you\u2019re seeing across your industrial businesses, I mean, you talked a lot about the consumer businesses. Obviously, most of those businesses in the 20% are consumer facing. Have you seen any incremental weakness in your CapEx type businesses? Are they generally holding up? Scott Santi : Not yet. Andy Kaplowitz : Good enough. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Scott Santi : Good morning. Joe Ritchie : So nice to see the incremental margins ex MTS come back. Just given the comments that you\u2019re making around price/cost and turning positive, if inflation kind of holds at these levels and we\u2019re closer to peak inflation, would you expect to continue to achieve the same type of incremental margins going forward? Michael Larsen : I think it\u2019s reasonable to assume that our incremental margins will be a little bit higher than our normal range, just given the recovery on price/cost that we talked about. So assuming again, Joe, that from an inflation side that things stay where they are or continue to moderate, then that would be a reasonable expectation. Joe Ritchie : Okay, okay. Great. And then you mentioned, Michael, that 23% of your business in Europe, obviously, there is a lot of concern out there as we head into the winter on rising energy costs and potential recession in the region. I know that you guys have given already some color around trend, but just maybe anything else that you can kind of tell us about that region and then specifically from a cost perspective, how that impacts your business? Michael Larsen : Well, I mean, I think there is certainly a reason to be a little bit more concerned about Europe, just if you look at the macro picture. I think the fact is our businesses are performing at a really high level right now. And so if you just look at Q3, I\u2019ll just go back to a little bit of commentary on Europe specifically. We had six segments growing between 9% and 26%, and so double-digit growth in five of the seven segments and only construction was down 1%. And it\u2019s not all Auto. If you take out Auto, Europe still grew 10%. I think obviously, we expect those growth rates to moderate here in the fourth quarter. But I think we\u2019re really well positioned in Europe to deal with, just like the rest of the company, deal with whatever that\u2019s ahead. And if we have a little bit more softness maybe in Europe, maybe we have a little more strength in other parts of the world, and that\u2019s kind of how the company is set up, as Scott said. So we will read and react. We will deal with whatever is ahead of us, but we\u2019re confident that we will continue to outperform on a relative basis. Joe Ritchie : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Jamie Cook : Hi, good morning. Congrats on a nice quarter. I guess my first question, I know on the top line, you addressed the trends that you were seeing in construction. I was surprised a little bit on the margin in the quarter. So if you could first provide a little color around that, that would be helpful. And then I\u2019ll... Michael Larsen : Yes, Jamie, it\u2019s all price/cost in construction so a little bit more headwind here than in some of the other parts of the company. And so I will also say that 25.7% operating margin in construction is not too shabby at this point. So \u2013 but still, you\u2019re right. Relative to prior year, we\u2019re down due to the price/cost dynamic. Jamie Cook : Okay. And then I know you didn\u2019t want to answer in terms of as we\u2019re thinking about the organic growth, which surprised on the upside. I know you don\u2019t want to answer what you\u2019re seeing in terms of price versus volume, but is there any update you can provide on which segments you\u2019re seeing the most success in terms of gaining market share and how sustainable you think this market share is going forward? Thank you. Michael Larsen : Well, I think from the beginning in terms of the \u2013 so one, we\u2019re confident that we are gaining market share across the portfolio and the kind of the guidance was only strategic long-term market share gains and not opportunistic kind of one-time orders from new customers. So we\u2019ve really focused on serving our 80 customers, as we call them, our best customers better than anybody else. And because of our win the recovery positioning, we are doing that and as a result of that gaining market share. I mean, it\u2019s hard to \u2013 we have 83 divisions so it\u2019s hard to point to specific areas. But if you just look at our overall at the enterprise level, organic growth of 16% in the third quarter, I think relative to other industrial companies that will probably compare pretty well. Jamie Cook : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe O\u2019Dea from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Joe O\u2019Dea: Hi, good morning. Scott Santi : Good morning. Joe O\u2019Dea: Can you talk about the raw materials and sourced components waiting within COGS? And then sort of what you anticipate in terms of the timing of seeing each of those start to sort of flow through with maybe a more favorable situation in the P&L? Michael Larsen : Yes. So if I understand your question, so we\u2019re currently running at about 3 months on hand. We\u2019re typically running at 2 months on hand in terms of inventory. And as supply conditions here begin to normalize and we\u2019re going to see a return to normal levels in that 2 months on hand. When exactly that happens is difficult to predict, but we are starting to see some signs that supply chain is improving. So I think it\u2019s reasonable to assume that once conditions normalize, that it will take us about six to eight quarters to get back to 2 months on hand. And obviously, just like our conversion rate is below our historical typical levels at this point, they are going to be above for that period of time as we benefit from significant working capital release. When exactly that plays out is difficult to say. It\u2019s not all going to come back in one quarter. I mean, we\u2019ve built this up over 2 years. It\u2019s going to take some time to get it back out again. But we\u2019re confident we\u2019ve added the right level of inventory, and it\u2019s really put us in a great position to serve our customers, mitigate supply chain risk and, like we said, take market share. Scott Santi : I think just \u2013 I think the question was more in terms of our cost of goods, what percentage of those are material costs. Michael Larsen : Correct. Joe O\u2019Dea: Just kind of \u2013 yes. So all that was helpful. And I guess related to this, just with raw mats coming right, will raw mats flow through perfectly\u2026 Scott Santi : Okay. I think\u2026 Joe O\u2019Dea: I think as components that you source, will you get cost down on that or do you think that\u2019s a trickier dynamic? Scott Santi : Well, there is a lot of factors that go into the last part of your question. I think the simple answer on your first 1 is that the percentage of material as the \u2013 material cost percentage as an overall versus the overall COGS is going to vary. But let\u2019s just say, roughly 60%, 65%, 35% freight labor, other elements of the cost structure if that helps. Joe O\u2019Dea: Yes, okay. And then I wanted to ask one about the fourth quarter margin, excluding the divestiture. I\u2019m getting something like a 50 basis point sequential decline from 3Q to 4Q. If that\u2019s accurate, can you just help with the bridge? I assume there is a little bit of sort of sequential decremental on lower revenue, but then price/cost should be more favorable. Just any other items to kind of consider in that bridge? Michael Larsen : Yes. I think if you look at it historically, we typically \u2013 Q3 is our highest quarter and we go down in Q4. The primary driver is that there is just less shipping days in the fourth quarter. So I think this year, there are 61 shipping days in Q4. There were 64 in the third quarter and so that\u2019s really the main driver here. On EPS, obviously, implied is slightly lower than what we just did in Q3. And the delta there is the foreign exchange piece. Joe O\u2019Dea: Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher from UBS. Your line is open. Steven Fisher : Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to clarify on the construction side of things, you mentioned the slowing in Q4 on the U.S. residential piece. But I didn\u2019t hear any follow-up comments on the commercial piece. Is that expected to slow too? Michael Larsen : Well, usually, residential is kind of the leading indicator. So, we just haven\u2019t seen it yet. Scott Santi : On the commercial? Michael Larsen : Yes. Steven Fisher : Okay. So, maybe that would be something more like a 2023. I guess related to that, have you done any analysis to kind of look at the various stimulus programs that have been put in place and kind of to assess how that might end up flowing through your businesses? Michael Larsen : No, we haven\u2019t really. If you have any great idea, send them over. But we are a short-cycle company. We read and react what\u2019s in front of us, and trying to predict what the government is going to do, I think has not really been a winning equation for us anyway. It may work well for others but not in our case. Steven Fisher : Okay. And just one clarification maybe on the last question about the margin in Q4. I guess are there any particular segments that you anticipate margins actually improving in the fourth quarter or any that stand out kind of one direction or the other? Michael Larsen : I think the fourth quarter looks a lot like the third quarter, except the organic growth rates are coming down. And so from a margin standpoint, it\u2019s pretty close to the third quarter. Steven Fisher : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Volkmann from Jefferies. Your line is open. Stephen Volkmann : Hey. Good morning guys. Sorry, maybe beating a bit of a dead horse here. But I just wanted to make sure I get this right because it feels like there is a lot of declining prices in various inputs from commodities to transportation, even energy. Are you seeing any of your input costs actually declining yet? Michael Larsen : Yes, we are. I mean we saw a meaningful decline here in Q3 from Q2, and we expect to see the same thing in Q4. Stephen Volkmann : Okay. That makes sense. Thank you. And then just curious, can you update us on where you are with the various divestitures? Is there \u2013 should we be expecting more here? Are you kind of ramping that back up or is it just kind of whenever it happens? Michael Larsen : I think there is maybe one more potentially here in the near-term. And then we will have to assess the remainder and whether now is a good time to move forward with those. But I think our views haven\u2019t changed in terms of the portfolio and the raw material that we need in order to continue to deliver the type of results that we are delivering. And so we have about a handful of businesses that we had flagged for potential divestiture. We just completed one. Maybe one more to go and then the balance, we will kind of reassess in the New Year. Stephen Volkmann : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Thanks very much and good morning. Maybe one element I just wanted to dial into again was around sort of inventories and the cash flow outlook. So, the conversion only around, I think 80% now this year, which is obviously somewhere below your very high standards. I think Michael, you were quite guarded as to the pace of when that cash flow conversion comes back up. So, maybe help us understand how you see inventories at the customer level, the pace of your own inventory liquidation and how you are thinking about capital spending within the cash flow. Scott Santi : Yes. I will maybe start on the first part with regard to inventory, and that is that we haven\u2019t seen enough stability yet on the supply chain side to make us comfortable that we can start backing off. So, our first priority is to preserve our ability to serve our customers. And so at this point, we are still in the mode of keeping the inventories where they are. As we start to see things become more, let\u2019s call it, reliable and consistent there, then we will certainly start making a move. But as of right now, we have \u2013 we are not in the mood of \u2013 in the mode of starting to reduce inventories. Michael Larsen : Yes, obviously. So, it\u2019s not a matter of whether or not we are going to benefit from working capital coming back down to normal levels. That we are sure of, we just don\u2019t know when. And in the near-term, we are absolutely committed to what Scott talked about, which is intentional working capital, including inventory to support double-digit growth and significant market share gains. So, we will update you if and when that changes. And then we will let you know what we think exactly the \u2013 how it might play out from a free cash flow standpoint. Scott Santi : And there is a question on CapEx. Michael Larsen : Well, CapEx, I mean I think we have always funded every good project inside of the company, including during the pandemic, and I think that\u2019s going to continue. We are really fortunate that we are not a capital-intensive business, not \u2013 we are a pretty asset-light business model, as Scott described earlier. And so at maybe less than 2% of sales, CapEx doesn\u2019t suck up a significant amount of our total cash flow. So, we are very comfortable with continuing to invest in the business as we have done for many years, including throughout the pandemic. Julian Mitchell : Thank you. And then just my follow-up would be on the demand outlook in Test & Measurement and Electronics. Very good growth there in Q3. There is obviously a lot of noise at different customers on electronics in particular within that division, but you are still putting up mid-teens organic growth. So, maybe sort of help us understand some of the exposures in that piece. And do you think strong growth is sustainable, again, given what\u2019s going on in terms of a lot of customers in consumer electronics, semi equipment \u2013 semiconductor devices, how you are managing to grow at this rate? Michael Larsen : Well, yes. So, we think that the growth is sustainable. We have not seen anything to suggest that it\u2019s slowing down. We are obviously a big beneficiary from all the growth on the semi side of things. But also on the CapEx side with our Instron business, which I think you are familiar with, we are seeing double-digit growth. On the \u2013 everybody\u2019s electronics business, I think is a little bit different. I think when I just look at the businesses in there, including electronic assembly, contamination control, the pressure-sensitive adhesives, we are still showing really solid double-digit growth. North America up 18%, international up 16%. So, there is still some supply chain issues, but I think the team is doing a great job staying on top of those and gaining share. And so we feel very good about the outlook for the Test & Measurement and Electronics business. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mig Dobre from Baird. Your line is open. Mig Dobre : Yes. Thank you. Good morning everyone. Michael, just wanted to go back to make sure I have this correct. The implied fourth quarter guidance, you said it was going to be down sequentially relative to Q3. Can you be a little more specific as to what the midpoint implies? And then I am kind of curious, as we are thinking about the year-over-year bridge relative to \u201821, I mean last year in the fourth quarter, we had a 200 basis point hit from price/cost. This year, it seems like we are going to be soundly positive. So, I am sort of curious how we bridge that, and then think about the incremental volume and also whatever is going on in terms of your internal initiatives that are flowing through. Michael Larsen : Yes. I don\u2019t know, Mig, that I can tell you something I didn\u2019t say already. I think if you take our full year guidance and the fourth quarter kind of implied, as we said, organic growth of about 10%, solid incrementals in our normal range, maybe a little bit higher than that. Operating margins improved more than 100 basis points on a year-over-year basis. We would expect another 100 basis points from enterprise initiatives. Price/cost goes from negative to slightly positive from a margin standpoint and also positive accretive to income, as I have said. So, those are kind of the high-level view on the fourth quarter. And again, we are not \u2013 we have adjusted our run rates on the top line, which is a little bit different than in prior years. We are just wanting to be a little conservative, hopefully, and account for some of the softness we are seeing in about 20% of the company, but also incorporate a lot of strength in the businesses that we talked about, including Auto, Food Equipment, Test & Measurement, Welding. And so that\u2019s maybe \u2013 those are kind of the key elements of the fourth quarter. Mig Dobre : No, I appreciate that. I ask because I am also not very good at math. And as I am kind of looking at your guidance here, to me, it looks like you have raised your revenue by, call it, $300 million. You have reduced your operating income margin by 50 bps. Net-net, that\u2019s more or less neutral to operating income, yet EPS came down $0.15 on a core basis. So, I am trying to understand if there is something below the line that\u2019s going on here that we don\u2019t have full appreciation for. Michael Larsen : I think I said this earlier, Mig. The reason why we are taking the EPS number down is incremental foreign currency headwind by incorporating current foreign exchange rates like we always do. So, that\u2019s what\u2019s accounting for the EPS adjustment. Mig Dobre : Alright. Well, I will leave it there. Thank you. Operator : And your final question comes from the line of David Raso from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. David Raso : Hi. Thank you. You mentioned earlier your capital spending businesses are not yet seeing a slowdown. I assume we are getting close enough to where you have had some conversations with those customers about their \u201823 planning. Are you getting capital budgets for \u201823 that are also very supportive of solid growth, or is that very much a 90-day type comment, even though you would think capital-intensive businesses must give you better visibility than a quarter at a time? Scott Santi : Yes. Go ahead. I was just going to say, David, we don\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s a little early in the planning cycle for us in terms of \u201823, number one. Number two, I would say, given our sort of traditional delivery and lead times, which are relatively short, we don\u2019t get a lot of forward visibility even in our CapEx businesses. So, regardless of what anybody has to say in terms of their outlook for the year, that\u2019s going to certainly be a number that\u2019s going to move around. In our sort of core operating MO is that we are going to produce what \u2013 based on what orders we are getting today, we are not going to sort of bite on our forecast on how optimistic or pessimistic, and we have the flexibility in our systems to do that. So, I don\u2019t have a lot of forward, we don\u2019t \u2013 coming back to our businesses and our customers, we don\u2019t have a lot of input in terms of strong points of view one way or the other at this point. David Raso : I appreciate that. And I have a quick follow-up on the M&A environment, the divestiture, obviously, a nice gain there. Can you just give us an update on how you are looking at further divestitures and M&A versus obviously bumped up the share repo? Michael Larsen : Yes. So, I think I said there, we have one more potential divestiture that we are working through. And then we have three that are kind of in the pipeline that we are going to spend a little bit more time on next year and determine whether now is the best time to sell those businesses. They are all performing at a high level, significantly better than obviously pre-enterprise strategy. And so it\u2019s just a matter of timing on those divestitures. On the other side of this, we talked about the M&A pipeline on most of these calls. I mean nothing has really changed. I mean I think to the extent we find acquisitions that are a good fit for us strategically, which really means that they can grow at 4% to 5% organically over a sustained period of time, we have significant margin improvement through the implementation of the business model. And we can \u2013 and their valuation is reasonable in the sense that we can generate a rate of return that makes sense for the company, then just like we did with MTS, when those opportunities come along, we are definitely going to lean in. And I think we have called our posture kind of aggressively opportunistic. So, when those come along, we don\u2019t have a lot of those, but when we do see them, we are definitely going to lean in hard just like we did with MTS. And there is nothing in the pipeline here in the near-term is what I can offer. David Raso : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much. Scott Santi : Alright. Thanks, David. End of Q&A: Operator : And thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference call. All lines may disconnect at this time.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the ITW Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Karen Fletcher, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. Karen Fletcher : Thank you, Cheryl. Good morning, and welcome to ITW's Fourth Quarter 2022 Conference Call. I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi; and Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen. During today's call, we will discuss ITW's fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial results and provide guidance for full year 2023.  Slide 2 is a reminder that this presentation contains forward-looking statements. We refer you to the company's 2021 Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. This presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release.  Please turn to Slide 3, and it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi. Scott Santi : Thanks, Karen, and good morning, everyone. As you saw from our release this morning, in Q4, we delivered a strong finish to a year of high-quality execution in the face of some pretty unique challenges in the operating environment. Starting with the top line organic growth, was 12% as all segments delivered positive organic growth, and five of our seven segments grew double digits, led by Auto OEM, up 20%, Food Equipment, up 17%, Welding, up 15%, Polymers & Fluids, up 11% and Test & Measurement and Electronics, up 10%. Construction Products was up 4%, and Specialty Products was up 3%. Operating margin expanded 210 basis points to 24.8%, with 110 basis point contribution from enterprise initiatives and favorable price/cost margin impact of 70 basis points, which was for the first time in nine quarters -- which was favorable for the first time in nine quarters.  Incremental margin was 52%, and operating income grew 18%. GAAP earnings per share increased 53% to a record $2.95, including $0.61 of gains from divestitures and $0.12 of negative currency -- excluding $0.61, sorry, of divestiture gains and $0.12 of negative currency EPS growth was 27%. For all of 2022, the company delivered organic growth of 12% for the second year in a row, best-in-class operating margin of 24.4% in our base business, after-tax return on invested capital of 29.1% and record GAAP EPS of $9.77, an increase of 15% versus the prior year.  There's no question that our decision to stay invested in our enterprise strategy and then our people throughout the pandemic and the quality of our team's execution of our when the recovery focus coming out of it are powering the strong growth and financial performance, ITW is currently delivering. As a result, we are very pleased with our momentum and positioning heading into 2023. Turning to our 2023 guidance. Demand remained solid across the majority of our portfolio, and we are seeing meaningful improvements in supply chain performance and moderating input cost inflation. At the same time, there's no question that the economic outlook, let's call it, remains certainly dynamic. As a result, our organic growth projection for 2023 of 3% to 5% and our EPS guidance of $9.60 at the midpoint reflect current levels of demand and a risk adjustment for further slowing in certain end markets. And Michael will provide more detail on that in just a minute. Before I turn it over to Michael, I want to again thank my ITW colleagues around the world for their extraordinary dedication and commitment to serving our customers and executing our strategy with excellence.  Michael, over to you. Michael Larsen : Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. The demand growth that we've experienced all year continued into the fourth quarter as revenue grew 8% with organic growth of 12%. On an equal day\u2019s basis, organic growth was 14% as the fourth quarter this year had one less shipping day compared to prior year.  We finished the year with strong growth momentum as evidenced by our sequential organic revenue growth of plus 4% from Q3 into Q4 on a sales per day basis as compared to our historical sequential of plus 2%. By geography, every major region grew double digit, with North America up 13%, Europe up 11% and China up 10%. Foreign currency translation headwind reduced revenue by 5%, and the net impact from acquisitions and divestitures was plus 1%. GAAP EPS grew 53% to $2.95 and included a $0.61 gain from two divestitures, which I'll provide more detail on in a moment. Excluding those gains, EPS increased 21% to $2.34, which included $0.12 of EPS headwind from foreign currency translation. So, on an apples-to-apples basis, eliminating both divestiture gains and currency headwind, EPS increased 27%. On the bottom line, operating income grew 18%, with strong incremental margin performance of 52% and operating margin improved 210 basis points to 24.8%. Operating margin in our base businesses, excluding MTS, was 25.2%. In the fourth quarter, we achieved favorable price/cost margin impact of 70 basis points. And as Scott said, this was the first quarter with favorable margin impact from price/cost since the third quarter of 2020.  Enterprise Initiatives contributed 110 basis points. As you saw in the press release, we completed two divestitures in the fourth quarter, resulting in a combined pretax gain on sale of $197 million recorded in nonoperating income and an EPS impact of $0.61. By utilizing capital loss carryforwards to offset taxes on the divestiture gains, the overall tax rate for the company was 19.1%. So overall, for Q4, excellent operational execution across the board, strong financial performance and what remains a pretty uncertain and volatile environment. Okay. Please turn to Slide 4, starting with our progress on organic growth. And as you know, we've been aggressively executing a very focused growth strategy to build consistent above-market organic growth into a core ITW strength on par with our operational 80/20 front-to-back capabilities. As you can see from the data on the left side of the slide, ITW's 12% organic growth rate for each of the last two years compares favorably to our proxy peers at about 9% both years, suggesting that while we're not there yet in terms of realizing ITW's full potential organic growth performance, we're making some very solid progress. Moving on to the segment results, starting with Automotive OEM, which led the way with organic growth of 20%. Year-on-year revenue growth was, of course, helped by supply chain challenges in the industry last year. North America was up 15% and Europe grew 23%. China was up 17% with particularly strong growth in electric vehicles. On a full year basis, ITW Automotive OEM revenues were up 12% versus 6% growth in car builds. Looking forward, we expect Automotive OEM to grow 5% to 7% in 2023 based on a risk-adjusted auto build assumption in the low single digits plus our typical penetration gains of 2% to 3%. Turning to Slide 5. Food Equipment delivered another very strong quarter with organic growth of 17%. North America grew 25% with double-digit growth in all major categories and end markets. Institutional was up more than 40% with strength across the board, restaurants were up 30% and retail grew 20%. International revenue grew 7%, with Europe up 9% and Asia Pacific was flat with some near-term softness in China.  The Food Equipment team also delivered excellent progress on margins, with Q4 operating margin of 27.6%, an increase of almost 500 basis points year-over-year. So obviously, strong momentum in this segment, and we expect Food Equipment to grow 8% to 10% in 2023. Test & Measurement and Electronics revenue grew 15%, with organic growth of 10%. Test & Measurement grew 12% organic, excluding the acquisition of MTS, with continued strong demand for capital equipment as evidenced by Instron, which grew 24%. Electronics was up 7%.  While our semi-related businesses, which represent combined annual revenues of about $550 million or approximately 20% of the segment, grew 17% in the quarter. We are beginning to see a slowdown in demand after three years of very strong growth. So, embedded in our 2023 organic growth projection of 2% to 4% for this segment is anticipated further slowing in semi-related end markets. Moving on to Slide 6. Welding delivered strong organic growth of 15% in Q4, with equipment up 17% and consumables up 13%. Industrial sales remained very strong with organic growth of 25%. On the commercial side, which is more consumer-oriented, demand continued to slow and organic growth was down 1%. On a geographic basis, North America grew 15%, and international grew 17%, driven by strength in the oil and gas business, up 19%. Operating margin was up 160 basis points to 31.6%, a new record for the segment and for the company. Looking forward, we expect revenue to grow 5% to 7% in 2023, which includes some anticipated further slowing on the commercial Welding side. Polymers & Fluids delivered organic growth of 11%, with the automotive aftermarket business up 13% with some seasonal strength in wiper blades. Polymers grew 11% with continued strength in industrial applications, and Fluids was up 5%. North America grew 11% and international was up 10%. Looking forward, we expect Polymers & Fluids to grow 3% to 5% in 2023, which is based on current levels of demand and anticipated further slowing in the more consumer-oriented automotive aftermarket business. Turning to Slide 7. Overall demand in Construction slowed to an organic growth rate of plus 4%. North America was still up 9%, with residential up 11% and commercial construction was down 6% due to a tough comparison of plus 21% last year. Europe was up 3% and Australia and New Zealand was down 4%. As you know, Construction is our most interest rate sensitive segment, and we are projecting further slowing in 2023 and a negative organic growth rate of minus 5% to minus 3%. Specialty organic growth was 3% as supply chain shortages eased up in Q4, and the equipment businesses had a strong finish to the year with organic growth of 8%. Consumables were up 2%. And on a geographic basis, North America grew 1% and international grew 7%. Looking forward, we expect Specialty organic revenue of negative 1% to plus 1% in 2023, which is based on current levels of demand and anticipated further slowing in the appliance components business. So, let's turn to Slide 8 for a recap of a very strong 2022. As throughout the year, our teams around the world did an exceptional job of delivering for our customers, while responding quickly and decisively to rapidly rising input costs, navigating supply chain disruptions and aggressively executing our Win the Recovery strategy.  As a result, for the full year, ITW grew organic revenue by 12% with double-digit growth in five of seven segments. And despite significant price/cost margin pressures and thanks in part to 90 basis points contribution from our enterprise initiatives, our base businesses expanded operating margin by 30 basis points to 24.4%. GAAP EPS of $9.77 was a record for ITW with EPS growth of 15% on top of 28% EPS growth in 2021. Excluding divestiture gains and negative currency translation impact, EPS grew 12% in 2022 on an apples-to-apples basis. In 2022, we also invested more than $700 million to accelerate organic growth and to sustain productivity in our highly profitable core businesses. Raised our dividend 7%, marking the 59th year of consecutive increases. Returned $3.3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases and made solid progress on the integration of a very high-quality acquisition in the MTS Test and Simulation business. And most importantly, we delivered these results while continuing to make meaningful progress on our path to ITW's full potential through the execution of our long-term enterprise strategy. So, let's move to Slide 9 for an update on our full year 2023 guidance. And while we certainly see some positives in terms of supply chain easing and moderating input cost inflation, there's also no doubt that the economic outlook and demand picture is becoming increasingly uncertain. On our last Q3 earnings call, we pointed to pockets of slowing demand at approximately 20% of our business portfolio. And today, we would add semiconductor-related end markets to the mix bringing the total to about 25% of ITW's portfolio.  In our view, it therefore made sense to take a more cautious approach to our top line guidance this year by basing it not just on current levels of demand, adjusted for seasonality as we typically do, but rather anticipating further slowing in end markets related to construction, commercial welding, auto aftermarket, appliances and semiconductor. As a result, our organic growth rate projection for 2023 of 3% to 5% is lower than our typical run rate approach. Operating margin is expected to improve by 100 basis points or more to a range of 24.5% to 25.5%. This includes approximately 100 basis points contribution from enterprise initiatives and positive price/cost margin impact based on all known and implemented price and cost actions. After tax return on invested capital should improve to 30% plus, and we expect strong free cash flow with conversion greater than net income. For 2023, we expect GAAP EPS in the range of $9.40 to $9.80, which also includes $0.15 to $0.20 of higher interest expense on our short-term debt and $0.25 of increased income tax expense as our tax rate will revert to our normal, approximately 24% versus 22% in 2022, excluding the tax impacts from our divestitures. In terms of cadence for the year, we're now back to our typical first half, second half EPS split of 49% and 51%.  Our capital allocation plans for 2023 are consistent with our long-standing disciplined capital allocation framework. Our top priority remains internal investments to support our organic growth initiatives and sustain our highly profitable core businesses. The second priority is an attractive dividend that grows in line with earnings over time, which remains a critical component of ITW's total shareholder return model. Third, selective high-quality acquisitions, such as MTS, that enhance ITW's long-term profitable growth potential and have significant margin improvement potential from the implication of our proprietary 80/20 front-to-back methodology and can generate acceptable risk-adjusted returns on our shareholders' capital. And finally, surplus capital will be allocated to an active share repurchase program, and we expect to buy back approximately $1.5 billion of our own shares in 2023.  Turning to our last slide, Slide 10, for our 2023 organic growth projections by segment. And you can see that we're expecting solid to mid -- solid mid- to high single-digit organic growth in four of our seven segments, offsetting some lower growth rates in Test & Measurement and Electronics, which is due to semiconductor demand, as well as in Construction and Specialty resulting in an overall organic growth rate at the enterprise level of 3% to 5%, which is on top of 12% organic growth in each of the last two years. Overall, we're heading into 2023 with strong momentum, and we're very well positioned to continue to outperform in whatever economic conditions emerge as we move through 2023.  And so, with that, Karen, I'll turn it back to you. Karen Fletcher : Okay. Thank you, Michael. Cheryl, please open up the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Jamie Cook : Hi, good morning. Congrats on a nice quarter. I guess, my first question, you talked about the 25% of your portfolio where you're starting to see weakness. Can you talk -- I know semis be incremental. Can you just give a little more color on what you're seeing in semi? And then on the 75% rest of your portfolio are trends in line with your expectations, a little more positive or negative versus last quarter? And then I guess, just my follow-up question to that price/cost in the quarter, I think it was 70 bps positive. I think that's a little better than what you expected. Was that driven more by price or raw going down? And then what are your assumptions on the ability to hold price in 2023? Thank you. Michael Larsen : Okay. That was a lot there, Jamie. I'll do my best, okay? So, I think the color on semi is really the -- we're coming off a three year very strong growth cycle with growth in the high teens or better than that over those three years. And we are starting to see a slowdown in the order intake really in Q4.  So, it hasn't really showed up in our numbers in a meaningful way yet, but we do expect that to continue into 2023. We think it's more of a near-term slowdown. And like you said, that is the addition to the portfolio we've said before, 20% is slowing. Demand is slowing now. It's 25%, and semi is really the incremental 5% this quarter. But it's important to keep in mind that the balance, the other 75% of the portfolio, continues to perform at a really high level. And I'll just point to the 12% organic we put up in Q4 and for the full year. And then if you look at our guidance on Slide 10, by segment, you can see mid- to high single-digit growth in Automotive OEM, Food Equipment, Welding, mid-single digit in Polymers & Fluids and then a little bit lower in Test & Measurement. And then of course, Construction is the one that's a little bit projected to be down year-over-year and Specialty about flat. I'll also say, if you just look at from Q3 to Q4, we -- typically, our sales per day go up 2%, we actually went up 4%. So, we're more than offsetting some of the slowing that we're seeing in 25% of the portfolio. So good momentum, really well positioned going into next year. I think on the price/cost side, we were really encouraged. We talked about this on the last call and an expectation of being positive -- slightly positive on margins on price/cost in Q4. This was a little bit better, driven by both sides of the equation really price and cost, but it was certainly great to see that turn positive for the first time since I think I said the third quarter 2020. So, first time in eight quarters, so really encouraging heading into 2023. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Melius Research. Your line is open. Scott Davis : Hey, good morning. Congrats on another strong year in '22. Scott Santi : Thank you. Michael Larsen : Thank you. Scott Davis : A little bit of a nit, but on the 3% to 5%, 23 top line for growth forecast. Is there any real price in that? Or you anniversary the big price increases that you had in Welding and now you're kind of more in the kind of neutral-ish to maybe slightly positive versus a bigger number? Michael Larsen : Well, I think we are certainly lapping some bigger price numbers. There's no doubt about that. And I think, as you know, we don't break out price and volume separately for all the reasons we've talked about in the past. But there's both price and volume in the numbers that we've laid out for 2023. And the 3% to 5% organic, I'll just say it's a risk-adjusted number. If you do a pure run rate, you end up at a higher number. We just thought given the -- everything we talked about, it was probably reasonable to take a more cautious approach given the environment. Scott Davis : Yes. No, it totally makes sense. What about the inflation assumptions in general when you guys think about the '23 outlook as far as kind of breaking out materials versus labor? And is it fair to assume that labor inflation remains reasonably high, but material inflation is more moderated? Is that a fair assumption in your guide? Michael Larsen : Yes. I think that's reasonable. I think certainly materials and components in that order, we are seeing -- I wouldn't say price are coming -- costs are coming down in a significant way, and they're remaining at a fairly elevated level. And then I think on -- our labor costs, certainly we're experiencing the same labor cost inflation as others. But -- and so maybe a little bit higher than typical, but nothing really that significant. We're still expanding margins by 100 basis points or better here in 2023. So hopefully, that answers your question. Scott Davis : Yes, it does. Thank you. And best of luck this year. Michael Larsen : Sure. Thank you, Scott. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tami Zakaria of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tami Zakaria : Good morning. Congrats on the great results. So I have a couple of quick ones. The first one is how should we think about your EBIT margin progression throughout the year? Is the 25.5% to -- 24.5% to 25.5% range going to be fairly consistent in all the quarters? Michael Larsen : So Tami, like I said, we're kind of back to our typical cadence here. I think we said first half, 49% of our EPS for the full year; second half, 51%. We really -- if you go back unlike time, we've been remarkably consistent. Embedded in that is also the fact that Q1 is typically our lowest quarter in terms of revenue, and we're expecting somewhere in the mid-single-digit type growth. Margins will probably start out a little bit lower, but still 100 basis points of margin improvement on a year-over-year basis. And maybe just to give an additional data point, if you run the same data on Q1 contribution to EPS overall, it's somewhere around 23% of the full year, and that's a pretty -- the company has become remarkably predictable over the years. And so I think that's probably a pretty good estimate for how the first quarter might play out. Tami Zakaria : Got it. That's fantastic color. Thank you. And I'm just going to ask the question and I hope I get lucky and get a number. But can you share what organic growth is trending quarter-to-date? Any segments trending negative right now? Michael Larsen : So we just saw the January numbers and everything looks fine. Everything is tracking and really nothing different from what we talked about in the script here. So we're off to the start that we thought we would have. Tami Zakaria : Okay, awesome. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz of Citigroup. Your line is open. Andy Kaplowitz : Good morning, everyone. Michael, when we think about margin expectations for '23 across your segments, does the lag in price versus cost flipped the most in Auto OEMs, so you could see a nice jump in margin in that segment? Or should we generally think that your segment margin will trend with who has the highest growth forecast versus the weakest growth forecast in '23? Michael Larsen : I think, Andy, we expect -- all of our planning here at ITW has done bottoms up, as I think you know. And every one of our segments, including the higher-margin ones, such as Welding as well as Automotive, which is really dealing with some near-term pressures primarily related to price cost as well as just volume leverage. Every one of our 7 segments told us that they expect to improve margins year-over-year in 2023. But obviously, the ones that have the higher growth rates are going to have more volume leverage and therefore, probably a more significant improvement in operating margin. But everybody will get better. I would just say on Automotive, it's going to take some time to recover the price/cost margin impact, which has been significantly higher in Automotive than in other segments for all the reasons we've talked about in the past. It takes a little bit longer to recover price.  So I think our current view is it will take us maybe two to three years to get back to automotive margins in the low to mid-20s. And so that's maybe how I would -- we would characterize it. Andy Kaplowitz : Very helpful, Michael. And then can you give us an update on the longevity of enterprise initiatives? ITW continues to I think we might begin to get a little spoiled here that it could last indefinitely. So how are you thinking about enterprise strategy? Do you still see a long runway of initiatives across your segments? And where will the focus of enterprise strategy be across your segments in '23? Michael Larsen : Well... Scott Santi : Yes, go ahead, you start. Michael Larsen : Okay. Well, I think we're in the tenth year now. I think if you add up the combined savings, it's approaching $1.5 billion of structural cost out from 80/20 and from strategic sourcing. And when we rolled up the plans here in November and check back in, in January and had a chance to review all the projects and activities that go into delivering these 100 basis points, we were really encouraged by what we saw. And so I know that for a couple of years, we've been saying -- I've been saying this is not going to go on forever, and I... Scott Santi : We were wrong. Michael Larsen : And I was wrong, which happens a lot. But I think, ultimately, look, I think if you model ITW long term, I'd go back to the TSR model we've given you, which is 4% plus organic growth, incremental margins in that 35% to 40% range. Then operating income grew $7 million. You add acquisitions and buybacks on top of that. And so EPS grows 9% to 10%, and you add an attractive dividend in that 2% to 3% range. 2% to 3% range on top of it, you get 11% to 13% over the long term, that's what you should expect us to deliver. And so I think I have to say, to give you a definite and on enterprise initiatives because, as Scott reminded me, I've been wrong for many years. But that's probably how I would think about it, Andy. Scott Santi : I would just add in terms of perspective that I think one of the real strengths of our operating methodology and our business model is it's there's no one definition of perfection. There is always room to get better. We use the business model as the core tool that our 84 divisions used to identify and prioritize opportunities to get better. And I don't see that stopping for quite a while. Michael Larsen : Right. I think we've said this before. I mean, this proprietary ITW business model is more powerful than it's ever been as we sit here today. It's much different from 10 years ago, 3 years ago. And we are applying it. Our people, we've all gotten better at applying these methodologies, and we're applying it to a much more differentiated portfolio. And so as long as we continue down that path, I think it is -- I agree with Scott. I don't think it's going to end any time soon. So that's probably how we've set it up. Andy Kaplowitz : Appreciate all the color, guys. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : You have Sabrina Abrams [ph] on for Andrew Obin. So first on the margin guide, the 70 bps to 170 bps of year-over-year expansion includes the 100 bps of enterprise initiatives. And then, I guess, the remainder is 20 bps of price/cost at the midpoint. I'm just trying to think, is this a conservative approach? Should you had 70 bps of benefit in 4Q? Is there potential upside here? Michael Larsen : Well, I think maybe what would be helpful, Sabrina, is just -- let me just give you some of the elements here that go into the margin improvement on a year-over-year basis. And I'm going to use round numbers here, okay? So if we just ended 2022 at operating margins of about 24%, you should expect volume leverage somewhere in the 50 to 100 basis points of positive contribution to margins year-over-year, the enterprise initiatives, which is sized at about 100. We're certainly going to make some good progress on price/cost as 70 basis points was encouraging in Q4. I think the -- if that's the run rate going into 2023, maybe a little bit better than that. Let's just say price/cost adds approximately 100 basis points based on what we know today. And then the offset to some of this is our typical kind of -- we talked about this a little bit, wages and inflation on wages. We are bringing in some new hires to support our organic growth efforts. We are investing in driving organic growth, including capacity. And so that's typically a headwind of less than 100 basis points. That's running a little bit higher, just given the underlying inflation that's in the system that's probably running at 150 to 200. And so you add all that up, you get 100 basis points plus of margin improvement on a year-over-year basis. And I think that's a pretty good number, Sabrina. Unidentified Company Speaker : Got it. That's helpful. And so China, I guess, was strong in Auto OEM in 4Q. Just trying to think what's incorporated in your guide for China reopening next year? Michael Larsen : Well, I think, as we look at kind of on a geographic basis, including China, most of our regions are kind of in that mid-single digits for the year. And China is maybe a little bit higher than that. A big driver, as you pointed out, in China is really the Automotive business, where we continue to make a lot of progress in terms of market share and penetration gains. So that's certainly our largest business and also the biggest driver of our growth in China next year. And so if the total company is 3% to 5% organic, China is certainly a little bit higher than that in our current projections as we sit here today. So... Unidentified Company Speaker : Great. Thank you so much. I\u2019ll pass it on. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Please go ahead, your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Solid results. Just back to enterprise, I've often kind of thought of it maybe incorrectly as reflecting a little bit of a trade-off between margin and growth. And maybe originally, it was more cost oriented, but the organic growth here recently would suggest you're not trading growth for margin. And I wonder if you could just kind of comment on that. Obviously, the growth has enjoyed a cyclical lift the last couple of years. So I don't want to overstate the point, but it does seem that the system has thrown up at organic growth than it had historically? And just any context on that, I think, would be interesting. Scott Santi : Yes. First of all, Jeff, thank you for noticing. The -- what I would say in terms of just the arc of the last decade, we've been on this is that clearly, for the first five to seven years, we had a lot more work to do inside the businesses to get ourselves in position to grow. And what we're delivering now is much more about businesses that are from an operational standpoint, a lot closer to 80% or 90% of their potential. And so a lot of -- which allows a lot of our effort and attention and just to be reallocated to commercial opportunities to grow. And that's ultimately what is showing up now. We have a lot more sort of energy collectively being devoted to growth opportunities because we've gotten the internal -- the operational position of these businesses firing in sort of in a really strong position. And so it's -- you can't be great at everything all at once. It's part of, I think, what we would reflect that over the last decade and one of the real secrets to the outcomes we've delivered in my view is that we've been focused on the right things at the right time and have not tried to do too much at any stage. But we're clearly now at a stage where organic growth is the 80 of what we've got opportunities to do and what we've got to deliver on going forward. And I think that's reflected in the numbers that we're currently throwing off. Jeff Sprague : And would -- Michael gave that piece of the bridge, wage and growth investment. Is that number other than kind of the inflationary pressures that you mentioned? Is that structurally moving higher? Or can that sort of be funded within the normal incremental margin construct and other levers that you're attempted for? Scott Santi : That's exactly the way we do it. We are self-funding our growth investments through our incremental margin contribution. So at the 35 historical and targeted run rate, that is -- that includes -- that's after those incremental investments in growth. We're investing in capacity now in a really significant way in headcount in the areas that help us grow and supporting innovation. And we're still going to deliver of 100 bps of margin improvement next year. So that just illustrates the point of these businesses are so profitable that every incremental dollar of revenue that we generate organically drives a lot of incremental cash flow and certainly to support that we're going to invest some of that, but it doesn't impair our belief that we're in a good chunk of it to the bottom line. Jeff Sprague : Great. Thanks for that context. Operator : Your next question is from Stephen Volkmann of Jefferies. Your line is open. Stephen Volkmann : Good morning, guys. Most of my questions have been answered. A couple of quick follow-ups. Is there a portion of your portfolio where you would expect to give back price once the sort of lower energy and transportation and raw material costs kind of work their way through? Michael Larsen : We have a very small portion of our overall portfolio where the pricing is indexed to raw materials. If you add it all up, it's somewhere around 5% of our total revenue, so really an immaterial number, where it's an automatic giveback on price. I think on everything else, we historically command a premium given our -- the differentiated nature of our products and services and the quality of our delivery, and we expect to maintain that premium as we compete and focus on gaining market share. So that's how I'd answer your question, Steve. Stephen Volkmann : Great. I appreciate it. Pretty minimal then. And then just sort of maybe the obligatory question on capital deployment relative to your thinking on any sort of further divestiture opportunities or M&A pipeline, anything to kind of call out there? Michael Larsen : Yes. So I think you saw the two divestitures here in the fourth quarter. That's part of -- I think we called out a handful of business units about a year ago. So the first two are done. We've got a smaller 1 that's kind of in the works. And then we've got a more meaningful one that is performing at a really high level right now. And I think we're going to kind of assess the capital markets and conditions and whether it's the right time to launch sometime this summer and that would kind of round out what we talked about a year ago. So that's kind of where we're at. Stephen Volkmann : Great. And M&A pipeline, sorry. Michael Larsen : Well, yes, I mean, we get this question every time, we answer it the same way. I mean, I think organic growth is priority number one for all the reasons that Scott just talked about. I think -- we'd certainly be interested in high-quality acquisitions that accelerate the long-term growth potential of the company, where we can improve margins through the implementation of the business model and we can earn a reasonable rate of return on our shareholders' capital. And so MTS is a good example of an acquisition that checks all the boxes. That was a pretty big one that we did a year ago. And to the extent that other opportunities like that present themselves that check the boxes, we're definitely going to lean in, in a big way. So that's -- but... Scott Santi : Yes, maybe just a little color on top of that, that's more sort of topical near term. What I would say generally is that we are not looking to acquire broken businesses, we're looking to acquire good businesses and help them be great businesses. And in environments where the sort of economic -- the macro is uncertain, those good businesses, it's really not a good time to sell. So if anything, I'd say the environment until the macro trajectory gets a little bit more clear, I would expect that the opportunities might be a little less than normal this year, at least through the first half, but we'll see. Stephen Volkmann : Appreciate the color. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Donner of BMO Capital Markets. Dan Donner : Excellent. Thank you. So the Food Equipment business, as you have highlighted, has definitely been a standout for you. And after attending the NAFEM Equipment Show yesterday, there's a noticeable difference in how the business seems to be presenting itself more cohesively than before. So will you comment on this aspect and also on some of the things that you're doing there with regard to consolidating sales reps and allocating more investments toward maybe the cooking side, specifically products like combi ovens and priors, which are certainly areas that have well-known large competitors? Michael Larsen : Well, I'll take a stab. I think we're not really doing anything different than we have over the last five years in the Food Equipment business. We've continued to invest in differentiated products, including the categories that you mentioned. And we've been putting up -- the team has been putting up some really great numbers as a result of executing on their strategy. And so if you add up the organic growth rate here, over 17% coming out of the pandemic 23% last year, this year, high single digit, double digit, and that's really as a result of us innovating and growing all product categories. Scott Santi : And I add to that near term, our supply capabilities winning these businesses. Michael Larsen : Yes, definitely, I think this has been an area where kind of back to our win the Recovery positioning and the decision to carry enough inventory to service our customers with the same level of excellence in difficult supply chain on the different supply chain conditions has paid off in a big way. And so I think if you get the sense that the Food Equipment team is in a good mood. I think that's because they're gaining share and putting up some really strong numbers, including on the margin side, if you look at that almost 400 -- almost 500 basis points of improvement on a year-over-year basis. So that business, like we said, has got a ton of momentum going into 2023, and we're very bullish on the future here. Dan Donner : Okay. Thank you. Yes, they were definitely in a good mood. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Joe O'Dea : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to start the Slide 4, where you show the 300 bps of outgrowth versus the proxy group over the last couple of years. Can you talk to attribution of that? And I think, obviously, a pricing environment where you've seen different trends across different companies, I'm not sure the degree to which maybe pricing is outpacing. But the degree to which it's volume is primarily share gain and just your confidence in the stickiness of those share gains as supply chain corrects? Scott Santi : Yes. I guess I'll -- my response would be that there's no way that we can break this apart into various pieces. What I can say is that the proof is in the pudding. Ultimately, it's in the performance and our ability to consistently outperform. We're not claiming victory here. We're not -- we've got a lot of room to go across the company in terms of our ability to consistently deliver the kind of organic growth that we're capable of. But what we are saying is that we put a couple of years on the board, where we are growing our peers in the aggregate. Now what percent of that is our market exposures versus theirs or different approaches to pricing or supply capability? I'd say all of the above. In the end, it doesn't matter as long as we're able to consistently outgrow our peers and outgrow our markets and that's really the goal. Joe O'Dea : And I guess related to that, as you're seeing maybe supply chain ease, and I don't know if competitors are in the market in a little bit more competitive way. But any challenges now that you didn't see maybe 6 or 12 months ago? Michael Larsen : Yes, I think, Joe, from the beginning, the Win the Recovery positioning was all about strategic share gains focused primarily on our existing customers. And we were not interested in opportunistic onetime orders. And so we're pretty confident with that direction. These share gains are going to stick. I think the pandemic and the supply chain kind of disruptions were a great opportunity for ITW to demonstrate how differentiated our supply chain capabilities are for those customers that didn't know. And so I think that's been really -- that's what's contributing also to the outgrowth relative to peers. I mean that's one more element of the equation as you talked about with Scott. Joe O'Dea : And then I just wanted to clarify on the average daily sales plus 2% versus seasonal -- or plus 4% versus seasonal plus 2, the degree to which that's underlying demand accelerating versus maybe backlog burn. I think it's hard to parse given broadly inflated backlogs out there what underlying demand trends look like. But any comments on what you're seeing sort of underlying accelerate versus decel? Michael Larsen : Well, I think we're not a backlog-driven company. As you know, we don't carry a lot of backlog. And as you also say, it's hard to parse out what was backlog versus new orders. So I'm not sure I can give you a great answer. What I can tell you is that, typically, our sales per day go up by 2%. If you go back and look in time, and they went up by 4%. And so things are definitely not slowing. And we've got some great momentum going into Q1 and 2023. Joe O'Dea: Great. I appreciate the color. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Good morning and thanks for squeezing me in. Maybe I just wanted to circle back to the organic sales growth guide and totally understand you don't take an elaborate macro gyration within that, and that's a very sensible approach. But you've got the 4% growth guide for the year as a whole organically at the midpoint. You just did low double digit the most recent quarter. So just want to understand how we think about that sort of step down. Is it a steady deceleration as we go through the year? Anything in particular we should bear in mind on one or two-year stacks? Any color at all really that you could give on and how we think about the plus four moving through 2023? Michael Larsen : It's all in the comparisons year-over-year, Julian. So like I said, we expect the year to play out from a revenue standpoint, in line with our typical cadence. And so Q1 starts out a little bit lower and then we kind of improve from there. But there's nothing baked in, in terms of a big acceleration in the back half or deceleration in the back half. We've kind of done our best here to model current levels of demand risk adjusted for the areas where we're seeing some slowing in demand and we come up with 3% to 5%. I think if you run the math, you'll see kind of the first half is the growth rates are maybe towards the higher end of that 3% to 5% and the second half is towards the lower end, and that's all driven by the comps on a year-over-year basis. Julian Mitchell : That's very clear. Thank you. And then within Construction products, I don't think we built with that one yet. Apologies if you have to repeat anything. But that's sort of down for guide for the year. There's a bit of price in there, some maybe volumes are down high single digit or something. But maybe just help us understand what's embedded within that? I think simplistically, you have 1/3 is resi new build, 1/3 is resi replacement, 1/3 is commercial. Those three big pieces, how are you sort of thinking about those this year? Michael Larsen : I mean the big driver, Julian, is the housing market, new housing. And so the residential side is about 80% of our business here in North America, and that's where we're seeing some slowing, which we've talked about since the summer, I think. So there's nothing new here. And that's the big driver here. Scott Santi : The commercial side is hanging in there. As I said, it was also our strongest business in the summer after the pandemic. Michael Larsen : Right. I mean... Scott Santi : Part of the advantage of the different end market exposures that we have. And we can -- we're always going to have some in the tailwind mode and some in the headwind mode, but the net mix of it all is pretty positive. So... Michael Larsen : Yes. It's going to be down a little this year, but it's also been a business that's really performed well for us when other parts of the macro have been challenged. So... Julian Mitchell : That makes sense. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for participating in today's conference call. All lines may disconnect at this time.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the ITW First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Karen Fletcher, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. Karen Fletcher : Okay, thank you, Rob. Good morning, and welcome to ITW's first quarter 2023 Conference Call. I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi; and Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen. During today's call, we will discuss ITW's first quarter financial results and provide an update on our outlook for the full year 2023. Slide 2 is a reminder that this presentation contains forward-looking statements. We refer you to the company's 2022 Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. This presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release. Please turn to Slide 3, and it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi. Scott Santi : Thank you, Karen. And good morning everyone. As you saw from our earnings release this morning, we delivered a solid start to the year, with results coming in largely in line with our expectations heading into the quarter.  Starting with the top line, organic growth was 5% with four of seven segments delivering positive organic growth, led by Food equipment up 16%, Welding up 10%, Automotive OEM up 8% and Test & Measurement and Electronics up 6%. Polymers & Fluids was flat, Construction was down 1% and Specialty was down 5%. Operating margin expanded 150 basis points to 24.2% with 100 basis point contribution from enterprise initiatives. GAAP earnings per share increased 10% to $2.33, which was a new Q1 record for the company. Our free cash flow conversion rate was 86% of net income which was in line to modestly above normal Q1 levels.  Looking ahead at the balance of the year. While there is of course some uncertainty with regard to the macro environment, I have no doubt that my ITW colleagues around the world will continue to read react and execute at a high level to whatever comes our way. I will now turn the call over to Michael to discuss our Q1 performance in more detail and our updated full year guidance, Michael? Michael Larsen : Thank you Scott. And good morning everyone. ITW delivered another solid quarter operationally and financially, starting with organic growth of more than 5%. Foreign currency translation headwind and divestitures reduced revenue by 2%, and 1%, respectively.  On the bottom line, our operating income grew 9% with incremental margins of 98%. Operating margin improved 150 basis points to 24.2% with enterprise initiatives and price costs contributing 100 basis points, and 190 basis points respectively.  In addition to higher wages and benefit costs year-over-year, were funding our growth investments including headcount in the areas that support our organic growth strategies and initiatives. And we still delivered 150 basis points of margin improvement in the quarter.  GAAP EPS grew 10% to $2.33, which included foreign currency translation a headwind of $0.06, and our Q1 tax rate was 22.6%. And as Scott said, it was encouraging to see our free cash flow performance return to normal levels. Overall for Q1, excellent operational execution across the Board and strong financial performance including record EPS. Please turn to Slide four, starting with positive organic growth in all of our major geographies. Including North America, which represents about 55% of total revenues, and grew 5%, and Europe is up 6%. Asia Pacific grew 2%, despite a 6% decline in China due to COVID related headwinds in Q1.  Moving on to segment results, starting with Automotive OEM and solid organic growth of 8%. North America was up 3% and Europe grew 16%. China was down 5% due to COVID related headwinds in Q1. And we're seeing the expected bounce back here at Q2.  In terms of automotive OEM margins, we are beginning to recover the price cost margin impact that has diluted margins in this segment by about 450 basis points over the last two years. As a result, we expect price cost margin impact to turn positive starting in Q2, which, combined with positive volume leverage and contributions from enterprise initiatives, will lead to higher margins sequentially and year-over-year starting in Q2 and for the balance of the year. Turning to Slide 5. Food Equipment delivered another strong quarter with organic growth of 16% as North America led the way with organic growth of 21%. Institutional end markets were up more than 50% with particular strength in education and lodging. In addition, restaurants were up more than 30%. International revenue grew 9%, with Europe up 11% and Asia Pacific was down 6% due to China. Strong progress on margins with Q1 operating margin of 26.7%, an increase of more than 400 basis points year-over-year. Test & Measurement and Electronics delivered organic growth of 6% despite a double-digit slowdown in semiconductor-related revenues, which represent about 20% of segment revenue. On the other hand, demand for our capital equipment remains strong as evidenced by Instron, for example, which was up 22%. Overall, Test & Measurement grew 12% organically and electronics was down 4%. Moving on to Slide 6. Welding delivered double-digit organic growth of 10% in Q1 on top of 13% in Q1 last year as equipment grew 10% and consumables were up 11%. Industrial sales remained strong with organic growth of 17%, while the commercial side was down 2%. North America grew 10%, and international grew 12%, driven by strength in the oil and gas business, which was up 15%. Operating margin expanded 110 basis points to 31.9% a new record for the segment and the company. Organic growth in Polymers and Fluids was about flat against a difficult comparison of plus 13% last year. Automotive aftermarket was down 1%, Polymers grew 1% and Fluids was also up 1%. On a geographic basis, North America grew 1% and international declined 2%. Turn to Slide 7. Organic revenue and construction was down 1% against a tough comparison of plus 21% last year. Residential construction was down 1% and commercial construction, which represents a little less than 20% of the business in North America was up 5%. Europe was down 9%, and Australia, New Zealand was up 3%. Finally, Specialty organic revenue was down 5%, which included 3 percentage points of headwind from product line simplification. On a geographic basis, North America was down 4% and international was down 6%.  Okay, let's move to Slide eight, for an update on our full year 2023 guidance. As you saw this morning, we raised GAAP EPS guidance by $0.05 to a new range of $9.45 to $9.85, which considers the lower projected tax rate for the full year in the range of 23.5% to 24%. Given the level of macroeconomic uncertainty going forward, we're essentially holding our operational guidance and adjusting EPS to reflect the lower projected tax rate. Our organic growth projection of 3% to 5% reflects current levels of demand with some risk adjustment for further slowing in certain end markets. Combined, foreign currency translation impact at current rates and divestitures are projected to reduce revenue by 1%.  Operating margin is projected to expand by more than 100 basis points at the midpoint of our range, which includes approximately 100 basis points from Enterprise Initiatives and positive price/cost margin impact. Like I said, we're off to a solid start to the year with some positive momentum heading into Q2, and we remain well positioned to continue to outperform in whatever economic conditions emerge through the balance of 2023. With that, Karen, I'll turn it back to you. Karen Fletcher : Okay. Thank you, Michael. Rob, let's open up the line for questions, please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Your line is open. Andrew Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning, everyone. Michael, can you give us a little more color on to how you're thinking about the company's margins for the year? I know you didn't change your forecast, but as you said, was up 150 basis points in Q1. I think you guided us to 100 basis points, and you said price versus cost in Q1, I think you said it was 190 points. I know you're thinking about 100 basis points for the year. So are you thinking that should be materially higher now especially given your comps return in automotive so what held you back from not increasing your margin forecast for the year? Michael Larsen : Well, I think Q1, Andy came in right along with our plan, really across the entire income statement and also on free cash flow. So Q1 margins expanded 150 basis points. That's typically the low point for the year. And so if you go back and look historically, you'd expect margins to improve from here in Q2 again in Q3 and Q4. And based on our current planning, we expect about 100 basis points of margin improvement year-over-year in each one of the remaining quarters. And actually, across our segments, we're seeing similar trends in terms of margins improving from here. We are -- if you look at kind of the bridge and we talk about this last quarter, as well we're certainly seeing some positive operating leverage from our organic growth this year. We're seeing at about 100 basis points of contribution from enterprise initiatives that's well within our own control based on projects and activities that are going on inside the company. We are starting to see price cost margin impact being positive. That really started in Q4. And as you said, another step forward here in Q1, we expect that to remain positive for the remainder of the year. As you know, we've diluted margins about 250 basis points at the enterprise level over the last two years and maybe we'll recover about half of that this year, so maybe a little bit more than 100 basis points from price cost. And then the delta is what we talked about in terms of the investments that we're making to support our organic growth and including in our people. And so we are certainly seeing some increases there in terms of wages and benefit increases that everybody else is seeing. So that's kind of the margin picture for the year-end. I hope that answers your question. Andrew Kaplowitz : Yes, Michael, that's helpful. And then last quarter, you said that 25% of your ITW businesses were slowing. Is that still the case? And those businesses end up slowing at the run rate you projected a maybe better or worse than you projected. And then Q1 is a bit higher than you predicted in terms of seasonality. Are you still thinking sort of that 49%, 51% in terms of EPS breakdown for the year? Michael Larsen : Yes. I think we're -- if you look at the -- what we talked about last quarter was about 25% of the company's revenues slowing down. And so just to maybe remind everybody, we're talking about residential construction. We're talking about commercial welding and the automotive aftermarket being down here in Q1 and kind of into in the low single digits. Our appliance components business and Specialty Products being down in the high single digits. And then semiconductor, we talked about orders coming down. We're now seeing that translate into revenues coming down in that 10% to 15% range, primarily in the Test & Measurement segment. So Q1 was actually in line with plan in terms of what we expected. We do expect some further slowing primarily in these -- this handful of businesses that I mentioned. And what I would just say... Scott Santi : And that's not new. That's in our plan. Michael Larsen : Yes, that was in our plan, and that's included in our guidance and our plan for the rest of the year. I would just say there's a lot of strength in other parts of the company, obviously. The vast majority of our businesses are still seeing solid demand. We're always going to have some headwind and tailwind and it kind of all nets out to some pretty solid performance, as you saw in Q1, and we'd expect the same for the remainder of the year. I'll just say this, I mean, the environment, obviously, this is pretty uncertain at this point, things can change pretty quickly. But based on what we know today, we remain really well positioned to deliver solid performance here in Q2 and for the balance of the year. Andrew Kaplowitz : Michael, are you still thinking that 49-51 split? Michael Larsen : Yes. From a planning standpoint, I think that's still a good assumption and in line with really what we have done historically. Andrew Kaplowitz : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tami Zakaria from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tami Zakaria : Hi, good morning. Thank you so much for taking my questions. So you mentioned sequentially, you expect Automotive margins to get better from here on. How about sales? Should we also expect the first quarter sales to be the lowest of the year and then build from here? Or is there some seasonality that we should be modeling? Michael Larsen : I mean there is very little improvement from here on out. I mean, I think there -- it's really the growth rates year-over-year are more driven by the comparisons. So if you look at Q2 last year was there was a meaningful decline in -- or a lower number in auto builds that's going to be higher this year. So we will see some good growth in Q2 on a year-over-year basis. But sequentially, you're not going to see significant and certainly not an assumption baked in here in terms of significant revenue growth sequentially. Tami Zakaria : Got it. Thank you so much. I\u2019ll pass it on to next person. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Maybe two separate topics for me. If you think about the parts of the portfolio that are still resilient and you have visibility, I think one of the uncharacteristic things maybe you saw in the last year or so is backlog build where you wouldn't typically get backlog build. I just wonder if you could speak to that kind of your forward visibility on some of the things that are a bit later, longer cycle, are the backlogs holding, you're starting to burn into them? Any color on orders there would be interesting? Michael Larsen : Yes. I mean I think as you point out, Jeff, we are not necessarily a backlog-driven company. And while backlogs have come down a little bit, they're still significantly higher today than kind of pre-COVID levels. So maybe not running at 2x, 3x, but at least 50% higher in businesses like Welding and Food Equipment where we're still seeing a fair bit of backlog. The other thing we talked about, Jeff, you know this as supply chain continues to moderate here in terms of the challenges we're going to see backlogs come down, and that's exactly what we're seeing across the company. Jeff Sprague : And I wonder if you could speak longer term to auto margins. I think you said kind of 450 basis point hit from just the price cost, arithmetic and the game had catch up there. Margins are down only about 300 basis points, right over the last year or so. Are you actually pointing us to kind of higher structural margins in auto on the other side of this? I know we don't get it all in 2023, but are we had to do a higher place than we were a year or two ago in auto margins? Scott Santi : Yes. I'm not sure, Jeff, the exact comp that you're referring to, but I think it's safe to say that auto margins, we see a low to mid-20s business over the next two or three years. And it's a combination of great growth prospects there. The fact that all the new programs that we add are margin positive and in fact, just to put in a plug for our Investor Day in a couple of weeks, we're going to spend some time detailing out sort of the margin path in auto in more substance. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis from Melius. Your line is open. Scott Davis : Hey, good morning. Scott, Michael and Karen, I was wondering if you guys could give us a little bit of a window into what's going on in China. I think the April PMI came in a little lighter than what folks were expecting back down a contraction level, but they should be reopening. And I think January was probably the toughest month you had in the quarter. But you've had a chance, I'm guessing by now to see at least an early look at April. What are you seeing there kind of just from a macro perspective and perhaps into each of the businesses if that makes sense? Michael Larsen : Yes. I mean I think we -- to answer your question, we're seeing a bounce back here in April, which supports a double-digit growth rate on a year-over-year basis in China here in the second quarter. We did see here in the first quarter, as you pointed out, particularly in January, several of our customers, the automotive OEMs as well as our restaurant food equipment businesses were slower to open up. So we were definitely down in automotive OEM. I think we said 5%. We were down in Food Equipment. Polymers & Fluids was also down kind of in that 15% to 20% range. And those businesses are all coming back pretty strong here in the second quarter. You'll see some big build numbers in automotive OEM in China. That business could be up significantly will be up significantly on a year-over-year basis. Also, the comps are easier here. So we're looking at a 40% to 50% growth rate in the automotive China business. Food Equipment is coming back, Polymers & Fluids, the Welding business. So it all adds up to something Q2 year-over-year up somewhere around 20%, which obviously includes the bounce back from January, and they're maybe a little bit slower than expected to be opening here in the first quarter. Scott Davis : All right. That's helpful. And I want to go back to Jeff's question, and I don't want to blow up your Investor Day, but feel free to point. But is the era of price de-escalators or price downs and the auto contracts, is that era over with and we're at least over the next 5 years, you envision more of a flattish price environment? Or has nothing really changed. And at the end of the day, we're going to be back into that kind of usual down 1%, 2% price dynamic? Michael Larsen : Yes. I think it's more of the latter, to be honest here. I think the industry has not really changed in terms of how these contracts are structured where you get a lot of price upfront. And so the key there is to continue to innovate and solve problems for customers in ways that nobody else can. And so as you win new programs and get new content on vehicles, that has to come in at a higher price. But in terms of the structure price tons every year that has not changed at this point. Scott Davis : Okay. Thank you for the integrity of answer. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Can we talk about your position in the Chinese like auto OEM market, there seems to be a real change that's happening there? And I'm just curious, how do you think your position is today? Do you need to do anything to kind of help scale the business? Just any thoughts around that would be helpful. Michael Larsen : Well, I think as you'll see, again, at Investor Day, there's been a pretty dramatic shift in that in what's been a very successful automotive business in China. The fastest-growing OEMs are our local to local Chinese OEMs and particularly on the EV side. And so will detail also at the Investor Day, some of the investments that we're making to support that growth and make sure that we have enough capacity and resources in terms of our innovation efforts to continue to win in the Chinese automotive business. So it is a very different business from 5, 10 years ago, but still very successful. And frankly, the organic growth prospects there in terms of above-market organic growth are really some of the best inside the company. So Joe, that's -- again, we'll spend a little more time on this at Investor Day, but we're certainly very optimistic on that business. Joe Ritchie : That's great to hear. I'm looking forward to learning more about it. I guess the follow-on question, and I know we've talked a little bit about the margin recovery in autos and we'll get more at Investor Day. I'm just curious, though, can you help maybe quantify how much of an impact price/cost was to the margins this quarter on a year-over-year basis. And I know that you're now forecasting for sequential improvement and year-over-year improvement as the year progresses. But how much of a benefit is it expected to be as we progress through the quarters? Michael Larsen : Yes. So I think it was a slightly negative price cost margin automotive in Q1 and like I said we\u2019re expecting this to begin to turn positive here in the second quarter. We are seeing overall deflation on more of the commodities, including resins, nylon and acetyl those more basic commodities, those prices are coming down. And so that's part of what's helping us along with, like we said, new content coming in at higher margins. And so those combined will lead to the beginning of cost recovery, price cost margin recovery this year. But as Scott said, this could take two to three years. This takes a little bit longer in automotive OEM than in other parts of the company. Scott Santi : And I'd just point out, following up on Michael's comments that our auto business still outperforms the peer benchmarks by a margin factor of 2.5x the returns on capital we generate are absolutely terrific and right in line with what we do also in the company. So from a long-term standpoint, these are short-term issues that we'll deal with, but it's not terrible by any stress. The business still performs really well. Michael Larsen : That's true. Joe Ritchie : Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Volkmann from Jefferies. Your line is open. Steve Volkmann : Good morning, everybody. Michael, you sort of answered a small part of my question, but I'll ask the broader one. I'm curious what you're seeing across the company in terms of the cost side specifically? I think you mentioned a few of these commodities down maybe for automotive. Are there any other areas where you're seeing deflation on the cost side? And then the follow-on is any risk? Or how do you plan that going forward relative to your price? Is there any risk that kind of price follows that back down as that goes down? Thanks. Michael Larsen : Well, so I think, Steve, we're seeing -- I wouldn't say we're seeing significant deflation at this point. It's just costs are not going up anymore. There's maybe a little bit of deflation, like I said, in kind of the basic commodities that we mentioned. On components, so assembled parts, machine parts that have labor content, I think the costs are going to be a little stickier there, again, because of the labor component. In terms of our planning, consistent with how we always do this, our planning assumptions are based on all known cost increases and decreases as well as the price that we have either implemented or announced, I think we are kind of lapping these more inflation-driven price increases, and we're kind of back to normal price increases. In terms of will those price increases stick as material costs potentially come down. I think we have only 5% of our revenues roughly is tied to an index. So the vast majority we would expect to certainly be able to maintain our historical price premium and at the same time, we want to compete and we want to gain market share, which is really the -- one of the big priorities, if not the number 1 priority of our enterprise strategy, which is strategic share gains to consistently grow organic growth above market. So that's how I would -- I think we'd frame that. Steve Volkmann : Great. Okay. Thank you. And then just a quick follow-up on the construction products. Market were quite a bit higher than I think some of us were looking for. Anything to call out there that was kind of margin goodness and how that sort of goes going forward? Michael Larsen : Yes. I mean when you see something really unusual, the answer is usually price cost. So that's another segment that's been hit really hard over the last two years, actually, a little bit more than the automotive segment from a margin standpoint. And here, what you're seeing is we are beginning to recover the margin impact, which is what we talked about is about to start happening in the automotive business. So that combined to positive price cost combined with a significant contribution from enterprise initiatives actually above the average of the company. I think they were the highest inside the company at 170-odd basis points of contribution of enterprise initiatives. So those were the two big drivers in the construction business. And what's really encouraging is as we look kind of forward, this is not a onetime kind of Q1 impact, we expect to -- based on what the team is telling us to sustain those margins in the high 20s, which is pretty remarkable when you think about where we started pre-enterprise strategy somewhere around 12%. So we expect to sustain those high-20 margins certainly in the near term and medium term. Steve Volkmann : I appreciate. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Chigusa Katoku : This is Chigusa Katoku on for Jamie. Thanks for taking my question. So on organic growth, you maintain the 3% to 5% guide. But I was just wondering if the outlook by segment just at around at all? Michael Larsen : And actually -- so of course, we looked at this. I mean, I think we're very close to what we told you on our last call when we gave guidance for the full year. We are seeing a lot of strength in automotive, food equipment, test and measurement, welding, construction, maybe a little bit better than what we had planned. But overall, kind of grand scheme of things, we are right in line with the assumptions that we gave you at the enterprise level when was that, 3 months ago, yes, last quarter. Chigusa Katoku : Okay. Great. And then on price/cost. So you mentioned that it was 190 basis points positive this quarter. And you remember, you expect it to be positive for the remainder of the year. But I was wondering how we should think about cadence just because I thought there would probably be some puts and takes with auto just beginning to recover onward? Michael Larsen : Yes. I think 90 basis points from price cost and is not -- that's not your normal contribution. So I think we'll have -- based on what we know today, another similar contribution in the second quarter and then it will come down in the second half of the year just as we run into some of the comparisons around price.  But like I said, net-net, we -- you would expect somewhere around 100 to 150 basis points for the full year in terms of price-cost margin, in fact, based on what we know today, which obviously, there's a fair bit of uncertainty in the environment. But based on what we know today, that would be the expectation. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Sabrina Abrams : You have Sabrina Abrams on for Andrew Obin. Thanks for taking my questions. I think you guys were talking about seeing further slowing through the rest of the year is embedded in the guidance, particularly in the 25% of businesses that you've already pointed to slowing. Are there other areas of the business that you would flag as maybe the next year to drop maybe based on current order activity? Michael Larsen : I'm not sure I understood the first -- you said CA slowing? Sabrina Abrams : Just like the 25% of the businesses that you've pointed to slowing and I think you said those would be the -- where you see particularly further slowdown in the rest of the year. I'm just wondering if there's any incremental signs of softness you're seeing in other parts of the portfolio? Scott Santi : I think that's a simple answer. The other 75% demand rates continue to be very strong. Michael Larsen : Yes. I think and Sabrina, the way maybe to think about it is there's a lot of strength in the more capital equipment businesses, food equipment, test and measurement, welding, there's a lot of strength in the automotive business on the top line, which is kind of on its own cycle. And then the more consumer-oriented, more interest rate sensitive and then semi is where there is some softness. And we've been calling out that softness really if you go back and look. I mean, since last summer, we started to see a slowdown in in construction, and it's played out in Q1, at least exactly like we thought it would. And so far, Q2 is off to a pretty good start. Sabrina Abrams : Got you. And then you talked about reinvesting in the business. Can you talk about where adding headcount has been more of a focus? Michael Larsen : Well, I think it's really across the enterprise. So it's -- we're not favoring one segment over another. Every business, every operating unit inside the company has significant organic growth opportunities in front of them, and they make the decisions in terms of where to allocate headcount and or to add headcount to support in support of their organic growth strategies. So there's not really one or two segments that are favored over another one. It's -- every 1 of our 84 divisions like I said, have significant organic growth opportunities in front of them and they're going after those by investing in innovation, commercial resources and capacity to support those customers. Scott Santi : And I'll just add that I can reiterate something you said before, which is in all cases, those investments are self-funded, i.e., margins in every segment will continue to go up. Michael Larsen : Yes. I mean, this is all part of our -- you look at our long-term incremental margins in that 35% to 40% range, that\u2019s after making all the investments necessary to take full advantage of the organic growth opportunities that are in front of us. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Joe O'Dea: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to start just on consumables trends and what you're seeing. I think if we look at sort of polymers and specialty products and construction products, those tend to have some of the relatively higher consumables exposure across the businesses. Those are where we've seen some of the softer year-over-year organic trends. And so is that really just a function of consumer exposure? Or also, any signs of seeing some destocking maybe tied to some of these consumables? And if that is the case, any visibility on what inning we might be in terms of sort of inventory correction? Michael Larsen : Yes. I mean there's certainly some inventory correction going on this quarter or last quarter, we saw that -- and again, it's not like we're selling directly to the consumer. These are all B2B businesses, but the end market, the end consumer or the end customer is a consumer. And those are the ones where we're seeing a little bit more softness, as you said. So I don't know if I have a whole lot more I can add to that. Joe O'Dea: Okay. And then also just wanted to circle back on the earnings cadence over the year and talking about the 49-51 split, I mean, it seems like it would actually imply maybe a little bit lower than normal weighting in the second quarter. Maybe the answer is you're talking about 100 bps, and it's overly nitpicking, but I just want to make sure it's not -- it doesn't sound like you're seeing sort of slowing relative to what you thought earlier in the year, such that we wouldn't see kind of a normal-ish second quarter? Michael Larsen : No. I think last quarter, we -- on this call, we talked about 49 51. I think it's still kind of in our planning assumption, 49%, 51%. And again, I'll just reiterate, that's based on what we're seeing today. I think there's a fair bit of uncertainty that everybody is dealing with right now. But that's kind of our -- that's our base planning assumption. And like I said, so far, Q2 is off to a good start. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : Thanks, good morning. Couple of ground, but I just want to dig into food equipment because that continues to suggest to really outperform quite nicely. So just curious where we are on the post reopening refresh cycle upgrade cycle? Any thoughts there on sort of the in-store base and share gains, et cetera? Michael Larsen : Well, I think we've gained a lot of share in this business based on our ability to service and supply our customers with lead times when others maybe struggled. I think there's really nothing unusual going on in terms of the recovery, the equipment side, we'd say we have largely recovered at this point. And then on the service side, we're still picking up momentum, maybe an area where we're a little constrained in terms of our ability to take care of everybody on the service side. But overall, we are continuing to see some really strong demand trends in this business. This is an area we're talking about backlog earlier where the backlog is 2x normal levels, which gives us a little bit more visibility than what we're normally we were used to.  In terms of the end markets, as you know, our business is more focused on the institutional side, and we're seeing a lot of strength there, whether it's health care or education or lodging but also restaurants up 30% plus. I think we said this in the prepared remarks. So overall, really a lot of solid momentum here. China was a little softer in Q1 as we talked about, I think that business was down about 20%, and so that's going to come back here in Q2 and for the remainder of the year. But certainly a business that's performing at a very high level, including on the margin side, it's really encouraging to see the margins back in in the high 20s again. So overall, I think a solid quarter and really well positioned for the remainder of the year. Scott Santi : Just to take another plug for it -- sorry, Nigel. I was just going to. Nigel Coe : Go ahead. Scott Santi : That we will be featuring food equipment as one of the segments at our Investor Day in a couple of weeks, just to make another plug for that event. Nigel Coe : That would be great. And then just my follow-on is just going back to order margins. You've talked about price cost, I understand that. North America was 3% growth, Europe is 17%. Just wondering if there's a mix issue as well that maybe just essentially to that margin to the downside. And when you talk about sequential improvement in order margins in Q2, do you think that continues into the back half of the year, so we have a nice cadence Q-over-Q from here? Michael Larsen : The latter, the answer is yes, that's the current planning assumption that margins continue to improve from here on out in automotive. I think North America, you can't read too much into the quarterly build numbers. But if you look at overall builds were up, I think, about 10% in North America in Q1. But as you know, we are more concentrated with the D3 auto OEMs. So those -- they were up I think, about 2% in the quarter. So I don't think that has a significant margin impact necessarily. As I think we've talked about before, our margins are pretty comparable across customers as well as by geography. So not a huge mix issue, if you want. Operator : And our last question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Good morning. And thanks for squeezing me in. I just wanted to circle back to the organic sales guide for the year. Because in Q1, I think you did 5% the year sort of guided at 4 at the midpoint, the price/cost tailwind shrinks through the year, and I'm assuming therefore that the price revenue tailwind does as well.  So you're essentially assuming sort of flat volume growth or sort of steady volume growth Q2 to Q4 with Q1 or even an acceleration perhaps. But you've talked about 1/4 of the business seeing a slowdown. So maybe help us understand what's the sort of the quarter of the business that's accelerating volume-wise from Q1 to offset the 25% that's slowing more. Michael Larsen : Yes. I think what we talked about during on the last call was our guide of 3% to 5% organic, we expect that being organic growth in the first half of the year being closer to 5% and the second half closer to 3%, and that's really more of a comp year-over-year phenomenon than anything else. There's no assumption here built in, in terms of things accelerating in the back half. Our typical seasonality is Q1 is kind of the low point from a revenue standpoint. Q2, we see a step up and then again in Q3. And then Q4 is kind of similar to Q3. So that's -- again, those are the planning assumptions based on what we're able to kind of extrapolate as we sit here today. I would just add to I'd just add, they haven't changed. I mean I think Q1 came in right along with our expectations. And so we're kind of still right in line with that full year plan. Julian Mitchell : And is it fair to assume sort of firm why that price tailwind does taper through the year just as the sort of the price cost margin tailwind tapers? Michael Larsen : Yes. Maybe with the exception of the one business we talked a lot about today, which is the automotive OEM business, that's just beginning to recover we do expect that one to pick up here starting in the second quarter and then again in the second half of the year. Julian Mitchell : That's helpful. And then just my follow-up would be on the Test & Measurement business, where I don't think there's been many questions, but some of the peers like say, Tektronix, Fortive or something. They were growing 20% plus in Q1. They're guiding to exit the year at flat. Just wondered on the sort of the core test and measurement piece aside electronics, how you're thinking about the balance of the year in terms of that rate of slowdown? Michael Larsen : Well, general and industrial demand for Test & Measurement equipment remains really strong. I think I mentioned Instron up 22%, another plug for our Investor Day, MTS, which will give you kind of a progress report was up 14% year-over-year in Q1. So those businesses are even more in line with some of the numbers that you were quoting. And really, the only challenges here are on the semi side, which is only about 20% of the segment.  And like we said those semi revenues are now down in that 10% to 15% range in Q1. We expect some further softness here in Q2 in that part of the business. But overall, I mean, I think organic growth of 6% and our margins kind of in the mid-20s after digesting a lower-margin acquisition and some really good progress in this segment. Julian Mitchell : That\u2019s great. Thank you. Karen Fletcher : So that wraps things up. I want to thank everybody for joining us this morning. And just a reminder, we look forward to seeing you at our Investor Day in Boston on May 18. Operator : Thank you for participating in today's conference call. All lines may disconnect at this time.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the ITW Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Karen Fletcher, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Karen Fletcher : Thanks, Rob. Good morning, and welcome to ITW\u2019s second quarter 2023 conference call. I\u2019m joined by our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi; and Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen. During today\u2019s call, we\u2019ll discuss ITW\u2019s second quarter financial results and provide an update on our full year 2023 outlook. Slide 2 is a reminder that this presentation contains forward-looking statements. We refer you to the company\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. This presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release. Please turn to Slide 3, and it\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi. Scott Santi : Thanks, Karen, and good morning, everyone. As you saw from our earnings release this morning, the ITW team delivered another quarter of strong operational execution and financial performance. Quarterly operating income grew 9% and exceeded $1 billion for the first time in ITW\u2019s history. Operating margin expanded 170 basis points year-on-year to 24.8%, a second quarter record with a 130 basis point contribution from enterprise initiatives. Operating margins for the company are now solidly above 2019 levels. And with a normalizing price/cost environment, we are back to making progress toward our 2030 goal of 30%. With regard to revenues, organic growth was 3% as stable underlying demand in many of ITW\u2019s industrial end markets was partially offset by inventory reductions at our end customers and channel partners in response to stabilizing supply chain performance. We estimate that this impacted organic growth by 1 point to 1.5 points in the quarter. GAAP EPS of $2.48 was also a Q2 record for the company and excluding one-off tax items in both years, grew \u2013 EPS grew 9%. Looking ahead, while customer and channel inventory normalization will continue to be a factor for the next several quarters at least, we expect stable underlying demand and continued strong margin and profitability performance through the balance of the year. As a result, we are raising our full year 2023 EPS guidance by $0.10 at the midpoint. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Michael to discuss our Q2 performance and full year guidance in more detail. Michael? Michael Larsen : Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Q2 revenue grew by 2% with organic growth of 3%, and divestitures reduced revenue by 1%. Foreign currency translation impact was neutral and not a headwind for the first time since the third quarter of 2021. Underlying demand remains stable across the majority of our end markets with some softness in about 25% of our portfolio. As Scott mentioned, our businesses estimate that inventory reduction efforts by our end customers and channel partners reduced organic growth by 1% to 1.5% at the enterprise level. By geography, North America was flat, Europe grew 5%, Asia Pacific grew 11%, with China up 22%. On the bottom line, operating income grew 9%, exceeding $1 billion for the first time ever. Operating margins were a real highlight this quarter as they improved to a new Q2 record of 24.8% with Enterprise Initiatives contributing 130 basis points. Price/cost margin impact contributed 260 basis points in Q2, while higher wages and benefit costs lowered margins by around 100 basis points. In addition, we continue to fund our growth investments, including headcount additions to support our organic growth strategies and initiatives. All in, we delivered 170 basis points of margin improvement in the quarter, with margin expansion in six of our seven segments, three of them, welding, food equipment and construction products, recorded all-time highs. GAAP EPS was $2.48, an increase of 5%, and excluding one-time tax items in both years, EPS grew 9%. Our cash performance was strong as free cash flow grew 68% to $705 million, a new Q2 record. Free cash flow was 94% of net income, about 10 percentage points above our historical Q2 average, helped by an inventory reduction of 6% since year-end. Like our end customers and channel partners, our divisions are also beginning to reduce inventory levels as supply chains normalize. That being said, we added almost $1 billion of inventory over the last two years to mitigate supply chain challenges and it would likely take us until the first half of next year to get our inventory levels from currently 3.2 months on hand back to our normal months on hand levels of about two. We expect that it will be much the same for many of our channel partners and customers. Overall, for Q2, excellent operational execution and financial performance across the board, including record operating income, operating margin and GAAP EPS. Turning to Slide 4. We wanted to spend a minute on ITW\u2019s operating margin performance in Q2. Like I said, one of the highlights of the quarter. Not only did margins significantly expand year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, but at 24.8% margins and are now also solidly above pre-pandemic levels, and we are back on track in terms of making progress towards our goal of 30% in 2030. Let\u2019s move to the segment results, starting with automotive OEM, which led the segments with strong organic growth of 16% and positive growth in all regions. North America was up 3% and Europe grew 18%. China grew 51%. Operating margin expanded 250 basis points to 16.8%, and price/cost margin impact turned positive for the first time in more than three years as this segment continues on the margin recovery and improvement path that we laid out at our 2023 Investor Day. As a reminder, we\u2019re executing a plan to get auto OEM margins solidly back into the 20s over the next three years. Organic growth in this segment in the second half reflects some tougher comparisons, and we expect continued meaningful sequential improvement in operating margins in Q3 and Q4. Turning to Slide 5. Food equipment also delivered strong organic growth of 7% with North America up 8%. Institutional end markets were up 13%, with continued strength across the board. International revenue grew 5%, with Europe up 5% and Asia Pacific up 2%. A real highlight was service revenue, which grew 16%, the ninth quarter in a row with double-digit growth as we continue to support existing customers, new product installations and gain market share. Operating margin expanded 310 basis points to 27.8%, an all-time record for the food equipment segment. Test and measurement and electronics delivered positive organic growth of 1%. The slowdown in semiconductor-related revenues, which represent about 20% of the segment, reduced the segment growth rate by 6 percentage points. Test and measurement grew 10% with continued strong demand for capital equipment as evidenced, for example, by Instron, which grew 30%. Electronics declined 13% on semiconductor softness, which is, however, beginning to show some signs of bottoming out. Moving on to Slide 6. Welding delivered 1% organic growth against a tough comparison of plus 22% in the prior year. Equipment revenue was essentially flat and consumables were up 2%. Industrial sales were really solid with organic growth of plus 5% on top of 27% in the prior year, while the commercial side was down 9%, about as expected against the comparison of 19% last year. North America revenue was flat and international grew 5%. This quarter\u2019s highlight was definitely operating margin expansion of 460 basis points to 33.9%, a new record for the segment and for the company. And the fact that our highest margin segment continues to improve margins and not just by a little bit, is a good example of the never satisfied continuous improvement mindset and is so core to the ITW culture and mindset across the company. Polymers and fluids organic revenue was down 1% against a difficult comparison of plus 10% last year. Divestitures impacted revenue by 6%. Automotive aftermarket was up 1%, polymers down 2% and fluids down 1%. On a geographic basis, North America grew 1% and international declined 3%. Turning to Slide 7. Organic revenue in construction was down 6% against a comparison of plus 15% last year. North America was down 3% with U.S. residential construction down 2% and commercial construction, which represents about 15% of the region, down 5%. Europe was down 14%, and Australia and New Zealand was down 4%. Despite some challenging end market conditions, operating margin expanded 170 basis points to 29.3%, an all-time record for the Construction Products segment. Finally, Specialty organic revenue was down 4%, which included 1 point of headwind from product line simplification and an estimated 3 percentage points from end customer and channel inventory reduction efforts. North America was down 7% and international grew 4%. Equipment revenue, which represents about 20% of the segment, was up 23%, and consumables were down 9%. With that, let\u2019s move to Slide 8 for an update on our full year 2023 guidance. As you saw this morning, we raised our GAAP EPS guidance by $0.10 with a new midpoint of $9.75 based on our strong first half performance with record first half GAAP EPS of $4.81 and the expectation for stable underlying demand and continued strong margin and profitability performance through the balance of the year.  Our organic growth guidance of 3% to 5% includes our expectation that end customer and channel inventory normalization activities will continue to modestly impact overall demand through at least the balance of the year. Operating margin is projected to expand by more than 100 basis points at the midpoint of our range of 24.5% to 25.5%, which includes a contribution of more than 100 basis points from enterprise initiatives. We\u2019re also projecting strong free cash flow performance with a conversion of over 100% of net income. Finally, on the tax rate, our first half rate was 22%, and we expect our typical 24% in the second half for an expected full year rate of around 23%. In summary, a strong first half, both operationally and financially. And as we head into the second half, we are in a strong position to continue to deliver differentiated performance through the balance of the year. With that, Karen, I will turn it back to you. Karen Fletcher : All right. Thank you, Michael. Rob, can you please open up the lines for questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research. Your line is open. Jeffrey Sprague : Thank you. Hello everyone. Scott Santi : Hello Jeff. Jeffrey Sprague : Yes hi, thank you. I wonder if we could address Michael, just kind of the price-cost algorithm for the remainder of the year now. You are up 260 bps in the Q2. I know you still got some more work to do there, particularly in Automotive. So maybe you could address that on a total ITW basis? And how do you see Automotive margins progressing into the back half of the year towards that two handle on margins there? Michael Larsen : Yes, sure, Jeff. So I think overall, on price-cost, we\u2019d say we\u2019re on track to recover the margin impact from a period over the last two years of unprecedented inflation, which has now stabilized. So, in the first quarter, price-cost was positive 190 basis points, Q2 260 basis points and for the balance of the year, we\u2019re looking at a more normalized 130 to 150 basis points range. And for the full year, we should recover somewhere around 150 to 200 basis points at the enterprise level. I think what was encouraging is every segment is now margin positive, including Automotive OEM and we expect that for [indiscernible] your question specifically to remain the case for the back half of the year. And combined with enterprise initiatives, we expect sequential improvement in Q3 and Q4 in the Automotive segment, and we should end up somewhere in the high teens as we exit 2023. We\u2019re still a long way to go over the next two to three years to get back to kind of the low to mid-20s, which is the path that we laid out at Investor Day. Jeffrey Sprague : Great. And your comments about the supply chain normalization and everything were pretty clear, but I just wonder if you could give us some perspective on your backlogs, right? Typically, you don\u2019t have big backlogs, but you got to kind of 2x normal in a number of your businesses. Where are we at the ITW level and kind of getting things back to the normal run rate? Michael Larsen : Yes, I think, similar to what we talked about on the last call, supply chain performance continues to improve. And as that happened, our backlogs are also starting to come down. And at this point, we\u2019re still above our normal levels. If you look at the businesses where we do carry some backlog Food Equipment, for example, we\u2019re running at 2x normal levels, and the same is true in Welding. But as I said, those backlogs are coming down pretty quickly as supply chain performance improves. Jeffrey Sprague : Thank you very much. Michael Larsen : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Jamie Cook : Hi, good morning. Two questions. A follow-up on the inventory reductions from your customers and channel partners. Exactly what\u2019s embedded in the back half of the year, is it another visit 1 to 1.5 points and in the guide in the back half of the year? And then as a follow-up to that, you are maintaining your revenue guide despite this, so what\u2019s doing better than expectations? And sort of my last question is Construction margins were very impressive considering the sales decline. So any color on that? Thank you. Michael Larsen : Yes. I think the inventory reduction impact that we saw here in Q2 is now embedded in our run rates, and therefore, embedded in our guidance for the balance of the year. Actually, if you look at our Q2, it came in right in line with run rate except for these \u2013 the inventory impact that we estimate at 1 point to 1.5 points. And underlying demand, as we said, is really stable, if not strong in places like Auto and Food Equipment. So we feel really good about our assumptions here going into the back half of the year. Your question specifically on Construction, I agree with you, that\u2019s some pretty impressive performance given the challenging end markets, particularly if you look at Europe. The big drivers here continue to be enterprise initiatives, which has been called the gift that keeps on giving. Scott Santi : By you. Michael Larsen : By me. Scott Santi : Yes. Michael Larsen : Yes, if I may say so. And I think total company, the Enterprise initiative impact ranged from 70 to 200 basis points by segment with Construction at the very high end of that at about 200 basis points impact. And then certainly, there\u2019s still some catch-up on price/cost. Construction was a segment that was hit harder than the average in 2021 and 2022. And so price/cost did contribute in a meaningful way. We do expect that, just like we do for the rest of the Enterprise to begin to normalize here in the back half, like I said in response to Jeff\u2019s question, but we\u2019re still going to see positive price/cost impact, including Construction in the second half. Jamie Cook : Thank you. Michael Larsen : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe O\u2019Dea from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Joe O\u2019Dea : Hi, good morning. Scott Santi : Good morning. Joe O\u2019Dea : I guess I wanted to sort of extend that a little bit in terms of the comment around underlying demand being sort of stable to strong and sort of calling out Auto and Food Equipment. But anything from sort of a regional or end market perspective that you\u2019re watching most closely on end market demand and sort of considerations on kind of prospects for slowing anymore? Scott Santi : I think overall, it\u2019s been remarkably stable. If anything, we saw some firming up in the second quarter based on some trends in the first quarter that we talked about relative to 25% of our portfolio. I think the one place we saw things continue to weaken was in Europe on Construction between Q1 and Q2, but for the rest of the portfolio, I think, at this point, the best description is pretty firm. Joe O\u2019Dea: Got it. And then also just the margin strength in the quarter and thinking about the back half of this year, I think, the midpoint for the full year would suggest something like a 25.5% margin in the back half. I think you\u2019ve talked about sort of continued progress on Auto. Just anything else that you think to be the more notable contributors to that sequential improvement? Michael Larsen : Yes, I mean the big driver continues to be the Enterprise initiatives. The work around eighty-twenty front-to-back and strategic sourcing efforts, we expect at least 100 basis points of contribution there in the second half. And then price-cost, we still expect a meaningful contribution as we talked about a few minutes ago. So, all of that means that as we look at kind of the second half, we expect margins to continue to improve sequentially from Q2 to Q3 and from Q3 to Q4, maybe somewhere around 50 to 60 basis points each quarter of sequential improvement. I think we talked in the past about 100 basis points of improvement year-over-year. That\u2019s still looking very good. So, like I said in the prepared remarks, we\u2019re really well positioned here in terms of our margin and profitability performance through the balance of the year and frankly into next year. So, I\u2019ll leave it at that. Joe O\u2019Dea: Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Tami Zakaria from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tami Zakaria : Hi, good morning. Scott Santi : Good morning. Tami Zakaria : Thank you so much for taking my questions. So, my first question is on Food Equipment. I think I saw on your slide, it grew 3%, while services were up 15%. So for the Equipment portion, is that entirely pricing-driven? Was there any volume growth in the quarter on the Equipment side? Michael Larsen : So, I think you know this, Tami, we don\u2019t break out price and volume. And I\u2019d say both elements contributed and it\u2019s a little different equipment versus service, but certainly some really strong activity. North America, I think, we said up 8%, that has Equipment up 5%, services up 15%, by end market institutions up 13%, health care up 18%, restaurants, still really strong performance there. Retail a little softer. That can be a little lumpy, international side, up 5%. So, I think really strong quarter by Food Equipment and actually looking really good for Q3. I think that they should be putting up another really strong quarter. There might be a little bit of \u2013 if you go back and look, the comparisons are a little bit challenging on a year-over-year basis. But overall, the underlying demand in food equipment remains really healthy and really well positioned again for the second half. Tami Zakaria : Got it. That\u2019s very helpful color. And if I can ask a follow-up about your Welding segment, I thought the results there were very interesting. Operating margin was up 460 basis points even though organic growth was about 1%. So, what\u2019s driving this very strong operating margin leverage? Is it purely price/cost, or is there something else going on in there? Michael Larsen : There is something else going on in there, Tami. So, it\u2019s a similar answer to what I said for Construction. I mean I think there is a healthy dose of enterprise initiatives. And then we\u2019re still recovering the margin impact on price/cost. So, those are the main drivers here. And like I said, I mean, price/cost, we expect that to normalize in the second half, but the Enterprise initiatives and we expect that to continue into the \u2013 through the balance of the year and into next year. Tami Zakaria : Perfect, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Your line is open. Andy Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning everyone. Michael Larsen : Good morning. Andy Kaplowitz : So you mentioned you thought electronics-related markets look like they may be bottoming out. Could you give us more color into what you\u2019re seeing here prompted you to say that? And then stepping back and focusing on the 25% of the business, including Electronics, that has been weak, would you say that like Electronics, you are seeing the bottoming in many of these markets, maybe outside of European Construction, which you already mentioned? Or was that [indiscernible] just focused on Electronics? Michael Larsen : So let me do the semi portion first. I mean, I think, there has been this view that the second half would be a step-up from the first half. Really, we talked about this going into the year. Scott Santi : Mostly from what we\u2019re hearing from our customers. Michael Larsen : And I was going to say, the customer feedback has now become even more supportive of that view along the lines of get ready for orders to come back here in the second half and make sure you have the capacity to support us, which, of course, we do. So, that\u2019s kind of the color commentary around semi. And similar to what you\u2019re hearing from other... Scott Santi : We\u2019re not baking any of that into our back half\u2026 Michael Larsen : That\u2019s a good point. None of that is baked in. So I think that\u2019s... Scott Santi : We\u2019ll take them when we see it. Michael Larsen : Exactly like we normally do; none of that would be in our run rates, obviously. And so we\u2019d be happy to see that here late Q3, Q4, if we get those \u2013 if that really comes to fruition. On the 25% of the portfolio, I think maybe to give you a little bit more detail, I think what was really encouraging this quarter is if you look at the performance of those businesses, and there are some puts and takes. There are some businesses that are no longer slowing, that have moved out and others, I think Construction Europe was an example that maybe have moved in, but it\u2019s still about 25% of the company. Those businesses were down 7% year-over-year in the first quarter, and they were only down 3% in the second quarter. And actually, if you look at it sequentially, the businesses as a group improved 2% sequentially. And that includes in that 25% is also at least a portion of our semi revenues. So I think that\u2019s certainly encouraging as we look to the back half of the year. Andrew Kaplowitz : Michael, that\u2019s really helpful. And then I just want to go back to your commentary on regional demand. You mentioned China was up 22% in the quarter, which I think you expect did. And obviously several of your peers have talked about seeing some incremental weakness in China moving forward. Do you still feel well positioned there, maybe given your China auto exposure, you still expecting kind of Food Equipment markets to improve? Any color would be helpful. Michael Larsen : Yes. I think, Andy, the big driver for us in China is auto, and that\u2019s our largest businesses. We talked about this on the last call, we expected a strong Q2 in China. Based on some of the COVID-related slowing in the first quarter, we bounced back in the second quarter with auto up more than 50% in Q2 and all of China up 22%. I think a better way to look at China is maybe if you look at the first half, our China business was up 7% on a year-over-year basis, and that\u2019s maybe a more accurate representation of kind of the underlying levels of demand. And so for the second half, we\u2019d expect something kind of in the mid-single digits out of that region. But again, it\u2019s all driven by the auto business that\u2019s doing a phenomenal job frankly, gaining share and launching new products particularly on the EV side with domestic local Chinese OEMs that are winning big time, as we talked about at Investor Day. So really well positioned, not just for the second half but for many, many years to come here in our China business and in auto particularly. Andrew Kaplowitz : Appreciate all the color. Michael Larsen : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Joe Ritchie : Hey guys. Good morning. Scott Santi : Good morning. Joe Ritchie : Can we maybe just double-click a little bit on the longer-term service opportunity in Food Equipment? Clearly, 16% growth in that business is very robust, and I\u2019m sure it carries a pretty good margin for you guys as well. Can you just maybe kind of talk a little bit about how you\u2019re increasing the growth rate today and then what the expectations are going forward? Michael Larsen : Yes. I mean I think the service business we\u2019ve talked about this for a long-time now in terms of long-term organic growth potential. It is a huge differentiator with us \u2013 for us in the market. We are the only OEM that has service capabilities, and it gives us all kinds of advantages in terms of our ability to install, service, maintain and then capture replacement down the line. So we think there\u2019s a lot more to come on the service side. We\u2019re obviously still, to some extent recovering from COVID. If you actually look at the Equipment side has now fully recovered to 2019 levels. The Service side is still catching up, and so we expect that there\u2019s still a lot of runway particularly with our installed base. Scott Santi : I was going to say that I\u2019m not current on the exact \u2013 what our businesses estimate is our share of our installed base, but last time I had the conversation I think it was sort of well into the low-20s at best maybe and don\u2019t sort of take that as possible, but at the point is that we have a lot of room to grow within \u2013 with just doing \u2013 giving more penetration with our current installed base globally. Joe Ritchie : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Maybe, I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s an opportunity to elaborate on that point, Scott. I think you guys called out the service business being roughly, what 30% of the Food Equipment segment. So are you \u2013 do you have to invest more in your service capabilities or getting feed on the street to improve the penetration there? Scott Santi : Yes. And that\u2019s been an active strategy for the last \u2013 really coming \u2013 really from before COVID. So some of it is coverage, some of it is programming. When you actually service the equipment you sell, we have lots of opportunity to integrate service offerings at the point we sell the equipment, which is part of the \u2013 why we think this is a big competitive advantage for us. So it\u2019s essentially all of the above, but there\u2019s no way to do service remotely. So we got to have service techs on the street. We\u2019ve got, I think, north of 1,500 in North America and the same in Europe. And given the profitability of the business and how much runway we have we\u2019ll certainly continue to invest. That\u2019s part of what Michael talked about; continue to invest in our organic growth strategies that\u2019s certainly a good example. Joe Ritchie : Yes. Okay. Great. And then maybe one last question just on M&A. Just any comments around the pipeline today, what you\u2019re seeing and whether there\u2019s been any movement since you last updated at Investor Day? Scott Santi : Yes, I\u2019d say that there\u2019s been no change. We continue to get sort of apple flow in terms of people wanting us to take a look at things. And as we\u2019ve talked about for a long time and certainly updated at our Investor Day, the aperture through which we will strike on those opportunities is pretty narrow given all the potential in our core business, but we\u2019ve done MTS recently, and we will continue to opportunistically be aggressive. But from the standpoint of overall flow, is it up or down, I\u2019d say it\u2019s been pretty stable. Joe Ritchie : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : And your final question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Thanks. Good morning. Maybe a question first off, just around the cadence of sort of Q3 versus Q4; anything to call out there when you\u2019re thinking about margins or the top line, particularly in the context of that destocking that you mentioned? Thank you. Michael Larsen : Yes. I think, Julian, I think I said this earlier, we do expect as we typically do, if you look at our historical sequential lift from Q2 to Q3 of about 1%. The thing to keep in mind is that Q3 has one less shipping day relative to prior year and relative to Q2, so that is going to have a little bit of an impact. So don\u2019t expect a big jump here in Q3. But certainly based on current run rates, some progress on the top line, progress on the bottom line with margin expansion. I think we talked about that somewhere along the lines of 50 plus basis points from Q2 to Q3. And I might just add that in terms of our typical cadence kind of first half, second half, if you look at our full year EPS, we\u2019re typically 49% to 51%, and we are \u2013 as we see today, right in line with that, based on our \u2013 if you look at our $4.81 GAAP EPS for the first half the midpoint of our guidance of $9.75, you can calculate what\u2019s left to go, and you\u2019ll see it\u2019s a lift from the first half to the second half. That\u2019s right in line with our historical averages, which gives us a lot of confidence as we head into the second half here. Julian Mitchell : Thanks very much, Michael. And maybe just my second question or follow-up would just be around when you\u2019re thinking about the sort of market share gain efforts across the company. Volume growth year-to-date very muted or negative; do you still think you\u2019re getting some share? Or was the sort of the share gain maximized really two, three years ago when competitors were supply constrained and now we\u2019re in a normal supply chain environment, the sort of share gains have dried up largely? Thank you. Michael Larsen : Well, so Julian, I wouldn\u2019t agree with how you characterize this in terms of no volume gains year-to-date. I think we have a lot of confidence that we continue to take market share not just as we talked about through the pandemic. But on an ongoing basis, I mean, I think if you look at our organic growth rates relative to peers in these \u2013 in some of these segments, you\u2019ve got some good comps. You can certainly take a look at that. And I think we\u2019re continuing to invest here in all of our organic growth strategies and efforts, including headcount to continue to take market share. So we have a high degree of confidence that we continue to take share. Scott Santi : And it\u2019s not something you measure in a quarter or two. Julian Mitchell : No, I think these... Scott Santi : I think the long view, we\u2019ve committed to organic growth in our organic growth goals in our \u2013 in the Investor Day we just did, and those are organic growth goals that are going to be well above underlying market growth at 4 to 5 and in that case by definition we will continue to take share. Michael Larsen : Yes. And I think the other thing, I mean, the biggest driver as we talked about at Investor Day, Julian, I think you were there is going to be our customer-back innovation efforts. We\u2019re signing a bright light on our CBI efforts, and we\u2019re \u2013 the whole company is focused on continuing to drive up the contribution to organic growth from our innovation efforts. And so you put all of that together we\u2019re highly confident we can deliver our long-term kind of 4% plus organic, which is given our high levels of profitability, that\u2019s all we need to grow, EPS kind of high-single digit, low-double digit. You add an attractive dividend yield on top of that, and you\u2019re getting that 11 to 13 TSR over the long-term, not every year, this year, yes, but not every year. That\u2019s what you should expect from ITW. And it\u2019s much more about that than it is a quarterly market share number, which is, I think, what you\u2019re asking about. Julian Mitchell : That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Michael Larsen : Sure. You\u2019re welcome. Operator : And thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference call. All lines may now disconnect at this time.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the ITW Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Karen Fletcher, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin. Karen Fletcher : Okay. Thanks, Krista. Good morning, and welcome to ITW's third quarter 2023 conference call. I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi; Vice Chairman, Chris O'Herlihy; and Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen. During today\u2019s call, we\u2019ll discuss ITW\u2019s third quarter financial results and provide an update on our full year 2023 outlook. Slide 2 is a reminder that this presentation contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the company\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. This presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release. Please turn to Slide 3, and it\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi. Scott Santi : Thank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. As you are all aware, on September 7, we announced our CEO succession plan, wherein I will be turning over the CEO role to my colleague, Chris O'Herlihy at year-end. Chris is an exceptional leader with deep expertise in ITW's highly differentiated business model, our focused strategy to leverage it to full potential and the company's unique one-of-a-kind culture. He has been an invaluable partner and collaborator with me over the past 11 years. We have worked closely together to prepare for this transition. He is more than ready and he will do an exceptional job as ITW's next CEO. If you allow me a brief bit of reflection in the last 11 years, I will simply say that everything we did was driven by our fundamental belief in the performance power of the differentiated set of strategic and operational capabilities and practices that we refer to as the ITW business model. In this past phase, we focused on getting the company properly positioned to be able to leverage them to their full potential over the long term. With this as our foundation, ITW enters our next phase in a position of great strength and resilience with these unique skills and capabilities sharply honed. I wholeheartedly believe that there will be an even bigger source of competitive advantage and differentiated performance in the company's next phase than they were in the last one, especially if you believe as I do that the level of volatility and unpredictability of the world will only increase from here forward. I have absolutely no doubt that Chris and the incredibly talented ITW leadership team behind him will utilize all of the differentiated tools at ITW's disposal to read and react to whatever comes our way and lead the company to even greater heights in our next phase. Let me close by saying that it has been both a privilege and an honor to lead this great company for the last 11 years. And I offer my deepest gratitude to all of my ITW colleagues past and present for all of their support and for their unwavering commitment to working every day to be the best ITW that we can be. With that, it is now my pleasure to turn the call and in a few months, the company over to Chris O'Herlihy. Chris, over to you. Christopher O'Herlihy: Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. First, I want to thank Scott and our Board of Directors for their trust and confidence in electing me as ITW's next CEO. I'm incredibly humbled by the opportunity to lead this great company, our exceptionally talented leadership team and our 46,000 dedicated colleagues around the world. As Scott said, as a result of the work done over the last 11 years in executing our enterprise strategy to leverage the ITW business model to its full potential, our company has never performed better or been better positioned for the future. The central focus of the next phase of our enterprise strategy is to elevate high quality organic growth and customer back innovation as key ITW differentiators on par with our best-in-class operational capabilities and financial performance. Our leadership team and I are deeply committed to doing just that in delivering on ITW's 2030 Enterprise Performance Goals. Now, let's turn to our Q3 performance. The strength and resilience of ITW's proprietary business model and high-quality diversified portfolio once again drove strong operational execution and financial performance this quarter. Starting with the top line, organic growth was 2% on an equal days basis, as demand for CapEx slowed down in test and measurement and electronics and welding. Our margin and income performance continues to be very robust. Operating margin improved 200 basis points year-over-year to 26.5% as enterprise initiatives contributed 140 basis points. Quarterly operating income grew 9% to $1.1 billion. GAAP EPS grew 9% to $2.55 and free cash flow was up 40%. With three quarters behind us, we are narrowing our EPS guidance to a range of $9.65 to $9.85, which now incorporates a $0.12 adjustment to the impact of the auto strike in Q4. Looking ahead at the balance of the year, the company remains well positioned to deliver another year of differentiated performance. I'll now turn the call over to Michael to discuss our Q3 performance and full year guidance in more detail. Michael. Michael Larsen : Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Organic growth in the third quarter was essentially flat and plus 2% on an equal days basis as Q3 this year had one less shipping day compared to Q3 last year. Foreign currency translation impact was favorable by 1.5% and divestitures reduced revenue by 1.2%. The net result was revenue growth of 0.5%. Third quarter operating margin was 26.5%, an increase of 200 basis points year-over-year as enterprise initiatives contributed 140 basis points and price cost margin impact was positive 210 basis points. GAAP EPS of $2.55 was up 9% and included $0.07 net of favorable corporate items on a year-over-year basis starting with unallocated expense, which improved by $43 million due to lower employee related expenses, including health and welfare and a one-time insurance recovery. This favorable item was partially offset by $16 million of lower other income, primarily due to lower investment income. As I said, the net effect of these two items was favorable $0.07 net per share. Free cash flow grew 40% to $856 million, with a conversion to net income of 111% as we continue to make solid progress on returning to our normal historical inventory levels. We repurchased $375 million of our shares this quarter and raised our dividend by 7% to an annualized payout of $5.60 per share, which marks our 60th year of raising the dividend. In summary, Q3 was another quarter of strong operational execution and financial performance. Turning to Slide 4, organic revenue growth by geography. As you can see, North America was down 2%, Europe was about flat, and Asia Pacific was up 6%, with China up 8%, driven by the Automotive OEM segment. Excluding auto, China was down 1%. Moving to the segments and starting with our Automotive OEM, organic growth was 4%. North America was down 5%, Europe was up 5% and China was up 18%. There was essentially no impact on Automotive OEM segment revenues from the auto strike in Q3. But as Chris noted, that will not be the case in Q4. As a reminder, our North American Automotive OEM business represents approximately 40% of total segment revenues. And within that 40%, approximately two-thirds of our annual sales are tied to D3 automotive customers. Included in our updated earnings guidance today is our estimate that the impact of the auto strike will reduce our Q4 earnings by $0.12 per share, which is essentially based on October D3 domestic production levels continuing through the remainder of the quarter. Turning to Slide 5. Food Equipment delivered solid organic growth of 6% as Equipment was up 5% and Service grew 9%. North America grew 10%, with institutional sales up in the mid-teens, restaurants up high single digits and retail up in the high teens on the back of new product rollouts. Europe, however, was flat and Asia Pacific was up 6%. In Test & Measurement and Electronics, organic revenue was down 4%, weighed down six percentage points by semiconductor-related demand, which represents about 15% of segments and for context, only 3% of ITW revenues. Overall, Test & Measurement grew 2% and as demand for CapEx slowed in the quarter and Electronics declined 13%. Moving on to Slide 6. Welding's organic revenue declined 2%, as Equipment revenue was down 3% on the back of softer demand for CapEx. Consumables were down 1% as industrial sales declined 9% versus a tough comparison of plus 30% last year. Commercial, however, was up 6% against an easier year-over-year comparison of down 10%. Overall, though North America revenue was down 3% and international was essentially flat. Polymers & Fluids, organic revenue grew 3% as automotive aftermarket grew 10% due to the launch of new products. Polymers was down 1% and Fluids was down 4%. Margins were solid as operating margin improved 280 basis points to 28.1%. Turning to Slide 7, organic revenue in Construction was down 2%, as North America grew 2%, with residential up 2% with some strength on the residential renovation side, which was up 7%. Commercial construction was down 2%. International markets were soft, with Europe down 8%; and Australia and New Zealand down 4%. Margins were solid as operating margin improved 420 basis points to 29.9% with strong contributions from enterprise initiatives and price cost. Finally, Specialty Products, organic revenue was down 6%. North America was down 9% and international grew 1%. Consumables were down 9% and Equipment revenue, which represents about 20% of the segment, was up 9%. Moving to Slide 8 and our updated full year 2023 guidance, as you saw this morning, we are narrowing the range of our GAAP EPS guidance to a new range of $9.65 to $9.85 which, as I mentioned earlier, includes a $0.12 adjustment for the estimated auto strike impact in Q4. Based on current levels of demand exiting Q3, including the estimated impact of the auto strike, we're projecting organic growth of 2% to 3% for the full year. We are raising our full year operating margin guidance to 25% to 25.5%, to reflect our stronger margin performance exiting the third quarter, and we expect that margins for the full year will improve by 150 basis points at the midpoint, including a contribution of more than 100 basis points from enterprise initiatives. We are projecting free cash flow conversion of more than 100% of net income for the year. So while the overall demand environment clearly has some uncertainties in the near-term, inventory normalization, elevated interest rates, increasing CapEx caution and the auto strike just to mention a few. The entire team at ITW remains focused on leveraging ITW's unique strengths and capabilities to optimize our ability to continue to deliver differentiated long-term performance. With that, Karen, I'll turn it back to you. Karen Fletcher : Thank you, Michael. Krista, please open the lines up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Davis from Melius Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Scott Davis : Good morning Scott and Chris and Michael and Karen. Michael Larsen : Good morning. Scott Santi : Good morning. Scott Davis : I was -- the price/cost positive 200 basis -- 210, was better. I think we were thinking just some simple math kind of more like 100, 150. What -- were you able to get more, price in the quarter? Or was it lower cost or a little bit of both? Or just a little color there would be helpful. Thanks. Michael Larsen : Yes. So let me give you a little bit of context here. So we are definitely on track to recover the margin impact now from more than two years of unprecedented inflation, which now appears to have stabilized. There's definitely still some pressure on the cost side, on the labor side, components as well as energy. That said we've made some good progress. Price/cost was positive 190 basis points in Q1, 216 in Q2, which was the peak and then 210 here in the third quarter. And we're now looking at somewhere around 150 basis points in Q4, and that would put us around 200 basis points recovery for the full year. Price is holding, and we're seeing a little bit of deflation on the -- more on the commodity side. So these would be the metals, in particular, which drove the stronger performance here on price/cost in the third quarter. Scott Davis : That's helpful. Chris, I know it's early. You've got another couple of months, but is there kind of a plan for the first 90 days? Or where do you see the -- I guess the focus shifting, is there a little bit more emphasis on portfolio or -- I know you mentioned kind of driving higher growth rates, but they're just -- given the diversity of end markets you sell into, there's just so much you can do on that front. But maybe just a little color on where you planning on spending your first kind of three to six months and focusing? Christopher O'Herlihy: Yes. So Scott, I would say, in general, our plan is very much in line with what we outlined at our Investor Day in terms of really ensuring that we continue to strengthen our foundation, which is our business model and obviously then building organic growth as a core strength on par with our operational capabilities and financial performance over time. I think the first 90 days I'm just learning the job, just go out and pretty good understanding of our businesses already, but obviously, working with our businesses to make sure that our strategy is well part of dominant businesses, which, of course, it is, that's really the plan for the first 90 days, I would say. But it's really in the context of being very committed to this -- the strategy for the next phase, which is to sustain the strong foundation we have around our business model, we're really leaning in and continuing to build our organic growth capabilities to be on par with our operational capabilities and our financial performance. Scott Davis : Okay. Best of luck. Thanks all. And congrats, Scott, a fantastic run, really exceptional. So thank you all. Best of luck. Scott Santi : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tami Zakaria from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Tami Zakaria : Hi. Good morning. Thank you so much. So my first question is, I wanted to understand the operating margin expansion a bit better, 200 basis points, enterprise initiative 140, price/cost 210. So what was the drag to get to the 200 basis points expansion. I remember you were investing in labor and compensation this year. Is that still there? And when do you expect that to taper off, especially as you look into 2024? Michael Larsen : Yes. Good morning, Tami. So you're right. If you look at the margin improvement year-over-year, another really strong contribution from Enterprise Industries. I think the best performance in 2.5 years, which is really remarkable given where we're at in the enterprise strategy. Price/cost, we talked about 210, and then 160 basis points of, I don't want to call it headwind necessarily because these are investments that we're making in our long-term organic growth initiatives, including new hires as well as then, obviously, the regular wage and benefit inflation that everybody else is seeing. That all adds up to about 160 basis points. And that's how you get to -- even with all of those investments, that we continue to make, you're getting 200 basis points of margin improvement on a year-over-year basis to 26.5%, which I believe was a new record for the third quarter. Tami Zakaria : Does that 150 basis points headwind continue in the fourth quarter and maybe in the next several quarters, how should we think about that headwind? Michael Larsen : Yes, I think the normal run rate is somewhere -- we've been running higher than that this year. The normal run rate and we'll see how the plans roll up for next year. I don't want to get too far ahead of myself. But if you look at historically, that's about 100 to 150 basis points of headwind. Tami Zakaria : Got it. Can I ask one more quick one? The $0.12 headwind from the auto strike you're calling out for the fourth quarter. Does that assume the strike continues through the end of the quarter? And what does that mean in terms of organic growth headwind for the fourth quarter? Michael Larsen : Yes. So Tami, let me just broaden the lens maybe a little bit here. I think given the uncertainty around auto and the fact that the strike is now in the sixth week here, we decided that we take a more prudent approach, which is basically based on what we're seeing in our businesses right now, maybe with room for things deteriorating a little bit further from where they are today. And if you take that quarter-to-date impact and extrapolate through year-end, that's how you get the $0.12 of EPS adjustment that's now embedded in our guidance. So assuming -- to answer your question, it continues through year-end. If the strike ends before year-end, obviously, we'll do better than that. If it gets worse, our businesses will do a great job in terms of reading and reacting to the conditions on the ground. The optimist might say that some of those -- that production will get deferred into next year. But obviously, a lot of uncertainty, and given that we don't really want to pin down a revenue number, we're just going to give you here the $0.12 of adjustment that I just laid out for you. Tami Zakaria : Great. Thank you, so much. Michael Larsen : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Andrew Obin : Yes, good morning. Michael Larsen : Good morning. Andrew Obin : So question, I think before you were talking about sort of 25% of the portfolio slowing structure over the past couple of quarters. Have any of those markets bottom like electronics? And have any new markets started to slow? Or is it the same 25%? Just how do you look at the world? Michael Larsen : Hi Andrew, so there's definitely some puts and takes. I think, for example, if you had asked me that question last quarter, I would have said automotive OEM -- automotive aftermarket would be in that category. They were up 10%. So just an example of things moving in and out. So I'm not sure it's really that relevant to look at. But if you just look at what we would say now is kind of slowing to 25% on a combined basis, those businesses were down year-over-year, 3% in the third quarter. However, sequentially, they did improve from the second quarter by a percentage point, which I would say fairly stable. Talking about electronics and semi specifically, I think consumer electronics remains fairly weak. On the semiconductor side, you will recall that we've talked about an expectation from industry experts, I'll call them as well as our customers that there would be a reacceleration of demand here in the second half of this year. And that now looks like it's been deferred probably until sometime next year. Now obviously, we remain, as we now do on an ongoing basis, committed to those businesses. We continue to invest and really position ourselves for the inevitable recovery down the road, which hopefully comes next year in 2024 and making sure that we're well positioned to take full advantage of the long-term growth opportunities that we believe are right in front of us in that part of our businesses, so. Andrew Obin : Got you. And then maybe you've answered this question as you talked about the business overall, but in Construction Products and Polymers & Fluids, the changes in variable margin cost was a material benefit to margin year-over-year and has been year-to-date. Anything specific that you're doing in these businesses and how much more runway is there? Michael Larsen : Well, there's a lot of work that's going on in those businesses to deliver these results. Obviously, I'd say the categories you're familiar with, the first one is the ongoing contribution from the enterprise initiatives. And so both the segments that you mentioned had a significant contribution from enterprise initiatives as well as favorable price/cost impact. So those are really the two big drivers in those businesses. And I think it is pretty remarkable that they're putting up record quarterly margin performance given, frankly, not a lot of volume growth, not a lot of volume leverage. So you can imagine once we get the volume leverage going again, as Chris was talking about at incrementals kind of in that 35 to 40 range, there's even more runway for margin improvement. Andrew Obin : Thank you so much. Michael Larsen : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Steven Fisher : Thanks. Good morning, and congratulations, Scott. Within the Welding segment, it seemed like the year-over-year was a little weaker on the industrial side relative to last quarter and maybe a little better on the commercial. Is that something that you're projecting at least in the near term? And to what extent is there a margin mix difference between those two subsegments that you could be aware of? Michael Larsen : So there's not a lot of difference in terms of the margin performance. But I think this is -- these are some great data points that illustrate kind of the dynamic nature of the environment that we're operating in. And really, what I tried to lay out in the commentary was what's driving this on a year-over-year basis are just a comparison. So it's really hard to draw any conclusions from the year-over-year comparisons. What I think we can say broadly in Welding, as we said upfront, is that the overall demand for equipment appears to be slowing down a little bit in the near term, whether that will remain at those levels on a go-forward basis is difficult to say at this point. Backlogs have normalized. We're not really a backlog-driven company. We're now back to two to three weeks of backlog at the enterprise level. And then the last point I'll make is we're still seeing meaningful impact from our customers and channel partners reducing their levels of inventory. So if you think about at the enterprise level, that was a point to 1.5 points of organic growth drag. So just to maybe normalize the Q3 results a little bit on the top line. So 2% on an equal days basis, and then you factor in the inventory adjustments, you're back at 3, 3.5 just to kind of put things in context a little bit. But there's no question that the activity slowed down a little bit on the welding side here in the third quarter. Steven Fisher : Okay, that's helpful. And then when would you get an idea of how your price versus cost is going to shape up for 2024? I'm getting the sense broadly in industrial it is going to be pretty tight. Would you agree with that? And is that something you can sort of 80/20 to kind of tilted in your favor? Michael Larsen : Well, so we haven't even rolled up our plans yet for next year. That really happens at the end of this month, and then we'll have some good discussions with our segments and we'll get a much better handle on what the price/cost equation might look like. I do think if you just look at the margin recovery trajectory that we're on. We haven't fully recovered the margin impact. And so I think it's not unreasonable to assume that there will be some carryover into maybe the first half of next year. And then you add on top of that maybe our normal pricing. But again, I don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves. We'll give you a lot more detail when we give you guidance for the full year, which will be early next year. But certainly, if you're -- price is holding at current levels and the raw material cost -- direct material cost equation, those has stabilized. We're not seeing significant deflation at this point, but we're also not seeing anything close to the inflation that we've seen over the last two years. So, that's kind of the good news here. Steven Fisher : Thanks. I appreciate the thoughts. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Thank you. Good morning. Maybe one area was interested in was Test & Measurement and Electronics. Also, in light of sort of progress on the integration of the acquisition, how that's gone as it's been in the portfolio several quarters now? And also just on the base business, very mixed to reads some of various peers in that market. Any color you could give us or kind of expectations for Q4 on Electronics versus, say, Test & Measurement within that, please? Michael Larsen : Yes. So, Julian, we don't give quarterly guidance. But I think if you look at historical information, you'll see that there's typically a ramp-up in Test & Measurement and Electronics in Q4 relative to Q3. And so we do expect some of that. I think overall, on the Electronics side, like I said, the consumer electronics end market remains soft. Just semi in isolation is down 20%, 25% on a year-over-year basis. And that's -- last year, that was about a $500 million segment. So, we're definitely seeing -- that's what's driving these results. If you take out the semi impact in Test & Measurement and Electronics we're actually up 2% on a year-over-year basis. But we expect this pressure to continue. We're not counting on a recovery here in the fourth quarter. It's based on run rate and typical seasonality I'd say on MTS overall, maybe, Chris, do you want to make some comments? You were just up there. So, maybe you want to-- ChristopherO'Herlihy: Yes. So, I would say, Julian, that certainly the assumptions we made when we acquired the MTS business in terms of strategic fit and financial rationale have been very much validated by our two years of owning the business. The business has performed very well. We are currently in the process of implementing our business model. We're already starting to see some real nice results accruing from that. But we strongly feel this is going to be a very, very successful ITW acquisition. In fact, we are taking our Board of Directors up to MTS later this week for them to witness firsthand the level of progress that we've made on the integration in terms of implementing our business model. But like I say, two years in, so far so good. Great people, great brands, great technology, great opportunity to improve the business model, and like I said, this is going to be a great ITW business in the long term. Michael Larsen : Yes. And I would just add maybe to quantify what Chris is talking about in the short term. This business grew double-digit top line in the third quarter. And you'll recall maybe margins coming in were somewhere around 7%. And through the implementation of the business model, at this point, we are -- the outlook for the full year is in the mid-teens. So right on track in terms of the potential that we thought we had when we acquired the business. So good progress. Julian Mitchell : That's helpful. Thank you. And good to hear on MTS. Maybe just a broader question, perhaps amidst the sort of the CEO transition that was announced and congratulations to both Scott and Chris. But maybe on the sort of thinking about the top line a little bit and it looks like maybe some of the share gains that ITW had enjoyed just after COVID maybe have eased to-date or eased in the last 12 months or so. I realize there's some destocking noise in various channels and so looking at market share in that context may not be that helpful. But just wanted sort of perspectives on market share across the larger ITW businesses and whether there's perhaps a need to redeploy a greater share of enterprise initiatives or price/cost savings into sort of organic reinvestment in the base business? Michael Larsen : Yes. Maybe I'll start and then, Chris, you can jump in. I think I'll start by saying we completely disagree with the premise that we are not gaining market share. Recognizing that it may be difficult for you looking in from the outside to decipher those market share gains on an annual basis, but if you go to every one of our divisions, they will have a very clear picture, all 84 of them in terms of what market growth is and what their growth rate is and what their competitors are growing at. And in all cases, we would say that given our competitive advantages that we derive from the business model in terms of our customer-facing metrics, in terms of our -- the value add that our customers are getting from buying our products, we're continuing to gain share in the markets that we're focused on. And in some cases, you're able to look at public company peers you can peel back the onion a little bit. And if you do that work -- if you were to do that work, Julian you'll see that we are gaining market share in the areas that we are focused on. And I might just add, not only are we gaining market share, but I'll just note the margin performance of our businesses relative to our competitors which typically we are running at two, three times, our competitors, and you can look at Food Equipment and Lincoln and the Welding side, for example, and you'll see that, that is the case. But maybe, Chris, if you want to comment a little bit? Christopher O'Herlihy: Yes, I would echo everything Michael just said in terms of the quality of our portfolio, in terms of the amount of room we have to grow in each segment customer-facing performance and so on and the focused investments that we've made in areas like sales and innovation, coupled with the fact that we've seen a nicely improving yield on customer-back innovation. All this gives the credence to what we're hearing from our businesses that we are getting share in most of our key markets in relation to our competition. Julian Mitchell : That's great. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Mig Dobre from Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Mig Dobre : Yes. Thank you. Good morning and congrats to Scott and Chris. Just a quick question on construction. In your comments, you mentioned that the resi renovation channel has done doing quite well. Maybe a little more color there. Is that a function of new products or anything going on in the channel? I just found that to be a little bit surprising given where productivity and interest rates and all of that seems to be? Michael Larsen : Yes. So again, Mig, you're right. This is on the residential renovation remodel side of things. So these are typically sales through big box retailers, names that you'd be familiar with. And I think if you look at I think somebody asked earlier about market share, this is a great example of really strong market share gains in this particular end market, because I agree with you, if you just look at the underlying data, you might be a little surprised that, that part of the business is up 7% year-over-year in the current interest rate environment. And like I said, this is essentially all volume and share gain through the big box retailers. Mig Dobre : And presumably, that has some staying power beyond this quarter? Michael Larsen : Well, I think that overall construction in North America actually remains fairly stable. I'd say maybe a little bit more concern on the international side, which has been weak. The market demand has been a lot softer on the international side. But North America \u2013 keep in mind that in the fourth quarter, typically, we talked about seasonality by segment, I said Test & Measurement usually does better. Construction is one where, for obvious reasons, the fourth quarter is typically a little bit lower than the third quarter. But in terms of the share gains and our \u2013 the strength in this particular part of the business, that absolutely has staying power. Mig Dobre : Great. Then my follow-up, maybe on Food Equipment. I'm curious as to how the supply chain has sort of evolved for you here and where your lead times are? I know you've got a number of verticals within this segment, but some context there would be helpful. And also, where are you from a backlog perspective? Are you seeing any sort of noise in the channel around destocking? Or is the segment perhaps less impacted than others? Thanks. Michael Larsen : So Mig, just from a lead time perspective, I would say that a natural outcome of our business model is best-in-class lead times and customer-facing performance. And we are very much back to where we were pre-pandemic in terms of our ability to supply our customers. In terms of the channel, yes, I think it's an area where there is a little bit of inventory in the channel. We're seeing that coming down. It's probably still out there. It's one of the segments that has been impacted, I think, by channel inventory likely to come down over the next couple of quarters here, but it's fair for sure. Christopher O'Herlihy: Yes. And then just on the backlog, we're back to normal levels which, in our case, given our customer delivery performance is two to three weeks. So we're back to kind of normal levels here. Mig Dobre : All right. Appreciate it. Thank you. Michael Larsen : Right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Joe O'Dea: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats to both Scott and Chris. I guess, I wanted to stay on that topic in terms of the channel inventory normalization it is something you talked about last quarter. I think size is pretty similarly last quarter. And so the question is just any changes that you've seen from kind of June, July into where we are now in terms of the trends on some of that inventory rationalization, whether regions, end-markets, pace of it or if it's all kind of trending in line with expectations as of a couple of months ago? Michael Larsen : I'd say this is trending right in line with expectations that we kind of laid out on the last call. Like I said, the drag on the organic growth rate of 1% to 1.5% was pretty broad-based, every segment had some impact, very similar Q3 as Q2, and we think this will probably be with us for a few more quarters. And I'd just say, if you just look at our own inventory levels, we are currently running slightly above three months on hand, where typically we're running at low-twos. And we estimate that in our case, it will take us probably until kind of early mid next year to get back to normal inventory levels as we work through the exact same things that our customers and channel partners are working through. And I might just add here that that's obviously going to continue to drive some really strong free cash flow performance for ITW as inventory levels, working capital continues to normalize, as a result of supply chain having stabilized. Joe O'Dea: And then, how does that kind of compare, relate to some of what you're seeing from your customers right now, I think, in the prepared remarks, you talked about maybe a little bit of slower kind of CapEx demand trends out of your customers. What you're seeing in sort of test and measurement or welding and the degree to what you're hearing from customers is this is more inventory related or if it's something that's a little bit of a pause that's more maybe macro uncertainty related? Michael Larsen : I think it's really hard to tell. I mean, I think overall, the demand environment, as we said there's, clearly some uncertainties here in the near-term. Inventory as part of that, the interest rate environment, everybody being maybe a little bit more cautious on the CapEx side and then in of our segments, particularly, the auto strike. So there's, a lot of things going on here. It is a pretty dynamic environment, it can change pretty quickly. The only thing we know for sure is that, the ITW team will continue to read and react to whatever conditions are on the ground. And I think if you just look at our track record, we'll continue to deliver differentiated long-term performance. And so that's really our focus is on continuing to do just that. Joe O'Dea: Understood. Thank you. Michael Larsen : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for participating in today's conference call. All lines may disconnect at this time. Have a wonderful day.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the ITW Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Karen Fletcher, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. Karen Fletcher : Thank you, Eric. Good morning, and welcome to ITW's fourth quarter 2023 conference call. I'm joined by our President and CEO, Chris O'Herlihy; and Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen. Also with us today is Erin Linnihan who joined our Investor Relations team last month as Vice President. Erin, welcome to ITW. During today's call, we'll discuss ITW's fourth quarter and full-year 2023 financial results and provide guidance for full-year 2024. Slide 2 is a reminder that this presentation contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the Company's 2022 Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. This presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release. Please turn to Slide 3, and it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Chris O'Herlihy. Christopher O'Herlihy: Thank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. In Q4, we delivered a solid finish to a year of high quality execution and face some pretty unique challenges, including slowing demand for CapEx, headwinds from customer and channel inventory reductions and an automotive industry strike. As a result, organic growth was essentially flat in the fourth quarter. Operating margin came in at 24.8% with 150 basis point contribution from enterprise initiatives and free cash flow grew almost 40%. GAAP EPS of $2.38 included $0.04 of unfavorable impact from the devaluation of the Argentine currency. Throughout 2023, the ITW team continued to leverage the strength and resilience of the business model and our high quality diversified business portfolio to deliver a year of strong operational and financial performance, including solid organic growth of 2% on top of 12% growth in both 2021 and 2022. Operating margin of 25.1% and an improvement year-over-year of 130 basis points. Income growth of 7% to a record $4 billion, after-tax ROIC of more than 30%, 50% plus free cash flow growth and GAAP EPS of $9.74. We delivered these results while investing almost $800 million to sustain productivity and accelerate our organic growth initiatives in our highly profitable core businesses. As we outlined at our Investor Day, our key strategic priority as we enter this next phase of our enterprise strategy in 2024 is to build above market organic growth fueled by customer-back innovation into defining ITW strength on par with our world class financial and operational capabilities. Turning now to our 2024 guidance. We are encouraged by what we are seeing in terms of demand across the majority of our portfolio, along with some meaningful improvements in both customer and channel partner inventory levels and input cost inflation, as well as continued progress on customer-back innovation. For our usual process, our organic growth projection for 2024 of 1% to 3%, and our EPS guidance of $10.20 at the midpoint, reflect current levels of demand adjusted for seasonality. Operating margin is projected to improve by about a 100 basis points at the midpoint to a range of 25.5% to 26.5%. This includes another solid contribution of approximately a 100 basis points from enterprise initiatives. Before I turn the call over to Michael to provide more detail on the quarter and full-year performance as well as our guidance for 2024, I want to thank my ITW colleagues around the world. Their extraordinary dedication and commitment to serving our customers and executing our strategy with excellence and for their incredible support as I transition into the CEO role. Michael? Michael Larsen : Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. In Q4, the ITW team delivered a solid finish operationally and financially to a strong year for the company. Starting with the topline, the soft market demand for CapEx that we talked about on our Q3 earnings call continued into the fourth quarter. In addition, customer and channel inventory reductions and the automotive industry strike reduced our organic growth rate by approximately 1.5%, resulting in essentially Fed revenue and organic growth on a year-over-year basis. That said, we finished the year with stable to slightly improving demand on a sales per day basis, as evidenced by sequential revenue growth of plus 2.5% from Q3 into Q4 compared to our historical sequential growth of plus 1.5%. Foreign currency translation added 1.2% to revenue and divestitures reduced revenue by 0.4%. GAAP EPS was $2.38 and included $0.04 impact from the devaluation of the Argentine currency. On the bottom line, operating income was a Q4 record of $988 million and operating margin was flat year-over-year as enterprise initiatives of 150 basis points and 60 basis points of price, cost, margin benefit, net of year-over-year inventory revaluations were offset by a combination of growth investments including headcount ads, higher employee-related costs, such as wages and benefits, as well as increased restructuring expenses year-over-year. Free cash flow grew 39% to a fourth quarter record of 908 million with a conversion to net income of 127%. Overall for Q4, solid operational execution and financial performance in a pretty challenging environment. Please turn to Slide 4, starting with one of the highlights for Q4 and the year. Our free cash flow performance on the left side of the page. And as you can see, our full-year free cash flow was up more than a $1 billion to a record $3.1 billion as our inventory months on hand metric continued its slide path to pre-COVID levels. Now let's move to the segment results starting with automotive OEM, which led the way with organic growth of 8%, despite North America being down 9% due to the impact of the automotive strike. Meanwhile, Europe's organic growth rate was plus 11%, and China was up 31% driven by strong market share and penetration gains in the rapidly growing EV market. Operating margin was 19.2% excluding 160 basis points of headwind from higher 80/20 front-to-back restructuring expenses as the automotive OEM team continues to work toward its margin goal in the low to mid-20s over the next two to three years as outlined at our Investor Day. Looking forward, we expect automotive OEM to grow 3% to 5% in 2024, based on an assumption of essentially flat global auto bills year-over-year, plus our typical penetration gains of 2% to 3% and continued above market organic growth in China. Turn to Slide 5. Food equipment delivered organic growth of 3% against a tough comparison of plus 17% in Q4 last year. Equipment grew 1% and service was very strong, up 7% for the quarter. By region, North America grew 4% with institutional end markets up in the mid-teens, retail up mid-single digits and restaurants down in the high-single digits. Europe and Asia Pacific both grew 1%. Test and measurement and electronics, organic revenue was down 1% due to continued softness in semiconductor-related end markets. While test and measurement grew 5%, electronics declined 14%. Moving on to Slide 6. Slower demand in welding resulted in an organic revenue decline of 7%. Equipment was down 8% and consumables were down 6%. Industrial sales declined 11% versus a tough comparison of plus 23%. Commercial was down 2% and oil and gas was down 3%. Overall, North America was down 7% and international was down 6%. Polymers & Fluids, organic revenue declined 2% with our automotive aftermarket down 3%, Polymers grew 6% and Fluids was down 7%. Operating margin expanded 270 basis points to an all-time high of 28.5% for the segment. Turning to Slide 7. In a tough housing market, construction products, organic revenue declined 4% as North America was essentially flat with residential renovation flat and commercial construction up 3%. International markets have been soft all year and in the fourth quarter, Europe was down 9% and Australia, New Zealand was down 5%. Specialty products, organic revenue was down 5% as North America was down 6% and international declined 5%. Consumables were down 10% and equipment revenue grew 8%. Moving to Slide 8 and full-year 2023 results. And as Chris said, throughout the year, our colleagues around the world did an exceptional job of delivering for our customers and responding decisively to a challenging and volatile market demand environment. As a result of their efforts, ITW delivered record financial performance in 2023 with solid organic growth of 2% on top of 12% growth in both 2021 and 2022. Best-in-class margins of more than 25% and after-tax return on invested capital of more than 30%. And we delivered these results while continuing to fully fund projects to accelerate above market organic growth and sustain productivity in our highly profitable core businesses. We raised our dividend 7% and return more than $3 billion of shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Let's move to Slide 9 and our guidance for full-year 2024. And looking ahead, we definitely see some positives in terms of moderating headwinds in the external environment from supply chain, input cost inflation, and customer channel partner inventory reductions. But there are certainly some challenges, including lower automotive bills that I talked about earlier for example. For our usual process, our topline guidance of revenue growth of 2% to 4%, an organic growth of 1% to 3% is based on current levels of demand adjusted for typical seasonality and incorporate current foreign exchange rates. Operating margin is expected to improve by about a 100 basis points to a range of 25.5% to 26.5%, which includes a 100 basis points contribution from our enterprise initiatives. After-tax return on invested capital is expected to remain firmly at 30% plus, and we expect strong free cash flows again with conversion greater than net income. For 2024, we are projecting GAAP EPS in the range of $10 to $10.40, which includes headwinds of about $0.10 of higher interest expense and $0.20 of higher income tax expense with an expected tax rate in the range of 24% to 24.5%. In terms of cadence for the year, we expect our typical first half, second half EPS split of 49% and 51%. Our capital allocation plans for 2024 are consistent with our longstanding disciplined capital allocation framework that we discussed at last year's Investor Day. Our top priority remains internal investments to support the organic growth initiatives associated with the next phase of the enterprise strategy and sustained productivity in our highly profitable core businesses. Second priority is an attractive dividend that grows in line with earnings over time, which remains a critical component of ITW's total shareholder return model. Third, selective high quality acquisitions that enhance ITW's long-term profitable growth potential, have significant margin improvement opportunity from the application of our proprietary and powerful 80/20 front to back methodology and can generate acceptable risk adjusted returns on our shareholders' capital. And finally, ITW's surplus capital is allocated to an active share repurchase program as we plan to buy back $1.5 billion of our own shares in 2024.  Turn to our last slide, Slide 10 for our 2024 organic growth projections by segment. And as you can see, five of seven segments combined are projecting organic growth of approximately 4% at the midpoint, partially offset by some unique challenges in construction and specialty products. These segment projections are the outcome of the bottom up planning process that we completed in January, and a combination of several factors including current levels of demand, deep underground market and customer insights from our divisions, market share gain expectations, and the growing contribution from our customer-back innovation efforts and the associated new product launches in every one of our divisions. Consistent with ITWs continuous improvement, never satisfied mindset, every segment is projecting to improve their operating margin performance again in 2024 with another solid contribution from enterprise initiatives across the Board. So overall, we are heading into the first year of our next phase enterprise strategy, well positioned to continue to outperform in whatever economic conditions emerge as we move through 2024. With that, Karen, I'll turn it back to you. Karen Fletcher : Okay. Thank you, Michael. Eric, can you please open up the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tami Zakaria with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tami Zakaria : Hello. Good morning. Thank you so much. So my first question is, when we look at the annual guide, organic growth guide for 2024 for each segment, how should we think about these segment growth rates for the first quarter? Should it be similar to the annual guide, or do you expect any deviation from that in the first quarter and then maybe improvement throughout the year? Michael Larsen : Well, I think, you'll see improvement in the year-over-year organic growth rates as the comparisons get easier as we move through the year. But by and large, the projections here track kind of typical seasonality from Q4 into Q1 and so forth. So there's really nothing unusual there. The other thing to keep in mind is while the guidance at the enterprise level is essentially based on current run rates as we talked about. It's a much more granular projection at the segment level, which includes also significant contribution again from new products as well as our normal pricing less drag from the inventory reduction that we've been talking about really all year. And so really give a better kind of number as we look at the segments. So that's how I would think about it. Tami Zakaria : Got it. That's very helpful. And then it seems like the inside incremental margin for the year is in the 60% to 70% range, probably in the high 60 if my math is right versus normally 35% to 40%. So what's really driving this? Any specific segment you want to call up that may drive this overall high incremental for the year? Michael Larsen : Yes. I think Tami, we've got fairly modest kind of revenue growth that we're calling for here, 1% to 3%. And our incremental margins embedded in the guidance are higher than our typical long-term 35% to 40%, which is what I would still use in terms of long-term modeling. The reason why is a 100 basis points contribution from enterprise initiatives that give us a higher incremental margin in 2024. As part of our planning process that I just described, we've now had a chance to go through all the projects and activities that contribute to a 100 basis points of enterprise initiatives, again in 2024. And I might add, these are largely independent of volume. So regardless of what volume does, we're seeing another significant contribution here, which is certainly a nice thing to have in your hip pocket in what we would describe still as a fairly uncertain and volatile environment. Tami Zakaria : Got it. Thank you so much. Michael Larsen : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Volkmann with Jefferies. Your line is open. Stephen Volkmann : Great. Good morning, everybody. I actually wanted to ask \u2013 excuse me \u2013 I wanted to ask the margin question a little bit differently, Michael, because if you have a 100 basis points from enterprise, and that's kind of the total that we're looking for, I suppose there must be some offsets in maybe some other costs or something because we're not really getting underlying incrementals. We're sort of getting it all from the enterprise initiatives, if you follow me. So just any detail on that would be great. Michael Larsen : Yes. So I think the math is actually pretty simple for 2024. So we've got some volume leverage at that 2% to 4% revenue growth, maybe just round numbers, maybe that's about 50 basis points. The enterprise initiatives add about a 100 basis points. We're entering into what we would describe as a normal price cost environment at this point. And so there's like a modest positive contribution from our price cost efforts. And then the offset is really our continued investments in growth, including some headcount, some employee-related cost, wages and benefits, even though those costs are moderating in 2023 that's still is approximately a 100 basis points of headwind, which then gets us to that midpoint of 26% in 2024. And I might add, well, on our way to our 30% target here by 2030 that we talked about at Investor Day. Stephen Volkmann : Super. Okay. Thanks for filling that in. And then maybe if I could just follow-up, the food guide, the bottoms up food sort of outlook of 3% to 5% seems like a bit of an acceleration from sort of recent trends, and we don't have super easy comps, I don't think. So what are you seeing in that end market? Christopher O'Herlihy: Yes. Sure, Steve. So on Food Equipment, projecting 3% to 5% growth next year, really on the back of a few different aspects. Firstly, as always, with Food Equipment, it's a very fertile environment for innovation. So we see several new product launches across all product categories. We would expect less channel destocking Food Equipment in 2024. And also I would say we have a continued recovery in service. As I think, service is about one-third of our revenues in food. We're the only major manufacturer with that captive service business and service is a business that's still in recovery pretty much from COVID, equipment has recovered, but we will see probably the final year of recovery in service in 2024, and all that is adding up to a 3% to 5% growth rate in food next year. Stephen Volkmann : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is open. Andrew Kaplowitz : Good morning, everyone. Christopher O'Herlihy: Good morning. Andrew Kaplowitz : Michael, when we look at your 1% to 3% organic growth forecast for 2024, you have a nice acceleration dialed into for your CapEx businesses such as welding and T&M. You're saying you're basing your guidance and current run rates. So you obviously did mention some improvement in sequential demand in Q4. Could you give us more color on what you're seeing in these CapEx businesses that's allowing you to forecast what you're forecasting? I would imagine you're dialing an improvements in semicon and electronics, for instance, in T&M, but that goes into now what you usually do. I'm just curious as to what's flushing out. Michael Larsen : Well, I think, like we've said, really most of the year we've seen some slowing in demand for CapEx and certainly in Q3 and Q4. I think as we go into 2024, as Chris just said, we've got less headwind from these customer and channel partner inventory reductions that were drag of about 1% in 2023. We have a meaningful contribution and increased contribution from new products, given all the efforts around customer-back innovation that we're driving. And then we have normal pricing, and you put all of that together and just based on, I think as you point out, it was encouraging that we saw a pickup in the sequential revenue per day from Q3 to Q4, that I think tells you that there's certainly some stability here and some of the headwinds I just described are maybe mostly behind us. We expect still a little bit of headwind from these inventory reductions as we go through the first half of the year. I think of it \u2013 we're working through our own inventory levels here and we expect to reduce our inventories in the first half. We think our customers and channel partners maybe doing some of the same, but it'll be less of a headwind here in 2024. So you put all of that together, I think you're an environment where things are pretty stable. Test and measurement you mentioned semi, it's less than 3% of our revenues. There is an expectation of a modest market pickup here in the second half. We expect to gain share and launch new products in this space. So we'll grow a little bit faster than market there. But overall, we're not expecting a big recovery in demand or the economy to pick up in the second half. This is basically based on kind of current run rates. The one outlier I'll just reiterate is automotive, we're going from a build environment in 2023, that was up in the high-single digits. We expect that to be about flat. And so the growth in automotive is all from penetration gains and continued market share and innovation in China which has been an incredible contributor to our overall growth rate and will remain so for the foreseeable future. Andrew Kaplowitz : Very helpful color, Michael. And then Chris or Michael, you mentioned unique challenges in specialty equipment and construction products. Maybe you could elaborate on what you're seeing in these segments. Doing more PLS in specialty, for example, what's the outlook or frame the outlook for 2024? Christopher O'Herlihy: Yes. That's correct, Andy. In terms of specialty particularly, we're doing some strategic portfolio work there heavier, I would say amount of product line pruning than we normally expect in a normal maintenance environment. We're doing quite a bit more on specialty really to position that segment for long-term growth of 4% plus. So that's what's going on there, and we're pretty pleased with the progress around that. On construction, it is very much a market story. I mean, obviously, all three main markets for us, North America, Western Europe, and Australia and New Zealand are all forecasting significantly declines in housing bills next year, that will be 11% in North America, mid-single digits in Europe and high-single digits in A and Z. So that's really what's impacting the construction business. Andrew Kaplowitz : Helpful, guys. Thank you. Christopher O'Herlihy: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Joseph O'Dea: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Christopher O'Herlihy: Good morning. Yes. Joseph O'Dea: So I mean, you talked about the daily sales rate from Q3 to Q4. It sounds like overall customer tone is perhaps getting a little bit better. You're talking about adding some headcount. Can you just expand a little bit on customer conversations over the last several months to understand a little bit better sort of the verticals where you see some of that uptick happening, and then where you are adding headcount within the business? Michael Larsen : Yes. I mean, I think the tone from customers has been pretty cautious all year, particularly on the CapEx side of things as we talked about. If you go back to our Investor Day last year, we talked a lot about accelerating our efforts to drive high quality above market organic growth primarily fueled by, as Chris said earlier, our customer-back innovation efforts. And so those are the areas, all growth related headcount ads that we're making to make sure that we have all the capability we need in terms of innovation, commercial, sales and marketing resources to drive continued progress and deliver on our above market organic growth commitments. Joseph O'Dea: Got it. And then on the channel inventory side of things, can you just talk about the visibility that you have and any context on how maybe elevated those inventory levels got during supply chain constraints? Where you think they are now relative to normal? It sounds like you think first half of this year you could still see customers doing a little bit of work to trim inventories. Michael Larsen : Yes. I think by and large, if you go back historically, we haven't had great visibility to the levels of inventory in the channel and with our customers. I think we have much better visibility today, given that we've been talking about it all year. Overall, it's been a drag of a percentage point on our growth rate for the year. It was 1.5% in Q3, 1% in Q4, and I think several of our segments, we are back to kind of normal inventory levels and this is largely behind us. And then there's maybe a few other areas where there might be some continued, but certainly less headwind as we go into Q1 and Q2. And then I think at that point, we'll give you an update. I think we'll be able to say this is now completely behind us. Joseph O'Dea: And so with respect to the growth outlook that there's no real inventory \u2013 notable inventory headwind within that growth range? Michael Larsen : Well, there's a little bit. I mean, obviously if you look at our run rates, it is included in our run rates at a higher level than what we might reasonably expect. So if that plays out the way we expect, that would be certainly favorable to the run rate and to the guidance that we just gave you. Joseph O'Dea: Understood. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Your line is open. Sabrina: Hey, good morning. You have Sabrina Abrams on for Andrew Obin. Michael Larsen : Hey, Sabrina. Sabrina: As we think about pricing into 2024, are there any segments or any particular businesses where on the margin you're seeing more competition and pricing competition as cost moderate? Michael Larsen : Well, I think, Sabrina, we've talked about this before, we want to maintain our price premium based on the quality and the customer service, the lead times that ITW is uniquely positioned to provide, but we also want to compete and we want to gain market share. That's kind of central to our overall enterprise strategy and the focus I just talked about around organic growth. So that's said, I think we expect a normal contribution from price here in 2024. These inflation-driven price increases are now behind us. Input cost inflation, that big wave we've been dealing with, as we sit here today, we'd say is largely behind us. And so we're entering into a normal pricing environment across the portfolio. I think that is a fair statement. If you just look at, we've now essentially recovered the margin impact from that price costs, the price cost dynamics, and we're entering into a normal environment in 2024. Sabrina: Thanks. And then as a follow-up on welding, what is driving the reacceleration in growth there from down 6% in 4Q? And how are you thinking about margins in the segment in 2024 given where you're exiting the year and the sort of margins you reported in 2023 here? Christopher O'Herlihy: Well, I think welding, so we're not counting on a market acceleration, just to be clear. This is if you look at in a normal market environment, just assume for a minute, let's assume the market is flat. The contribution from new products and normal price very quickly gets you to something in the low-single digits. So I just want to be clear around that. The other thing I'd say, just on the margins. We talked a little about the year-over-year inventory revaluations. That's what caused the margins to drop in the fourth quarter, below 30%. And we expect that to be back above 30% here in the first quarter as that one-time kind of year-over-year inventory impact is behind us. So we would expect margins to kind of remain in that 30% plus as we go through 2024. And as I said earlier, that's not unusual. Every one of our segments told us as part of this bottom up planning process that they are on target to improve their operating margin performance in 2024. Sabrina: Thanks. I'll pass it on. Christopher O'Herlihy: Yes. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS. Your line is open. Steven Fisher : Well, thanks. Good morning. Christopher O'Herlihy: Good morning. Steven Fisher : This has been asked in a few ways about the segments, but really just trying to think about the 1% to 3% organic growth in the context of your sort of 4% to 7% CAGR through 2030. I guess what's the buildup of market growth and price versus market penetration and customer-back innovation? I know again, there's lots of different segment dynamics here, but when you roll it all up, are you basically assuming that it is kind of like flat markets and a couple of points of penetration and innovation. Is that the way to think about it? Christopher O'Herlihy: Yes. I think it is. I mean, as we say, in our four to seven calculus that we outlined at our Investor Day, you have a contribution from market \u2013 contribution from market penetration, and the largest contribution is actually from customer-back innovation. And that's what we're seeing here in 2024 really across most of our businesses. As we used to think about growth, 2% growth last year on top of 2021 \u2013 or 12% growth in 2021 and 2022 and targeting 1% to 3% here on the path to four plus, is kind of how are outlining this. And I would say that it's a target and a goal that we're very confident on the basis that it's where the bulk of our divisions are spending their time. We're making progress, certainly more to do, but given the portfolio, given the fact that we've got plenty of room to grow in each segment, given the investments that Michael has been talking about that we've been making now for quite a few years in strategic marketing and innovation. We're really putting ourselves and building the muscle here to get into a position where we will grow 4% plus over the entirety of this next phase. And I think in terms of just capability build, if you think about this in the way that \u2013 the way we leaned into front to back 80/20 in the last phase of our strategy, that's the way we're leaning into innovation in the next phase of our strategy. The same level of rigor, scope, and capability building that we applied to front to back 80/20 in the first phase. We are now applying to customer-back innovation here in this next phase. And I would say we're very encouraged by the progress that we've seen on innovation over the last couple of years. It was a 1% contributor five years ago. It's now a 2% contributor on its way to 3% and beyond. And again, very encouraged by the progress that we're seeing across many of our divisions in terms of the qualitative work they're doing on innovation, but also in terms of the quality of the innovation pipeline across all seven segments. Steven Fisher : That's really helpful. And just to follow-up, sort of the macro level of the pace of economic growth seems to be diverging between Europe and North America increasingly. So can you just give us a sense of what you've factored in on the European economy and how you're thinking about that? I know you talked about the construction side, and I guess similarly on China, how are you thinking about China in 2024 sort of a net positive for you, I think in 2023, maybe different for some other companies. So how are you thinking about that in 2024? Christopher O'Herlihy: Yes. I think in our overall guidance here of 1% to 3% organic, that's where you'll find all the major geographies. So North America, in that low single-digit, 1% to 3% range. And Europe kind of similar to North America, definitely we've seen some challenges on the construction side as you pointed out, but kind of you put it all together, it's in that one to three range. And then the China is more positive, but that's really driven by the automotive business, which is more than half of our revenues in China. So we expect another double-digit type growth for the auto business in China. And that takes China to kind of the mid single-digit range in 2024. Steven Fisher : Really helpful. Thank you so much. Christopher O'Herlihy: Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Thanks very much and good morning. Christopher O'Herlihy: Good morning. Julian Mitchell : Maybe \u2013 and apologies if I'm somewhat retreading some worn ground already, but just trying to understand on the revenue outlook again, because it sounds like you had suffered from some destocking in 2023. You're assuming that destocking continues Q1 and Q2 or you're seeing that destocking continue as we speak. But you sound confident on the sort of sell-through, I suppose and so the guidance embeds your selling recouples upwards to sell through in the second half. So I just wanted to make sure, is that the right way of thinking about it? And when you're thinking about sell-through right now, is your sense from your salespeople and the bottom up work that you mentioned that the sell-through in most of your markets is sort of better now than a few months ago. Just trying to understand that, please? Michael Larsen : I'd say it's about the same, Julian. I mean, I think we \u2013 as Chris said, we just delivered 2% organic growth in 2023 in a pretty challenging environment as we talked about. And that included a point of inventory reduction impact. And I might add a point of drag from semi since it came up earlier. So if those two don't repeat, which is what we're saying, then you go from 2% to 4% pretty quickly. And we're not saying that destocking continues at the same level in the first half, which I think is what you said. We do expect it to be less of a drag in the first half. We also said the comps year-over-year are certainly more challenging in the first half than they are in the second half. So I think we're confident because when we look at everything going on inside the company and this focus on driving above market organic growth, a big focus on customer-back innovation, we look at the pipeline and new products that are being launched in every one of our divisions across the company. We look at a kind of a normal pricing environment. We feel pretty confident based on what we're seeing, as we sit here today. Now, we also said this is a pretty uncertain and volatile environment, things can change quickly. And so the thing that we have a lot of confidence is our ability to continue to read and react to whatever conditions our divisions are dealing with on the ground and deliver strong performance as we go through 2024. So we're not economists. We're not trying to forecast where the global economy is going. We're kind of basing our guidance on all the things we just talked about. And that's how we end up in that 1% to 3% range for 2024, which to us doesn't seem like a moonshot based on everything we just talked about. Julian Mitchell : That's helpful. Thank you. And then maybe switching away from the topline. On the margin front, I think in an earlier question reply, you mentioned sort of higher investments offsetting enterprise initiatives. So there's a couple of things on margin. One was, are we seeing a big increase in R&D and/or CapEx this year and any color on those as a sort of external benchmark for that reinvestment rate? And then price cost, I think a big first half tailwind for you maybe on margins this year. Just wanted to sort of any sense of scale for that. Michael Larsen : Yes. Price cost, I think we're kind of in a normal environment for 2024. It's not going to be a material driver of our performance. It'll be a modest contribution to margins and EPS in 2024 based on everything that we know today from a pricing and inflation standpoint. In terms of the investments, I think, our investments grow in line with our sales over time, and that's true both for customer-back innovation, it's also true for our capacity CapEx improvements that \u2013 that are all of these investments, about $800 million in 2024 are geared and centered around driving above market organic growth in every one of our divisions. And the biggest headwind, I think to margins this year was not so much the investments necessarily not just in growth, but we saw inflation in our employee-related costs just like everybody else including wages and benefits. And we expect that part of the equation to moderate here in 2024 based on some of the actions we're taking to manage those costs in 2024. So that's not going to be an increased headwind as we go forward. Julian Mitchell : Thanks very much. Michael Larsen : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mig Dobre with Baird. Your line is open. Mircea Dobre : Thank you for taking our question. Good morning. Christopher O'Herlihy: Good morning, Mig. Mircea Dobre : On the topic of outgrowth, it sounds like you're seeing about 2% this year. You're aiming for maybe 3 percentage points. I guess what I'm curious, when you're looking at your portfolio, presumably we don't have this outgrowth notion being sort of evenly distributed, what portions of your portfolio are generating outgrowth at the pace that you need it to be? And where else do we need to see further investment or further adjustments needed to be made? Christopher O'Herlihy: Yes. So Mig, I would say that, we're probably seeing our growth across most of our portfolio. I would use, auto as an example, think about flat bills in 2024. We're talking about 3% to 5% on auto as an example. We've historically outgrown in food equipment. As I think, if you look at some of the comparisons and so on. Also with welding and with construction, large down market here in 2023 which we outgrew, so we have the capacity to outgrow across much of our segment. And with respect to investments, I think we've been making these focused targeted investments for some time now. This is not new news. This is something we've been doing for a few years to really position ourselves to grow at 4% plus across the enterprise over this next phase. And I think the big driver of that, as we said a few times is customer-back innovation, is leaning on customer-back innovation that we've been working on for a couple of years, and we'll accelerate over this next phase. And that's really what will drive the outgrowth going forward. And that customer-back innovation opportunity resides in every segment on the basis of the level of differentiation in every segment, the share runway opportunity we have in every segment. So we would expect every segment in time to meaningfully contribute to that 4% plus organic growth. Michael Larsen : I would just add to that, Mig. We've talked a lot about the individual segments today. I think you got to look at ITW as the beneficiary of a highly diversified, high quality portfolio. All of our segments with margins in the high-20s, we're working through automotive, and so you're always going to have some puts and takes, which is what we're talking about. But this portfolio really gives us a level of resilience and a real competitive advantage relative to others, and puts us in a great position to perform, continue to perform at a high level in any type of demand environment over the long-term. Now, we never said that we were going to be the fastest grower. There's always going to be certain end market trends, whether it be aerospace or electrification or whatever it maybe. But you put this portfolio together in its totality. We have all the firepower that we need to deliver a 4% plus average annual organic growth as we go forward. And by the way, five of our segments are doing that, as we said earlier in 2024. So I wouldn't lose sight of the fact that, we're a business model centric company and a huge beneficiary of this high quality diversified portfolio. Mircea Dobre : Understood. Then my follow-up, maybe a question on M&A, Chris, love to get your thoughts on this and maybe how you think about using M&A as a potential tool to generate this outgrowth that you're talking about? Thank you. Christopher O'Herlihy: Yes. Sure, Mig. So effectively, we are very much sticking to our disciplined portfolio management strategy, which is very consistent in terms of \u2013 we are certainly interested in high quality acquisitions where we can find them that extend our long-term growth potential to grow at a minimum 4% plus at high quality. That's the primary kind of lens, we look at acquisitions. We've been able to leverage the business model to improve margins. And so we certainly review opportunities on an ongoing basis, but we're pretty selective here about acquisitions, given the fact that we believe we've got a lot of organic growth potential that we're going to execute on here over the next few years. If I think about MTS as an example of the typical \u2013 attractive candidate, we look at and ticked all the boxes in terms of strategic attraction, in terms of differentiation, solving customer pain points, opportunity to leverage the business model to improve margins. And having owned that business now for just over two years because we stuck to the characteristics that we believe in with respect to acquisitions. This is an acquisition that's turning on to be a home run and will be a great ITW business in the long-term. So it's a real blueprint for how we think about acquisitions and how we'd be thinking about acquisitions going forward. Mircea Dobre : Appreciate it. Thank you. Christopher O'Herlihy: Sure.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the ITW's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Erin Linnihan, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Erin Linnihan : Thank you, Krista. Good morning, and welcome to ITW's First Quarter 2024 Conference Call. Today, I'm joined by our President and CEO, Chris O\u2019Herlihy; Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen; and Vice President of Investor Relations, Karen Fletcher. During today's call, we will discuss ITW's first quarter financial results and provide an update on our outlook for full year 2024. Slide 2 is a reminder that this presentation contains forward-looking statements. We refer you to the company's 2023 Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. This presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release. Please turn to Slide 3, and it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Chris O\u2019Herlihy. Christopher O'Herlihy: Thank you, Erin, and good morning everyone. While the near-term demand environment across the majority of our segments was certainly challenging as we anticipated, the ITW team delivered a solid start to the year as our first quarter results came in as expected. And we remain solidly on track to deliver on our 2024 performance targets. Starting with the top line. Organic growth was down 0.6% as 5 of 7 segments declined in the face of a tough demand environment and versus some difficult comparisons year-over-year. Those comparisons are more favorable for the balance of the year, and based on current levels of demand, we are confident that we will deliver on our full year performance targets, including organic growth of 1% to 3%.  The ITW team continued to execute at a very high level and delivered strong margin and profitability performance in the first quarter. Excluding a onetime inventory accounting item, quarterly operating income grew 4%, as operating margin expanded 120 basis points to 25.4%, with a strong contribution from enterprise initiatives of 140 basis points, as we continue to make solid progress towards our goal of 30% operating margin by 2030. GAAP EPS of $2.73 increased 17%, and excluding the onetime item, we grew EPS 5% to $2.44. The free cash flow conversion rate of 68% was in line with normal Q1 levels.  Looking ahead, where we did raise our GAAP EPS and margin guidance for the year to account for the onetime item, our operational guidance remains unchanged. We continue to expect that current levels of demand across the majority of our end markets and favorable year-over-year comparisons will translate to positive organic growth through the balance of the year. Combined with our continued strong margin and profitability performance, we are confident that ITW is firmly on track and well-positioned to deliver on our 2024 guidance. In concluding my remarks, I want to thank all of our ITW colleagues around the world for their exceptional efforts and for their dedication to serving our customers with excellence, and driving continuous progress on our path to ITW's full potential. I will now turn the call over to Michael to discuss our first quarter performance in more detail, as well as our updated full year guidance. Michael? Michael Larsen : Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. In Q1, we delivered a solid start to the year with some high-quality execution in a pretty challenging demand environment as expected. Despite an organic revenue decline of 0.6%, operating income grew 4% and operating margin improved 120 basis points to 25.4% as enterprise initiative contributed 140 basis points. EPS increased 5% to $2.44, excluding a onetime item. Our free cash flow was $494 million, and we repurchased $375 million of our own shares during the quarter as planned. EPS increased 17% to $2.73, and operating margin expanded 420 basis points to 28.4%.  As you saw this morning, our GAAP results include a onetime LIFO inventory accounting change that resulted in a favorable pretax impact of $117 million to cost of revenue equal to $0.29 a share. In Q1, we made the decision to transition from the LIFO to FIFO inventory accounting method for all of our U.S. businesses, because it is a more consistent and simpler method for valuing inventory across our operations. In summary, Q1 results were as expected in the current environment, and growth rates are projected to improve as we go through the balance of the year. Our margin and profitability performance continues to be strong, and we're solidly on track to deliver on our guidance, which I will discuss in a few slides. Please turn to Slide 4 for a look at organic growth by geography. As you can see, the 4% decline in North America was partially offset by positive growth internationally, as Europe grew 1% and Asia Pacific grew 6%, led by China up 15%. Excluding the 23% growth rate in our Chinese automotive OEM business, organic growth in China was still up 7%. For the full year and for our usual process, which is based on current levels of demand, we expect organic growth of 1% to 3% in both North America and Europe, with Asia Pacific up in the mid-single digits, led by China.  Moving on to segment results and starting with the Automotive OEM segment, which delivered solid organic growth of 3% despite North America being down 6% as Europe grew 2% and China grew 23%, driven by continued strong penetration and market share gains. For the full year, we continue to expect solid above-market growth with our typical penetration gains of 2% to 3% and continued outgrowth in China. Margin and profitability performance was strong as margins improved by 370 basis points to 19.8%, and enterprise initiatives contributed more than 200 basis points. We continue to make solid progress on the margin enhancement plan in this segment, and we are firmly on track to deliver margins in the low to mid-20s by 2026, which you will recall is what we said we would do at our Investor Day last year.  Turning to Slide 5. Food Equipment organic revenue declined 1% as expected against a tough comparison of plus 16% in the first quarter last year. Equipment was down 4%, and service grew 3%. And by region, North America declined 2% due to a particularly difficult comparison of plus 21%. On a positive note, the retail business was up 10%, fueled by new product launches and overall North America order activity in Q1 was pretty encouraging across the board. International revenue was flat with Europe down 1% and Asia Pacific up 6%. While 5 of our 7 segments improved their margins in Q1, Food Equipment margins declined modestly to 26% as a result of focused capacity investments to support and accelerate continued above-market organic growth in our very attractive service business. Looking forward, we expect margins to continue to improve sequentially as we go through the year. Turning to Test & Measurement and Electronics. Organic revenue was down modestly as Test & Measurement grew 2% despite a tough comparison of plus 12%. Electronics was down 8% due to challenging near-term demand trends in electronic assembly. The recent MTS acquisition continues to perform well and grew more than 20%. With margins that are improving, but still in the mid-teens, this created a mix headwind for this segment and diluted segment margins by about 250 basis points. Looking ahead, we expect Test & Measurement and Electronics margins to improve from here as we go through the balance of the year. Moving on to Slide 6. And as expected, Welding faced a tough demand environment and year-over-year comparison of plus 10%, which resulted in a decline of 3% in Q1. Equipment declined 2% and consumables were down 6%. Industrial sales declined 1% versus an 18% comparison, and the commercial side was down 6%. By region, North America declined 3% against the comparison of plus 10% and international declined 8%. On a positive note, operating margin improved 80 basis points to 32.7% with a solid contribution from enterprise initiatives. Organic revenue in Polymers & Fluids declined modestly as Automotive Aftermarket was down 2%, and both Fluids and Polymers were essentially flat in the quarter. On a geographic basis, North America declined 5% and international grew 5%, led by China. Operating margins improved 104 basis points to 25.8%.  Turning to Slide 7. Near-term demand trends in Construction Products continued to be challenging on a global basis as organic revenue declined 7% in Q1. North America was down 3% as the residential and renovation business was down 1%. And international markets remained soft as Europe was down 11% and Australia and New Zealand was down 12%. On a positive note, operating margin improved 190 basis points to 29.4%, driven primarily by another solid contribution from enterprise initiatives. Finally, Specialty Products. Organic revenue growth was up 6%, due primarily to the timing of large equipment orders in 2 European businesses. As a result, international was up 19% and North America was down 1%. As we have talked about before, we're working to reposition the Specialty segment for consistent above-market organic growth, which involves some strategic portfolio work and more significant product line simplification as we go forward.  Operating margin improved 410 basis points to 29.7%, driven by operating leverage and a solid contribution from enterprise initiatives.  With that, let's move to Slide 8 for an update on our full year 2024 guidance. With Q1 results that were right in line with our expectations, we're solidly on track to deliver on our 2024 performance targets and guidance. Looking ahead and starting with the top line, we do see some positives in terms of stable demand, more favorable comparisons year-over-year as we move forward, a normalized pricing and inflationary environment, new product launches, and no meaningful headwind from inventory destocking. Per our usual process, our organic growth guidance of 1% to 3% is based on current run rates adjusted for typical seasonality. Operating margin is expected to improve by 140 basis points at the midpoint to a range of 26% to 27%, which includes more than 100 basis points contribution from enterprise initiatives and 50 basis points from the onetime item in Q1. As I mentioned on our last call, every segment is projecting to improve their operating margin performance, again, in 2024, with another solid contribution from enterprise initiatives across the board. After-tax return on capital is expected to remain firmly above 30%, and we expect strong free cash flows, again, with conversion greater than net income. As you saw this morning, we raised our full year GAAP EPS guidance to a new range of $10.30 to $10.70, which now includes $0.30 of EPS from the Q1 inventory accounting change. Setting that item aside, our operational guidance remains essentially unchanged as we expect a combined headwind of about $0.30 from higher interest expense, currency and income taxes, with an expected tax rate in the range of 24% to 24.5%. In terms of cadence for the year, we expect our first half, second half EPS split to be about 50-50 this year, as we factor in the onetime item in the first quarter, which compares to our typical split of 49-51, so slightly less back-end loaded than usual. To wrap things up, as expected, the ITW team continues to execute at a very high level in a challenging near-term demand environment, which we anticipate will improve as we go through the balance of the year based on current levels of demand and more favorable comparison. In addition, our first quarter results came in as expected, and we are solidly on track to deliver on our 2024 guidance. On a separate note, today is Karen Fletcher's last ITW earnings call. Over the last 6 years, Karen has been instrumental in articulating ITW's unique and differentiated competitive advantages and our plan to leverage them to their full potential to you, the investment community, in a clear and compelling manner. In doing so, she has helped us position ITW as one of the world's highest quality, best performing, and most respected industrial companies. Please join Chris and me in thanking Karen, for her many contributions to ITW and wishing her all the best in retirement. Karen Fletcher : Thank you, Michael. That means a lot, and it's been a privilege to do that. Michael Larsen : Thank you, Karen. And with that, Erin, I'll turn it back to you. Erin Linnihan : Thank you, Michael. Krista, will you please open the line for questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Jamie Cook from Truist Securities. Jamie Cook : Congrats Karen, and thanks for all your help over the past 6 years. Karen Fletcher : Thank you, Jamie. Jamie Cook : My first question on the Food Equipment side, I think, Michael, you noted some positive order activity in North America. If you could just speak to what you're seeing there? And then how much of a margin headwind was the capacity investments that you spoke about? And then my follow-up question, just on Specialty. I know you spoke to taking portfolio actions in PLS. If you could just give a little more color there, where are you taking actions? And how much is PLS, I guess, a headwind to organic growth within Specialty for the year? Michael Larsen : I think that was 4 questions in one, Jamie. Well, I'm going to try... Jamie Cook : I know, but that's every quarter, so I get... Michael Larsen : I'm going to try my best here. So the comment on Food Equipment. I think for many of our segments, if you take a step back, these growth rates are a little unusual for us, which is really driven, as we said, by these really significant challenging comparisons that we're dealing with, including in Food Equipment.  So the additional color, even though we're not necessarily a backlog-driven company, was directed around the order activity in North America, which grew double digit in the first quarter here, and which I think gives some additional credibility. What we're saying is that we are expecting a return to more typical growth rates here, including in Food Equipment as we go forward.  The margin pressure, the margin impact is about 100 basis points in Food Equipment here in Q1 and Q2. And it's really as a result of taking advantage of a huge growth opportunity that's sitting right in front of us in our service business. So what we're talking about is adding a significant number of service technicians to help us meet the demand in one of the most attractive parts of our Food Equipment business. And as you know, we're the only captive OEM with the service business, which is a huge competitive advantage for us in this segment. So I think those were the 2 questions around food equipment. I don't know if you want to add anything to that, Chris? Christopher O'Herlihy: No. I would just, I guess, accentuate the point of differentiation aspect of the service business within food with unique captive manufacturer. And this is a necessary investment at this point to capitalize on what is an undoubtedly stellar growth opportunity on the service side for us. Michael Larsen : And then on Specialty, the organic growth rate here was really driven by large equipment orders and the timing around those in 2 of our businesses in Europe. What we're trying to articulate on a go-forward basis is that we still expect meaningful PLS, product line simplification, as we move forward and strategically reposition this business for 4% plus growth on a consistent basis. And so we still expect a meaningful impact from that as we move forward. And I think kind of what we're saying is don't count on 6% organic growth as we move forward. We had guided to this segment at our last call to be down 1% to 3%. And so please keep that in mind. And the same is true for the margins. I mean, I think what you're seeing here on the margins is what happens when we get some growth in these businesses and the operating leverage here contributing in a meaningful way to 29.7% operating margins in the Specialty segment. I think that is not -- on a go-forward basis, that's Q1, both growth rate and margins are a little bit of an anomaly, and I think we expect to return to more -- still very profitable margins kind of in the high 20s, but maybe not something that starts with a 29. Jamie Cook : Congrats again, Karen. Karen Fletcher : Thanks, Jamie. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tami Zakaria from JPMorgan. Tami Zakaria : First off to Karen, I'll definitely miss you, but I wish you all the best of luck. And welcome aboard, Erin. Looking forward to working with you. Karen Fletcher : Thanks, Tami. Tami Zakaria : Of course. So my first question is, just wanted to get a little color here. I think you expect organic growth to be positive throughout the balance of the year. Does that mean you expect 2Q organic growth to be within that full year range of 1% to 3% growth? Michael Larsen : So Tami, as you know, we don't give quarterly guidance. What I will tell you to try and help you out here a little bit is that if you model kind of current levels of demand or run rate, as we call them, into Q2, what we're typically seeing is a step-up in revenues in the low single digits from Q1 to Q2. And in Automotive OEM, actually a meaningful improvement in the builds from Q1 to Q2, an increase in the low to mid-single digits there as well. So you will see slightly higher revenues in Q2. And given that the comparison gets easier on a year-over-year basis, we were up 5% in Q1 last year, up 3% in Q2, it is certainly possible that we'll see slightly positive organic growth here in Q2. But the more meaningful step-up really starts in the second half of the year, which is kind of what's implied in our guidance here.  So think about it maybe as kind of flattish in the first half, maybe slightly positive in Q2, and then an improvement in the second half of the year, as the comparisons year-over-year improve by 4 points relative to the first half of the year. So in the second half last year, revenues were essentially flat, and at current run rates, you'd expect to see positive organic growth rates in the low single digits in the second half.  And I might just add for those keeping track that there are 2 extra shipping days in the second half this year compared to the second half last year, which at least mathematically should provide some additional revenue growth for us. Tami Zakaria : Got it. That's very helpful. My second question is similar to the first one, but on the margin side. I think that in the first quarter, you had $117 million tailwind. That's about 70 basis points tailwind for the full year, but you raised the full year guide by about only $50 million. And the first quarter margin also came in a little better than what most people on the Street were modeling.  Just trying to understand, as we think about the next 3 quarters, is there any incremental cost pressures or maybe price cost headwind than originally thought? Or is it just your conservatism that you raised the full year guide by only 50 basis points? Michael Larsen : Well, what I would say, Tami, is that we're really pleased with our first quarter operational performance here, as you saw in the margin rates. And if you exclude the onetime item, 140 basis points from initiatives, 120 basis points of overall margin expansion, and margins at 25.4% is a pretty significant accomplishment here for the first quarter. And we do expect, as we typically do going through the year, that margins improved sequentially from here on out. So you should see a modest improvement sequentially from Q1 to Q2, and then again into Q3 and Q4. The only thing I would highlight as you think about the second quarter is, similar to last year, we do expect some higher restructuring expense in the second quarter, and these are all projects that are tied to a typical 80/20 front-to-back projects. These are not tied to any concerns around volume growth whatsoever. I don't want you to think that this is pure planned restructuring for the second quarter.  And as I said, just real quick on Q1, again, 5 of 7 segments improved margins in the current environment, including with revenues down in 5 of 7 segments. And we expect, consistent with our bottom-up planning process here for the full year, that every segment will improve margins as we go through the year and on a year-over-year basis. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Volkmann with Jefferies. Stephen Volkmann : Great. Karen, I can add my congratulations, and we will miss you. And Erin, welcome. And I'm impressed that you already have Karen's cadence down so well. So... Karen Fletcher : Thank you. Stephen Volkmann : Can I ask a little bit about China? That seemed to be a bit of an outlier there. I guess, quite a bit of that automotive, but even without that, things seem to be relatively good. Any color you can give us on that? Michael Larsen : Yes. I think as you pointed out, Steve, the big driver is obviously our Automotive OEM business, up 23%. And the team there is doing a great job growing content on new vehicles, including on the EV side, and gaining market share. Even excluding those, as I said, China was still up 7% year-over-year.  Strong contribution from Polymers & Fluids. Some of that is tied also to market share gains on the EV side of things and the bonding of some of these batteries in the assembly process, where we have a really unique and differentiated product. Specialty products also contributed. Test & Measurement grew and Food Equipment. So across the board, really solid performance in China. And moving forward, we'd say that looks pretty sustainable as we go into Q2, and then the second half, the comps get a little bit more difficult. But as I said, for the full year, China should be up in the mid- to high-single digits here, which is certainly encouraging. And again, I think it speaks to kind of the benefit of being as diversified from a geography standpoint as we are. And so certainly, some challenges in the first quarter in North America, but offset in Europe and in China, which is really a big benefit for us. Stephen Volkmann : Super. And then a follow-up is on Automotive margins. Obviously, going well there, and I think you said 200 basis points or better than 200 basis points of enterprise there. And I'm just trying to get a sense of how we should think of the cadence in auto margins as the year progresses. And I don't know, maybe the exit rate or the total year enterprise something? Michael Larsen : Yes. I mean, I think, I wouldn't expect a lot of regression from where we are. These are absolutely sustainable here in the 19%-plus range. And I think that's probably where we'll end up for the year, maybe a little bit better in the back half. Some of that depends on the build assumptions. There might be a little bit of restructuring here in the second quarter. But big picture, I'd say, Automotive, really solid progress here on a year-over-year basis. We expect full year margins in the 19%, almost 20% range, an improvement of 240 basis points on a year-over-year basis, and lots of room to go as we work through our margin enhancement plan. Christopher O'Herlihy: Yes. And Steve, I suppose just to support that, I mean, this is very much an improvement plan that's on track to get back to the low to mid-20s margins by 2026, as we outlined at our Investor Day, largely through a combination of, over that time, volume recovery, enterprise initiatives, and higher-margin innovation. So both in '23 and again in '24, we're very much tracking on that cadence with respect to what we outlined at our Investor Day last year. Michael Larsen : Yes. So nothing unusual in terms of the margins in Q1, and sustainable, but lots of room for improvement from here. Operator : Your next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Andrew Kaplowitz : Karen, congratulations. We'll miss you. Karen Fletcher : Thanks, Andy. Andrew Kaplowitz : So Michael, probably, I'm guessing you don't want to reset your organic growth guides for your segments every quarter, but just higher level, you had Construction, Specialty forecast to be down, I think 1 of 3, while the other segments were projected to be up between 2 and 4 and 3 and 5. Specialty was actually much better. Has that changed the segment's outlook at all? I know you talked about a little bit of a pull forward in some equipment orders. And were any of the other segments like weaker than you thought, to start? Michael Larsen : I think, Andy, you're right. We don't want to update our guidance for the segments every quarter. And what I will tell you is, given our portfolio, there's always going to be some puts and takes. And I think that's, again, I just talked about the competitive advantage with being as diversified as we are geographically. And the same is true when you look at this portfolio of businesses. You're always going to have some things that maybe are a little more pressured from a market standpoint in the short term. And those are typically offset by segments that are performing a little bit better. And it all kind of evens out to that 1% to 3% organic growth guidance.  So I'm not really going to go through segment by segment here, but I'd say there's definitely some puts and takes, but overall, not too far off from what we talked about on the last call. And certainly, our full year guidance, we're firmly on track to deliver on that. Andrew Kaplowitz : Michael, that's helpful. And then just in Welding, maybe give us a little more color to what you see going on there. There was some destocking end of last year, maybe a little bit still early this year. Are you getting past that, and differences between industrial and commercial markets, sort of what do you see going forward there? Michael Larsen : Yes. I think the big driver here is really the comparisons year-over-year. That's driving the growth rates as we go forward. And so just like I said, for the total company, for Welding, it's also true that as we go through the year, these comparisons get easier. 10% growth in Welding in the first quarter last year is obviously not a sustainable growth rate. And so it wasn't really a big surprise that organic revenue was down 3%. I'd say on a positive note, and this is true not just in Welding, but across the board, last year, we dealt with some meaningful headwind from excess inventory at our customers and in the channel. And to the point of magnitude, a percentage point of drag on the organic growth rate last year, that is essentially behind us at this point. So that's kind of the positive news across the board, including in Welding. And then we're back to a normal pricing environment. We've got an exciting lineup in terms of new products that are being launched here in the near term. And so you put all of that together, and we feel really good about the outlook here in Welding. Top line, obviously, but maybe I will just highlight the margin performance again. The fact that with revenues down, margins at 32% plus, operating margins is really strong and speaks to the focus that we have on really quality of growth over quantity of growth. And the team is executing well on that plan. Andrew Kaplowitz : Agreed on the margin performance. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Sabrina Abrams : You have Sabrina Abrams on for Andrew Obin. Congratulations, Karen. Karen Fletcher : Thanks, Sabrina. Sabrina Abrams : On the margin side, are there any changes to how you're thinking about volume leverage, price cost, maybe like the reinvestment in enterprise initiatives, as we move through the year? Maybe we could like walk through the different buckets and how they relate to the full year guide? Michael Larsen : Yes. I think there's not a lot of change from what we talked about on the last call. We are maintaining our operational guidance here kind of big picture at 1% to 3% organic growth. There is some positive operating leverage. We expect slightly more than 100 basis points of enterprise initiatives, which is based on the strong performance here in Q1 at 140 basis points.  Price/cost has essentially normalized at this point. So there is some modest favorability from price/cost as we go through the year. Maybe a little bit more in Q1 versus the back end of the year. And then we have done a good job, as we talked about on the last call, managing some of the cost pressures from an inflationary standpoint around employee-related cost benefits. That used to be a headwind. Order of magnitude, we used to talk about 150, 200 basis points, and that's right around 100 basis points of margin headwind now. And then the last thing that I would add is just the accounting change. So factoring in the LIFO accounting change in Q1, that's how you get to that 140 basis points of margin improvement for the full year and the new range of 26% to 27%. Sabrina Abrams : And then what are you guys seeing in terms of electronics demand? And what are you hearing from your customers? Because this market has been pressured for 5 or 6 quarters now, but clearly, the comps are getting easier. Has this started to bottom out yet? Michael Larsen : Well, so I think it's a little bit of a mixed picture there. I think last year, we talked a lot about the challenges in the semi-related businesses. Last year, those were down order of magnitude 20% to 25%. Now -- we're talking about just to kind of size things. These businesses represent about 15% of the Test & Measurement and Electronics segment, 3% of total ITW revenues. So just to kind of put things in context.  The positive news is that the semi markets appear to have bottomed out. So this is no longer a drag on the overall growth rate of the segment. They were actually maybe slightly positive here in Q1, but the inevitable recovery has been deferred. And so when exactly that will come, whether that's in the second half or next year, is hard to tell. It's not factored into our guidance, as we told you today.  And then we're seeing a little bit of what I said in the script, a little bit of pressure in the electronic assembly side of things. So this is maybe more tied to consumer electronics, and that's what drove electronics being down 8% here in the first quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from Mig Dobre with Baird. Mircea Dobre : And I'll join the chorus here. Karen, all the best in retirement and really appreciate all the help over these years. Karen Fletcher : Thanks, Mig. Mircea Dobre : One question I had was about EMEA, which frankly came in a little bit better than I would have guessed. I guess one of the themes during this earnings season has been that Europe, frankly, has not been that great. So I'm kind of curious what you're seeing there? Is it just a function of the Specialty kind of onetime items that might have helped Europe in the quarter? Or is there kind of more green shoots to talk about in Europe? Michael Larsen : I mean the big driver in Europe here from a dollar standpoint was the Specialty Products, these 2 equipment businesses here, and the timing around some of those orders, as Specialty was up 20% here in the first quarter. But overall, I'd say pretty stable. Automotive was up 2%, Test & Measurement and Electronics up 5%, Food Equipment about flat. That's a little bit of an anomaly that will return to more positive growth as we go through the year.  And then smaller businesses. Welding down a little bit and Polymers & Fluids down a little bit. But overall -- and then Construction obviously remains a drag internationally as it has been for well over a year at this point. So Construction was still down double digit here in the first quarter. But overall, 1% positive organic growth in the first quarter in Europe. Mircea Dobre : Understood. And since you mentioned Construction, that was going to be my follow-up there. How do you sort of think about the way this segment can progress through the year here? Is there some sort of a stocking effect that we need to be aware of? And can you also clarify a little bit what you're seeing in North America. You talked about resi. I'm curious what you're seeing on the nonresi side of things? Michael Larsen : Yes. I think overall, actually, if you think about Construction, the performance in North America I think is a good example of illustration of how the business is outperforming in a very challenging down market. Only to be down 3% in a market that, if you look at all the key metrics, is certainly down a lot more than that is pretty impressive. Residential/remodel, we said down 1%. I mean the home centers are actually down a little bit more than that. And on the commercial side, to your question, that continues to be soft. The commercial side is down. I mean, it's a fairly small part of the overall business, about 20% of the global business, maybe even a little bit less than that. That business was down in the low teens here in the first quarter. But overall, pretty resilient performance in a challenging market, and we expect that frankly to remain that way as we go through the balance of the year. If you look at our guidance last time we were together, we said we expected Construction to be down 1% to 3% and I'd certainly put them in that category. And then what's really helping drive some of the performance here is the margin performance. Again, for our Construction business to be delivering 29% plus margins is pretty remarkable without any volume leverage. Erin Linnihan : And I think we'll take one more question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Matthew Pan : This is Matthew Pan from Julian Mitchell's team at Barclays. Just one, if you could dial in on the TME margins, they were down year-over-year. Can they expand in 2024 overall? Michael Larsen : The short answer is yes. And I think one of the reasons, as I said in the prepared remarks that Test & Measurement margins were down in the first quarter is really the strong performance of the MTS business, which grew at 20% plus organic, which is certainly great performance. But due to the fact that we're only 2 years in, in terms of implementing the ITW business model, margins are in the mid-teens in that business. And so there's a negative mix effect that diluted the margins in Test & Measurement by about 250 basis points.  Now as we go forward, starting Q2 and then through the balance of the year, we do expect that margins will improve from here in the Test & Measurement and Electronics segment. If you just look at kind of where we were historically, we're going to be back to kind of the mid-20s here for the full year is the current expectation. So like in every segment, including in Test & Measurement and Electronics, we expect to improve margins on a year-over-year basis. So... Christopher O'Herlihy: Yes. In Test & Measurement and Electronics, I would just add that there's an extremely fertile environment for innovation, which will underpin margin progression going forward in that segment. Michael Larsen : Yes. Matthew Pan : Got it. And just a quick follow-up. The free cash flow was down year-over-year in Q1. Is that just a working capital build? And then what are your thoughts on Q2? Is that up year-over-year? Michael Larsen : Yes. I think if you look at the free cash flow conversion, it's actually pretty close to kind of normal seasonality. Working capital, if you look at the inventory, it's certainly a decline on a year-over-year basis. It looks like an increase from year-end in Q1. You have to factor out this LIFO inventory accounting change, which added $117 million of inventory in the first quarter. If you do that, you'll see that inventory was actually flat in the quarter relative to year-end, when typically we see a 5% increase or about $85 million of inventory increase in the first quarter, which the team was able to offset.  Now that said, our months on hand are still elevated relative to pre-COVID levels. And so pre-COVID, we were in the low 2s months on hand. We're right around 3. Certainly, some improvement, but we believe that there is a lot more opportunity here to drive those inventory levels back to kind of pre-COVID levels given that supply chain has normalized. And so as a result of that, you should expect continued strong free cash flow performance as we go through the year. And that's consistent with the guidance we gave today, which is a conversion of 100% plus for the full year.  So I think overall kind of typical performance in Q1, and more to come as we go through the balance of the year in terms of reducing our inventory levels, which will result in strong free cash flow, as you've come to expect from ITW. Operator : That concludes our question-and-answer session. And with that, that does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the ITW Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Erin Linnihan, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. Erin Linnihan : Thank you, Audra. Good morning, and welcome to ITW's second quarter 2024 conference call. Today, I'm joined by our President and CEO, Chris O'Herlihy; and Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen. During today's call, we will discuss ITW's second quarter financial results and provide an update on our outlook for full year 2024. Slide 2 is a reminder that this presentation contains forward-looking statements. We refer you to the company's 2023 Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. This presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release. Please turn to Slide 3, and it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Chris O'Herlihy. Chris? Christopher O'Herlihy: Thank you, Erin, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our press release this morning, during the second quarter, the short cycle demand environment continued to moderate across our portfolio. At the total company level, second quarter revenues came in approximately 1 percentage point, or $50 million below what they would have been had demand held at the level we were seeing exiting the first quarter. Second quarter organic revenue was down in three segments with declines year-over-year in CapEx-related products such as welding, test and measurement and construction. These declines were offset by revenue growth in four segments resulting in overall flat organic growth year-over-year at the total company level as compared to our end markets which we believe were down in the low single digits. As usual, as the quarter progressed, the ITW team executed well on all the elements within our control. As evidenced by record second quarter operating margin, which improved by 140 basis points, 26.2%, supported by 140 basis points of benefit from enterprise initiatives. Operating income grew 4.5% to a second quarter record of $1.05 billion and GAAP EPS came in at $2.54, up from $2.48 last year. As per our normal practice, we are adjusting our full year guidance in line with demand levels in our businesses as they exist today. Current run rates exiting Q2 projected through the remainder of the year results in about flat organic revenue for the full year. The moderating demand is partially offset by stronger margin performance and we are raising our margin guidance to 26.5% to 27%. Factoring in both of these elements, lower market demand and stronger margin performance, we are lowering the midpoint of our EPS guidance by 1% as we narrow the range to $10.30 to $10.40. While the combination of moderating manufacturing CapEx demand and lower automotive bill forecasts for the second half has us operating in a challenging near-term environment, we will continue to drive our usual high-quality execution on all the elements within our control, while remaining focused on managing and investing to maximize the company's growth and performance over the long-term, as we build above market organic growth fueled by customer-backed innovation into a core ITW strength. In this regard, we are very encouraged by the progress we are making on customer-backed innovation in each of our divisions. In concluding my remarks, I want to thank all of our ITW colleagues around the world for their exceptional efforts and for their dedication to serving our customers with excellence and driving continuous progress on our path to ITW's full potential. I will now turn the call over to Michael to discuss our second quarter performance in more detail, as well as our updated full year guidance. Michael? Michael Larsen : Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. In Q2, revenue declined 1% with organic revenue down 0.1%, essentially flat year-over-year, and a slight improvement from being down 0.6% in Q1. As Chris said, demand moderated sequentially as total company revenues grew 2% from the first quarter to the second quarter, a point below our historical run rate growth of 3%. Faced with moderating demand, the ITW team, as usual, did a great job in terms of reading and reacting to the environment and delivered record margin and profitability performance in the second quarter, as evidenced by 4.5% operating income growth and operating margins of 26.2%, an improvement of 140 basis points as enterprise initiatives were once again the largest margin and profitability driver contributing 140 basis points this quarter with more to come in the second half. GAAP EPS of $2.54 increased 2% or 5% excluding a 2023 one-time tax item. Our free cash flow was $571 million which was a 75% conversion of net income, slightly below our historical conversion in the 80% range, as we continue to focus on reducing our inventory months on hand to pre-pandemic levels without impacting customer service levels. We repurchased $375 million of our own shares during the quarter as planned, and the effective tax rate was 24.4% compared to 21.4% in the prior year, which lowered EPS by $0.10. In addition, foreign currency translation was approximately a $0.05 headwind year-over-year. In summary, strong execution and Q2 results as the impact of a moderating short cycle demand environment was offset by strong margin and profitability performance. Please turn to Slide 4 for a look at organic growth by geography. The 2% decline in North America was an improvement over the first quarter's 3% decline. Europe grew 1% and Asia Pacific grew 3%, with China up 5%. Moving on to segment results, the Automotive OEM segment delivered flat organic growth in the second quarter against a tough comparison of plus 16% in the year-ago quarter. North America was down 4%, Europe was down 2%, and China was up 7%. In the first half, Automotive Builds were flat, and our Automotive OEM segment grew 2% above market. For the full year, we continue to expect solid above-market growth with our typical penetration gains of 2% to 3% and continued outgrowth in China. In our guidance, we have now factored in the most recent automotive build projections, which have declined to negative 2% for the full year. As you may recall, when we issued our initial guidance in February, Automotive Builds were expected to be flat for the year. On a positive note, the segment delivered strong operating margin performance of 19.4%, a 260 basis points improvement, as we continue to work towards our goal of achieving operating margins in the low to mid-20s by 2026. Turn to Slide 5, Food Equipment organic revenue grew 2.5% against a comparison of plus 7% in the second quarter of last year. Equipment grew 1% and service grew 5% against a comparison of plus 16% last year. By region, North America increased 2% with service up 3%. Organic growth in the institutional market was up mid single digits, and the retail market was up high single digits. International revenue was up 3.5% led by Europe. As we talked about last quarter, the current margin performance reflects the fact that we're making focused capacity investments in the first half of 2024 to support and accelerate continued above-market organic growth in our very attractive service business. Looking forward, we expect margins to continue to improve sequentially as we go through the year. Turning to Test & Measurement and Electronics, organic revenue was down 3% with continued softness in semiconductor, electronics, and CapEx-sensitive end markets. Both Test & Measurement and Electronics were down 3% in the quarter. Moving on to Slide 6, Welding was down 5% in Q2, as Equipment declined 5% and consumables were down 3%. By region, North America declined 6% with industrial sales down 7% and the commercial side down 6%. International grew 3% with some strength in Europe. Operating margin was 32.9% with a solid contribution from enterprise initiatives. Organic revenue in Polymers & Fluids increased 3%, led by Polymers up 10%, and Fluids was up 4%. Automotive aftermarket was down 2% in the quarter. On a geographic basis, North America declined 4% and international grew 13%. Operating margin of 28.2% improved more than 200 basis points. Turn to Slide 7. Demand trends in construction products continue to be challenging on a global basis as organic revenue declined 4% in Q2 in a market that we believe is down in the mid to high single digits. North America was down 2% as the residential and renovation business was down 2% and commercial was down 9%. International markets remain soft as Europe was down 7% and Australia and New Zealand was down 4%. Finally, specialty products had a strong quarter with organic revenue growth of 7% due to significant strength in our aerospace equipment division as well as pockets of increased demand across our portfolio. As a result, international was up 10% and North America was up 5%. As previously discussed, results can be a bit choppy as we continue to work to reposition the Specialty segment for consistent above-market organic growth, including strategic portfolio work and more significant product line simplification, which included 230 basis points in Q2. Operating margin improved 590 basis points to 31.9% with strong contributions from enterprise initiatives and operating leverage. With that, let's move to Slide 8 for an update on our full year 2024 guidance. Despite a challenging first half macro demand environment, the ITW team found a way to deliver solid operational and financial results. And excluding one-time items, we grew operating income 4% in the first half as margins improved by 130 basis points to 25.8% with 140 basis points from enterprise initiatives. GAAP EPS was up 10% -- up 5% excluding one-time items. Looking ahead to the second half in our updated guidance, we do not expect the short cycle demand environment to improve. Per usual process, we are adjusting our full year guidance in line with conditions on the ground as they exist today. Current run rates exiting Q2 adjusted for typical seasonality and the most recent automotive build forecast projected through the remainder of the year would result in approximately flat organic growth for the year in markets that we believe are down in the low single digits. This compares to a prior organic growth guidance of 1% to 3% and impacts EPS by approximately $0.25. The lower top line guidance is partially offset by stronger margin and profitability performance, which is expected to continue into the second half, including a significant contribution of more than 100 basis points from enterprise initiatives. As a result, we raised margin guidance to 26.5% to 27% as we continue to make solid progress towards our goal of 30% operating margin by 2030. The higher margins impact EPS favorably by about $0.10. The net of these two factors, as you saw this morning, is that we lowered the top end of the range of our full-year GAAP EPS guidance to a new range of $10.30 to $10.40, which is a reduction of $0.15 or 1% at the midpoint from $10.50 to $10.35 with 6 months to go in the year. To wrap things up, we delivered a solid Q2 and first half in a challenging demand environment, and we've updated our full year guidance per usual process to reflect current levels of demand. Given the strength of our competitive advantages, the resilience of the ITW business model, and our diversified high-quality portfolio, we're well-positioned for whatever economic conditions emerged through the second half of the year. With that, Erin, I'll turn it back to you. Erin Linnihan : Thank you. Audra, will you please open the line for questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Andy Kaplowitz at Citigroup. Andy Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning, everyone. Christopher O'Herlihy: Good morning. Michael Larsen : Good morning, Andy. Andy Kaplowitz : Good morning. Chris and Michael, you continue to have unusually strong results in specialty products in Q2 after I think you said in Q1 that it was a bit unusual and Q2 would normalize. I know you mentioned aerospace. I don't think I've heard that particular business mentioned before. So could you give us more color on what's going on there and what is the probability that segment could continue to outperform? Michael Larsen : Yes. So, Andy, we've had a -- as you've outlined, a very solid half one here in specialty. There's a few different things going on. I think strength in aerospace has been a feature throughout the first half. There's some other pockets of strong demand elsewhere. Obviously, we had favorable comps in specialty and we've also benefited from the timing of some orders, particularly in Q1 for some of our European equipment businesses. This is a segment that we've got some strategic portfolio repositioning going on. A bit more than the normal kind of PLS that you'd see, more than maintenance, much more strategic, it's going to be a bit of a drag on revenue for the full year, we would say. We probably expect specialty to be up just above flat, maybe flat to low single digits for the full year. But the important thing here is that the strong work that we are doing to really make this segment a 4% grower in the long-term. And based on the progress that we've seen this year, we certainly believe we can do that. Andy Kaplowitz : Very helpful. And then Chris and Michael, you mentioned that demand continues to moderate in Q2, but could you give us a little more color regarding the cadence of the demand you saw? Has demand stabilized at lower levels across your short cycle businesses, or would you say it's still getting worse? And then with the understanding that you're forecasting the exit rate of Q2, you do have much easier comps in the second half. So just at the enterprise level, are you digging in any conservatism or is it really just on run rates? Michael Larsen : Well, so I think in terms of the cadence, I think we saw as we were going through the quarter is the demand continued to moderate as the quarter by -- as the quarter progressed. And by segment, definitely auto, as auto builds came down, the CapEx businesses that Chris mentioned, Test & Measurement and Welding, were maybe a little bit more impacted than some of the other businesses. I think on a positive note, I just might add that June also had really strong margin performance. So I think we got some good margin momentum heading into the second half. In terms of the back half of the year, as we said, per our typical process, this is based on current levels of demand that we're seeing in these businesses adjusted for seasonality. We do have, as you recall, some more favorable comparisons here in the second half of the year. If you look at last year, we were up 4% in the first half of '23, and we're flat in the second half of '23. So, the comparisons definitely get easier. We also have the benefit of two additional shipping days in the back half, one in Q3 and one in Q4. And then the last thing I would add is we've updated the automotive build forecast, as we saw a decline there from previously about flat for the year to down 2%. And we expect to outgrow that per typical 2% to 3% and we continue to outgrow by a little bit more than that in China as we've talked about previously. So those are all the elements that kind of went into the top line guidance. I might just add, if you look at the reduction, 1 to 3 organic now to about flat, and you look at kind of the flow-through on that, that's about a 20% decremental, just given how strong the margin performance is and how flexible our cost structure is so that we can continue to kind of read and react to whatever demand environment we're dealing with in the second half. Andy Kaplowitz : Appreciate all the color. Michael Larsen : Sure. Operator : We'll move next to Scott Davis at Melius Research. Scott Davis : Hey, good morning, guys. Michael Larsen : Good morning. Christopher O'Herlihy: Good morning. Scott Davis : I know I probably asked this in prior quarters, but M&A is, I assume, no change in strategy there, more bolt-ons? Or we have heard of some larger assets that are going to become available, would you guys be comfortable casting a wider net there? Christopher O'Herlihy: Yes. So, Scott, I think our posture on M&A hasn't changed much. I mean, as we shared at our Investor Day, we have a pretty disciplined portfolio management strategy and we're certainly staying consistent to that. From our standpoint, we have a pretty clear and well-defined view of what fits our strategy and our financial criteria. So, for us, it's a case of just finding the right opportunities. Very much focused on high-quality acquisitions that can extend our long-term growth potential, growing at a minimum of 4% plus at high-quality. We've been able to leverage the business model to improve margins. So we review opportunities certainly on an ongoing basis, pretty selective given what we believe to be pretty compelling organic growth potential that we have in our core businesses. And if I go back to the MTS acquisition from a couple of years ago, that was certainly an acquisition that ticked all the boxes and only a couple of years in here and already turning out to be a great ITW business. So to the extent that we can find acquisitions like that, then we'll certainly be very active. Scott Davis : Okay. Fair enough, Chris. And then I was just looking back at your investor deck and your growth, your long-term growth targets, 4 to 7, 2 to 3 points of that were coming from customer-backed innovation, and you did mention that in your prepared remarks. But are you still confident that you can drive that kind of growth from customer-backed innovation? It seems like a lot to me, but you guys would have a better feel for that. Christopher O'Herlihy: Yes, I was going to say, Scott, that we're even more confident now than we were at Investor Day. Our confidence has certainly continued to grow. We're very encouraged by what we're seeing in our businesses. It's one of the reasons that we believe that we're outperforming our end markets right now. And our view on customer-backed innovation is that we're going to lean into customer-backed innovation in the same way with a similar approach that we utilized in really reinvigorating front to back 80-20 in the last phase of our enterprise strategy in terms of our intention around it, in terms of the rigor and capability build that's going on all over this company right now. And in doing so, increase our contribution from what was approximately 1% in 2019 to north of 2% today, and what will be north of 3% in the not too distant future. So everything we see on customer back and the work we're doing in our divisions gives us an even stronger sense of confidence that this is going to be really impactful in terms of our ability to grow 4% plus in the long-term. Scott Davis : Okay, thank you, Chris. I'll pass it on, appreciate it. Christopher O'Herlihy: Sure, Scott. Thank you. Operator : Next, we'll go to Tami Zakaria at JPMorgan. Tami Zakaria : Hi, good morning. Thank you so much. Christopher O'Herlihy: Good morning. Michael Larsen : Good morning. Tami Zakaria : So my first question is -- morning. So, my first question is North America saw negative, I think you said 2% organic growth while other regions are positive. Are you still seeing destocking headwinds in North America or any other region? Or is the market softening now more a function of just demand rather than destocking? Michael Larsen : Yes, I think it's more the latter, Tami, that demand is a function of where we are in the economic cycle. And so destocking, which was a headwind all of last year, is no longer a significant factor at this point. I think if you look at just North America, down 2% was really driven by Welding, down 6%. And then Auto, Polymers & Fluids down 4%. And then some positive momentum in Food Equipment up 2% and Specialty up 5%. But again, that's really more reflection of kind of where we're at in the cycle versus anything going on from a destocking standpoint. Tami Zakaria : Got it. That's helpful. And then just a bit clarity on the new operating margin guide. So operating margin expected up about 165 basis points on flattish organic growth. Can you help me understand that 165 basis points, how much of that is enterprise initiatives versus the 140 you saw in the first half? And then is there any price cost or volume or anything else that's adding to that 165 basis points year-over-year? Michael Larsen : Yes, I think not a lot of volume leverage, obviously, as we're guiding to about flat growth for the year. The biggest driver continues to be the enterprise initiatives. As you said, we got 140 basis points in the first half. The roll-up for the second half looks really good. As we said today, more than 100 basis points. And so somewhere I would say between 100 and 140 is maybe a reasonable estimate. And then price-cost, a modest contribution. We're kind of back to a normal price-cost environment. And so that's not a significant driver. Really the big driver here, as I think you pointed out, are the enterprise initiatives that independent of volume, continue to contribute in a meaningful way, which is a great position to be in -- in a -- given where we are in the cycle, in a pretty challenging and uncertain environment. And without giving too much away, as we kind of look into the future beyond this year, we'd expect another solid contribution in 2025 and beyond. Tami Zakaria : Understood. Thank you. Michael Larsen : Sure. Operator : We'll go next to Joe Ritchie at Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : Hey, good morning, everybody. Christopher O'Herlihy: Good morning, Joe. Michael Larsen : Good morning. Joe Ritchie : Can we go back to Specialty for a second? You guys talked about the strategic positioning efforts there and when I think about that business, it's a hodgepodge of a bunch of different businesses that seemingly don't have a lot to do with each other. And so I'm just trying to understand like what's the kind of like overall strategy with the businesses within Specialty. And then what are you guys really doing to kind of drive this margin expansion sustainably higher over the long-term? Christopher O'Herlihy: Yes, so Joseph, specialty is indeed, as you said, a collection of high-quality, high-margin businesses. There is a concentration around consumer packaging, both on the equipment side, on the consumable side. There's also a bit of a concentration around appliance components. And then there's a collection of smaller businesses, one of which is primarily lined up alongside aerospace, that are very attractive and certainly capable of growth. So we're going through a strategic repositioning of some of those businesses in terms of heavier leaning on PLS. We haven't seen much growth in Specialty over the last few years, as you know, so that's what caused us to really look at the portfolio. But we feel very good about the progress we're making in terms of there's a lot of high differentiated product lanes in that segment. And this repositioning will put us in a position where we accentuate the growth of those, we resource those, and we maybe de-resource some other ones that are not in a position to grow. But overall, I would say it's a nice portfolio of businesses with a strong differentiation lineage running through it. And as I say, we are well-positioned to grow to some 4% plus in the long-term. Joe Ritchie : Okay, great, Chris. And then maybe just to follow-up to that is, sometimes companies will go through this, addition by subtraction exercise, and it sounds like you guys are in the process of improving the margins. The margins are already good. But it also kind of seems like there's an opportunity then for you guys to potentially divest some of those assets going forward, whether it's in the specialty business or beyond in the rest of your portfolio, how are you guys thinking about that equation in the divestiture side? Christopher O'Herlihy: Yes. So, we look at our portfolio on an ongoing basis. We believe we've got a very high-quality portfolio and if the opportunity comes to divest, we would certainly do that. I would say that as we think about portfolio management today, it's more likely to be in the realm of product-lane pruning as opposed to divestiture. Now, that could change, but as we look at it today, it's much more along the lanes of pruning within businesses as opposed to divestiture of businesses, I would say. Joe Ritchie : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll move next to Julian Mitchell at Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Christopher O'Herlihy: Good morning. Julian Mitchell : Maybe just a question around the free cash flow conversions, because I think it's sort of 67% in the first half, the year's guided a 100 plus. Doesn't seem like there should be a lot of working cap liquidation in the second half because the quarterly revenue run rate is kind of stable at $4 billion. So maybe just to flesh out the confidence in the cash conversion step up, please. Christopher O'Herlihy: Yes, sure, Julian. I mean, I think you're right. We are slightly below our typical conversion range here for the first half. And I think on the last call, we talked about our focus at the divisional level on reducing our inventory months on hand from we're right around 3.1 right now as compared to pre-COVID, 2.5 or even a little bit lower than that in some of our segments. So, we've made some progress. Inventory is down a double-digit on a year-over-year basis. But I would agree with you that we can definitely do better. We fully expect to take advantage of this opportunity in the second half to reduce inventory levels and generate above average free cash flow while, as I said, maintaining our typical ITW [indiscernible] customer service level. So big focus on this in the second half. And just given our track record around, kind of do what we say, execution, we feel like we're really well-positioned to generate above average free cash flow in the second half. Julian Mitchell : That's helpful. Thank you. And then just my second question would be around the sort of, it looks like the second half run rate on the total company sales and margins, very similar to Q2, as you normally guide, with sort of 26% margin, $4 billion revenue a quarter. You mentioned, Michael, the day sales effect in Q3, Q4, but just wondered, anything else in terms of seasonality for total company you'd remind us of for the third versus the fourth quarter? Any big moving parts on the segment margin as we step into the back half? I think Specialty, you've talked about Polymer & Fluid, I'm also curious about the margin outlook there, please. Michael Larsen : Yes. Yes, I think all good questions, Julian. I mean, Q3 looks a lot like Q2, I would say. We typically see a modest increase in revenues from Q3 to Q4, with emphasis on modest. And we also see typically a modest improvement in operating margins as we go through the year -- from Q2 to Q3 and then into Q4. And so there's really nothing unusual going on there. We do, as you pointed out, we do benefit from having a couple of extra days here in the second half and then, like I said, more favorable comparisons. The other thing that would not be in the run rates is what Chris talked about earlier, which is this increased contribution from new products coming in at higher margins. But we feel like we've really maybe taken not just an approach that's consistent with kind of how we've done it historically in terms of guidance, but a fairly conservative approach going into the second half. Certainly things can change quickly. Things kind of improve, but they can also deteriorate and hopefully, kind of parsing out for you the impact here in Q2 in terms of what a point of revenue growth sequentially means or decline means, the $50 million at the decremental that we talked about, I think gives you a way to kind of further risk adjust your numbers, or if you are more optimistic, you can certainly make those adjustments as well. But that's kind of how we think about the guidance here for the second half. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Michael Larsen : You're welcome. Operator : And we'll take our final question from Walt Liptak at Seaport Research. Walt Liptak : Good morning. Thanks, Chris and Mike. I wanted to ask a follow-up on the guidance and just a comment that you made on the first question about -- it sounds like June might have gotten a little bit better for some of the capital goods businesses like welding or maybe some others. I wonder if you can talk about that, that some of that macro industrial weakness start to get better. Christopher O'Herlihy: Well, yes, I think, Walt, June was -- things continued to moderate, particularly Auto Builds were softer in June. And then on the CapEx side, Welding, I think consistent with commentary you may have heard from some of our peers in the welding space. And then Test & Measurement, I think while we have not seen a pickup in semiconductor or electronics or CapEx, I would say semi also has not gotten worse. So it's kind of bumping along. And I would just add that we remain like really well-positioned for the inevitable recovery down the road. And I think if you look at, some of the segments with positive organic growth here in Q2, so you look at Specialty, you look at Polymers & Fluids, the operating leverage that we generate of fairly modest organic growth is pretty remarkable. So we're really well-positioned for that. We continue to invest, a lot of focus on new products, but we've not seen a pickup in those markets yet. But again, really well-positioned for the inevitable recovery down the road here, whenever that may happen. Walt Liptak : Okay. Yes, totally agree with that. On one of the segments it's doing -- that's growing, Food Equipment, you guys sounded kind of upbeat about kind of the retail chain, despite some of the bankruptcies that have been going on. I wonder if you can talk about, maybe in a little bit more detail, how that retail part of the business is moving? Christopher O'Herlihy: Yes, I mean, I think the retail growth similar to in the first quarter, I think up 9% here in the second quarter, and it's all driven by new products. So this is all way and wrap equipment and new product rollouts. And I'd say our customer base is not part of the population that you may be alluding to that's having trouble financially. I mean, these are all the big grocery store, retailers, chains that you would expect. And so we're not seeing any impact there from them being in trouble financially. Quite on -- quite the contrary. Walt Liptak : Okay, great. Okay, congratulations for that. Thanks. Christopher O'Herlihy: All right, thank you. Operator : That concludes the question-and-answer session.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the ITW's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Erin Linnihan, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. Erin Linnihan : Thank you, Kathleen. Good morning and welcome to ITW's third quarter 2024 conference call. Today, I'm joined by our President and CEO, Chris O'Hairlehy, and Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen. During today's call, we will discuss ITW's third quarter financial results and provide an update on our outlook for full year 2024. Slide 2 is a reminder that this presentation contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the company's 2023 Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. This presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release. Please turn to Slide 3, and it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Chris O'Hairlehy. Chris? Chris O'Hairlehy: Thank you, Erin, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our press release this morning, during the third quarter, the market demand environment continued to moderate across our portfolio with further softness in the Automotive and Construction markets. Overall, third quarter revenues came in approximately half a percentage point, or $25 million below what they would have been had demand held at the level we were seeing exiting the second quarter. That said, the slowdown in Q3 was less than in Q2, where revenue came in approximately one percentage point, or $50 million below run rate. As a result, third quarter organic revenue declined 1%, with five segments down year-over-year, partially offset by growth in two segments. This 1% revenue decline compares to our end markets, which we believe were down in the low to mid-single digits. As we have all year, the ITW team continued to successfully navigate and overcome these market challenges with strong operational execution. Those efforts resulted in operating income of $1.05 billion with operating margin of 26.5%, which included a 130 basis point contribution from enterprise initiatives. With little operating leverage, six of seven segments still increased operating margin, resulting in segment operating margin expansion of a 110 basis points. EPS grew 4% to $2.65, excluding the gains from the divestiture that Michael will review in more detail. The continued contribution from enterprise initiatives, regardless of volume, speaks to the power and resilience of our business model. And it is notable that for the first time, three of our segments delivered operating margin above 30% in the quarter. And we are well on our way to achieve our goal of 30% operating margin for the company by 2030. Our continued focused execution and typical operational excellence have enabled ITW to effectively counter persistent market headwinds and achieve increased profitability, where we continue to invest to maximize growth and performance over the long term. Consistent with our long-term commitment to return surplus capital to shareholders by an attractive and growing dividend, on August 2nd, we announced our 61st consecutive dividend increase, raising our dividend by 7%. And year-to-date, we have repurchased more than $1.1 billion of our outstanding shares. Today, we are raising our full-year GAAP EPS guidance by a $1.33, from a range of $10.30 to $10.40, to a new range of $11.63 to $11.73, to incorporate the impact of the divestiture gain and a lower projected tax rate for the full year. Based on current levels of demand exiting Q3, we are maintaining our previous operational guidance for revenue and organic growth to be approximately flat for the year and our operating margin to be between 26.5% and 27%. While the ITW team is in a commendable job managing the short-term challenges this year, perhaps more importantly, we continue to deliver solid progress on our next phase enterprise strategy priorities. As we outlined to you a year ago, the central focus of the next phase of our enterprise strategy is to elevate high-quality organic growth and customer-backed innovation as key ITW differentiators, on par with our best-in-class operational capabilities and financial performance. This quarter, we made further progress in our journey to achieve this strategic goal. We believe that customer-backed innovation, or CBI as we call it, is the most impactful driver of our ability to consistently grow revenue above market. In essence, the customer-backed innovation revenue of today fuels the ability to drive market penetration and share gain in the future. Over the past few years, we've made progress on expanding our revenue from CBI from less than a percent in 2017 to approximately 2% today. And at our September Leadership conference, we launched the next phase CBI framework for our 84 divisions around the world. Just as we successfully focused the entire organization on 80-20 front-to-back over a decade ago, we are now doubling down on customer-backed innovation. And I, for one, can feel the energy, excitement, and momentum from our team as they implement this strategy at each division. With our continued laser focus on our typical do-what-we-say execution, it is with strong conviction that I know we will build above-market organic growth fueled by customer-backed innovation into a defining ITW strength. In concluding my remarks, I want to thank all of our ITW colleagues around the world for their exceptional efforts and dedication in serving our customers with excellence and driving continuous progress on our path to ITW's full potential. I now turn the call over to Michael to discuss our Q3 performance and full year guidance in more detail. Michael. Michael Larsen : Thank you, Chris. And good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 3, and as expected, the third quarter ended up looking a lot like the second quarter with continued strong operational execution in a moderating demand environment. Total revenue declined 1.6%, with organic revenue down 1.4%. Foreign currency translation reduced revenue by 0.4%, and acquisitions increased revenue by 0.2%. On a geographic basis, organic revenue declined about 3% in North America. Europe was down 0.5% and Asia Pacific was down 1% with China, essentially flat. In this environment, the ITW team continued to focus and execute well on the things that we can control as evidenced by six of our seven segments, expanding operating margin, driven primarily by enterprise initiatives that contributed between 70 and a 180 basis points to each segment and a 130 basis points at the enterprise level. Third quarter operating margin was 26.5%, up 30 basis points sequentially from the second quarter and flat with the prior year due to a tough comparison. As you may recall, last year's Q3 margin of 26.5% expanded 200 basis points compared to 2022 due in part to the favorable impact of a few corporate items that we discussed on the call last year, including a one-time insurance recovery. Excluding those one-time items last year and looking just at segment operating margin, which is included in the press release tables, our segment operating margin increased by a 110 basis points compared to the prior year, which is more in line with our typical margin expansion on a quarterly basis. GAAP EPS of $3.91 was up 53% and included a $1.26 gain from the divestiture of our non-controlling equity interest in Wilsonart. Excluding this gain, EPS of $2.65 was an increase of 4% year-over-year. I want to spend a minute on a previously announced Wilsonart divestiture. The proceeds from the transaction, net of transaction costs were approximately $395 million, which we reduced to reduce our commercial paper balance. The transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $363 million and income taxes on the gain were more than offset by a discrete tax benefit of a $107 million related to the utilization of capital loss carry forwards, which resulted in the favorable GAAP EPS impact of a $1.26. Free cash flow was $783 million, which was 102% conversion of adjusted net income. And as Chris mentioned in the third quarter, we raised our dividend by 7% to an annualized payout of $6 per share, which marks our 61st consecutive year of increases. And as planned, we repurchased $375 million of our own shares during the quarter. The effective tax rate in the quarter of 14.9% was below our typical tax rate in the 24% to 25% range. As you can see from the reconciliation, the press release, the tax rate was favorably impacted by several discrete items in the quarter, including the Wilsonart transaction. Excluding these discrete items, our core tax rate was 23.7%. So in summary, the third quarter looked a lot like the second quarter with moderating, but also stable demand and solid operating margin and profitability performance as we continue to focus and execute well on the things that we can control. Please turn to Slide 4, for a look at our year-to-date segment margin performance. And as you can see from the table on the left side, six of our seven segments have expanded their already best-in-class margins year-to-date and three segments by more than a 100 basis points. Food Equipment is a bit of an outlier due to the growth investments in our service business and specifically the near-term inefficiencies associated with on-boarding of new service technicians to support accelerated organic growth in this business. This margin headwind is now largely behind the Food Equipment segment as evidenced by a 110 basis points of margin improvement in the third quarter. Total company margin is up a 180 basis points, which in fairness includes a 100 basis points from the one-time LIFO adjustment in the first quarter, but still solid performance in the current environment. Moving to the segments and starting with Automotive OEM, organic revenue declined 3% in the third quarter as industry build rates continue to come down. North America was down 6% as the D3 customer bills were down 9%. Europe was down 5% and China was down 2%. Compared to the automobile industry build data, the segment has outperformed bills by about 200 basis points year-to-date and we expect similar outperformance in the fourth quarter. The segment also delivered solid operating margin performance of 19.4% and 50 basis points increase despite lower volume and we expect more progress in the fourth quarter and next year as we continue to work towards our long-term goal of achieving operating margins in the low to mid 20s by 2026 in this segment. Turn to Slide 5, organic revenue in Food Equipment was about flat against a tough comp of plus 6% last year as equipment was down 4% and offset by service, which grew 7%. Regionally, North America was down 2% after being up 10% last year with institutional sales about flat as healthcare was up mid single digits and restaurants were down about 10%. International was solid up 3% with the service business up 8% and Europe up 4%. Operating margin improved a 110 basis points due to the service margin normalizing and a solid contribution from enterprise initiatives. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect margin to continue to improve as we go through the year. Test & Measurement and Electronics, organic revenue was down only 1% after being down 3% last quarter with stable demand in Semiconductor Electronics and CapEx sensitive end markets. While Test & Measurement was down 3%, Electronics was up 1% in the quarter after being down 3% last quarter. And this marked the first quarter of positive growth in Electronics since the end of 2022. And we're beginning to see increased Semiconductor customer activity suggesting that perhaps we are near a bottom for this market. As we've discussed before, we remain very well positioned to capitalize on the growth opportunities in this space when the inevitable recovery does happen. Operating margin expanded by 190 basis points in the quarter to 25.7%. Moving on to Slide 6, Welding's organic revenue declined 1%, a meaningful improvement from being down 5% in the second quarter as both Equipment and Consumables revenue declined 1%. Both America revenue was down 2% but International was up 6% with solid growth in Europe and China. As we talked about at the beginning of the year, the Welding team was planning on a solid contribution to the top line from the launch of new products, which in the third quarter resulted in a 3% plus contribution to growth. And this is just one of many examples inside the company that illustrates how continued progress on CBI as Chris was talking about, gives our segments the ability to gain share and outgrow their end markets. Operating margin of 32.3% was a third quarter record for the Welding segment. Polymers & Fluids, organic revenue grew 1% with Polymers up 10% due to international strength and Fluids was up 3%. Automotive aftermarket, which as you know, is tied closely to consumer discretionary spending was down 3% in the quarter. On a geographic basis, North America declined 5% and International grew 11% with Europe again showing solid demand. Turn to Slide 7, organic revenue in Construction products was down 9% as Construction end markets took a sizable step back from the second quarter with new housing starts down 10% on an annualized basis as compared to down 6% in the second quarter. As a result, North America declined 10% with residential down 12% and commercial construction down 7%. Europe was down 4% and Australia and New Zealand was down 11%. Despite the lower volume, operating margin of 30.2% was a record for the segment with another significant contribution from enterprise initiatives. Finally, specialty products had a solid quarter with organic revenue growth of 6% with strength across the portfolio as both Equipment and Consumables were up 6%. North America was up 8% and International grew 2%. The 6% growth rate for the segment included about 200 basis points of PLS or product line simplification in the quarter. As we continue to make progress on repositioning some of our specialty products divisions for consistent above market organic growth. We expect about 300 basis points of PLS in the fourth quarter and that the segment will be flat to up low single digits for the full year. Operating margin expanded 330 basis points to 31.1%, a third quarter record for the segment with strong contributions from operating leverage and enterprise initiatives. Moving to Slide 8 and our updated full year 2024 guidance. As you've seen all year, the ITW team continues to execute at a very high level and find a way to leverage our business model and high quality diversified business portfolio to deliver solid operational and financial results in a challenging demand environment. Looking ahead at the fourth quarter, we do not expect the near-term demand environment to improve, and as usual, our guidance is based on current levels of demand, seasonally adjusted, and foreign currency exchange rates. As a result, we're maintaining our previous projection for revenue and organic growth to be approximately flat for the year. We're also maintaining our full year operating margin guidance, which is projected to be between 26.5% and 27%, an improvement of a 165 basis points at the midpoint, with enterprise initiatives contributing more than a 100 basis points. As you saw in the press release, we incorporated the impact of the Wilsonart divestiture gain and a lower projected effective tax rate of 21.5% for the full year into our EPS guidance, as we raised GAAP EPS guidance from a range of $10.30 to $10.40 per share by $1.33 to a new range of $11.63 to $11.73 per share. Excluding the Wilsonart gain, EPS range is $10.37 to $10.47 per share, or $10.42 at the midpoint. So, in summary, while the overall demand environment remains pretty uncertain and challenging in the near term, we remain laser-focused on leveraging ITW's unique strengths and capabilities to optimize our ability to deliver differentiated performance over the long term. And with that, Erin, I'll turn it back to you. Erin Linnihan : Thank you, Michael. Kathleen, will you please open the queue for questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open. Jeff Sprague : Hello. Good morning, everyone. Chris O'Hairlehy: Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Good morning. Hey, I just wanted to sort of pick up sort of where you left off there, Michael, with kind of the trends into the fourth quarter. I don't know, unless my math is wrong, I think kind of sequentially you're looking at revenues of maybe 4% or 5%, when normally they declined slightly. So, was your exit rate in September or your early read in October kind of better than what we saw in the quarter in aggregate? Or maybe you could just clarify if I'm missing anything there. Michael Larsen : Yeah, sure, Jeff. So, let me start by saying, as you know, we don't give quarterly guidance. And as you were trying to do based on our year-to-date performance and our full year guidance, you can get pretty close in terms of figuring out Q4. But maybe let me try to help out a little bit. So, I'd say at a high level, Q4 looks a lot like Q3. Typically what we see from a seasonality standpoint is a sequential improvement in revenues from Q3 to Q4, about a point to a point and a half. And that's going all the way back to 2017. So, at current run rates, typically we're up a point to a point and a half. We do have easier comparisons in the fourth quarter. And for what it's worth, there's also an extra shipping day in the quarter. So, you add all that up, we get to about flat revenues on a year-over-year basis. We expect, again, our typical margin improvement of about 100 basis points on a year-over-year basis. So, that is a slight decline from Q3 to Q4, which is kind of the typical seasonality. And the main driver here remains another strong contribution from the enterprise initiatives. And then factoring in a more kind of normal tax rate for us in that 24%, 25% range. And you get to EPS at the midpoint. And I'm just doing the math. I'm not giving guidance that's in that 2.51 range for the fourth quarter. So, I'll just add, while we're talking about the fourth quarter, we do expect a strong quarter, again, from a free cash flow standpoint. And we're projecting some meaningful improvement on our inventory levels in the fourth quarter, which is not easy in the current demand environment. So, hopefully that's helpful, Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Yes. No, it's very helpful. Thanks for that color. And then just kind of secondarily, your business in China is not huge. It's very important for Auto, though. And it was just kind of interesting that China Welding was solid. A lot of cross-currents there. Like, we had some pretty ugly China numbers out of Trane and Otis today. Those are different businesses, obviously. But maybe this is for Chris. Can you just maybe give us your bigger picture view on what's going on there? And also just kind of given the importance of Auto, anything in this kind of China-Europe tariff spat around Automotive influence your view or outlook at all? Chris O'Hairlehy: Yeah. So, I think from the Auto China standpoint, Jeff, I mean, China builds this year in Auto are expected to be up 1%. We expect to be up 8%. So, our businesses continue to penetrate very successfully in China. And EV obviously is a large part of the story, given the fact that China is producing about 60% of the world's EVs. But we're making very strong penetration gains in EV in China, as evidenced by the market growth. In Auto in general, we expect to be up a couple of percent against flat builds this year. Sorry, flat versus negative down 2% -- up 2%, I would say as we have been kind of historically would expect to be on into the future. And that that strength has been pretty much across all three geographies, Europe, North America, but especially in China. Michael Larsen : So, let me just add a little bit of color. So, I think if you look at the third quarter, about flat with Auto, as we said down 2. And certainly some challenges also in Test & Measurement down single-digit, low single-digits, same in Food Equipment. So, strength in Welding which is tied to oil and gas, LNG, transportation, and also some strength in our specialty products, appliance business. So, you all add up, you get to about flat for the quarter, up 6% year-to-date. We think in the fourth quarter, as Chris said, we'll see a pickup on the Automotive side, continued strength in Welding. And so, Q4 should be kind of flat, maybe up a low single-digit and the full year up in that 5% range. So, as we sit here today, I think we feel pretty good about China. I know there's a lot of talk about stimulus and so forth. We haven't seen a lot of that yet. So, if that's still to come, that would certainly be helpful. But as we sit here today, we feel pretty good about China. Chris O'Hairlehy: Okay. Thank you for the color. Michael Larsen : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook of Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Jamie Cook : Hi, good morning. Michael Larsen : Morning. Jamie Cook : I have two questions. One, I was impressed with the specialty growth in the quarter despite headwinds from PLS and I know Specialty is special, because there's a lot of different businesses in there. Can you just sort of break down what you're seeing within that business? What segments drove sort of the organic growth? That would be my first question. And then I'll give you my follow-up after that. Chris O'Hairlehy: Yeah. So, Jamie, I think a good part of the Specialty story is strengthened Aerospace. We have one particular business that's focused on Aerospace. And again, we saw about 30% growth in that business this quarter. We saw, I'd say, pockets of strong demand I think throughout the segment, areas like consumer packaging. Consumer packaging equipment were also pretty strong. And we did have some favorable comms in Specialty versus last year. But even with all that, we expect Specialty to be up kind of low single-digits for the full year. And it's really strengthening our conviction that on the basis of the strategic portfolio positioning we've been doing in that segment, which involves some, as we said before, some product line pruning throughout the segment which is certainly choppy, and it's creating a bit of a drag, as Michael just indicated a couple of 100 basis points this year. But what it does, what this is all doing is really strengthening our conviction that the objective to make Specialty a 4% grower in the long term is well on track here. And everything we've seen this year gives us a strong belief that we can do that. Michael Larsen : And I think the only thing I'd add is just, Jamie, if you look at the margin performance, you can see what happens at ITW, and this is not unique to Specialty when you get a little bit of operating leverage, suddenly you're in that 31% plus range, which is certainly very encouraging and gives us, as we said earlier, a lot of conviction and ability to get to that 30% target at the enterprise level with three segments this quarter above 30%, which is, that's the first time that's happened. And again, that's with very little operating leverage. So that's certainly really, really gives -- pretty encouraging as we look also into next year in terms of the momentum around the margin performance of the company continues. Jamie Cook : And that's helpful, because I think some of the bears think the 30% plus is challenging for you guys to do. So it's nice to see that. I guess one more follow up. Chris, you talked about market outgrowth in Auto. You talked about Welding from the new product introductions, and even on Food, the increased service effort. As you go through CBI, and you're now, you've been with ITW forever, but CEO for a longer period of time. Are there any businesses that you're considering are more challenged, like over the longer term that you think is going to be tough to get to the organic growth targets that you have? You don't have to say which ones, but just understanding if there's any difference in how you're thinking about the portfolio relative to when you first took over. Thanks. Chris O'Hairlehy: Not at all, Jamie. I think if we go back to Investor Day last year, we were very overt in our comments that we felt that all seven of our segments have the capability to grow 4% plus. And we certainly believe that today, and even more so. With respect to CBI, the CBI opportunity, I think is very relevant across all seven segments. And we're at different points in terms of the development around that. But I think, everything we've seen would indicate that all these segments have a pretty fertile innovation environment, have critical customer pain points that are there to be solved. We're certainly mobilizing the company around that in very similar way to where we mobilized the company around front to back 10, 12 years ago. With the same kind of capability build and investment in resources, a much higher level of leadership kind of time and focus around CBI, we have lots of great innovation practice across the company. And we've now codified that into a very effective innovation framework. And this is the exact same approach that we took on 80-20 front to back, which as we know was very successful. And we've seen this. I mean, this is not something that's starting today. We've been working on this for a couple of years now in terms of focused investment in resources and CBI. And we've seen that in terms of the improvement in yield that we've seen from CBI. So there is a lot of conviction here that the yield improvement from one to somewhere over two today will be north of three in due course. And we have a very clear path to doing that. And like I said, that's going to result in improvements in every one of our segments on the ultimate journey to having every one of these segments growing at 4 plus. Jamie Cook : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz of Citi Group. Please go ahead. Andy Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning, everyone. Michael Larsen : Morning, Andy. Andy Kaplowitz : Chris and Michael, I know you've been hopeful about a turn in Test & Measurement for much of this year. And you did mention maybe more positive discussions with Semiconductor customers and you did see Electronics turn positive. So maybe you can give us some more color on the conversations you're having. The outlook obviously, you're always going to predict run rates, but as you go into \u201825, do you see a better outlook for the segment? Chris O'Hairlehy: Yeah, I think based on the customer conversations that we are having, we're starting to see a bottoming, particularly in Semi. Just to characterize, Semi is about 15% of Test & Measurement. It represents a couple of percent of ITW's revenues. So just to put it in context, but there's no doubt that we saw a bottoming and slight improvement in this, I think, in the third quarter. Electronics, similarly, had been down for quite a while, significantly down earlier this year. It's starting to bottom there as well. And then I think an important kind of bellwether for us, the Instron business, which is a critical business within Test & Measurement, had very solid growth during the quarter. And that's certainly encouraging as we look here for the balance of the year and on into next year. Andy Kaplowitz : It's helpful, Chris. And then, Michael, I think you mentioned, I think, what you call the solid step back in Construction markets in Q3. Do you see any hint of stabilization as you go toward the end of the year in those markets? I mean, obviously, we started a U.S. rate cutting cycle. Maybe what changed in Q3 versus Q2 in your businesses that led to this step down? Michael Larsen : Well, I think, Andy, we're talking about our most interest rate-sensitive segment. So, I think what we're seeing here is a market that's down in the low teens. I pointed in the script to kind of the housing start numbers being down 10% on an annualized basis, which kind of mirrors our business in North America. Maybe we're a little bit better than that. And then we're seeing similar type of softness in Australia, New Zealand, which is a meaningful part of our business. So, I think at this point, it's really too early to point to any signs or indicators that things are getting better here. Over the long term, certainly the fact that interest rates appear to be coming down has been a leading indicator, but we've not seen anything to suggest that things are picking up in Construction at this point. So, and I'll just say in that context, I think it's even more remarkable that we -- the team put up margins of 30% plus here in the third quarter in an environment that's certainly pretty challenging. So, and about as challenging as we see across the company at this point in the cycle. Andy Kaplowitz : Appreciate it, guys. Michael Larsen : Sure. See you, Andy. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tami Zakaria of J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open. Tami Zakaria : Hi, good morning, Team ITW. Hope you're doing well. Chris O'Hairlehy: Good morning, team Tami. Tami Zakaria : Thank you. So, my first question is on margins. Very nice margin performance in the quarter. I'm curious, what was price cost in the quarter? And more broadly, how are you thinking about Enterprise initiative and related margin improvement potential in 2025? It seems like almost like an endless well at this point, and I mean it positively. So, any forward-looking comments about Enterprise initiatives and what you're expecting for next year would be helpful. Michael Larsen : Yeah, let me do price cost and then, Chris, if you can add some commentary on Enterprise initiatives. But I think at this point Tami, as we said before, price cost has kind of normalized. This is no longer a distraction as it was back in \u201821, \u201822, and \u201823. At this point, price dollars are ahead of costs on a dollar basis and modestly positive from a margin standpoint. Now, that, just to be clear, doesn't mean that costs are coming down, particularly Electronics, Energy in certain geographies, components that have labor content. We're also seeing it in our employee costs, health and welfare, and other pockets, overhead costs such as just to point out, rental expense, leases, software licenses. So, we have to continue to be very diligent in this area and make sure that we get price to offset all of these pressures. But overall, nothing significant to point to on the price cost equation. And then maybe on the Enterprise initiatives, Chris. Chris O'Hairlehy: Sure. So Tami as we said, Enterprise initiatives continue to be an important contributor to results. And how we think about these initiatives is that these initiatives, they are independent of volume and they're really an outcome of the continuous improvement mindset that's very much part of ITW's DNA, I would say. And this is what really drives this divisional kind of quality of practice and 80-20 front to back in sourcing. And typically very bottom-up initiatives driven by our talented people in our divisions at a very granular level. Most of these initiatives are in the couple of hundred thousand dollar range and in terms of individually. But when you have 84 divisions, these add up to a very meaningful number. So, the divisions have a lot of visibility, ownership, and accountability on these. And the track record has indicated over the last 11 years, our divisions are going to do what they say when they forecast these. So, our confidence on enterprise initiatives going forward, that this will continue really is an outcome of this strong ownership and accountability that resides in our divisions and the strong continuous improvement mindset that I refer to that's really hardwired into our divisions at this point. And the case of 80-20, as we know, this is the gift that keeps on giving. So, with that we certainly see an ongoing contribution from Enterprise initiatives going forward, including in 2025. And this is a fundamental part of how we drive differentiated execution in any environment. Tami Zakaria : Got it. That is very helpful. Thank you. And my second question is more strategic. So, there's a lot of optimism around data centers, AI, power generation, power demand, so on and so forth. How do you assess these opportunities internally? Do you see an opportunity for ITW to increase this exposure to some of these trends, maybe organically or through acquisitions? So, how do you evaluate some of these scenes? Chris O'Hairlehy: So, I think as it relates to data centers specifically, we have standard characteristics of businesses that we would pursue for acquisition based on sustainable differentiation. So, if an opportunity came along that was data center related and met our normal criteria, then we'd be all in based on the characteristics of having a business that could grow above market, that we could leverage our business model, and we could acquire at the right valuation. And that applies to everything, not just data centers. So, we don't have a specific focus on data centers. We kind of look at all these things on an equal basis in terms of their long-term attractiveness for us. Tami Zakaria : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe O\u2019Dea from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Joe O\u2019Dea : Hi. Good morning. First, just wanted to ask on, and kind of specific to North America, but interested in kind of CapEx versus OpEx trends, and I think appreciating a pretty quick book and ship model. I'm not sure how much you would see this, but we do hear about inquiry activity being better than order activity out there. And so, curious the degree to which you see some of that or hear some of that from your salesforce and customer tone. As I think about rates starting to come down, I think some folks waiting for getting post-election, and just the idea that you're getting a sense that there is some pent up demand that hasn't moved forward with some uncertainty overhang, and thoughts on that potentially moving forward nearer term. Chris O'Hairlehy: Well, I think, Joe, I'd start by saying we're not economists and we're not trying to predict the impossible here, which is where the economy is going. We are, as you said much more short cycle. Our divisions do a great job kind of reading and reacting to what's going on in their respective end markets. I would just make a broader comment based on what we saw in the third quarter, which is some stability in the more CapEx sensitive businesses. So, I'll point to Welding, as I mentioned. I'll point to Test & Measurement, including our Instron business, which was up in a meaningful way on a year-to-year basis and improved kind of quoting and order activity. So, maybe that squares with what you were talking about. And then the softness in Q3 was really much more tied to Construction and Automotive production, specifically with our customers, with the T3 customers. But certainly some stability in CapEx, and we'll see where it goes from here. We're modeling based on current run rates. So, based on what we're seeing in our businesses today, and we'll see how it all plays out as we go into 2025. And interest rates maybe -- would be a little helpful if they came lower for sure. So\u2026 Joe O\u2019Dea : Nope, I appreciate that color. And then just wanted to ask on CBI, as we think about it becoming sort of a growing initiative. Just what it means on the R&D side and the degree to which you can keep R&D relative to sales at sort of similar levels or what you're doing there, as we would think, to drive more innovation you might need to allocate a little bit more there. Chris O'Hairlehy: Yeah, so for us spend in R&D or innovation is largely an outcome of basically request more divisions. Basically, we fund all the good projects. We've been making over the last three or four years, making very focused investments in areas like innovation and strategic marketing. We expect that to continue. But if that number was to go up, that's not a problem for us. It's really an outcome of funding all these good projects. And our teams are really focused on their 80 opportunities in their markets with their key customers. And whatever we spend in R&D typically is an outcome of that. And we're very happy to spend it because it's typically money well spent on the degree of focus that our businesses have. Michael Larsen : Yeah. And just from a numerical standpoint, I'd say, R&D spend the way we've defined it here over the years is about 1.8% of sales. So as sales grow, so will the R&D dollar spend. And we don't foresee any significant change in that as we go forward. As Chris said, we really fund every project that our divisions put forward and that's important to them. And so that's how we approach it here. Really in terms of it's an outcome of this process that Chris described. Joe O\u2019Dea : Appreciate it. Thank you. Chris O'Hairlehy: Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sabrina Abrams of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Sabrina Abrams : Hi, good morning. As a follow up to some of the CBI commentary and questions, I think back at your investor day, the framework for CBI for segment was about 2% to 3% contribution and its most meaningful driver to reach long term targets. Are you on track for that this year? And I understand it's relevant to all seven segments. But maybe if you could provide any color on which segments you think are more mature in this journey. Chris O'Hairlehy: Yeah, so we're very much on track to do 3% plus inline with our target by 2030, if not indeed before that, based on the progress that we are making. We're at varying levels of accomplishment currently across our seven segments. I would point to Welding as an example. This year, as we've highlighted, Michael highlighted his commentary, our Welding business is suffering some significant end market challenges, but we're getting north of 3% contribution CBI in Welding. As we forecasted at the beginning of the year, several new product launches. So Welding will be one, Test & Measurement, Electronics, obviously an area of significant attractiveness around innovation in the context of what's going on in those markets. New materials being developed, all of which require to be tested, increasing stringency in areas like R&D and in quality control, all of which requires more and more sophisticated testing equipment which really speaks to our competitive advantages. And then the other one I'd highlight is Food Equipment. Food Equipment, sustainability in areas of energy savings, water savings is a very fertile innovation environment, and we've managed to leverage that for several years. And the other one, of course, I point to is Auto. Auto, given the disruptive nature of Auto right now, particularly with the increased penetration of electric vehicles, provides enormous opportunity for innovation. And we're capitalizing on that as evidenced by the fact that our electric vehicle penetration into electric vehicles is higher than the market average. So, I feel pretty good about all seven segments, but those are the four that I'd highlight right now. Sabrina Abrams : Thank you. And it seems some of the above average PLS in Specialty products is behind us and that business is growing nicely. You guys got rid of Wilsonart. Moving past some of this portfolio rationalization, is there more appetite to do M&A, given some of these divestitures are behind us? Chris O'Hairlehy: Yes, I would say our posture on M&A hasn't changed. And since we outlined this at the leadership conference. And we've got a pretty disciplined portfolio strategy. We believe clear and well-defined view of what fits our strategy. And so it's a case of us finding the right opportunities. And for us, we're focused on high quality acquisitions that extend our ability to grow at a minimum 4% over the long term. That's the first criteria. The second criteria we look at is that we're able to leverage the business model to improve margins and then obviously acquiring the business at the right valuation to provide a decent long term return for our shareholders. We review opportunities on an ongoing basis, but we're very selective on the basis of these criteria. And if I could point to MTS as an example, MTS was an example of an acquisition we did 2.5 years ago, which fulfilled all of our criteria. And thanks to a very strong execution. That's now turning out to be a home run on the basis of being pretty selectable, the criteria going in, strong execution when we acquire it. And now we've got a business that in the long term will be a superb ITW business. Sabrina Abrams : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. I was hoping this might be one call I could escape AI data centers, but I think they got dragged in minutes ago. Chris O'Hairlehy: We didn't bring it up, just for the record. Julian Mitchell : No, totally fair, totally fair. If we think just for a second, Michael or Chris about sort of inventories, just curious about your own levels and those of your customers or distributor partners, I think your own inventories dollar wise are pretty steady sequentially this year, but still running a little bit high as a share of revenue versus pre-COVID, maybe 11% versus something like 8% five years ago, six years ago. Is 11 sort of a good run rate from here? Or no, it should come down over time, but gradually just as the revenue picks up? And then how do you assess the sort of state of play of inventories that your distributors and customers, so they kind of generally right size now after two years of being leaned out? Michael Larsen : Yeah, I think that's right, Julian. Let's start there. The channel, I think those inventory levels have normalized. Our channel doesn't carry a lot of inventory because they're used to our place in order today, we ship you tomorrow. So with that level of customer service, there's no incentive for them to carry a lot of inventory. And then I would kind of pivoting to our own inventory levels. I'd say just more broadly on free cash flow, it was good to be above 100% again here in the third quarter, which is more aligned with the typical levels that you expect from us. And we expect to continue to make meaningful progress again in Q4 on the inventory and free cash flow. So we've talked about our focus on reducing our months on hand, getting back to kind of pre-COVID levels of about 2.5 months on hand, we're about 3. The difference here is in that $300 million to $400 million range of additional inventory that we'll expect to come out Q4 and then into next year. So we view that, I think the same way you do as a big opportunity to drive above average free cash flow for the company here in the near term. I think we've made some progress down, I think it's 6% year-over-year. Last year, inventories came down 17%, but we can certainly, we agree that there's some opportunity here and we want to do that, reduce inventory levels while maintaining those customer service levels, which is where I started because we believe they're a real competitive advantage for us. And the last thing I'll say is all of this, the fact that maybe we're a little bit lower this year free cash flow than in prior years, doesn't impact our capital allocation plans. We're investing in our businesses for growth and productivity, all new products are funded. We raised the dividend 7% in August and we're buying back 1.5 billion of our shares this year as planned. But I agree with you that there's definitely an opportunity here and we're going after it in every one of our 84 divisions in a meaningful way here. Julian Mitchell : That's a very good answer. Thank you. And then just my follow-up, sort of thinking again about that question of customer-backed innovation and driving up organic growth and market share. I think as you said, sort of R&D to sales is pretty steady. So maybe flattish dollars year-to-date versus last year. CapEx was sort of flattish year-to-date, down somewhat in the third quarter year-on-year. So when we're thinking about kind of the levers of getting that market share up, and it's in the context of a sort of decentralized operating structure where you're sort of letting the businesses ask you for R&D dollars. Maybe give us one or two examples of how you're driving up that share? How does that interplay work between trying to get more dollars of spend into different businesses with a high return versus that kind of decentralized nature? Any sort of examples around that might be helpful for me, at least. Chris O'Hairlehy: Yes. I would say Julian, that our spend in innovation has been rising over the last two or three years. I mean, we've seen double-digit increases in spend on the basis of pretty focused investments in strategic marketing and innovation across the portfolio. But a lot of this goes beyond spend. It really comes down to a much higher level of, I think, leadership time and focus. As I said, we're already doubling down on this in the same way we doubled down on 80-20 front-to-back last time. And we've been investing in building capability really for the last few years here. And I think you can see that in the increased yield that we've had since, like \u201817 \u201818, where it was about 1%, to now where it's about 2%. So we're already seeing the investments. And this capability build is both in our divisions, but also at our segment level to really enable our businesses to be able to achieve this. A lot of this comes down to the quality of the framework. We have a lot of great innovation practice across the company. We've codified that, and now we want to make sure that it resides everywhere in every division in ITW. And this is the exact same approach that we took on 80-20 front-to-back that was very successful in the last phase of our strategy. So we're on a great path here. We've already seen the outcomes. We expect to see a continuous improvement in CBI contribution every year from here on out, starting in 2025. Julian Mitchell : That's great. Thanks, Chris. Chris O'Hairlehy: Sure. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones at Stifel. Please go ahead. Adam Farley : Hey, good morning. This is Adam Farley on for Nathan. I wanted to follow up on Welding. What impact do you believe the upcoming election is having on the sentiment in the underlying industrial market? Do we potentially see an improvement in \u201825, maybe post-election? Michael Larsen : Maybe I'll... Do you want to jump in? Chris O'Hairlehy: Yes. So at a high level, Nathan, I would say, look we're a short-sighted company. So we're kind of reading and reacting to what's in front of us. There's nothing overt or specific that we're hearing from our customers related to the election, I would say. Michael Larsen : Yeah, I would agree with that. I think there's some, other than anecdotes, there's really nothing specific that we can point to. And I think that we'll kind of leave it at that. Adam Farley : Okay. Fair enough. I know it wasn't called out in the press release, but was there any hurricane impact at your sites or maybe at your customer sites? Michael Larsen : No, not at our sites. I can't speak for all of our, thousands of customers in those affected regions, but there was no impact on our facilities or, and thank God, on our people in those areas. Adam Farley : Okay. Thank you for taking my question. Michael Larsen : All right. Thanks, Adam. Erin Linnihan : And Kathleen, I think that ends the call for us today. Operator : Yes. There are no further questions at this time. Thank you, everyone, for participating in today's conference call. All lines may disconnect at this time.",

Good morning, and welcome to Illinois Tool Works Inc.'s fourth quarter 2024 conference call. I'm joined by our President and CEO, Chris O'Hearlihy, and Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen. During today's call, we will discuss Illinois Tool Works Inc.'s fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results and provide guidance for full year 2025. Slide two is a reminder that this presentation contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the company's 2023 Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. This presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release. Please turn to slide three, and it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Chris O'Harelahe. Chris? Chris O'Hearlihy: Thank you, Erin. Good morning, everyone. You saw in our press release this morning, in Q4, Illinois Tool Works Inc. delivered a solid finish to the year. We outperformed our underlying end markets with organic growth turning positive excluding pipeline simplification, and we continue to execute well controlling the controllables to expand operating margins and free cash flow to record levels. GAAP EPS improved 7% to $2.54. In end markets that we believe were down in the low to mid-single digits, fourth quarter organic revenue declined half a point, which is a point better than the 1.4% decline in Q3. Excluding the impact of product line simplification, primarily due to strategically positioning for growth, in our Specialty Products segment, organic revenue growth was positive 0.4%. Overall demand was steady in Q4, with some improvement relative to demand levels going into the quarter. Revenue came in approximately two percentage points or $70 million above what they would have been had demand held at the levels we were seeing exiting the third quarter. In addition to outperforming our end markets, the Illinois Tool Works Inc. team did a solid job executing operationally, resulting in operating income of $1.03 billion, an increase of 4% despite total revenues that were down more than 1%. Record operating margin of 26.2% was an increase of 140 basis points with a 120 basis point contribution from enterprise initiatives. As a result of strong working capital management, primarily around inventory, free cash flow increased 10%, with a conversion to net income of 133%. Looking back in 2024, the Illinois Tool Works Inc. team delivered another year of solid operational and financial performance, achieving record financial results, including EPS, margins, and returns as we consistently outperformed underlying end markets, particularly evident in segments such as automotive OEM and construction products. We made continued progress on our next phase key strategic priorities. In 2025, we will build on this momentum and remain laser-focused on building above-market organic growth fueled by customer-back innovation into a defining Illinois Tool Works Inc. strength, on par with our world-class financial and operational capabilities, and deliver differentiated performance in whatever environment we face. We still have some work ahead of us as we position the company to deliver 3% plus CPI yield by 2030, but we are pleased with achieving 2% in 2024, more than double our historical pre-COVID levels. Furthermore, I'm particularly encouraged by the progress we're making on a key leading indicator of CBI yield, patent filings, which increased 18% in 2024. Turning to our guidance, we are very well positioned to continue to execute at a very high level again in 2025, on both the top and bottom line. Our usual revenue guidance approach, our organic growth projection of 1% to 3% excluding TLS reflects current levels of demand adjusted for seasonality. Although there are certainly some positive signals in our businesses, the current reality is that we are not yet seeing these reflected in orders. Having said that, we are very well positioned to capitalize on an improving demand environment if it should materialize. Our EPS guidance midpoint of $10.35 reflects the fact that we are faced with non-operational headwinds including a foreign currency translation impact of $0.30. Our expected operating margin improvement of 100 basis points is powered by another solid contribution from enterprise initiatives independent of volume. In concluding my remarks this morning, I again want to extend my sincere gratitude to our global colleagues for their unwavering dedication to serving our customers and executing our strategy with excellence. Now I'll turn the call over to Michael to provide more detail on the quarter and full year performance as well as our guidance for 2025. Michael? Michael Larsen : Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. In Q4, the Illinois Tool Works Inc. team delivered a solid finish operationally and financially to a record year. Starting with the top line, organic growth was down 0.5%, which included a 0.9% revenue reduction from strategic product line simplification. Foreign currency translation reduced revenue by 1%, and two acquisitions earlier in the year added 0.2%. Total revenues were down 1.3%. Sequentially, revenue growth of plus 3.7% from Q3 to Q4 compared favorably to our historical sequential growth of plus 1.5%. On a geographic basis, organic revenue declined about 1.5% in North America, was down 3%, and Asia Pacific was up 5% with China up 9%. On the bottom line, the Illinois Tool Works Inc. team continued to focus and execute well on the things within our control, as evidenced by an operating margin of 26.2%, an increase of 140 basis points year over year driven by enterprise initiatives, which contributed 120 basis points. Six of our seven segments expanded operating margin, driven primarily by strong execution of enterprise initiatives that contributed between 70 and 190 basis points to each segment. In summary, for Q4, we outperformed our underlying end markets with positive organic growth, achieved record margin performance with a strong contribution from enterprise initiatives, and generated record free cash flow and record GAAP EPS of $2.54. Please start with slide four. Operating cash flow was $1.1 billion, and free cash flow increased 10%, a quarterly record of $1 billion, with a conversion to net income of 133%. Strong working capital management, including inventory, was a meaningful driver of the strong cash in Q4, with further targeted reductions this year. We project free cash flow conversion of greater than 100% for 2025. Now let's move to the segment results starting with automotive OEM, where organic revenue declined 2% in the fourth quarter against the tough comparison of plus 8% in Q4 2023. On a regional basis, North America was down 5%, while Europe was down 10% against a tough comparison of plus 11%. China grew 8% despite a comparison of plus 31% as our China team continues to drive customer-back innovation and gain market share, including in the rapidly growing EV market. For the full year, compared to industry bill data, the segment outperformed relevant bills by our typical 200 to 300 basis points, and we expect similar outperformance in 2025 as we project that automotive OEM will grow 0% to 2%, 1% to 3% excluding PLS, with auto bills in relevant markets that are projected to be down in the low single digits. On the bottom line for the full year, automotive OEM improved margins by 230 basis points to 19.6%, and the segment remains firmly on track to achieve its goal of low to mid-twenties operating margin over the next couple of years. Turn to slide five. Food equipment delivered organic growth of almost 3.5%. Equipment grew 3% and service grew 5%, as the growth investments made in the first half of 2024 to expand capacity and support long-term above-market growth in this very attractive service business are paying off. By region, North America grew 2%, with institutional end markets up in the high single digits, and restaurants essentially flat. The international business was strong with growth of 5%, with Europe up 4%, and Asia Pacific was up 11% due to strong equipment sales. Test and measurement and electronics, organic revenue turned positive for the first time in five quarters, up 2%, with test and measurement essentially flat as electronics grew 6%, the highest growth rate since the fourth quarter of 2022, as semiconductor electronics activity started to pick up. As we've talked about before, because of our focused growth investments, including customer-back innovation, through the cycle, we remain very well positioned to capitalize on a long list of attractive growth opportunities as the semi-electronics recovery begins to take shape. Operating margins expanded by 170 basis points in the quarter to 27%. Moving on to slide six. Organic growth in welding improved as organic revenue was essentially flat after five subsequent quarters of year-over-year declines. Equipment was flat and consumables were down 1%. While North America was down 2%, international grew 9%, with strong growth in China as a result of some very targeted customer-back innovation efforts. Throughout 2024, the welding team continued to benefit from a strong pipeline of new products, contributing more than 3% to growth. In our view, this is a great example of our strategic CBI efforts and the adoption of our next phase CBI framework gives our divisions the ability to gain share and outgrow end markets on a consistent basis. Operating margin of 31.2% was a 160 basis point improvement over the prior year. Polymers and Fluids, organic revenue grew 1% with Polymers up 5%, and Fluids up 1%. Automotive aftermarket, which tends to be more correlated to consumer discretionary spending, was down 1%, which is about two points ahead of end market growth with relevant point of sale data indicating a market that was down 3%. On a geographic basis, North America declined 4%, and international grew 8% with Europe again showing solid demand. Turning to slide seven. Our most interest rate-sensitive segment, construction products, organic growth was down 4% in a tough market as new housing starts were down about 7% globally in Q4. In North America, construction products was down 4%, approximately three points ahead of a market that was down about 7%, with residential renovation down 3% and commercial construction down 9%. Europe was down 3% and Australia and New Zealand were down 8%. The 2025 outlook for the construction market globally remains uncertain with new housing starts in the US expected to be down in the low to mid-single digits. With that as a backdrop, we expect construction products to be about flat in 2025 as we're well positioned to outperform end markets with the launch of new products and market share gains. Operating margin of 28% improved 110 basis points with another significant contribution from strong execution on enterprise initiatives. In expected, specialty products organic revenue was down 4% with a planned 5% reduction in revenue from strategic PLS as the team continues to take the necessary actions to strategically reposition the segment for consistent above-market growth. While the work is not complete, the progress so far has been encouraging. 2024 organic growth of more than 3%, margin improvement of 380 basis points, gives you a sense of the strategic and financial value we derive from PLS. Operating margin was a record 28.4% for the quarter. Moving to slide eight and full year 2024 results. As you've seen from Illinois Tool Works Inc. all year, our colleagues around the world continue to execute at a high level for our customers and for the enterprise. As a result of their efforts, Illinois Tool Works Inc. consistently outperformed end markets and delivered record results on key performance metrics such as earnings, operating margin, and after-tax return on capital. Throughout 2024, we remained focused on maximizing our growth and performance over the long term as we invested in projects that accelerate above-market organic growth and sustained productivity in our highly profitable core businesses. We raised our dividend for the sixty-first consecutive year by 7% and returned more than $3.2 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Moving to slide nine for an update on one of our key strategic priorities. As we've talked about before, customer-back innovation is the most impactful driver of our ability to consistently grow revenue above market. The CBI revenue of today fuels our ability to drive market penetration and share gains in the future. Over the past few years, we've expanded our CBI revenue yield from less than a percent pre-COVID to 2% in 2024. We're well positioned for further improvement in 2025 based on the recent launch of our next phase CBI framework. We can feel the energy and excitement from our divisional teams as they implement the framework in their divisions. And as Chris said, we're particularly pleased with the 18% increase in patent filings in 2024. Because every one of those patents is tied to a known customer pain point, and represents a high-quality growth opportunity for Illinois Tool Works Inc. In 2025, we will continue to work on fully adopting our new CBI framework in each one of our divisions consistent with the pace required to deliver CBI yield of 3% plus by 2030. Let's move to slide ten and our guidance for full year 2025. As you can see, Illinois Tool Works Inc. is once again well positioned to execute at a high level and outperform our end markets in any scenario. We aim to improve margins by approximately 100 basis points with another strong contribution from enterprise initiatives. Per our usual process, our organic growth projection of 0% to 2% or 1% to 3% excluding strategic PLS of a percentage point is based on current levels of demand adjusted for typical seasonality. Foreign currency translation at current rates represents a 3% top-line headwind. In terms of profitability, operating margin is expected to improve by about 100 basis points to a range of 26.5% to 27.5%, which includes approximately a 100 basis point contribution from projects related to enterprise initiatives that are independent of volume, ranging from 60 to 170 basis points in each segment. We are projecting GAAP EPS in the range of $10.15 to $10.55, which includes a longer list than usual of non-operational headwinds, including $0.30 of unfavorable foreign currency translation impact and $0.15 to $0.20 from increased restructuring expenses tied to ongoing 80/20 front-to-back projects, and higher income tax expense with an expected tax rate in the range of 24% to 24.5%. Excluding the $0.30 of non-operational headwind from foreign currency, EPS would be $10.65 at the midpoint, an increase of 5% versus last year. In terms of cadence for the year, we expect a first half, second half EPS split of about 47% and 53% as compared to our usual 49% and 51%, which is due to increased restructuring expenses in the first half of the year. Combined with the typical sequential step down in revenues from Q4 to Q1, we therefore expect Q1 EPS to contribute about 22% of the year's EPS, slightly below our typical 23% to 24%. As I mentioned, we expect strong free cash flows with conversion greater than net income, and per our disciplined capital allocation framework, surplus capital is allocated to an active share repurchase program as we plan to buy back $1.5 billion of our own shares in 2025. Our guidance does not account for any pricing adjustments made in response to the implementation of tariffs. Illinois Tool Works Inc.'s produce-what-we-sell strategy largely mitigates potential tariff impact, and we're comfortable that once again we're in a position to read and react as necessary by adjusting price in response to higher costs as a result of tariffs. Based on our past experience, most recently in 2017 and 2018, and our strong operational capabilities, we believe that the price-cost equation is manageable for Illinois Tool Works Inc. across a wide range of scenarios. Turning to our last slide, slide eleven, for our 2025 organic growth projections by segment. As you can see, six of our seven segments are projecting positive organic growth, based on current run rates adjusted for typical seasonality. Every segment is well positioned to outperform their end markets again in 2025, and consistent with our continuous improvement, never-satisfied mindset, every segment is also projecting margin improvement with another solid contribution from enterprise initiatives. In summary, our segments are heading into 2025 well positioned to execute again as they continue to outperform their underlying end markets and improve margins and profitability. With that, Erin, I'll turn it back to you. Erin Linnihan : Thank you, Michael. Tamika, please open the line for questions. Operator : At this time, if you would like to ask a question, press star one. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question is from the line of Steven Bockman with Jefferies. Steven Bockman : Great. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking the question. Morning. Couple of things here, Michael. I think you gave a range of enterprise initiative benefits on the various segments, but I was too slow to write it down. But can you just maybe call out where this top and bottom kind of impact would be from enterprise initiatives on the appointment level? Michael Larsen : Yeah. The largest impact, as you might expect, is I said 190 basis points would be in our automotive OEM segment. You know, we've talked about the margin improvement plan there going back to Investor Day in 2023. And so that's where the largest opportunity probably resides. And then at the lower end, you would expect segments that are already operating margins in the kind of low thirties, maybe something like welding, would be in that maybe 60 basis points plus range. So that's kinda the I think the important point is that every one of our segments has opportunity for further improvement in margins, driven by enterprise initiatives, which, as you know, are independent of volume, which is a great place to be going into a pretty uncertain 2025. Steven Bockman : Okay. Great. And then maybe just bigger picture. Thank for the slide on CBI. But that's the one I think it's toughest for us to kind of explain. Wondering if there is a segment or maybe just even a couple of very specific projects that you could call out that kinda illustrate the power of WebCVI. Michael Larsen : Yeah. So, Steve, I would say that CBI is well represented across all seven segments. Every division is working on this in a very intentional way. And we have a great pipeline of new products right across the company. But it's called a one where we're seeing some steady impact in 2024. Welding, obviously, we've called on a few on a few different calls here as having made great progress in what has been a very difficult market in welding, we certainly mitigated that market admission by basically coming to us to 3% innovation contribution from welding in 2024, more to come in 2025. But nice increase across the portfolio. The increase you see going into 2025 is broad-based and will impact every segment. But a carload welding specifically in 2024. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis from Melis Research. Scott Davis : Hey. Good morning, guys. Michael Larsen : Hey. Good morning, Scott. Scott Davis : I'm just kind of amazed that you can increase margins in a down volume environment. I mean, it just doesn't happen very often in our world. Unless you're coming off, like, a really big restructuring or something, which is not really the case, but you guys help us understand. Let's just take auto as an example. When you look at your performance in auto, it's you know, can you kinda parse it down to, you know, mixed benefit, new product benefit, you're getting better price and margin with new products, are you more efficient with your labor or your fixed assets? I mean, if there's any way to kinda break down how this kinda special sauce is working, I think it would be it'd be helpful. Michael Larsen : Yeah. So, Scott, I would say in auto specific we kinda call this out somewhat at Investor Day in terms of, you know, the main drivers of margin improvement in auto were gonna be, you know, volume recovery. Obviously, we're not getting a whole lot of that at the moment, but the other main components were enterprise initiatives and then higher margin on CBI. And that's really what's driving, you know, the margins in auto. Enterprise initiative is just kind of how we think about those, and obviously, we've been delivering on those across the an appraisal for a while. But really and it continue to be an important contributor results. Really, these initiatives, which as we called out, are independent of volume, are really an outcome of what we consider to be just this very, very strong continuous improvement mindset that's very much part of Illinois Tool Works Inc.'s DNA and really drives the visual quality of practice in areas like 80/20 front to back and strategic sourcing. These are very much bottom-up initiatives driven by our talented people in our divisions at a very granular level. Most of these projects are less than a half million dollars individually, when you have 84 divisions, they add up to a real meaningful number here. So have a lot of visibility, ownership, and accountability in our divisions around these initiatives. And as a track record, as indicated here, with respect to enterprise initiatives over the last eleven years, our divisions have very much done what they said they would do. So we believe these are all sustainable. On the back of this ownership and accountability, that's fundamental to our culture, strong continuous improvement mindset that we would say is now hardwired into our divisions. And in the case of 80/20 front to back, as you've heard us say on many occasions, this is something that we've never done with. It's the gift that keeps on giving. So with that, we see this contribution continuing. Obviously, Michael's called out called it out again at a hundred basis points in 2025. It's ultimately that that's what makes it sustainable is your continuous improvement mindset that exists across all of our businesses. Not just in auto. In auto, we also have, as we do elsewhere, you know, the whole impact higher margin impact of CBI. And the other aspect that's fundamental to enterprise initiatives is PLS. Which we called out, you know, a number of times in this call. As being fundamentally valuable to us, not just from a growth standpoint in terms of you know, clarifying where to grow, simplifying our portfolio, and simplifying the allocation of resources. But also in terms of the margin pop that we get, from enterprise initiatives around PLS. And a lot of those projects have a payback of a year or less. Scott Davis : Okay. That's helpful. And guys, you didn't mention M&A in your prepared remarks, and I know this stuff can be a little lumpy, but I happen to have a view that you guys can be arguably the quote best owner for lots of different stuff because you've been successful in the past and running lots of different widget businesses and that skill seems to be transferable, I would think. But maybe I'm overstating that. There's just a little color on what's holding you back on M&A? Is it price? Is it the opportunity set? Is it you know, I would think you'd have a fair amount of confidence in your organization that you could integrate and win with a pretty wide set, I guess, is kinda my point. Michael Larsen : Yeah. I think if we've outlined, you know, basically, we remain pretty disciplined in terms of M&A, in terms of our portfolio management strategy. You know, we certainly have a clear we would say a clear and well-defined view of what fits our strategy in our financial criteria. So it really is a question of us finding the right opportunities. You know, we're focused on high-quality acquisitions that would extend our long-term growth potential minimum 4% plus, a growth of high quality, and then being able to leverage the business model to improve margins. So I would say we review opportunities on an ongoing basis. We are very selective, you know, given all the organic growth potential we have in our core businesses. But we are pretty active in terms of reviewing opportunities. And to the extent that we find the right opportunities, we'll be appropriately aggressive in pursuing them. And I would say, you know, going back to the MTS example of an opportunity that really ticked all the boxes for us and know, although, you know, in two years in here, we are this is turning into a home run for us. And then that was largely on the basis that you know, it really met all the characteristics that we look at. But rest assured, we're pretty active. We just need to find the right opportunities. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Andrew Kaplowitz : Hey, guys. Close enough. How are you doing? So Chris or Michael, I know you're forecasting your segments based on current run rates for 2025 and Chris mentioned that orders haven't picked up yet. But I was intrigued by your commentary that your sequential growth from Q3 to Q4 was 3.7%, you know, greater than 1.5% in store growth. So but you see through the end of the year better yet through January, any pickup in sales momentum that's worth calling out. You did call out semi recovery. Beginning with the intestine measurement. Do you forecast that to continue? Is there anything else you're seeing? Michael Larsen : I think it's a little too early. Probably, I need to call a recovery here for sure. We are seeing some positive signs. We called out semi electronics. You know, going through the fourth quarter, we saw a pretty solid December. What we usually do. And so I think we don't wanna get too far ahead of ourselves here at this point. So we've modeled as we always do based on run rate. And if certainly, if market conditions improve, if demand picks up in the second half. And there are, I should say, certainly some external indicators that would suggest that that is a possibility. You know, we're really well positioned to take advantage of those growth opportunities. And if that turns out to be the case, you know, 1% to 3% organic XPELS you know, would be on the conservative side. But, you know, we don't wanna get too far ahead of ourselves. We're focused on the things that know, we can control. We just talked about the margin improvement from enterprise initiatives. And know, when the inevitable recovery happens, we're gonna be in a great position to continue to outgrow the underlying markets. So that's kinda how we've positioned this. Andrew Kaplowitz : Helpful, Michael. And could you give us more color into your ability to continue outperform in China? I mean, it's been very impressive. Obviously, it's focused on China automotive. So maybe just talk about that. I think you already said that you expect similar level levels of outperformance in 2025 or is it 2024 in China Automotive? Automotive in general? But maybe talk about what you're doing there. Is it really CVI that's helping you or something else? Michael Larsen : Yeah. So, Andy, the performance in China relative to automotive has been going on for quite a while now. And it really speaks to the quality, you know, of the team that we've built in China, the investments we've made in China, over many years. And you're right. CVI is a large part of this, particularly you know, our growth in EV in China has been significant. You saw it again this year where we outperformed builds in China by about 800 basis points. We expect similar outperformance in China next year in automotive really on the back of, you know, the resource base the investments that we've made, the really best in class innovation and business model application that we see in China that's put us in a position not just to outperform on revenues, but even from a margin standpoint, you know, our margin in China are pretty much similar to what they are elsewhere in the world. So you know, it's really a factor of the organization and organizational capabilities we built across the business model innovation, and growth in China. Andrew Kaplowitz : Appreciate the color, guys. Michael Larsen : Thanks, Andy. Operator : Next question is from a line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeff Sprague : Hey. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hey. I just wanted to think about the in a relationship with PLS and CBI. Right? Regardless of how good your margins are, right, there's always gonna be a twenty in your construct. So should we think of you know, CBI also just kinda constantly reloading the PLS opportunity set. And if that's the case, should we just kinda be thinking about it I don't know. Secular 1% headwind on PLS indefinitely as the as the CBI benefits kinda build on the other side of that equation? Michael Larsen : Yeah. So maybe just refresh, I think, in terms of, you know, our philosophy and how we think about product identification and, you know, the value that accrues for us. So I would say, Jeff, you know, PLS for us is very much an essential part of the ongoing strategic review and portfolio pruning. That goes on really as a critical part of the implementation of 80/20 front to back in all of our divisions. And, you know, we got pretty much a trade and trusted methodology around this that's deeply embedded and very well understood. It certainly requires discipline, but there is a lot of benefits that our divisions get from proper PLS implementation. And even though there's a short-term kind of revenue impact, here, this has always been positive for us in the long term from a growth standpoint. And that PLS provides strategic clarity, which ultimately will help CBI for sure. But not just clarity, but also execution on our division's most critical customers and products. And effective resource deployment around that, again, which all indirectly helps CBI. Then from a margin improvement standpoint, of course, you know, we get the cost savings from PLS, which ultimately are a meaningful component of the enterprise initiatives. And so I would say with PLS, you know, there's no doubt that the specific way that we execute PLS. It's very much an ongoing kind of value-creating activity for us in our divisions. And like I say, we have a lot of positive experience and expertise on this. So we saw this, you know, very much so, and especially this year, but on our overall business on an ongoing basis. But the clarity that comes out of PLS ultimately will be an enabler around CBI. And Jeff, if I may just add, you know, PLS was a little higher in 2024 than kind of our normal maintenance run rate of about half a point, which was entirely driven by the work that was done in specialty products. And I talked a little about the outcomes and the momentum going into 2025 in that segment. You know, we're a little bit higher this year. As well at a point, primarily in automotive, construction, and then more work to do in specialty products. I think it's too early to tell whether this is kind of a new I think you call it a secular kinda work. Now the runway is about a point. I think it's a little too early to say. Let's get through this year, and then we'll kinda see what it rolls up to next year. But the important thing is as Chris said, this is an outcome of how we run these businesses. We're not trying to manage the PLS number because we know the strategic and financial value that we derive from doing PLS in our businesses. Jeff Sprague : Great. Thanks for that perspective. And then maybe just a little tactical one on auto, right, in region four region, but you know, even in region. Right? US, Canada, Mexico, Mexico, could be a lot of scrambling going on in the supply chain, maybe a reprieve here this week. But you know, are you seeing any, like, unusual change in order patterns? People trying to, you know, get in front of maybe just the expiration of this thirty-day cooling-off period. You know, just any other kind of tariff-related noise that you might be seeing would be interesting. Michael Larsen : Yeah. Jeff, to be honest, I would say it's too early to tell. I mean, obviously, it's been a pretty choppy week on the tariff front. But look, all I would say is that we're really well positioned here to read and react. To whatever comes along, and we're confident that this is not really a state EPS for us. This year. Right. And we, you know, we have assets in all these geographies where uniquely positioned to take care of customers and that's gonna be our priority as we manage through this. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jamie Cook with Truist Securities. Jamie Cook : Good morning. I guess just two questions. You know, one, just back on auto again. Another question just obviously, auto has been a great content story for you. If we shift back more to ICE versus EV, just wondering what the potential headwind could be for the auto business given just been such a great growth driver. And then my second question, Chris, to you. Obviously, you know, under you, CBI seems to be I don't wanna say more important, but it's definitely getting more press or you're talking about it more, I would say, relative to your predecessors. But just trying to think about the 30% plus margin target. We do get some, you know, criticism that that might be too high or maybe it gets pushed out as we're focused on CBI. So just anything you can say about your confidence level there is it just a function of volumes or anything you wanna say on that target? Thank you. Chris O'Hearlihy: Yes. So let me start with the CBI and margin impact. First, Jamie, if I could. You know, we would say that actually seeing CBI is likely to be an on margins because ordinarily, when we invent differentiated new products, margins tend to be higher. And with respect to the whole organic growth versus margin question, which I think you're posing, you know, from our perspective, organic growth and margin go hand in hand. And I would even say that historically, our fastest-growing business have often been our highest margin businesses. And I think we also demonstrated, you know, coming out of the pandemic where we had both healthy growth and margin expansion. Right? Over that period, we are investing, you know, in a very focused way in resources like innovation and strategic marketing to position us to grow at 4% plus. Percent in the long term. So for us, I mean, you know, it really comes down to as we often talk about in Illinois Tool Works Inc., the quality of organic growth. You know, the fact that we can deliver organic growth at these high incrementals, which is really a natural outcome of applying our business model to this high-quality portfolio of businesses. Yeah. So the math is pretty simple. You know, given our margin is 26% with growth at 35% plus incrementals, then, you know, we expand margin. And in fact, the path of 30%, as we have pointed out, is much more paved with operating leverage than structural cost reduction. And then this is why effectively. It's a that our primary road to 30% in 2030. You know, given the high levels of differentiation in our portfolio, you know, we have very healthy gross margins. This provides more than enough investment firepower to appropriately invest in our business to help drive CBI and growth while still delivering very healthy incremental margins. And on the back of that, of course, continued expansion in operating margins. And then I think, Jamie, you asked about kind of the transition the pace of the transition from ICE to EV and you know, I think for us, at this point, our content per vehicle, ICE versus EV is about the same. Our margin profile is about the same. And so we are fairly agnostic to any mix in ICE versus EV at this point. Obviously, we've been as we've talked about many times on this call, really well positioned, particularly in China where the growth has been and the content, the vehicle growth has been really terrific. So at this point, we don't see this as a major issue for the company. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : Hey, guys. Good morning. Michael Larsen : Hey. Joe Ritchie : So just talking about PLS and because back innovation. I guess on the PLS side, yeah, how much is PLS how much has that been contributing to the margin expansion? Like, much they contribute in 2024 and the expectation from 2025? And then your commentary on CVI is very, very interesting. I'm just curious, like, which segments are furthest maybe, behind or in the earlier stages of implementing it. Michael Larsen : Yes. So the generic ask answer to your question in terms of the contribution margin contribution with PLS in the overall context of enterprise initiatives, it varies from year to year, Joe, but I'd say, you know, directionally, it's in the 50/50 range, I would say. On CBI, like I said, you know, we have, you know, broad-based kind of improvement on CBI across the portfolio. All seven segments are working on this and making improvements. If I was to call out ones that are probably further ahead, I referenced welding already. You know, automotive, you know, obviously, necessarily so given the level of disruption that we see in automotive markets right now. Food equipment, obviously, a very fertile space for innovation on the back of energy and water savings. And then test measurement electronics, another area where you know, significant change in those end markets around increasing stringency in innovation standards, in quality control standards. Obviously, new materials being developed require new test methods. That's another area where we've had a lot of early success, I would say. But rest assured, all seven segments, you know, we'll see an improvement in innovation contribution as we go forward. Joe Ritchie : That's helpful, Chris. And if I could maybe just follow-up with one more. I recognize you're planning to do, you know, the billion and a half in buyback this year. You take a look at your balance sheet right now. It's in a good position. If you wanted to lever up another turn, would be pretty easy for you to do a more aggressive buyback. I'm just curious, like, under what scenario would you maybe consider doing maybe a little bit more and be a little bit more aggressive buying back your shares? Michael Larsen : Yeah, Joe. So the $1.5 billion that we've penciled in for this year is our best estimate of what the surplus capital is gonna be for the company this year. So, you know, once we've fully funded our internal investments for growth and productivity, once we've paid the dividend any acquisitions, and then what's left is allocated to share repurchases. And obviously, to the extent that the performance of the company exceeds kind of the guidance we gave you today, whether it's top line or margins or we still have opportunity on working capital, as I said in my remarks, and that $1.5 billion goes higher than typically, what we would do is allocate that excess surplus capital also to the share buyback program. So maybe one way to think about the $1.5 billion is it's at least $1.5 billion. And to the extent the company performs, you know, better than what we laid out for you today, the number could be higher than that. I think in terms of capital structure, if I may, without getting too technical here, I think we've made some really good adjustments over the last few years in response to a higher interest rate environment. And I'll just point to our interest rate. Our interest expense in the fourth quarter being down year over year, our projection for 2025 is flat to maybe even down slightly. Despite the fact that interest rates are significantly higher. I think if you just look at kinda what other peers are talking about, I think that would compare pretty favorably. And so in terms of capital structure, we would say we're in a pretty optimal place at this point in time. And do not foresee any major changes in terms of capital structure or capital allocation for that matter as we enter into 2025. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Tami Zakaria with JPMorgan. Tami Zakaria : Hi. Good morning. Thank you so much. Hi. Starting back on the tariff topic, I appreciate that it's too early to tell. But can you remind us of your exposure to direct imports from countries like Mexico and also the EU and Canada? The reason I asked last time in 2018, you did provide some numbers around imports from China and how that would impact the P&L. Which was very helpful. So anything you're able to or willing to share now? Michael Larsen : Yeah. I think with all the usual caveats, I'll just I'll give you kinda a way to think about this, Tami. The combined imports from China, Canada, and Mexico account for less than 10% of our domestic spend here in the US. So China, it's kind of in the mid-single digit 5%. Five, six percent range. Canada, 2%, Mexico, 2%. So and then, obviously, you know, Europe, slightly different equation there. But that's for those three. So you add that up, and do kinda know, back at the let's just pick China for a moment. Okay? So roughly $250 million of imports from China 10% increase is $25 million. Which means we have to go get price of at least $25 million. And probably a little bit more than that to recover the margin impact as well. So you know, I think the and this is a $16 billion company. So I think that's kinda why combined with our produce where we sell strategy, you know, our ability to read and react at the divisional level, you know, we feel like as we sit here today, this is a manageable equation. We've got a game plan in place that will cover tariff-related material cost inflation with price actions based on, you know, some pretty positive experience doing the same thing coming out of 2017, 2018, and by the way, a very inflationary period coming out of COVID, given the differentiated nature of our businesses, our ability to execute and take care of customers, we feel very good about our ability to offset, you know, those tariff-related cost increases. So pretty much in any scenario that we can think of as we sit here today, we feel like we're in a good spot. Tami Zakaria : Got it. So a quick follow-up. Minus any tariff-related noise, what is the expectation for price cost for this year that's embedded in the guide? Michael Larsen : Yeah. I think Tami, we're kinda back in kind of a normal price cost environment. Historically, we have offset cost increases with price on a dollar basis and also it's been slightly favorable from a margin standpoint as well. So, you know, keep in mind that you know, given the performance and the value of the product and services that we offer. You know, we're in a good position here to get price to offset any potential cost increases. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Hey, Julian. Hi. Good afternoon. Michael Larsen : Hey. Good morning. Julian Mitchell : Maybe just the first question around the top line sort of cadence. You know, understood, Michael, what you said about Q1. Yeah. The first half share of earnings. Anything you'd call out on the sort of top line movement through the year and anything on sort of any segments we should bear in mind when looking at the slide eleven weightings. Michael Larsen : Yeah. I think, Julian, typically, I'll refer to kind of the typical seasonality. And so what usually happens from Q4 to Q1 revenues sequentially declined by kinda 3% ish with a little bit more than that last year. In 2024 and in 2023. If that happens, that's about a little over $100 million. That's organic growth that's down about one. And then foreign currency with rates as we sit here today adds another three points of pressure. So now you got revenues kinda down in that three to five range. Margins typically start out at the lower end in Q1 and kind of progress from there as we go through the year. Just like top line, by the way, goes up Q1 to Q2. Q2 Q3 is about flat, and then there's another pickup again from Q3 to Q4. And then we have these non-operational headwinds beyond currency, including, you know, somewhat higher restructuring in the first half of 2025. All related to 80/20 front to back project, the TADA. These are projects less than a year payback that are feeding the enterprise savings to margin improvement that we are putting up every quarter, that will be more weighted towards the first and the second quarter, and we have a little bit of headwind on the tax rate as well in the first half. So you add all that up, know, just relative to Q4, EPS $2.54. Revenue's probably ten cents of EPS headwind. Going into Q1 and then maybe another ten cents of headwind from the combination of higher restructuring expense and a higher tax rate. So that's that 22% of the full year number that we gave you for the first quarter. So hopefully, that's helpful. Julian Mitchell : Okay. That's great. Thank you, Michael. And maybe just wanted to focus perhaps on specialty products for a second. You know, that was one segment that definitely caught the eye the first quarter, few quarters of last year, seems to be, you know, normalizing somewhat on sales in the fourth quarter. So how are we thinking about margins in specialty for the year ahead? There's a lot going on there with PLS and restructuring or reorganization there, it looks like. Maybe just kinda flesh out what the plan is in specialty and any more details on the year ahead there, please. Michael Larsen : Yeah. So as you pointed out, Julian, very solid year in specialty in 2024. You know, some strength in areas like aerospace and then strong demand in areas like food and beverage packaging equipment and so on. And then as we called out, you know, all through the year, this has all been done at a time when we were doing some strategic portfolio repositioning for long-term growth. And that's certainly, you know, with a significant impact in Q4 as you saw both hundred basis points. There's some carryover on this in 2025. But we expect growth in specialty in 2025 despite the PLS. We also expect margin improvement in specialty in 2025. And the objective here is to make this segment a 4% grower in the long term. And based on 2022 to 2024 performance, we're certainly well on our way to doing that. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Michael Larsen : Sure. Sure. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Nigel Cole with Research? Nigel Cole : Oh, good morning. Thanks for the question. Just wanted to talk about the 90 bps of margin expansion at the midpoint, x items. In general sense on where you see. Know you don't provide margin guidance by segment, but if you could just make any comments the best opportunities for, Omex and we're perhaps you know, those below the bar. And in particular, I just wanted to try and dig into the auto margins just given, you know, first half relatively depressed. And that the extra rate close to 20%. So just wondering you're seeing in auto specifically. Michael Larsen : Yeah. So Nigel, you're right. We don't really give margin guidance by segment, but what I can tell you is that we expect based on kind of the bottom-up projection that we received, from our segments at Plantheim, we expect every one of our segments to improve margins in 2025. And that's based on what they told us, not what Chris and I would like to see. You know? And so I think, obviously, the businesses that are the segment that are a little further along in terms of the journey towards 30%. So if you think about welding, I think those you know, it can be a little bit more challenging. You know, if you without getting too detailed, just look at the growth at five, forty percent incrementals, you get less of margin improvement in welding than you do, for example, in automotive. Now in automotive, you're right. We're not counting on a lot of lift here from in fact, we're counting on a market that's down in the low single digits. And the big driver here in 2025 is the enterprise initiatives. And so that's really that's what's fueling the margin improvement in that you know, call it a hundred basis points of margin improvement in automotive in 2025. So we still you know, we've got a lot of things that are still within our control from a margin improvement standpoint. Independent of volume, that's a great place to be. We'd love to see some operating leverage. And if you just look at it as an example. If you we try to call it specialty products, you know, a little you know, 3% growth and suddenly margins are up, you know, more than 300 basis points. And that's so they're the incrementals when this growth starts to come through. At least in the near term, I'm gonna be you know, quite a bit higher than our kinda historical 35% to 40% incremental margins. And that's really from there, that's where the margin improvement really accelerates. So hopefully, that's helpful, Nigel. Nigel Cole : It is, Michael. Yeah. Thanks. And just I just wanna double click into that one key restructuring. This is fifteen cents. I think it's fifty-five, sixty million dollars of pretax investments. Just given that you don't disclose restructuring by setting and any help in terms of where you see the heaviest impacts across portfolio? Michael Larsen : I'd rather not get into that level of detail now. So we'll call it out when we report. Q1. You'll be able to see kind of we've got that schedule in the back of the press release that laid out the restructuring. Suffice it to say that, you know, there's opportunity for, you know, further margin improvement in every one of these segments. And know, I'd rather not get into the specifics in terms of by segment for the first half. Now just to be clear, the EPS headwind on a year-over-year basis that we called out from restructuring and the tax rate was fifteen to twenty cents. Per share. About half of that is tax and the other half is restructuring. And eighty percent of that restructuring is gonna is planned for the first half of 2025. So it'll be a little bit of a challenging start to the year in terms of the headline numbers. And, you know, we'll help with calling out kind of those non-operational headwinds as we go through the year. But just from a modeling standpoint, we wanna make sure everybody was kinda clear on how the year might unfold. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo. Joe O'Dea: Hi. Good morning. Michael, your comment about, you know, your position to take advantage of an inevitable recovery is encouraging. You know, just curious as you look at the end markets and I think about kind of volumes and cycles, know, what you're looking at, whether it's kinda re or whether it's end market and segment, but, you know, where you think you're gonna see things get better earliest and any perspective from a volume standpoint in terms of, you know, how depressed some of these markets are? Michael Larsen : Yeah. Joe, I wish I could help you there. I mean, I think my crystal ball is not any better than yours. You know, I think the reference to, you know, taking advantage of the recovery was specific to what we're seeing in semi and electronics. I think if you look at some of you know, so that's one cycle that certainly, you know, for two years has been pretty challenged. I think the same could be said for some of our capex driven businesses. Test and measurement, you know, the Instron business, positive growth in Q4, but not the typical kinda five, six, seven organic that you would expect in that business over the long run. You know, welding certainly encouraged that the business is now, you know, flat. Ish in Q4 and down low single digits for the full year. That's a cycle know, typically, those cycles last six to eight quarters, and that's kinda where we're at right now. So the only thing I can just give these are just kinda anecdotal thoughts on where things go from here. But things change quickly. This is you know, we're operating in a pretty fluid and pretty dynamic demand environment with you know, things change pretty quickly here. We, as you know, are more short cycle oriented. So our focus is really on how do we make sure we position ourselves for long-term above-market organic growth in these businesses, continue to invest through these cycles, leveraging our financial position to do so, and then when these recoveries come, we're gonna be in a great spot to compete and gain share and grow with new product. So really the focus that we're talking about. Joe O'Dea: No. I appreciate the call appreciate that color. And then on tariffs and pricing and how you manage the uncertainty, the question is just how quickly you can implement pricing through the system and I'm sure that's not a one size fits all kind of answer, but, you know, living in an environment where you can have such headline whiplash, kind of how you approach that and how long it takes to get pricing in response to, you know, what you would anticipate tariffs could be. Michael Larsen : Yeah. So, Joe, you're correct. It's not really a one size fits all answer because we have, obviously, 84 divisions and 84 different kind of circumstances and opportunity profiles around pricing. But what I can assure you is that, you know, given the decentralized nature of the company, given the fact that decisions are made very close to our customers, then, you know, our nimbleness means that we are quicker to read and react more than most. So there's not a huge lag with us for that reason. Not a whole lot of approvals that are needed to implement pricing. It's done on the ground in the division, close to the customer, relative to the circumstantial opportunity profile that the division sees. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Yes. Good morning. Good morning. Just to follow-up on short cycle industrial names. So just TMM and E and welding. So just to confirm, we're not modeling any ramp of organic growth this year. And more structurally, once again, just to confirm, if PMI is sustainably over fifty, how fast can these businesses grow, and should we think sort of high single digits as possible in a robust cyclical recovery? Michael Larsen : I think, Andrew, that's that it's impossible to answer that question. I mean, I think we have models based on current levels of demand. We are not modeling a recovery in any of these end markets, including welding and test and measurement. If that indeed happens, you know, we will take full advantage of the growth opportunities. You know, historically, coming out of cycles like this, it's not uncommon to see quarterly growth rates in kind of the mid and maybe even high single digits, but every recovery, as you know, is different. And you know, as we'd like to say, we're not economists here. You know, we are so there's no incentive for us to try to forecast where things go just given the short cycle nature of our businesses. So I'm sorry I can't help you. Andrew Obin : No. No. That's a great answer. Thank you. And just on food equipment, you know, solid growth in fourth quarter. Right? 3% plus versus the kind of third quarter. Guidance for 1% to 3% organic growth. So why would things decelerate from the fourth quarter? Are you seeing pressure anywhere? Michael Larsen : No. We're not seeing pressure. It's basically again based on, you know, sequential run rates over time, not just the fourth quarter. We are very encouraged about food generally. I would say, you know, we've seen this continued recovery in service. Still not quite back at pre-pandemic levels here. We hope just to refresh we are the only major manufacturer in captive service business and this it's a real differentiator for us. Because it used to be a very first iteration environment in food equipment, as I said earlier around things like water and energy savings. We see continued end market strength in areas like institutions. And then, geographically, I think China and Latin America are expected to be solid geographically. But that's the kind of the view on food equipment. We expect a solid 2025 on the back of a solid 2024. So, Andrew, I'd say we share your optimism, and we'll pass that on to the team that runs the business. Okay. And we'll see how they do this year. But, you know, 1% to 3% further margin improvement, service business is really performing at a good level now given the investments that we talked about. And so we're really feeling good about how we're positioned going into 2025 in food equipment. Operator : Great. And thank you everyone for your time today. This concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your line.",
