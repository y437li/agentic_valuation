And now, I'd like to introduce the Priceline Group's speakers for this afternoon, Darren Huston and Daniel Finnegan. Please go ahead, gentlemen. Darren Huston : Okay, thank you very much. Welcome to the Priceline Group\u2019s first quarter conference call. Thank you for joining us before the market opens this morning in New York. I am here in Amsterdam with Priceline Group CFO Dan Finnegan. The Group reported consolidated gross bookings for the first quarter of approximately $12.3 billion, up 34% year-over-year, or about 35% on a local currency basis. Non-GAAP net income was $416 million, up 40% year over year, and earnings per share was $7.81, up 36% versus prior year surpassing Factset consensus estimate of $6.93 per share and our guidance for the quarter. Our customers booked accommodation reservations for 83.4 million room nights in the quarter, up 32% year over year. Booking.com continues to extend its lead as the world\u2019s largest brand for booking accommodations and continues to increase its year-over-year share of rooms booked in every region it operates in. Booking.com\u2019s platform now has over 455,000 hotels and other accommodations in 200 countries, up 54% over last year. This reflects not only our continued aggressive push into directly bookable non-hotel accommodations but still the attractive worldwide opportunity to acquire traditional hotel properties. Agoda.com delivered strong transactional growth in the quarter and we are confident that both Agoda.com and Booking.com are gaining share across the Asia Pacific region. High growth rates in these new markets continue to contribute the higher overall group growth as they become an increasing share of our worldwide business. Priceline.com posted solid 20% growth in gross bookings with strong results in both in air and rental cars. Priceline.com hotel results when combined with Booking.com success in North America reflects hotel market share gain. The Priceline.com team also made good progress reworking much of the plumbing that will allow to improve all aspects of the sites with real time experimentation and to test taking a strong brand and hotel offering aboard with multi-currency capabilities. Rentalcars.com year is off to a good start with its transition from a completely semiopaque offering to a mixed retail offering behind it. Rentalcars.com customers will now see reviews and have more transparency on the quality of the services they are booking. Results were strong as the team continues to build share in international markets and successfully execute its mobile strategy. KAYAK delivered impressive profitability in the quarter and early indications from its targeted expansion in Europe are encouraging. I am really pleased with these teams onboarding for the group and a methodical work they do every day to build a wonderful customer experience and sustainable business model for the future. Mobile continues to be a key focus for all the group companies as we continue to see mobile bookings growth or exceed our desktop growth for all of our brands. Mobile transactions are of course important but the emerging mobile and multi-screen lifestyle is also transforming our customer experience with our companies offering us opportunities to engage with them throughout their travel. This is of course driving more bookings and new booking patterns, but more importantly people engagement with our company\u2019s brands. The group performed well in the first quarter on both the top and bottom line. Operating leverage stemmed from the beneficial impact of the Kayak acquisition. Our outlook calls for pressure on operating margins in Q2 as we will anniversary that acquisition later this month. We will continue Booking.com successful foray into offline advertising in certain international markets and invest aggressively in online variable channels to profitably build our book of business for the third quarter. We remain committed to making the smart investments in people, infrastructure, marketing, supply and innovation to allow us to pursue profitable long term growth from a position of strengths and extend our lead as the world\u2019s leading online travel business. I want to thank our employees around the world for their hard work and dedication and delivering a strong start to the year for their brands and for the group. I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review. Daniel Finnegan : Thanks, Darren. I will discuss some of the highlights and operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the second quarter of 2014. Growth rates mentioned in my remarks are in relation to the prior-year comparable period, unless otherwise indicated. Q1 was a strong quarter from a top and bottom line perspective. Room nights booked grew by 32% in the first quarter, decelerating compared with the unit growth rate of 37% achieved in Q4. Growth rates were solid across all our key regions and we believe that we again grew our market share in Q1. Average daily rates or ADRs for Q1 2014 were up on a local currency basis by about 3% for the consolidated group. Rental car days booked were up by 25% for Q1, decelerating compared to 32% growth in Q4. The growth is a blend of strong performance for retail reservations for rentalcars.com and Priceline.com partly offset by a decrease in Name Your Own Price rental car days for Priceline.com. For the first quarter compared to the prior year, the FX rate for the euro to the US dollar was favourable by about 4%. However the dollar strengthened significantly against many other currencies including those of Australia, Brazil, Turkey, Thailand, Argentina and Indonesia. As a result, currency exchange rate had an overall slightly negative impact on our growth rates expressed in US dollars. Our Q1 gross bookings grew by 34% compared to prior year. Our Q1 international gross bookings grew by 37% in US dollars and by about 38% on a local currency basis. Gross bookings for our Priceline.com brand business in the US grew by 20%. Performance was strong across retail air, rental car and hotel verticals, including the benefit from increased advertising placements within KAYAK. Hotel Express Deals also performed well but our Name Your Own Price hotel, air and car services were all down year over year due to limited availability of discounted grades and share shifts to express deals. I will remind you that name your own price impacts merchant gross bookings and disproportionately impacts merchant revenues since we record name your own price revenues on a gross basis while our other revenues are recorded on a net basis. Gross profit for the quarter was $1.4 billion and grew 37% as compared to prior year. The inclusion of KAYAK in our results contributed about 7 percentage points of inorganic gross profit growth for the quarter. KAYAK revenue amounted to $69 million in Q1 net of intercompany activity. Our international operations generated gross profit of $1.21 billion, which constituted an increase of 35% as compared to the prior year and 37% on a local currency basis. Gross profit for our US business including KAYAK amounted to $201 million which represented 50% growth versus prior year, excluding the impact of travel transaction tax charges recorded in Q1 2013 that we discussed last year. Non-GAAP operating income amounted to 35.6% of gross profit for Q1 which is 50 bps better than last year. Operating margins were impacted by 111 bps of deleverage in off-line advertising mainly related to our booking.com TV campaigns and the inclusion of KAYAK offline advertisers. Other OpEx also reflects some deleverage as we continue to invest in people, offices and IT related expenses to support our business growth. Online advertising expense as a percentage of gross profit was 200 bps better than prior year. The year-over-year improvement in this metric is due to the inclusion of KAYAK because KAYAK spends relatively less on online advertising as a percentage of gross profit and spending by our other brands for ad placements on KAYAK is eliminated from our consolidated results. We expect KAYAK to benefit our consolidated online ad efficiency until we anniversary the acquisition on May 21. Operating margins came in 340 bps better than assumed in our guidance forecast due to gross profit over-performance, better than assumed ad efficiency and lower than forecasted other operating expenses. The favorable ad efficiency results from better than forecasted online ad ROIs, favorable mix of direct business and shift in some off-line advertising spend to Q2 and beyond. Adjusted EBITDA for Q1 amounted $513 million which exceeded the top end of our guidance range of $450 million and represents 39% growth versus prior year. KAYAK had a nicely profitable quarter and contributed to our bottom line. Since KAYAK earns much of its revenues click through generated rather than travel consumed, Q1 is a relatively more profitable quarter from a seasonal perspective for KAYAK than it is for our overall business. Kayak contribution to our gross profit and EBITDA growth rate will be less impactful after we lap the acquisition in May. Non-GAAP net income grew by 40%, and non-GAAP EPS grew by 36% reflecting the impact of a higher fully diluted share count. In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $177 million of cash from operations during first quarter 2014 which is about 3% lower than last year. We prepaid income taxes of $346 million in the quarter for booking.com in return for an early payment cash discount. We made a similar prepayment last year in the amount of $224 million. These taxes would otherwise have been paid monthly over the year and so subsequent quarters of the year will have a lower payment burden as a result. We spent about $30 million on CapEx and we repaid about $58 million over 2015 convertible notes upon early conversion by their holders. We also returned $97 million to shareholders through purchases of our common stock. Our cash and investments totaling about $6.7 billion at quarter end are available for general corporate purposes, including additional share repurchases, acquisition and debt repayment. Now for second quarter 2014 guidance. We\u2019re forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 22% to 32% in US dollars and by 20% to 30% on a local currency basis. With US gross bookings growing by 15% to 20% we expect international gross bookings to grow by 24% to 34% in US dollars and by 21% to 31% on a local currency basis. Our Q2 forecast assumes that local currency ADRs for the consolidated group will be up by about 1% compared to the prior year period. Our Q2 forecast assumes that foreign exchange rates remain at the same $1.39 per euro and $1.70 per British pound at yesterday\u2019s closing rates. Improved result in average exchange rate that will be stronger by about 6% for the euro and about 10% for the British pound as compared to the prior year. We expect the overall impact of currency fluctuations to be favorable to our growth rates expressed in US dollars. We have hedge contract in place to substantially shield our second quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any fluctuation to the euro or the pound versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter but these hedges do not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue, gross profit and operating income and do not hedge our earnings beyond the second quarter. We expect Q2 revenue to grow year over year by approximately 19% to 29% and gross profit dollars to grow by 24% to 34%. We expect the declines in our Name Your Own Price services will impact revenue growth rates in Q2. We expect about 300 bps of deleverage in non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of gross profit compared to prior year, driven by lower online ad ROIs and increased investment in offline advertising expense. Our approach to online and off-line advertising is consistent with past practice. With the disciplined approach to invest in advertising to build our brands, while delivering demand at an acceptable ROI. Our ROI targets are fluid based upon competitive and marketplace conditions and are set to achieve the right balance between topline growth and bottom-line profitability. We are investing more heavily in online advertising thus far in Q2 and assume the strategy will be maintained for the remainder of the quarter. Q2 year-over-year online advertising efficiency benefits from the inclusion of KAYAK in our consolidated result but to a lesser extent than Q1, because we lap the acquisition on May 21. Q2 also reflects some off-line spend that is shifted from Q1 into Q2 as I mentioned a moment ago. For full year 2014 we continue to estimate that we would spend between $220 million and $240 million for offline advertising. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $725 million and $775 million which at the midpoint represents 21% growth versus prior year. Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately 15% comprised of international income taxes and for alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the US. We are targeting on-GAAP EPS of approximately $11.22 to $12.02 per share which at the midpoint represents 20% growth over prior year. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 53.3 million shares based upon yesterday\u2019s closing price $1131.74. We forecast GAAP EPS between $9.67 and $10.47 per share for Q2. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed in our earnings release. We\u2019re pleased that the hard-work and talent of our brand teams delivered great results in Q1 and a strong forecast for Q2. Our guidance reflects our actual results to date and our expectation that such a large business comparing against high transaction growth rates. We experienced a pattern of sequential deceleration. Our forecast does not assume any material change in macroeconomic conditions in general and conditions in the consumer travel market in particular. We will now take your questions. Operator :  (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Heath Terry of Goldman Sachs. Heath Terry \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Great. Thanks. Darren, when you look out sort of across the landscape of travel, what are you seeing in terms of the willingness of hotels to begin to work with additional platforms, particularly some of the smaller hotels that have long been almost sort of de facto exclusive to Priceline including your own other platforms like KAYAK? And then maybe even more broadly, just the level of sophistication that you're seeing in hotels, and particularly with the larger chains, the franchisees of those hotels in engaging more directly with online? Darren Huston : I would say generally speaking of course everyone advancing in a way that they think about the role of technology and how they run our operations, a few years ago we would be going out and you\u2019d have to be teaching people how to use the PC. That obviously isn\u2019t the case anymore. I mean I was just in Bucharest in Romania this week and they\u2019ve got fiber optics in Romania, I mean you would have thought and obviously you will need to adjust the model. But the internet is also changing very fast and it\u2019s not only a world of just PCs, it\u2019s now world of tablets and phones and there\u2019s so many options open to hotels that the degree to which we\u2019re catching up technologically there is becoming more confused, and all the different ways that they could be spending their money. And they of course are always looking for the best and lowest cost option to generate demand and I strongly believe we still offer that, I mean given the fact that everything is changed, you can advertise on Google or TripAdvisor, you have to pay money for that just to play. And a lot of them rely on us to be that provider of demand not just from local demand but demand from all parts of the world, and for any single hotel or even for some of the change it\u2019s difficult for them to get the scale they need to be able to attract customers from the corners of the world, even as much of the technology is advanced. So generally speaking it\u2019s a very dynamic environment, many hotels have channel managers which allow them to plug in the bookings as well as Agoda, they can try things on KAYAK, they can work with other vendors, they can put them on these demand systems, but net, net, most of the hotels I see have a hard time finding the kind of ROI, by doing it on their own, and they would much rather prefer to focus on just running a great hotel. I mean the real secret to success for hotels in this new world is just run a product, have a very differentiated thing and we can help bring the entire world to find them and I think many of them are recognizing that\u2019s the case. Heath Terry \u2013 Goldman Sachs : You mentioned ROI. Obviously you picked up some headlines earlier this month with some comments that you made about the limitations that you found in the social media platforms, the ROI there. Is that just maybe to go beyond the headline, is that something that you feel is sort of an innate limitation of those platforms or is that something that Priceline sees as an opportunity to exploit down the road as either those platforms or customers get more sophisticated around using them for travel purposes? Darren Huston : So to be clear, we do spend money on Facebook and Twitter and any other platform and we really care deeply understand our offerings and may also work closely with us to try to make this work. That has built a small fraction of our spend and I think that is important to differentiate between kind of primarily brand advertisers, the Coca-Colas and GMs of the world, advertisers like us which are directly response advertisers and for direct response advertisers, these are these large service of audience in the world that just haven't been figured out how to translate that audience into a transaction where Google of course is extremely good at this as our many of them others and my comments there are more wanting to move bigger and faster and I'm sure, and to be honest I think Facebook for instance is making a lot of progress but we would love to have some of these big audience pools to be able to find business at an ROI like we find in other channels, and that's really my comment. And if anything I would call a general encouragement to continue to \u2013 they will be able to figure this out. I think man of these large audience platforms, company like Priceline are the key I think for them breaking the back of the issue, how do they deal a powerful advertising business. Operator : Our next question comes from Justin Post of Bank of America. Justin Post \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch : Can you comment a little bit about the positive ROI you're seeing in 1Q and then why you guided a little bit for deleverage in 2Q? I think that also is related to shifting out spend to 2Q. Maybe talk a little bit why you did that. And are you spending more now because you anticipate healthy activity in 3Q? Darren Huston : Hey Justin, so to be clear we didn't have positive ROIs in Q1, we still had ROI pressure \u2013 we had positive ROI but we didn\u2019t have year-over-year. Year-over-year slightly negative not to the extent that have seen thus far in Q2 and we\u2019re forecasting. We had a significant beneficial impact from the inclusion of KAYAK in Q1 and that was built into our forecast, we knew that, that was going to be there. KAYAK also had a better quarter than with the forecast, so that contributed, we get less of a benefit as we move into Q2 from the inclusion of KAYAK because we lap the acquisition and we made a conscious decision that we\u2019re going to invest to an aggressive degree in variable channels and that\u2019s in our actual results to date and in our forecast for the rest of the quarter for online advertising. For offline advertising if you look at the markets you\u2019re investing in booking.com and KAYAK and Priceline for that matter in the US, UK for booking.com, and Canada there was pretty bad weather in those markets, polar vortex in Canada and US and a lot of snow, flight disruption and we had flooding in the UK. And so we decided to step up guest and not spend as much for offline advertising there and instead deferred it to Q2 where there is still huge amount of travel booking going on for spring breaks and for summer vacation. So that\u2019s why we pushed back on that. Daniel Finnegan : I would also note that Q2 is really a key period in the online travel space, and certainly in the northern hemisphere. And we\u2019re going to make sure that we \u2013 in the channels that we really understand, the variable channels that we\u2019re getting at least if not more than our fair share of your channels, other may be using a lot of couponing and discounting, that\u2019s not traditionally been a way that we build business, we\u2019re going to make sure that the channels are warmed up and the snow leaves and prices get less, we want to be in the market executing because that\u2019s when you really build demand for the summer and we want to make sure that our forecast reflects that. Justin Post \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch : And maybe one follow-up. As we think about 3Q, the KAYAK acquisition will be lapped, what would you give advice as we start to model 3Q without KAYAK in there? Darren Huston : We don\u2019t give any guidance beyond Q2 as our normal practice, it will definitely get less benefit in the online ad efficiency from the KAYAK acquisition as we lap it. So I would just assume that there is no built in efficiency from that and then you\u2019ve got to come up with your own estimation as to what you think will happen with just the online ROIs and in the marketplace in general. That\u2019s such a big number in our P&L that it can be very volatile and can have its positive or negative impact on operating leverage. Operator : Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth of JPMorgan. Douglas Anmuth \u2013 JPMorgan: I just want to just stick with the KAYAK theme here. Just coming up on the anniversary in a couple weeks, can you just talk how you're thinking about the benefits so far of KAYAK versus the standalone business, and then also how it's driving broader group, how that's grown over last year relative to what you're thinking when you acquired it. Darren Huston : I would say generally speaking, we\u2019ve seen the meta [ph] is becoming a more important channel for all of the OTA brands in the group and I think bidding and owning meta has taught us a lot about what that means, what does it mean to the other side for somebody selling advertising for those volume advertising and we certainly do a lot of impressive group to share best practice I would say in particular in the area of mobile, KAYAK has been a tremendous addition into the conversation of the group as we try to build our way through how we can drive success in the mobile space. They also have had a pretty nice impacts on Priceline\u2019s air business, it\u2019s been another area I would flag as a positive. Now the way we run the group is the brands run very independently. We do share across the group, we have sessions around social and mobile and other topics but really it\u2019s up to Steve and his team to drive the results and knowing Steve and his folks, I think they get energized being around other -- group of other really high performing companies and thinking about how they\u2019re going to take their product and lead to their business being the world\u2019s leading meta. And now I'm excited to take settlement with the group, driving some really good results and now the next page for them is to go from being what I would call primarily the US business to becoming very global and they become a number of experiments to that degree that we\u2019re feeling really good about and quite promising. Operator : Our next question comes from Ross Sandler of Deutsche Bank. Ross Sandler \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Just had two questions. Back to the ROI discussion. So if you strip out the impact from KAYAK we're probably seven quarters into the period where you started to call out ROI pressure. So is the year-on-year decline in ROI ex-KAYAK a function of the geographic mix shift which is natural in the business, or if we look at it on a same geo basis, is the ROI declining there as well? And do you envision a time where booking will have a base of organic traffic that could potentially offset these ROI pressures or not? And then the second question is one that you've gotten in the past, but TripAdvisor announced this week that they're going to launch assisted book for all channels, smartphone, mobile, and tablet -- sorry, smartphone, desktop, and tablet. How do you view these assisted channels? If we were to see Google implement assisted book do you have any sense of how that could impact your unit economics in hotel? Daniel Finnegan : Hey Ross, first of all on ROI, you are right, we\u2019ve got pressure now for seven quarters to varying degrees. We saw the back half of 2013 less pressure as we were comping against the periods where the pressure first started until the comps got a little bit easier. I would argue that as you go into the back half this year, maybe therefore the comps are little bit tougher but it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re not going to give a forecast and it\u2019s very difficult to predict even if we wanted to give long exactly how the market is going to lay out that far into the future. In terms of geographic shift, won\u2019t give you any details of our marketing ROIs by market but this is too significant of an impact in the consolidated results to \u2013 not being more across the board. Darren Huston : I would probably start off by just saying that TripAdvisor is really partner of ours and we have a very healthy relationship and I would say it\u2019s got even stronger over time and it feels quite data driven and quite symbiotic and we are finding ways together to drive a lot more business in their sort of core products. And when it comes generally to the introduction of new products, the way we think about it is we are always changing on both the ROI as well as the strategic value and I talked about strategic value, it\u2019s just a good experience of a customer. It\u2019s creative of a customer who they book with, as it helped us build customers for the future, or it\u2019s just about a single transaction. And if the strategic value of a particular product is high, for instance Google PPC over the years but then we lean in, then we invest, then we spend more on it, we focus our people on innovating the campaign, we actually even co-create products in those scenarios. If the strategic value is low, obviously we don\u2019t spend heavily, we lean back, we go for really high ROIs, we don\u2019t invest, we might even just partially put product in, or even not participate at all. That\u2019s always the trade off we\u2019re going and I think in the case of [indiscernible], we understand the product really well, [indiscernible] lot of change to try to address some of our strategic concerns but at least on the launch, we decided not to participate, at this time that\u2019s not that we won\u2019t in the future and that is very constructive and I think in the case of TripAdvisor or Google, who introduced the new product, we\u2019re very involved in the discussion and then ultimately they\u2019re going to make their decision, and we will make our decision and that\u2019s how all these things work. So I do feel very comfortable that we are building a bigger and stronger directed to over time and [indiscernible] any partner that we are not afraid to make really difficult decisions because we do every day. And over time it\u2019s smarter to build up a better business. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC. Mark Mahaney \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : I wanted to ask a broad question about alternative accommodations, you given the disclosure that\u2019s become a larger part of your pace, could you talk about the impact of that to the business in terms of -- maybe just in terms of consumers, do you find that this is bringing a broad range of consumers, are you able to increase match rates, what this does to your overall economics, does it help geographic expansion, just does this give you greater depth in each existing market? What\u2019s the impact of the buildout of alternative accommodations on your business? Darren Huston : Thanks, Mark. I think generally speaking it\u2019s been very positive, because if you think about it when people come to a city, they\u2019re just looking for a place to stay but the scenario under which you arrive [indiscernible] might be with your family and kids, and other ones might be a business trip, maybe you are backpacking or you\u2019re on a Gulf trip with friends, and in a way hotels can satisfy many of those needs but there is other types of accommodations that might never satisfy. For instance, I was talking to some folks about hostel booking and they were telling us, you guys know you\u2019re the number one way that people book a hostel, I mean it\u2019s hard to imagine three years ago that we were like huge in the hospital world \u2013 then with the younger consumer, it\u2019s a low ticker, what brings us apparently just on a very low budget. When you look at Paris, it allows you to find a place you can book for \u20ac30 but we also have the George at the bank and you could save for \u20ac1000 if you want, so it\u2019s trend for the assortment that really allows us to treat different consumer scenarios and with products that match the needs of the consumer. Specifically vacation rentals, which is kind of the latest in the long tail, or self catered product, it\u2019s becoming a really good deal because vacation rentals are very difficult to book, you go through an email phone with the user, people don\u2019t feel secure about it, also many familiars, the vacation rentals is an upgrade, if they are on vacation, they are also saying on a visa or in Tashkent, so our role of going down the path of accommodation, getting them wired up, making them directly bookable, making them instantly convertible, it\u2019s good work to do and by increasing that assortment, it\u2019s further strengths in booking.com and our other brands as products that consumers want to go to first to really find the accommodation that matches them. But I would say it\u2019s been \u2013 it\u2019s really hard work by the way because you should go down the long tail, you\u2019re getting really small places, you\u2019re getting the cities without name, you\u2019re getting to families and holidays but it\u2019s great work in the sense of really reinventing the product that we bring to consumers and it\u2019s really going extremely well. And one other thing I would say is more people are looking for products like apartments or self-catered product around the world and even hotels are adjusting, you find many hotels in Europe that in the front they are hotels but in the back they\u2019ve got an apartment block, if they are using for families etc. So also seeing that the product within a single hotel can have many variants depending on the user needs that they are trying to address. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Millman of Millman Research. Michael Millman \u2013 Millman Research : Could you talk about what impact you're seeing from Trivago on KAYAK in the US? And also on the rental cars, can you talk about what you're seeing in pricing in Europe and the US and what you're seeing in fleet availability in Europe and the US? Darren Huston : I will let Dan take the second one, rental cars. With regard to Trivago and KAYAK, both of them are \u2013 this is not from the FTA site, both are great sources of demand, Trivago in the United States has grown significantly but off to a very low base and we\u2019re participating in that with Trivago, and we use the thing with KAYAK, we try to treat our first demand very independently regardless the act Expedia is the majority owner of Trivago and we won KAYAK, we try to keep Chinese wall between those, that I know Expedia has the same and we\u2019re getting a lot of growth out of both of those sources of bookings today. Daniel Finnegan : And in terms of rental cars business, Michael, pricing is up low single-digits in the US and down low single digit for our European business. Availability for summer is always a challenge as the team in rentalcars.com does a great job of working closely with the suppliers to make sure we get our fair share of the availability, that\u2019s an ongoing path to make sure we are in the right position. In the US as well as it relates to our Name Your Own Price business, it\u2019s been more challenged each of the big players, the big 3 have partnered with their smaller price alternatives where they can move some excess inventory on weekends and what have you, in the past more typically got to our Name Your Own Price channel, so this is really nothing there, it\u2019s always the challenge for the Priceline team to get at that excess inventory, we will have quarters where we get better results because we\u2019re more successful in quarters like Q1 and what we are projecting for Q2 where it looks like it\u2019s going to be more challenging, the market is healthy and there is not just that many excess cars to move through Name Your Own Price. Operator : Our next question comes from Dean Prissman of Credit Suisse. Dean Prissman \u2013 Credit Suisse : So as you look at the continued growth of your business, room night growth of 32%, I'm guessing it's combination of both new users and greater wallet share with existing customers. Can you qualitatively discuss the relative importance of each lever? And then I have a follow-up. Darren Huston : Yeah I would say we have a healthy balance of both new usage as well as repeat. We\u2019re always looking to get both levers in a way I don't feel that healthy to have too much of your business direct because we\u2019ve got to keep casting the net and the fishing net to bring more customer base, clean good franchise. So we have a healthy balance of both, more of our business as Dan mentioned is coming direct which I think is healthy and that includes new customers. But I don\u2019t really want to talk too much about wallet share and other topics which should be confidential. Dean Prissman \u2013 Credit Suisse : And then given the size of the outbound China travel market and even greater potential, beyond the Ctrip relationship, can you update us on your strategy with Booking.com, particularly as one considers the tour group oriented nature of international travel originating from the country? Darren Huston : We feel very positive about our outbound business from China, it\u2019s one of our fastest growing businesses in the world. We did find just for color that The Malaysian air tragedy where everyone had a bit of a short term impact but we are seeing Chinese in drove right now traveling to North Asia, Southeast Asia, even Europe, US and I think part of this is all nationalities are becoming more comfortable with mid travel or traveling in a do-it-yourself way into the packaged travel, that\u2019s a general trend. We certainly see that with Chinese as well and you can come to Amsterdam I would figure [indiscernible] Shanghai, all the people who have come back, channel bags, and they were definitely traveling on their own, wasn\u2019t group travel and I think you\u2019re going to continue to see that trend, the Internet in some ways makes it more comfortable for even cautious travelers to go out whether couple or as a family versus having to travel as groups. By the way I had spent three years as they have a Microsoft in Japan, even back then Japanese only travelled in groups. So you definitely see a massive change in that Japanese are traveling in alone or with very groups of friends, doing their do-it-yourself travel versus the kind of packages. By the way it doesn\u2019t mean packages are going away any time soon and it\u2019s just that the general trend is for more and more independent travel including among North Asian folks. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Sena of Evercore Partners. Ken Sena \u2013 Evercore Partners : Does growth in Facebook and some of the newer channels pose any sort of change to how you think about rate parity over the next few years given that it's a log-in experience? Maybe as you look out over the next few years, how should we think about rate parity and what effect that could have on the competitive landscape? Darren Huston : I think it\u2019s a good chance to touch on this topic and I would say first, you need to start with the consumer and if anything things are getting more confusing for consumers if you go on to most meta channel despite all the great work that\u2019s been done, most rates are not real deal, there is tax issue, exchange rate issue, lot of wholesale inventory being landed as retail inventory, sometimes you will click on a rate and it goes to a blank website and you try to \u2013 use something else. So the whole area of rate in hotels and accommodations I would say unfortunately it\u2019s like backsliding, there\u2019s just a lot of noise in the market and that\u2019s a very important thing that needs to get addressed, by a combination of both gate, and metas, the world just needs more transparency to really rate. I guess the second point I would make is that new customers get charged more, I mean it's a basic principle of the company, we will not let them charge more, it\u2019s why we have the best price guarantee, it is why we push for transparency in pricing and clarity and we will go to the ends of the earth to make sure they don\u2019t. So to some degree we need more data on it, we need to more better understand that property is like building a product less on some surgical social channel but we understand the opportunity whether it\u2019s also Google etc. and all of the new ways to market as well as anyone does and we\u2019re monitoring this and creating investment in big data etc to really understand in depth to basically deliver on that basic principle, we will never let our customers get charged more. And that also by the way includes collecting deals that are better than anywhere they will find on the internet and I mean we have thousands and thousands of rates on our sites that if you log in or you are loyal user, those hotels are providing to you to get your business, so we\u2019re in our own a massive marketing channel for hotels to pick a customer that might have shown up somebody else to come to their hotels. And I think that is going to continue going forward. But I actually relish the opportunity to continue to address this and I think we are in a pretty unique position to help bring some sanity to the world of pricing, both because of KAYAK, also because of our position in the marketplace as the world\u2019s leading player in the space. Operator : Our next question comes from Tom White of Macquarie. Tom White \u2013 Macquarie: Thanks for taking my question. I guess I just wanted to reconcile some of your comments around meta search becoming a more important channel for the OTAs. But I'm also hearing some comments about sort of better direct navigation business in the quarter. If we look at sort of your markets on a geographic, unique basis, is the percentage of traffic you're getting from meta search increasing or decreasing? And then also just on mobile, maybe provide a bit more color around some of the non-transaction engagement you referenced in your prepared remarks. Darren Huston : Let me take the first comment. We \u2013 meta search is an important channel for us but it's not as big as you might think it is, it\u2019s been growing as a percentage of our source demand, we have many other source of demand versus Google, and many other search engines that we buy demand from globally but we also have a very long tail affiliate of EasyJet, providing there and all the way down the line many, many airlines and railroads etc. So if you look at all sorts of paid demand, direct demand is growing search paid demand, within paid demand, meta continues to grow quite well and take some x proportion but it\u2019s not so dramatic, it\u2019s completely shifting that overall landscape \u2013 for Q1 it is a positive factor in terms of our advertising efficiency, it\u2019s the trend we\u2019re seeing for some time now, a nice growth in our direct booking business, nice growth in repeat \u2013 we talked about our advertising philosophy, the client focused dollars in areas that we think are strategically valuable, we will build the customers that recognize our brand and it\u2019s loyal to it, from the service we can provide them over the long run. Tom White \u2013 Macquarie: And then just on mobile, talked about non-transaction engagement. I was just wondering if there's any more color there, and if you ever thought that that might be a monetizeable opportunity for you somewhere down the line, maybe advertising revenues or something like that. Darren Huston : I think on that, the way we think about it is \u2013 sometimes it\u2019s hard to connect all the pieces but the users will take one of the screen to ultimately book on, we want to give credit to the experience to all the screens that they ultimately use and multiscreen attribution is not simple, so we think we have a fairly strong bit on it in terms of way \u2013 whether you use it for entering the system on what devices they are using, to ultimately complete their journey, and then we think all learning is they are using more and more screens to help on their journey, it\u2019s amazing how many screens people touch on the same booking. I think what that\u2019s helping us do is it\u2019s changing \u2013 just the booking and into something that improves the entire trip from easy check in to easy Wi-Fi to even comparing thins like guides to the city and other elements of innovation, in some ways it\u2019s almost like the move to increase the number of screens and move to mobile, has the wallet that we are painting on before it was just the desktop and it was a single experience and people would print out their paper based confirmation and that would be it in terms of their digital connection with us. So now everything is digital, many never print the confirmations, they won\u2019t actually go on the confirmation, when they are standing at the bus, or train station and say, taking to my hotel, that you can now do on booking.com and literally give you walking direction, the driving direction to your hotel, as you find things around your hotel, that it\u2019s interesting I would say all of the growth of screens, it\u2019s still early days, but I think we are getting a lot of smarter about thinking of the consumer as holding many screens and then deciding how we interact with that. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a big advertising thing necessarily, that\u2019s not our thinking about, it\u2019s much more about how do we become more meaningful in the booking experience rather than just being aggressively do the transaction. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Olson of Piper Jaffray. Mike Olson \u2013 Piper Jaffray : For Booking.com in the US, where would you say we are on the spectrum of growth trajectory? Was there some low-hanging fruit in terms of market share gains in the first few quarters of entering the market with the new brand and the big ad campaign, and now it becomes more challenging to gain incremental share? Or is it the opposite, that now with the brand further permeated in the market, it should be easier to leverage the work you've done in building Booking.com in that market? Darren Huston : I would say that generally speaking it\u2019s still early days, we recently passed 40,000 properties in the United States and to build a property kind of like it takes many years, we\u2019ve gotten now pretty much all the change on board, now we are building independent hotels and really gotten into long tail accommodations, I was talking about a team in Boston the other day, all of P&Ds and things that they have yet to put on the platform. So we are seeing continued growth, there are some markets that are very retail oriented, places like Miami, where we are really bigger, San Diego and other markets that are more wholesale oriented but Orlando is the world place like that we need to continue to chip away but in the way that we grew the rest of our business, it doesn\u2019t all come in one pop, it\u2019s like a continued methodical breaking down walls, moving forward and I feel really good about what our teams are doing in the United States. We are going to continue to expand the number of offices, the amount of engagement we do, the hotels and we\u2019re still at booking.com highly under-indexed in the United States relative to Europe and the degree to which we can continue this hard work there's a lot of growth still ahead of us in that market. Mike Olson \u2013 Piper Jaffray : And then following an earlier question, could you talk about where you are on number of vacation rental properties now on Booking.com? And will you kind of focus on primarily adding portfolios of properties from managers or also individual property owners? Darren Huston : I think the count today is right at the bottom \u2013 vacation rentals at the bottom, we tend to think it\u2019s a 145,000 approximately vacation rentals, we define those as self catered product that includes holiday homes and 144,702, by the way all of our data on the website is real, we\u2019re constantly updating, that\u2019s why I look, but what we are trying to do is build those properties that you can truly confirm, that you know you\u2019re going to be able to stay there, that have electric calendars that are secure, and we started by working with property managers because it\u2019s easy to understand, because it\u2019s like working with the hotel owners, it\u2019s got thousands of rooms, the room impacts the vacation rentals themselves. And we\u2019re building out other some extra net [ph] other products will ultimately allow us to work with individuals vacation homeowners as well. That\u2019s our goal, there is a lot of work to do to get there but you will continue to see this number go up over time because we\u2019re just going to methodically break down the walls and bringing the product on board. We\u2019re really happy with our production, if you talk to any of players who work with us I think they will highlight to you that booking.com produces extremely well for them and we hope to bring that production to a broader number of accommodations over time. I would say we\u2019re more European planted today because it was a natural place to start we do have vacation rentals in other parts the world but slowly that account outside of our [indiscernible] building as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Fitzgerald of Jefferies. Brian Fitzgerald \u2013 Jefferies: A couple quick ones. Maybe a quick follow-up on mobile. Anything to call out in terms of engagement as differentiated across your brands or geographies? And then on booking, user reviews up 44% by our estimates year over year, 10% in the quarter. How do you think about -- how you drive review growth there and the efficacy of the reviews, make them more valuable to the traveler? Darren Huston : I will start with the review question and then \u2013 so on reviews, the thing I would like the people is our reviews are all some verified guests and we still have rule that once your review is 14 months old, becomes off the site, so it makes the comps a little bit weird at times because of seasonality. So importantly when you look at that number you always take that into account and the second thing is obviously our ability to attract people, their review changes over time. Right now I am feeling very good if anything engagement is increasing despite the fact that often when you check out of a hotel you get a message from us, from the hotel, maybe somebody else and people are engaging a very deeply in our reviews and our review response rates are very high and keeping our reviews a very high quality and we are proud of that and we feel like we have the largest number of verified reviews for accommodations in the world, of course others have many more reviews but they are not necessarily verified, they are much more open ended in terms of anyone being able to do the review. I think your other question was on mobile. Daniel Finnegan : And so we said in the past, the brands are at different stages of maturity in terms of mobile apps and mobile websites, booking.com, KAYAK and Priceline.com are pretty far advanced, all of our brands are getting significant and growing levels of traffic coming to us through mobile devices and we are doing a nice job in growing our mobile bookings are very high rate as well. So from us mobile engagement -- typical level when a customer comes in and look at the [inaudible] Operator : Our next question comes from [inaudible] Darren Huston : \u2026Because everyone is trying to figure out this exact question. I think for the group versus others would be very heavily weighted on mobile web, we think that's where you're going to a pickup brand-new transactional customers, somebody standing in airports, staying in either hotel tonight and they open to a web-based record, downloads our app, to necessarily make that, we think our app customers as more of our loyal bookers, we don\u2019t necessarily try to take them down to do their first booking ever, on a mobile app, we are happy with that. But that\u2019s not \u2013 that\u2019s been our general way of generating demand with mobile and we also believe that mobile downloads for sure don't lead to engaged booking does and there is a lot of Charlotte [indiscernible] lots of download but it doesn't necessarily ultimately make it a good ROI investments and we\u2019ve got similar views in the past on things like Facebook likes, it\u2019s nice to have but it\u2019s not ultimately leading to a good result and we definitely shied away from. We also don\u2019t believe strongly and overly interrupting the experience that when you get on mobile app we immediately tell you we will download the app, without letting you get through to the experience, that\u2019s something that differentiates our approach, I think we\u2019re much more about what the consumer experience and quickly getting them into the booking path and learning about what they are going to do next. That\u2019s -- again it's an evolving \u2013 there is lots of companies that are trying to implement in the space, we\u2019re building our own tooling, we have a lot of smart people looking at it, I feel very good about our result but it\u2019d be wrong for me to say that we\u2019ve got everything figure that it will work, we\u2019re just trying to get as smart as we can and be ROI focused as much as we can on this space. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin Kopelman of Cowen and Company. Kevin Kopelman \u2013 Cowen and Company : Thanks a lot. On KAYAK, you said it delivered impressive profitability. Can you give us any sense of how it compares to overall group margins? And also can you discuss any Easter timing impact for Q1 and to what extent that will offset the Priceline anniversary of KAYAK in Q2. Darren Huston : So the KAYAK profitability, the KAYAK business is nicely profitable. Some of the competitors talk about the growth rate of their businesses but the profit is more in question. Steve and team have chosen to strike the right balance I think between what they spend to drive topline growth while delivering very healthy margins. So our earnings based upon check out, they are delivering higher relative percentage of their annual profit in Q1, it\u2019s really positive to our margins for Q1. In terms of Easter timing that is a benefit to Q2 and a detriment to Q1 [inaudible] that\u2019s reflected in our forecast, so Q2 looks better \u2013 Q2 looks worse as a result of that shift in terms of our profitability and gross profit growth. Kevin Kopelman \u2013 Cowen and Company : And then a follow-up on vacation rentals. We know it's a large percentage of the properties. Can you give us any sense of how big a factor it is on bookings or room nights growth? Is that a meaningful addition to growth yet? Darren Huston : Yeah, I think as we have disclosed vacation rentals are not \u2013 on average not as big as [inaudible] rentals. So [technical difficulty] educate you on this call but this call is a self-catered hotel with lots of apartments. And there is actually quite a few of those and it\u2019s a growing category particularly in Europe and also in other parts of the world. So we feel like the production in the vacation rentals space is very strong, but always if you look at the growth of our property count it always going to over emphasize the amount of rooms supplied because the supply is still many times, you are getting less rooms for property. It\u2019s not that there is no hotels to acquire requiring many, many hotels to just over time the long tail, per property brings on investments. Operator : Thank you. And at this time I would like to turn the call back to management for any further remarks. Darren Huston : No, I want to thank everyone again \u2013 this is our first conference call in Amsterdam \u2013 it\u2019s our first conference call for Europe hopefully, it\u2019s a signal that we are a global company but I apologize everyone having to get up before the market but I do really appreciate the interest and the engagement and we are looking forward to a great Q2. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude today\u2019s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.",

And now, I would like to introduce the Priceline Group's speakers for this afternoon, Darren Huston and Daniel Finnegan. Please go ahead, gentlemen. Darren Huston : Well thank you very much. Welcome to the Priceline Group\u2019s second quarter conference call. Thank you for joining us before the market opens this morning in New York. I'm here in Amsterdam with Priceline Group CFO Dan Finnegan. The Group reported consolidated gross bookings for the second quarter of approximately $13.5 billion, up 34% year-over-year, or about 32% on a local currency basis. Non-GAAP net income was $667 million; up 31% year over year, and earnings per share was $12.51, up 29% versus prior year surpassing Factset consensus estimate of $12.06 per share and our guidance for the quarter. Our customers booked accommodation reservations for 90 million room nights in the quarter, up 29% year over year. Booking.com's platform now has over 525,000 hotels and other accommodations in 205 countries, up 58% over last year, reflecting Booking.com's continued aggressive push to extend its lead as the world's largest brand for booking accommodations. Following the success of Booking.com's first offline advertising campaign in the U.S. last year, and the encouraging early results this year of the campaigns in Australia, the UK, and Canada, we launched TV advertising in Germany a few weeks ago. These off-line branding efforts, together with our substantial long term investments in online brand building, product innovation and best-in-class customer service have helped to grow our mix of direct business. We believe the healthy balance we have between a strong direct business and first-time customers acquired online are critical to sustained and profitable growth, and are helping us increase market share in every market we operate in. Another area of investment and innovation for Booking.com has been vacation rentals. We are rapidly expanding our footprint of vacation rentals, and we now have over 190,000 directly bookable self-catered properties. In the last 12 months, our customers spent over $4 billion on vacation rentals that they booked primarily through Bookng.com, but also on our experimental site, Villas.com. We are encouraged by these early results, but also recognize there is still much left to do. We expect to make significant progress in how we grow, merchandise, and expand our vacation rental offering in the coming months. Agoda.com was negatively impacted by the civil unrest in Thailand, but nevertheless delivered good transactional growth in the quarter. Both Agoda.com and Booking.com continued to strengthen the Group\u2019s position in the Asia Pacific region, particularly among international travelers. We are making excellent strides in North Asia and Booking.com has become the largest online accommodation service in Australia. This region of the world continues to contribute to higher overall Group growth, as it increases its share of our worldwide business. Priceline.com posted solid 21% growth in gross bookings, with strong results in its retail offerings. The Name Your Own Price business however continues to be under pressure, given the tighter availability conditions present in today's robust travel environment. Priceline.com's hotel results, when combined with Booking.com's success in North America, continued to reflect hotel market share gains. RentalCars.com delivered good results in what has become a more competitively intense marketplace. Having transitioned from an entirely semi-opaque offering to a retail offering, our team is now focusing on striking the right balance of savings and transparency, to deliver the right product at the right time. I have high confidence in our team's ability to successfully make this transition. KAYAK again delivered an impressive bottom line quarter, while also accelerating its top line. Targeted expansion in Europe, with a dedicated off-line advertising presence is yielding favorable results, and we look forward to building the KAYAK franchise across Europe, in an aggressive but profitable manner. Success on mobile remains critical to all of our brands. Mobile has become a very material and fast-growing booking channel for the Group, and we believe we are on the right path of offering best-in-class experiences, without bias to interface chosen by the customer. We prefer to earn our customer's loyalty over the long term, by exceeding their expectations, time-and-time again, rather than relying on short-term channel specific incentives. We view the mobile opportunity through this lens, and are taking a disciplined approach to driving lasting, sustainable customer engagement with our Company's brands. China is also critical for the future. As we announced last week, the Group expanded its relationship with Ctrip, the largest online travel agency in China. We invested $500 million through a convertible bond, and feature a plan of the Group the right to obtain up to 10% of Ctrip's outstanding through a combination of this convertible bond and open market purchases. The Group will also have the right to appoint an observer to the Ctrip Board of Directors. By getting closer together, both we and Ctrip see ways that we can offer our customers the absolute best choice of accommodations and experiences. This collaboration will bring more guests to China, and more Chinese to the rest of the world, in the coming months, quarters and years. I look forward to executing against this next stage of our partnership, and continuing to learn from and work with James and his leadership team in Shanghai. Finally, I'd like to welcome the OpenTable team to the Priceline Group. We closed on the acquisition in late July, and have already begun the groundwork to realize the global potential we see in this adjacent marketplace. The OpenTable team meanwhile has been working hard on expanding our mobile payments app, known as Pay with OpenTable, beyond the pilot launch in San Francisco earlier this year. Today, we are announcing that Pay with OpenTable is now launching in New York. We are also confirming our plans to roll it out to 20 other cities across the U.S. before year-end. Early results show that everyone wins with pay with OpenTable. The restaurant gets faster table turns, the servers get better tips, and the guests leave far more satisfied. Since many of you on the call are from San Francisco or New York, we welcome you to try this experience yourselves. It's really quite satisfying, and we believe it has great potential. The Group's business performance exceeded expectations in the quarter. We remain committed to making the smart investments in marketing and people, and I want to thank our employees around the world for their hard work and dedication. I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review. Dan. Daniel J. Finnegan: Thanks, Darren. I'll discuss some of the highlights and operating results and cash flows for the quarter, and then provide guidance for the third quarter of 2014. Growth rates mentioned in my remarks are in relation to the prior year comparable period, unless otherwise indicated. Q2 was a strong quarter from a top and bottom line perspective. Room nights booked grew by 29% in the second quarter, with solid performance across all our key regions. Average daily rates, or ADRs, for Q2 2014 were up on a local currency basis by about 3% for the consolidated Group. The FX rate for the Euro to the U.S. dollar was favorable for the second quarter compared to the prior year by about 5%; however, the Euro weakened versus the dollar as compared to the $1.39 exchange rate that prevailed at the time we gave Q2 guidance. As a result, currency exchange rates helped year-over-year U.S. dollar growth, but had a slightly negative impact compared to our guidance. Q2 gross bookings grew by 34% compared to prior year. Our Q2 international bookings to grow by 36% in U.S. dollars, and by about 35% on a local currency basis. Gross bookings for our Priceline.com brand business in the U.S. grew by 21%. Performance was strong across retail air, hotel, and rental car verticals, including the benefit from increased advertising placements within KAYAK. Hotel express deals also performed well, but our Name Your Own Price hotel, air, and car services were all down year-over-year, due to limited availability of discounted rates, and share shift to express deals. I highlight that Name Your Own Price impacts merchant gross bookings, and disproportionately impacts merchant revenues, since we record Name Your Own Price revenues on a gross basis, while our other revenues are recorded on a net basis. Gross profit for the quarter was $1.9 billion, and grew 36%, as compared to the prior year. The inclusion of KAYAK in our results contributed about 3 percentage points of inorganic gross profit growth for the quarter, and a later Easter this year also benefited Q2 growth. Our international operations generated gross profit of $1.65 billion, which constituted an increase of 38% as compared to the prior year, and 36% on a local currency basis. Gross profit for our U.S. business including KAYAK amounted to $230 million, which represented 25% growth versus prior year. Non-GAAP operating income amounted to 42% of gross profit for Q2, which is 210 bips lower than last year. Operating margins were impacted by 76 bips of deleverage in offline advertising, mainly related to our Booking.com TV campaigns and the inclusion of KAYAK offline advertising. Online advertising expense as a percentage of gross profit delevered by 50 bips compared to prior year, mainly due to lower ROIs, partly offset by the favorable impact of including KAYAK. The inclusion of KAYAK benefits this metric through the anniversary of the acquisition, because KAYAK spends relatively less on online advertising as a percentage of gross profit, and spending by our other brands for ad placements on KAYAK is eliminated from our consolidated results. Other OpEx also reflects some deleverage, because it includes $5.6 million of one-time deal costs incurred in Q2, related mainly to the OpenTable acquisition. OpEx also includes the impact of our investment in people, offices, and IT-related expenses to support our business growth. Operating margins came in about 100 bips better than our guidance forecast, due mainly to less year-over-year decline than assumed in online advertising ROIs. Adjusted EBITDA for Q2 amounted to $809 million, which exceeded the top end of our guidance range of $775 million, and represents 30% growth versus prior year. Non-GAAP net income grew by 31%, and non-GAAP EPS grew by 29%, reflecting the impact of the higher fully-diluted share count. In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $690 million of cash from operations during second quarter of 2014, which is about 16% above last year. We spent about $32 million on CapEx, and we repaid about $59 million of our 2015 convertible notes upon early conversion by their holders. Our cash and investments amounted to $7.2 billion at quarter end, with about $1.8 billion in the U.S. In July, we used our U.S. cash and $995 million borrowed under our revolving credit facility to fund the $2.5 billion of cash paid to close the OpenTable acquisition. Our credit facility does not expire for over two years, and represents low-cost borrowing, at about 1.4% interest. Our credit rating was recently upgraded by S&P to BBB-plus, and terms in the investment grade and convertible debt markets continued to be very attractive. We will evaluate all longer-term financing options available to us going forward. Before I cover third quarter guidance, I'd like to spend a few moments on recent strategic transactions, and their impact on the forecast. We lapped the KAYAK acquisition we made on May 21 last year, so there is no inorganic benefit to top line and bottom line growth in Q3. We have also seen a meaningful benefit to our online ad efficiency over the past year from KAYAK's impact on this metric as I mentioned a moment ago, while discussing Q2 results. This year-over-year benefit no longer exists in Q3. OpenTable is included in our forecasted results from the acquisition close date of July 24 through the end of the quarter. It is only a couple of weeks since the deal closed, so we are in the process of charting the path forward with the OpenTable team, but we intend to increase investment in Q3 and coming quarters, to position the business for future growth. We expect that the impact of the OpenTable acquisition on our non-GAAP EPS for Q3 will be slightly accretive. In Q2, we also acquired certain businesses that provide hotel marketing services including boutique. Our Q3 forecast includes the operating expenses for these businesses, as they build and refine their services over Q3 and coming quarters, to go to market. We believe that our hotel marketing services team will create compelling offerings for our hotel partners, and help us deepen our relationships with them on a mutually beneficial basis. Lastly, we just recently announced an expansion of our partnership with Ctrip. We have great respect for the Ctrip team, and are excited at the prospect of partnering more closely with the leading online travel agent in China. We invested $500 million of our international cash in a Ctrip convertible bond. Ctrip also granted Priceline Group the right to purchase their shares in the open market over the next year, so that combined with shares underlying the convertible bond Priceline Group could hold up to 10% of Ctrip\u2019s outstanding shares. The impact of the enhanced partnership is reflected in our guidance forecast, and is not expected to have a significant impact on our near term financial results. For Q3 guidance, we are forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 19% to 29% in U.S. dollars, and by 18% to 28% our local currency basis. With U.S. gross bookings growing by about 10% to 15%, which reflects lapping certain ad placements on KAYAK. We expect international gross bookings to grow by 22% to 33% in U.S. dollars, and by 21% to 31% on a local currency basis. Our Q3 forecasts assumes that local currency ADRs for the consolidated Group will be up by about 3% compared to the prior year period. Our Q3 forecast assume that the foreign exchange rates remain at the same $1.34 per Euro and $1.68 per British pound as Friday's closing rates, which would result in average exchange rates that would be stronger by about 2% for the Euro and about 9% for the British pound, as compared to the prior year. I highlight that the Euro exchange rate assumed in our forecast is about 3% weaker than the$1.39 exchange rate that prevailed at the time we reported Q1 and most analyst last updated their forecasts. We have hedged contracts in place to substantially shield our third quarter EBITDA and their earnings from any fluctuation in the Euro or pound versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter, but these hedges do not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue, gross profit and operating income and don\u2019t hedge our earnings beyond the third quarter. We expect Q3 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 15% to 25%, and gross profit dollars to grow by approximately 21% to 31%. We expect the declines in our Name Your Own Price service will impact revenue growth rates in Q3. We expect 350 to 400 bps of deleverage in non-GAAP operating income as a percent of gross profit compare to prior year primarily due to lower online ad ROIs, increased offline spend, and increased investment in other operating expenses. Our Q3 online advertising forecast reflects our actual results to date, and assumed further pressure throughout the remainder of the quarter, based upon the trends we have experienced over the last couple of years. We estimate that the Group will spend roughly $130 million for offline advertising over the back half of the year, with more than half the spend coming in Q3, which puts us near the high end of the full-year range we previously provided. We are pleased with our forecasted operating margins as we make the investments for future growth in OpenTable and hotel marketing services, that we said we would make at the time of the acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $1.265 billion and $1.365 billion, which at the midpoint represents 18% growth versus prior year. Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately 16%, comprised of international income taxes and alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S. We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $19.60 to $21.10 per share which at the midpoint represents 18% growth year-over-year. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully-diluted share count of 53.4 million shares, based upon Friday\u2019s closing stock price. We forecast GAAP EPS between $17.86 and $19.36 per share for Q3. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed in our earnings release. In summary, we believe that our forecast reflects another quarter where we would sustain our market leading topline growth rates, while maintaining strong bottom line growth, and market-leading profit margins. The advertising investments assumed in our forecast are consistent with our past practice, while following a disciplined and sustainable approach to support our brands, while striking a reasonable balance between growth and profitability. We believe that investments in restaurant reservation and hotel marketing services will plant seeds for future growth. Our guidance reflects our actual results to date and our expectation that such a large business, comparing against high transaction growth rates, will experience a pattern of sequential deceleration. Our forecast does not assume any material change in macroeconomic conditions in general, and conditions in the consumer travel market in particular. We will now take your questions. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Justin Post of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now opened. Justin Post \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I'll just do one. On the OpenTable acquisition, can you tell us how you plan to report that in your financials going forward, how we should be thinking about modeling it, and then how you've incorporated that in your gross profit growth, and EBITDA growth, and the EPS growth guidance for Q3? Thank you. Darren Huston : Hi, Justin. We'll report it in revenue, gross profit and in our EBITDA bottom line. It won't show up in our gross bookings or in our room nights obviously so those are key metrics that we always point to for the top line health of the business so those will be unimpacted. For the first year, we'll likely report the revenue that is generated by the business so you have a read on the inorganic impact on our growth rates. We won't break out their profitability separately. We may break out specific metrics from time to time like restaurant count or seated diners, but I wouldn't think we're going to be reporting on those consistently quarter to quarter. Justin Post \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And is there a benefit in your EBITDA or EPS in 3Q? Darren Huston : There is. So as I've said in the prepared remarks we've included OpenTable from the acquisition close date of July 24 through the end of the quarter. Now our forecast does reflect our expectation that we're going to make investments in the business as we said at the time of the acquisition, particularly in the area of international growth and so our forecast also reflects those investments. Justin Post \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you. Darren Huston : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dough Anmuth of JPMorgan. Your line is now opened. Dough T. Anmuth \u2013 JPMorgan Securities, LLC:  Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask about the marketing environment, and Dan, if you could just go into more detail on your comments on ROI and what you're expecting in Q3 here? And also I think, Darren, you talked about disciplined approach on mobile, if you could elaborate on that a little bit as well? Thank you. Daniel J. Finnegan: Thanks a lot, Doug. So in terms of the Marketing environment I'd say on the online side it's obviously a very competitive environment but relatively stable. I'd say we're being like always a little bit prudent because we don't completely control that environment and if within the next six weeks it changes we want to reflect that in our guidance but nothing other than that will report. Obviously the offline Marketing is the stuff that we completely control and that's an area where we decided we're still within the range but at the higher end of the range we gave an offline marketing and we're making investments specifically by with KAYAK and booking.com in Europe and we've actually seen results from the investments we've made to date and we're deciding to double down a little bit on that on the back end of the Summer. Those are the two things as it relates to Marketing. I'd say also from an online perspective of course we're in this competitive environment but we also mentioned our direct business is increasing quite nicely. That's the kind of effect you'd want to see if do offline Marketing which is also a bit of a mobile effect and more of our business on mobile comes direct but I think that's a real healthy trend for the future of course we want to continue to bring new customers into the franchise and that's why we do Marketing but those customers are sticking to the platform and coming back directly which is a real positive sign. And just final comment on the mobile front. We continue to feel really good our mobile products both our web based products and our App product. We don't talk about the percentage of our business that gets done on mobile but it's definitely in line with the other players in our industry and we continue to see really significant growth on mobile going forward and that's not just us, we're seeing that everywhere we buy demand and it's really the nature of the customers transition to more of a multi-screen environment versus just a pure desktop business. Dough T. Anmuth \u2013 JPMorgan Securities, LLC: Great. thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC. Your line is now opened. Mark S. Mahaney \u2013 RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Two questions please. Darren on this direct approach that you are talking about this direct business, could you quantify how much of your business you would say is direct and I assume you mean people coming directly to your brands rather than coming to you through search engine marketing channels. And what learnings do you have about how the loyalty of these customers to profitability, customers to come to you directly versus through the other channels you used in the past and just briefly on Ctrip, it sounds like its not that material because you talk about the mechanics of the deal, maybe its not that change than what you have in the past, but how should that impact if its successful, how should that impact your bookings revenue and earnings five years down the road. Thanks. Darren Huston : Yes, thanks a lot Mark. I would say first on the direct approach, so we don\u2019t like to reveal the exact percentages that we get direct than what we don\u2019t. the way we do think about it though is its all of the free demand that we get basically people coming and typing in Booking.com of coming through our approximately. We often also include of course SEO, e-mail. There is a it of a debate on the SEM we spent our own brand, because that\u2019s very high ROI, but we do consider that indirect, because we are buying the customer, but those customers obviously pay type Booking.com into a search engine and pick our ad, we do pay for them but it\u2019s at a lower rate and that obviously helps us the more they do that versus finding us in other ways, but generally speaking it\u2019s a positive trend, but we like to of course keep a good balance. We are also pushing account signup more on Booking.com and our other brands and a much higher percentage of our customers now use accounts and those accounts are also used to experience the brand more than just a booking brand to get their confirmation when they arrive on site, its also for us to give them other offers, we give our account holders discounted rates, things like that and that\u2019s also improving the business that comes back to us through account holders who generally tend to book more direct than they do through paid channels, because they have an established relationship with us. And then on the Ctrip, you know the mechanics are basically you know Ctrip is a channel for us, if a Ctrip customer books at Booking.com or Agoda hotel room then we record that and then the cost of marketing is what we pay Ctrip in terms of the revenue share its kind of typical affiliate relationship and that we hope gets better and stronger because in this next phase of our relationships we are really working closely with Ctrip to both brand, so the Ctrip customer knows they are booking on Booking or Agoda, but also too improve the content that\u2019s being used to market international accommodations to Ctrip customers. The other side of this deal which actually is completely new, is us using Ctrip\u2019s properties and using those on Booking.com in a reciprocal fashion so we will have customer whose come from overseas and may want to stay in a really small village in China and which may not see a lot of international demand, we will be able to offer them a product that is actually supplied by Ctrip but we end up doing the booking and they of course pay us back for that customer as well. So, obviously we see even regardless of the Ctrip deal, Chinese bookers are one of the fastest growing bookers on all of our properties, particularly on Agoda and Booking and we think that this will only accelerate that and of course tapping into China is going to be a huge benefit, both because they are a great source of bookings, but also we are running a global business here and we believe five, 10 years down the road it would be hard to say you are global if you are not taken China and this is just a next step for us in what will likely be a series of steps as we move closer and closer to Ctrip overtime. Mark S. Mahaney \u2013 RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Thanks Darren. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dean Prissman of Credit Suisse. Your line is now opened. Dean J. Prissman \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities : Thanks for taking my questions. So Darren, just sticking with Ctrip, obviously given the market opportunity of outbound demand from China, I think the strategic motivations for the enhanced distribution agreement are very clear. However, could you shed some light on the strategic motivations underpinning the investment in the Company? And then I think you previously indicated that when you acquired KAYAK, The Priceline Group's brands were underrepresented as advertisers on the platform. To what degree are you fully represented now, and if not, can you give us a qualitative sense on how much runway remains? And then I have one follow-up afterwards, thanks. LLC: Thanks for taking my questions. So Darren, just sticking with Ctrip, obviously given the market opportunity of outbound demand from China, I think the strategic motivations for the enhanced distribution agreement are very clear.

To what degree are you fully represented now, and if not, can you give us a qualitative sense on how much runway remains? And then I have one follow-up afterwards, thanks. Darren Huston : Okay. I would say first of all on the Ctrip deal our original relationship in 2012 was commercial and it was fairly arms length. It was really meant to test the international product of Ctrip and also to build a relationship between the two companies to see a lot of this does come down to cultural match and can we work together and can we build trust together and this next wave which really is a next step and we that making an investment in Ctrip along with the commercial relationship also allowed us to go much deeper int eh commercial relationship with also something that was important to Ctrip as well and I think also in a North Asian context taking a minority share is a positive next step that we're also aligned with their success, the future becomes successful and we become more conformable on the commercial side pushing our brands to one anothers customers but that's really the reason behind it. I think it's a very safe investment in the way that we built it, it gives us a lot of options going forward, both sides retained a lot of flexibility in both running our own businesses but also I mentioned to James we're almost like second cousins now, we're not necessarily married but we are certainly related and that also for our employees on both sides, I think \u2013 then understand relationship between the two companies is more special than a standard arms length commercial relationship. And your second question was Dean was on KAYAK? Dean J. Prissman \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities, LLC: Exactly. Daniel J. Finnegan: Yes, I would say it's funny because we go back and forth as you know at the Group we run our brands very independently and I give Steve a hard time all the time. I would say we have reasonable representation on KAYAK. We don't do anything with KAYAK to tilt the playing field at all. We keep a very strong Chinese law between the works that they do with many of our competitors who are also advertisers on KAYAK and we haven\u2019t that anything to change those dynamics but I would say at this point, relative to the market share that we have and particularly in United States where KAYAK is strongest, our brands are reasonably represented but I always believe we can do more but I think about that more in an arms length way of how can booking and go to and Agoda and Priceline work even closer with KAYAK, to get a more meaningful share of their business, but our share on KAYAK I would say as represented as we are on say trip advisor, or other platforms that aren\u2019t owned by the Group. Dean J. Prissman \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities, LLC:  Great and just final question being, I was wondering if you could quantify the impact that the Agoda headwinds you called out had on your room night growth in the quarter? Darren Huston :  No, we wouldn\u2019t separately that out it. It's hard to quantify an impact too, Dean. We can see when a market is impacted the growth rate suffers but we don't know to what extent those people are instead going and staying in Malaysia or Indonesia so we don't put out a quantification on that. Daniel J. Finnegan:  One thing I would just highlight is that Agoda, in Asia generally what we saw because of the issues in Thailand but also issues in Vietnam et cetera and also the Malaysian air tragedy the original one that Chinese bookers are among the biggest bookers in the region and many of them decided to travel into North Asia so we both saw great business in North Asia, but a lot less in Southeast Asia, so generally that would balance out but Agoda has other issue they very strong with bookers in Southeast Asia and it was some nervousness among bookers in Southeast Asia, given everything going on there but as I mentioned as well, we do hope that is abating and we do see some positive signs so that particular situation impact us as much going forward. Dean J. Prissman \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities, LLC:  Thanks guys. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom White of Macquarie. Your line is now opened. Thomas Cauthorn White \u2013 Macquarie Capital Inc.:  Great thanks for taking my question. Just on the issue of direct versus paid traffic, seems like you guys are benefiting from your recent branding campaigns. But, I guess my question I guess is on the Meta search channel. A lot of those are also investing considerably in consumer marketing. Can you maybe comment a bit on whether that channel, the Meta search players, is kind of increasing as a percentage of your mix, or is your direct traffic gains coming primarily from traditional paid search or affiliate channels, other channels? And then just quickly on the hotel marketing services opportunity, the acquisition of boutique seems interesting, maybe just a bit more color on the strategy there, and potential synergies? Thanks. Darren Huston : Yes. Thanks, Tom. We generally speaking among our paid sources of demand, Meta has been quite strong although I would say a little less so in the last few months in terms of its percentage. Probably the biggest weakness in terms of growth has been Google and PPC overall and I think that reflects as much Google shift from desktop to mobile. We do think in all these channels by the way, we are increasing our share of these channels, but I should also flag that Meta search is not that critical to our business. It's an important channel but PPC and even our affiliate business would holdup to our overall Meta search business. So, that\u2019s a little bit of color there. And when you compare direct to overall paid, our direct business is growing faster than our paid business, and then when it comes to hotel Marketing services, we don't want to reveal too many cards here, but right now, before we acquired Boutique and Hotel Ninjas, we already had a number products, we were selling B2B basically to Hotels. We do a lot of white label sites for the chains and other languages, we also have a product both Agoda us called the Booking button that allows hotel websites to add booking functionality at no cost to their websites. All of these are things we're doing to increase our value to hotels, but now we're looking at cloud-based solutions to really help hotels improve their own direct marketing over time and there will be more to report on that in the coming months and quarters. Thomas Cauthorn White \u2013 Macquarie Capital Inc.:  Great. Thank you. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Sandler of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now opened. Ross Sandler \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG :  Thanks, guys. So I had a question on the kind of offline marketing versus online marketing. So you're now about two years into the offline campaign, and can you broadly talk about how you're measuring success of the program, and at some point, do you expect to see your online marketing start to show leverage, when combined with this pace of offline marketing, as we've seen with some other companies? Doesn't look like its showing up yet in the financials, but maybe on a country-by-country basis are you seeing that? And then second question is for the customers that you're bringing in direct from these new mobile channels can you just talk about how the LTV or the purchase frequency compares to customers that have come in historically under the PC channel as you measured it? Thanks. Darren Huston : Okay, Ross. First of all on the offline versus online, there's a set of macro measures that are important and then there's a set of micro measures. Let me start with the micro measures there are about how you spend and the media you use and the ROI you get from running an ad on this channel versus that channel. That's all a very sophisticated set of measure that helps you improve the ROI you get from offline in short and medium term. The macro measure of course if you add online plus offline in any market you want to be able to return \u2013 increase your return on overall advertising in that market and often that takes some time. It can be six months, nine months, 12-months, 24-months but that's ultimately the goal and if we don't achieve that if ultimately we can't get a market from a level of return before we did offline to a higher return after we did offline, then that wasn't a good investment to make. We're still early on even though it feels like we've been doing this for a long time. Many of our Markets even Australia which is our second market hasn't even lapped a year, but we feel relatively confident that over time we can improve our return on advertising in every market using a positive mix of marketing tools including offline and online marketing, but again, this is early learning and we're quite positive but more to come. As it relates to mobile you always have to go into the different aspects of mobile. Lots has been written about last minute booking, obviously if you look on a per transaction basis and this is now mostly mobile phones, a last-minute booking is usually for one night and on average our bookings are two nights or more so that immediately makes it a less valuable booking, but what you don't know is that if that's banned, for instance booking he may be a customer that his next booking may be a five night booking and you\u2019ve got to be careful that you don't under attribute the value of maybe finding Dan on his cell phone in the next time finding Dan on a PC. The other thing I would say about mobile is, that\u2019s a very specific thing, around last minute booking, but we\u2019ve also seen a trend where people are doing more and more early booking. And, lot of that is happening on tablets as they are earlier in their research process and we find that tablet-based booking is as if not at times more valuable even than the PC bookings. So you shouldn't just paint all of this stuff with a single brush and we have to look into the economics of each channel and then obviously what you're willing to pay is really attribution of the customer when you go out and try to find at the map. I hope that helpful. Ross Sandler \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG : Yeah very helpful thanks guys. Operator : Thank you Our next question comes from Heath Terry from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now opened. Heath P. Terry \u2013 Goldman Sachs :  Great thank. I was wondering if you could give us a sense from maybe more macro perspective, as we look at the occupancy rates at record highs, and the increases that we've seen in ADRs, do you have a sense of whether or not that's been a positive or negative headwind to your business and to the extent that we think about how this is going to have an impact over the next year whether or not we're seeing sort of crowding out of the leisure market as occupancy rates hit that level and you start to see the less price sensitive business market continue to take share versus leisure? Darren Huston :  Okay. Thanks Heath I will add something to that one. So first of all the important thing is not to paint too much of a brush on things geographically because the U.S. market is very different than any other markets. You've got extremes like if you look at four star and five star hotels in China they are still running a very low occupancy because that\u2019s a market that's over-built, and then you have different destinations. Some are very business oriented, some are very leisure oriented like in Orlando and some are kind of a mix if you look at a city like New York. Also leisure customers also tend to be a valuable customers to hotels it depends on where their business customers are coming from business customers will sometime pay higher ADR but in some hotels the leisure customer may be worth more depending on how the business customer was acquired. In our business generally, our business works well positively with the cycle meaning if ADRs go up then our commissions are higher, but we also have a counter cyclical chit is in low demand periods and we obviously get better availability and that helps our opaque business and other high discount our products build supply. So we are able to be a little bit we can write the cycles quite well because of these countering effects and I don\u2019t believe that we\u2019re seeing environment almost in any market where we are feeling crowded out of demand. Certainly right now as we speak this is high season in Europe literally this week and we still have availability in most markets in Europe. And then we're going to go obviously into the fall and then we are going to have a lot more opportunities to sell lot more product. Heath P. Terry \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Great thank you. Operator : Thank you Our next question comes from Naved Khan from Cantor Fitzgerald Your line is now opened. Naved Khan \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald : Yes thank for taking the question. Darren, just going back to your comments about KAYAK, and seeing a topline acceleration in that business, were you sort of referring to the business on a gross business, or just on a net business? And then regarding the expansion in Europe for KAYAK, do you plan to focus more on the hotel side or on the air side, and can you just sort of clarify that for us? Darren Huston : Yes, I would say that the comments with KAYAK on gross or net are both for same and then regarding their expansion I think that the team is still working that out in Europe they have been in the advertising if you see it has been in more in air message that's then taken into hotel, but they are experimenting with various types of coffee to see which works best. Naved Khan \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald : Okay Great. Darren Huston :  Thank you. Operator : Thank you Our next question comes from Brian Fitzgerald of Jefferies. You line is now open. Brian Fitzgerald \u2013 Jefferies & Co.: Thanks. Maybe two quick follow-ups on OpenTable. You mentioned rolling out Pay with OpenTable in San Francisco and New York, and 20 other cities by year-end. Any additional color on other facets of the integration timeline, or focuses there, and when you expect to see kind of the real meaty plan to leverage your benefit from the acquisition? So that's one follow-up. And then the second one, to Doug's question on advertising ROIs, last quarter you mentioned a conscientious decision to invest in variable channels. Are the ROIs you see there inherently higher than in other channels, and that's why you decided to focus there, or do you believe you can extract better results from these channels, than the market of your competitors? Thanks. Darren Huston :  Okay Brian. I'd say first in OpenTable, yes, we certainly haven't been, we did a lot of planning and we're now in the execution phase of those plans. As we highlighted during the acquisition it's really three areas we're focused on. One is international expansion so we're in the middle of those plans really exciting and that's an issue of product getting all the language translations, an issue of which cities, how fast but I expect that we'll be through the Fall get ourselves aligned, and begin executing fairly forthrightly. The second area is co-marketing and that's something that's in the plans right now and co-marketing is if you're a booking.com guest from London staying in New York, co-promoting the OpenTable App and the restaurants around your hotel, for instance, and those are tests that we hope to put in play pretty quickly and then finally was the payments area and you have the update on that so I feel really good about where we are and there's lots of work to do. The teams are now moving between San Francisco and Amsterdam, in particular, doing a lot of learning and a lot of things that come into play. And I think by 2015, I hope, we'll be in full rollout of those plans. As it relates to ROIs and variable channels, there's a lot that goes into ROIs. Certainly it's a very competitive environment, and the costs of buying a booker have been going up. We try to counteract that by increasing investments on our website so they convert better, which we've been seeing some good success with but also building more direct business so that we rely less and less on the paid demand, which is allowing us, basically creating currency to more aggressively go out and find those customers through paid channels.  Not much else to it other than that. Obviously, we try to balance ROIs against the various sources of demand, and we both evaluate the ROI of the demand, and then also the importance from a strategic nature of the demand and it's something that we're buying where we get full access to the customer, and can cross market to them, et cetera, or is it a source that doesn't allow us near as much freedom to build a long term relationship with that customer. And that's how we set our ROI targets, and we're quite disciplined as a Company around that. And basically making sure that we don't really look at lifetime value, although we value that, we're looking at how we earn money on every single conversion that we buy. Brian Fitzgerald \u2013 Jefferies & Co.: Great, thanks, Darren. Darren Huston : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ronald Josey of JMP Securities. Your line is now opened. Ronald V. Josey \u2013 JPMorgan Securities, LLC:  Great. Thanks for taking the question. So more a high level question, Darren. We're now in a few years of the expansion of Booking.com here in the US, and I'm just wondering what the impact has been from other international markets, as more hotels come here, or are available here domestically? And specifically the demand from call it Europe and South America coming here, and then vice versa. And then also just a real quick follow-up on the marketing line. I think you said TV in Germany, I understand you are marketing more in TV here, but why Germany now? Thank you. Darren Huston : Thanks, Ron. Let me first address the US, we announced on a previous Conference Call the U.S. is now Booking.com's largest destination market and certainly, we've had historic business that comes in from Europe, and that generally lands in a few obvious destinations, New York, Washington DC, a lot of East Coast destinations, Orlando. but recently we've seen a significant impact from guests from Latin America. I was recently in Miami talking to some hotels and we think we're the Brazilian OTA, which of course we are. But that's how they think about us because it's the guest that shows up from booking.com and then out on the West Coast a significant increase with Asian guests and Pacific guests from Oceananna in the San Francisco and Las Vegas, et cetera. So I feel a lot better about the international demand in the United States but even more importantly what I get excited about is we're getting more U.S. guests staying in the U.S.. It's probably one of our fastest growing Markets is American domestic travelers discovering the tremendous flexibility of pay when you stay, instead of paying ahead and really logging the diversity of properties that we have on our site and that really the thing creating a tipping point in the U.S. market for us and we're now at a level of accommodation and property options that I feel very proud of, and the U.S. is right up there with some of our more mature European markets in terms of what we can offer our customers, but much more to do Germany. And then Germany, the decision really was we came into the U.K. which isn\u2019t fairly call it in quotes mature market for us, but we saw some really positive results there because even despite how successful we've been in U.K. are aided awareness was not near we wanted it to be what we've seen some acceleration in the U.K. as bookers and we decided to go into Germany. Germany has been a market for us in Europe that we do well in but we under index relative to what we do in the rest of Western Europe primarily because we have some domestic competition and a lot of German surprisingly just travel to Germany, but the campaign so far has done a nice job and it's very early days of introducing the Germans that you can use Booking.com as you love to travel Italy or Spain or its France but its also great tool to travel within Germany as well. So that was really it was the next largest obvious market for us in Europe given where aided awareness and our penetration is related to others. Ronald V. Josey \u2013 JMP Securities LLC :  Thank you. Operator : Thank you our next comes from Michael Millman of Millman Associates. Your line is now open. Michael S. Millman \u2013 Millman Research Associates :  Thank you. First, wanted to follow-up on an earlier question regarding the mobile, and particularly same-day mobile. I was wondering if there's a back end of cancellations that maybe going to others? I guess I feel that it's unusual all of these people continue to travel without reservations. And secondly, on U.S. car rental, also, to what extent are you seeing growth, if you're seeing growth in mobile, and to what extent are \u2013 you mentioned that opaque is less available. To what extent therefore are you seeing more increased pricing, and to what extent are you seeing higher mileage cars, and how is that affecting the interest in people renting? Thank you. Darren Huston :  Thanks Michael I am going to take the first one with Dan and I take the second one. Daniel J. Finnegan: Yes, it's an interesting question, you ask about last minute booking on mobile. Knowing what I know there are some cities in Europe that it's dangerous to show up and not have a booking, and if you arrive at the airport because it can literally be close to all sold out in certain seasons, but it is a very spontaneous thing and the other thing about accommodations is unlike in a lot of other aspects of travel you can get a last minute booking for, potentially less than you would get a booking you made 7, 14, 21 day in advance. And it\u2019s a little bit of risky proposition but at the end of the day the hotel room needs to fill in room and also the reason people are using apps for this is, if you walk into a hotel room and say I need a room, they aren't necessarily going to give you the price that's published on the internet, because you're standing in a hotel room and you need a room. And a lot of people use apps and OTAs in particular to try to get a really good price at the last minute, but it is a little bit of a gamble and you got to be smart about how you do it but you can truly get a lot of great deals last minute and in this particular aspect of travel. Darren Huston : Hi Michael, as far as the questions on U.S. car rental, so car rental tracks similarly to the rest of our services in that mobile is growing much faster as more people are adopting \u2013 doing booking on mobile devices and research on mobile devices, so we're growing very fast and we\u2019re pleased with the offerings that we have particularly at Priceline. com for U.S. car rental. We did say opaque is less available so you are seeing that paired with increased pricing and just a very healthy travel environment. It also drives up pricing particularly on our opaque services, because we were unable to get the same level of discounts that we've got in the past and so we're unable to give the level of discount that we typically could and that drives up the pricing there. I don't have any information for you really in terms of higher mileage cars being used to a greater extent. Sorry, I can\u2019t help you with that one. Michael S. Millman \u2013 Millman Research Associates :  Okay. Thank you. Darren Huston : You\u2019re welcome. Operator :  Thank you. And our final question comes from Kevin Kopelman of Cowen and Company. Your line is now open. Kevin Kopelman \u2013 Cowen and Company :  Hi, thanks. Can you give us more color on your alternative accommodations initiative, especially how the Villas.com launch performed versus your expectations? Thanks. Darren Huston :  Thanks, Kevin. Yes, we gave a little bit in my comments, I had mentioned to you that in this what we call vacation rental space; we're already a very large player. As we went a couple years ago from being completely about hotels to non-hotels, it was a very natural migration for us to go into non-hotel categories like resorts and motels et cetera, to get into what we would call more self-catered products, like apart-hotels, vacation rentals, apartments, et cetera. So this has been a long-term journey. There's a lot to do, because there are a lot of challenges around, vacation rental bookings who's going to show up with the keys, whose changing the sheets, a lot of vacation rentals need deposits so there are some things in the market have been built up in a way where the renter expects to dance back and fourth with the guest on e-mail or by phone until they finally come to some kind of settlement. And our business is purely about booking and getting an instant confirmation and requiring vacation rental owners to keep a live calendar that's real and pricing that's real, and everything you would expect in a modern e-commerce business. So, there is many challenges we're now doing a real significant amount of business in this space and Villa's.com specifically is just one of many tactics we're taking to try to really prove out and test various options for being successful in the vacation rental space. And, so far we're really pleased with the results of that effort, but again it's part of a much broader set of actions that we're taking. Having vacation rentals on our site has proven to be a great synergy for people who are just looking for a place to stay. We even find that people with families may think they are going to Barcelona and they\u2019re going to stay in two or three hotel rooms and they end up in a home by the beach, at potentially a cheaper price if they are a large group. So for many people, it's even an upgrade. When you're on leisure travel it\u2019s just been really, really hard in the past to book and to feel secure about your booking and that's something that we're, as a company trying to change. Kevin Kopelman \u2013 Cowen and Company :  Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And at this time I would like to turn the call back to management for any closing comments. Darren Huston :  Now, we want to thank everyone for joining this call and we look forward to delivering a very strong Q3. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude today\u2019s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.",

And now I would like to introduce the Priceline Group's speakers for this afternoon, Darren Huston and Daniel Finnegan. Go ahead, gentlemen. Darren Huston : Okay, thank you very much. Welcome to The Priceline Group's third quarter conference call. Thank you for joining us before the markets open this morning in New York. I'm here in Amsterdam with Priceline Group CFO, Dan Finnegan. The Group reported consolidated gross bookings for the third quarter of approximately $13.8 billion, up 28% year-over-year or about 29% on a local currency basis. Non-GAAP net income was $1.2 billion; up 29% year-over-year and earnings per share was $22.16, up 28% versus prior year, surpassing FactSet consensus estimates of $21.08 per share and our guidance for the quarter. Our customers booked accommodation reservations for 95 million room nights in the quarter, up 27% year-over-year, versus 29% in Q2. This modest deceleration reflects the benefit of higher growth rates in new markets which continue to become an increasing share of our worldwide business. Growth rates also benefited from strong execution in building supply and availability during our peak booking season. Booking.com's platform now has over 540,000 hotels and other accommodations in 207 countries, up 52% over last year. Booking.com is establishing clear global leadership in the online accommodations market. We continue to see market share gains in every geography, with particular strength outside of Western Europe. The business is also growing in the non-hotels area as we continue to experiment and invest in adding these properties to our inventory and taking friction out of the booking process. Growth in our vacation rental bookings, including villas, chalets, apartments, apart-hotels and other self-catered product continues to exceed the growth of our hotel business and as a result comprises an increasing share of our business. Our marketing mix is also diversifying favorably. We believe the off-line branding investments of Booking.com have been a key component of our growing mix of direct business and we intend to continue to complement our substantial online advertising investment with effective off-line branding. We'll likely invest in off-line advertising in additional markets during 2015 provided we continue to observe acceptable ROIs on our total advertising spend. Priceline Group posted 10% growth in gross bookings versus 21% in Q2 reflecting the impact of tougher comps from increased advertising on Kayak last year and a difficult environment for opaque availability. Conversely, retail hotel and rental car growth helped to offset this challenge with solid performance. Total rental car days accelerated in the quarter, reflecting strong performance at both RentalCars.com and Priceline Group. Between Kayak, Priceline Group and Booking.com, we feel good about our growing position in the United States travel market and we plan to continue to profitably invest to improve our services and bring more customers to our sites. Asia Pacific also continues to be a bright spot for the Group and we believe we delivered market share gains through the efforts of Agoda.com and Booking.com. We saw strong growth in particular in North Asia, with some recovery from the political unrest in Southeast Asia. We're also well into the planning and execution of our latest commercial agreement and investment in Ctrip, China's largest OTA. We were excited to have OpenTable join our quarterly leadership team meetings in Amsterdam and the knowledge sharing between OpenTable and the balance of the group is underway. Pay with OpenTable, our mobile payments app, is off to a strong start with great adoption rates and feedback from diners and restaurants alike. International expansion will be a longer term rollout and the team is hard at work laying the groundwork for success. We've also completed our plans for co-marketing between our brands and experimentation and execution on those plans has now begun in earnest. The Group performed well in the third quarter with market leading growth on both the top and bottom-lines and sustained leadership and profitability as well. I believe our teams are executing very well in an intensely competitive marketplace and against a mixed global economic and political backdrop. We continue to build our brands for smart investments in mobile, marketing, people, best-in-class customer service and product and service innovation. This includes new opportunities also like dining, mobile payments and hotel marketing services. We also continued to invest in building trusting win-win relationships with our partners across accommodations, flights, rental cars and restaurants. I want to thank our employees around the world for their hard work and dedication in delivering terrific performance during our peak summer seasons. We also continued to be very optimistic about the many opportunities that are still ahead of us. I'll now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review. Dan? Dan Finnegan : Thanks, Darren. I'll discuss some of the highlights in operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the fourth quarter of 2014. Growth rates mentioned in my remarks are in relation to the prior year comparable period, unless otherwise indicated. OpenTable is included in our income statement from the acquisition close date of July 24 through the end of the quarter. OpenTable revenue included in Q3 results amounted to $41.2 million and is included in advertising and other revenues in our consolidated statements of operations. There was no cost of revenues for OpenTable in our reporting format so gross profit equals revenue. We will report OpenTable's revenue for the first year to help investors understand the impact of the acquisition on our top line growth. Q3 was a strong quarter from a top and bottom-line perspective. Room nights booked grew by 27% from the third quarter decelerating modestly compared to the 29% growth rate for Q2. Average daily rates or ADRs for Q3 2014 were up on a local currency basis by about 3% for the consolidated group. The FX rate for the Euro to the U.S. dollar for the third quarter was about the same as the prior year; however, the Euro weakened as compared to the $1.34 exchange rate that prevailed at the time we gave Q3 guidance. The impact on the bottom-line was mitigated by our hedging program, but currency exchange rates had a slightly negative impact compared to our guidance for gross bookings, gross profit and operating profit. Q3 gross bookings grew by 28% compared to prior year. Our Q3 international gross bookings grew by 32%, both in U.S. dollars and on a local currency basis. Gross bookings for our Priceline Group brand business in the U.S. grew by 10%, driven by good performance for retail travel services which benefited from increased retail advertising placements on Kayak. We lapped the start of these ad placements in Q3 which caused gross bookings growth to decelerate for Priceline in Q3 and will result in further deceleration in Q4. Hotel express deals performed well, but our Name Your Own Price hotel, air and car services were all down year-over-year due to limited availability of discounted rates and share shift to express deals. I highlight that Name Your Own Price impacts merchant gross bookings and disproportionately impacts merchant revenues, since we record Name Your Own Price revenues on a gross basis, while our other revenues are recorded on a net basis. Gross profit for the quarter was $2.6 billion and grew 32% as compared to prior year. Our international operations generated gross profit of $2.34 billion which constituted an increase of 33%, both in U.S. dollars and on a local currency basis, as compared to the prior year. Gross profit for our U.S. operations, including OpenTable which is largely a U.S. business amounted to $275 million which represented 24% growth versus prior year. Non-GAAP operating income amounted to 54% of gross profit for Q3 which is 191 BPs lower than last year. Operating margins were impacted by investments we made in off-line advertising and other OpEx, to build our brands and support growth initiatives in restaurant reservations and hotel marketing services. Operating margins came in better than our guidance due mainly to less than forecasted year-over-year decline in online advertising ROIs. Adjusted EBITDA for Q3 amounted to $1.43 billion which exceeded the top end of our guidance range of $1.37 billion and represents 28% growth versus prior year. Non-GAAP net income grew by 29% and non-GAAP EPS grew by 28%. In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $1.3 billion of cash from operations during third quarter 2014 which is about 33% above last year. We spent $29 million on CapEx and repurchased $148 million of our common stock in Q3. We spent about $2.5 billion of U.S. cash in Q3 to complete the OpenTable acquisition and we used non-U.S. cash to invest $500 million in the Ctrip convertible bond and $151 million in Ctrip stock. We raised about $2.3 billion of additional capital in the U.S. during the quarter at what we believe to be attractive terms, by completing a $1 billion convertible debt offering and raising about $1.3 billion through a Euro denominated bond offering. Our cash and investments amounted to $8.2 billion at quarter end, with about $1.6 billion of that balance in the U.S. Now for Q4 guidance, OpenTable is included in our forecasted results for the entire quarter. It is still a relatively short period of time since the deal closed, but our current intention is to increase investment in OpenTable from an advertising and OpEx perspective in Q4 and coming quarters to position the business for future growth. For Q4 guidance, we're forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 8% to 15% in U.S. dollars and by 13% to 20% on a local currency basis, with U.S. bookings growing by about 0% to 5% which reflects lapping certain retail air add placements on Kayak during Q3. We expect international gross bookings to grow by 10% to 17% in U.S. dollars and by 16% to 23% on a local currency basis. Obviously, the deterioration in the Euro exchange rate over the last couple of months is indicative of weakening economic conditions in our most important market which is of concern as we look at the business going forward. Our Q4 forecast assumes that local currency ADRs with the consolidated Group will be up about 1% compared to the prior year period. Our Q4 forecast assumes that foreign exchange rates remain at the same $1.25 per Euro and $1.60 per British pound, as Monday's closing rates which would result in average exchange rates that would be weaker by about 8% for the Euro and about 1% for the British pound, as compared to the prior year. I highlight that the Euro exchange rate assumed in our forecast is about 7% weaker than the $1.34 exchange rate that prevailed at the time we reported Q2 and most analysts last updated their forecasts. We\u2019ve hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our fourth quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any fluctuation in the Euro or the pound versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter but these hedges do not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue, gross profit or operating income and do not hedge our earnings beyond the fourth quarter. We expect Q4 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 11% to 18% and gross profits to grow by approximately 17% to 24%. We expect the declines in our Name Your Own Price service will continue to negatively impact revenue growth rates in Q4. We expect that 350 BPs of deleverage in non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of gross profit compared to prior year as we invest in advertising and other expenses to support our brands and new initiatives. Our Q4 online advertising forecast reflects our actual results to-date and assumes further pressure on ad efficiency throughout the remainder of the quarter based upon the trends we\u2019ve experienced over the last couple of years. We estimate that we will spend about $50 million to $55 million for off-line advertising in Q4. These investments in advertising and other OpEx can have a more pronounced impact on profitability in Q4 and Q1 which are quarters where we typically earn a lower percentage of our annual profit due to the normal seasonality for our business. As a reminder, Q4 2013 personnel expense included a $12 million charge related to a payroll tax levy in the Netherlands. We do not expect to incur a similar charge this year. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $625 million and $665 million which at the midpoint represents 12% growth versus prior year. Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately 15%, comprised of international income taxes, an alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S. Our non-GAAP EPS forecast also reflects the cash interest expense related to the two bond offerings we completed in Q3 that I mentioned a moment ago. We're targeting non-GAAP fully-diluted EPS of approximately $9.40 to $10.10 per share which at the midpoint represents 10% growth year-over-year. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 53.2 million shares, based upon Monday's closing stock price. We forecast GAAP EPS between $7.55 and $8.25 per share for Q4. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP operating results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed in our earnings release. In summary, we believe that our forecast represents strong top line and bottom-line growth and exceptional profit margins. Our Q4 forecast implies full year EBITDA growth of 26% to 28%, with an operating profit margin in the mid-40% range. We would be pleased with this outcome under any circumstances, but particularly in a year where we made substantial investments to support our brands, including increasing off-line brand advertising support by over $100 million. Our guidance reflects the actual deceleration in growth experience to date and our assumption that we will experience further deceleration over the remainder of the quarter as we compare against the period where our room night growth accelerated last year. Although we're increasingly concerned about economic conditions in general and in our key European market in particular, our forecast does not assume any further deterioration in macroeconomic conditions. We will now take your questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Heath Terry \u2013 Goldman Sachs : You commented on seeing higher online ROI in the quarter and then obviously guiding towards seeing pretty significant weakness, particularly in the U.S. in the fourth quarter. Wondering if you can tell us what's changed from Q3 to Q4? Is it a specific channel? Is it mix from independent to more chains on the hotel side? What would you say describes the difference? And to the extent you see quarters like Q3 where ROI and online spend is higher, how quickly can you adjust your spend to take advantage of that and were you able to do that in the quarter? Dan Finnegan : So for Q3, we actually didn't have an increase in ROIs year-over-year. They just weren't down to the extent that we forecasted when we gave guidance and we don't really adjust based upon the ROIs coming in better. We follow a consistent and disciplined approach that targets what we consider to be a reasonable ROI, based upon positions in the variable channels at that point in time. As far as the U.S. growth rate goes that's more a function of lapping ad placements that Priceline Group has done on Kayak over the past year, particularly powering the retail air booking path on Kayak so that drives a significant amount of gross bookings dollars, not a significant amount of gross profit. So the impact from the bottom-line perspective is not as dramatic. Operator : Our next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Justin Post \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Just a couple questions on Q4 guidance, you mentioned ADRs going from plus 3 to plus 1 in local currency. I'm just wondering if you\u2019re seeing a real slowdown in travel so far this quarter and are you seeing some cancellation in room nights? And then has the competitive environment picked up as Q4 has started? Thank you. Dan Finnegan : So as far as the ADRs go Justin, it reflects our particular business mix. We\u2019ve seen some market-to-market impacts that could be more macroeconomic or currency driven, for instance European travelers going to the U.S. with the significant slide in the Euro versus the dollar, having a tendency to trade down in terms of what they're willing to spend in dollars for a hotel room to try and keep the cost of the trip consistent from a Euro perspective. In terms of the European economic condition in particular we're concerned about what we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of months. I think the results we posted for Q3 are very strong from a top line and bottom-line perspective, for Q4, we\u2019ve seen some deceleration and then our forecast reflects an expectation we'll see further deceleration as we go forward. If you remember last year, we accelerated during the back half of Q4 so whenever we\u2019ve a difficult comp like that we're a little bit more cautious with our approach to forecasting. Darren Huston : Maybe Justin, I'll just add, this is Darren, that competitively I don't feel that the issue we track market share of all of our accommodation partners around the world and we believe we're increasing market share everywhere. So there's a little bit of a geographic mix and as Dan points out exchange rate challenges obviously for us are translation issues in the U.S. dollars, but they do actually have real impacts as well, people rethink their travel. We are very internationally travel-oriented Company, we're more weighted into people coming from one country to the other and if not just the Euro, it's the ruble, the Australian dollar, there are other nationalities who like to travel internationally, who may change their plans or still execute their plans and they will actually trade down to maybe a three star versus a four star accommodation to reflect a fixed family budget. Justin Post \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Maybe one follow-up, in 2012, I think you saw a slowdown and then in 2013 you re-pivoted, did more off-line advertising, bought Kayak. As you look forward to next year, are there some levers and different adjustments you can make maybe to try to reaccelerate growth? Thanks. Darren Huston : I'm actually very optimistic. Obviously what we constantly face is just the sheer size of our business relative to others and we always have a strong focus on profitability. So there are things we could do but if we don't feel good about it from an ROI standpoint that generally as a group those aren't things we will do. But we have many plans. We are really bullish on of course OpenTable and its opportunity to add to us longer term. Hotel marketing services as you know, is an area we are investing in and seeing some real positive signals from our hotel partners of people interested in that kind of product which is a great new vehicle. We're also doing a lot on the mobile front and other plans that I'm not prepared to announce on this call for competitive reasons. But I feel good about the pipeline of innovation that we have and it's still a very big market. I mean, we are the largest player now in online travel, but we're still small proportionate to the market opportunity and it's always good to remind ourselves as well that travel is growing twice the rate of GDP. Online travel within travel is growing. The share is shifting to large players in the OTA space. There is a lot of things that are working in our direction and we would hope over time to continue to take advantage of those. One other thing I will flag is our property count because some people have brought this up. You see that it's been a little slower in the last month or so, but that's really a seasonality effect. We have a significant amount of stock that comes online in the Spring and then goes offline in the Fall. So we don't count that on our total until it comes back online, but we don't see any barrier there as well. We\u2019ve a very strong pipeline of new properties ready to be completed and signed on and verified and I still think the opportunity to add properties is still very significant for our business going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Doug Anmuth \u2013 JPMorgan: I was hoping you could just talk more about Booking.com into the U.S. and perhaps also just help us parse out the growth rates a little bit across the international business by geography. And just to clarify on Q4, going from 32% ex-FX bookings growth in the third quarter down to 16% to 23% and you're saying you don't think it's competition so we can interpret it as macro and perhaps law of large numbers. But is there anything else we should be thinking about there? Thanks. Dan Finnegan : I'll take that second part. I would say you hit it pretty well there, Doug. I think, we look at it as the law of large numbers, so generally we expect the business to decelerate given the size of it. There are some macro concerns, particularly in Europe and then in addition we just have a very difficult comp because growth accelerated last year, so because it's our normal expectation that we're going to decelerate when we have a period of particular strength like that, it gives us more caution when we forecast against it. Darren Huston : Just adding on the United States in particular, it is one real highlight in the global travel market. It's a real positive and it has been a real positive for us. Our retail business is very strong and in particular Booking.com. We believe, is of all of the bigger players, is the fastest growing player in the U.S. accommodations market and we continue to expand our properties. We have got great repeat rates, a lot of growing business in direct customers so we're very bullish that we can get significant growth out of the U.S. market looking forward. But it's a very competitive market and we certainly stand ready to compete for that business and feel good about the progress our team has made. There is much more to do it's one of the number of very large markets where I think our product deserves more market share and we plan to go out and make that happen. Operator : Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Ross Sandler \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Just two quick questions, I think a follow-up from what Doug just asked but if you look at the growth rate for core Booking.com implied by the 700,000 room nights per day, you decelerated fairly meaningfully from Q2 to Q3 and I know Easter had an impact on the Q2 growth rate but where do you think we are in terms of Booking.com's share gain story globally in most of these Markets? Is it still happening or are you basically the market and in particular, where does that stand in the U.S. and then Darren, you just mentioned new mobile products or some new initiatives. Can you just elaborate a little bit on what you're implying from that comment a few minutes ago? Thanks. Dan Finnegan : Doug I'll take the first piece. So I'm not sure what you're referring to there in terms of local currency growth rate for our international business we went from 34.5% to 31.8% from Q2 to Q3, so what I would classify as modest deceleration, I believe that Booking.com is growing its share across the board in all of the markets in which we're operating so growing still at a very good rate within Europe and as we've said several other times on prior calls, Europe is still such a big part of the business that the overall growth rate pretty closely tracks the trends that you're seeing with the European business and then our other newer markets, North America, Asia Pacific and South America growing at a faster rate than the U.S.. Darren Huston : And let me take on I think you were asking, Ross about mobile specifically. Yes it's an area that doesn't cease to amaze me in terms of the potential automotive if anything particularly bookings through mobile phones had been extremely strong. Tablets are becoming a little more like PCs I think for everyone and it's just the curiosity with all of the new Fablet type form factors coming out and also the growth in ultra-light PCs etcetera, where the tablet ultimately will fit in but certainly we're seeing more and more of the business coming through mobile and I think that really does play to a strength. If you look at the ratings of our products on Google or on the iTunes store we have some of the most highly rated products and we've spent a lot of time as a team working on the plumbing to make sure that they are all cloud connected, that the consumer has a great experience walking in with an electronic version of their bookings etcetera, etcetera, and a lot of the new innovation which we aren't announcing in this call really relates to how do we enhance the experience for the consumer. So now that the plumbing is working really well and we're getting great feedback, how do we take our mobile game to the next level so that it connects end to end from looking, booking to staying for the user, and I'm very excited and optimistic about the opportunities that will bring for us. These things are not easy to do. They make executing an online business more complicated but they really play to our scale and our ability to invest across a very large base of properties and we can then bring pretty amazing value to our consumers and their sort of multi-screen lifestyle, so hopefully that helps. The other thing I think Dan just totally touched on, but we feel also very good that our productivity per hotel continues to increase so if you take a hotel that was on our website four years ago three will see more bookings per day from booking today than they did a year ago than they did the year before that and the year before that, so our core hotel partners are getting more production from us but still there's so much more to do and we still represent a small share of the total accommodation space. So I don't frankly see any limits to that at this time. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC. Your line is open. Mark Mahaney \u2013 RBC: If I could try to get off three questions, you talked about Ctrip somehow being still in the planning stages. Could you talk about when or the extent that that's already operational, what's the path to that being fully operational and material perhaps. Second, in terms of competition could you just talk qualitatively; it's always been a competitive marketplace. Is there something that's changed in terms of where the competition is coming from? Are you seeing it more from direct travel wholesalers or hotels or airlines directly as opposed to other online travel agencies? Is the direction of the competition changed and then finally on alternative accommodations you talked about it becoming more material? Is that having an impact on the rest of the business? Like do you view those alternative combinations as purely incremental, somewhat cannibalistic, could you describe what impact that has on the rest of the business? Thanks a lot. Darren Huston : So maybe I'll take you to those quickly one by one. On the Ctrip deal, as you know we've been in a commercial relationship with them for some time. Part of the new commercial relationship was a deeper integration for Ctrip being able to then book Booking.com and Agoda Hotels and a lot of that integration has happen and we're seeing very strong results from it. Obviously those accrue to both us and to Ctrip because it's now on a branded basis and more and more Chinese are traveling outbound. The other side of the agreement was for us to put Ctrip our product on the Booking.com website in particular. There is a lot of work going on to get the technical terms APIs worked out so that we have the right connection points because they want those bookings to be able to have them for the consumer very seamlessly but we hope to be in test with their product on our website say by the middle of this quarter, so the end of this month and then we'll see where we go from there. We're going to take a slow rollout approach just to make sure the consumer experience is absolutely perfect as it relates to that particular integration but I don't see any barriers to making that happen. In terms of competition there's obviously a lot of noise in the marketplace, it's an extremely competitive marketplace. I don't see anything really that material has happened. If anything, our dependence particularly on Google has lessened which is some of the challenge Google has in growing their clicks relative to the rest of the internet. More of our business is coming direct which is very healthy. I think that's partly related to offline, but also partly we offer our guests a great direct experience and a lot much higher percentage of them are using accounts now versus finding us through indirect channels and in terms of us versus hotels or hotel chains I don't see any material change there. I think there's always going to be business that goes direct to hotels and into hotel chains. We frankly embrace that fact but there is also a lot of travelers who travel less frequently and are really looking for a bed in a particular city versus a particular property and I think that continues to play to our strength. And then your last question was on non-hotels. No, I don't see this at all cannibalistic, if anything \u2013 if you look at the Millennial Travelers, the younger travelers, they prefer to stay in non-hotels. They prefer to stay in secondary cities. Certainly with the rise of players like Airbnb, etcetera it's getting \u2013 it's making people more courageous to try new things and if anything the non-hotels are really significantly increase the variety of product on our site and it's made the world of accommodations more transparent and more exciting frankly for people. Non-hotels also help us a lot when cities get sold out which it does happen, convention times, things like that, so they provide nice shoulder availability for people and for particularly for leisure travelers and families. Sometimes the non-hotel can feel like an upgrade because they have got a lot of people, they all want to stay in the same house. They don't mind traveling into the city to see the museum but one has more of a self-catered versus catered experience. So I really don't see any negative in it. Hotels still do very well. Occupancy rates in many parts of the world are quite high. I don't see there being any sign at least at this time that the phenomenon of more non-hotels entering the legitimate space is having any big effect on hotels or kind of the more traditional product. Operator : Our next question comes from Naved Khan with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open. Naved Khan \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald : Can you touch up on the opportunity for TV spending in some of the newer markets, can you elaborate on that a little bit. Where are you seeing those kind of opportunities? Darren Huston : Yes, so we don't \u2013 as you know, we advertise the three brands; Priceline Group is still primarily U.S. but we do do ads in Canada now. With Kayak it\u2019s been a North American story although we have increased our offline marketing in Europe and still working the model but feeling some success there and then for Booking.com, it's really not been that long but we're now in the U.S., Australia, Canada, the UK and then recently launched in Germany and as time goes on and if anything we\u2019re feeling better about that investment that it fits well in our mix, it gives us a really nice drive towards our direct business. It also helps diversify our sources of demand really nicely that allows us to the more we diversify the source of demand and better understand sources, we can act a little more strategically vis-a-vis our source of demand. We don't have to lean into everything at all times because some of our sources of demand can have strategic conflict and this has been a real breakthrough for us to know that we can be out on our own and to build our brand and to build customer relationships for the long term rather than having to consistently be in the market buying them on a transactional basis. So that's the story and then in terms of future plans, unfortunately, nothing to reveal at this time, although I know you're hoping for that but we're looking at a number of options going into 2015 and we wanted to make sure we signaled at this time that they are quite likely will involve more markets. Naved Khan \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald : And then just a quick follow-up if I may. Turning back to your guidance especially for international bookings growth, what kind of impact are you baking in from Ebola or the threat of Ebola and what have you seen so far in your numbers? Darren Huston : I would say, again it's a very mixed environment and before I get into the negatives, it's always worth highlighting, you know the summer was actually quite stable in Europe and a lot of particularly Brits and Germans didn't go to Southern Europe. There were other pockets like France, Benelux and of course Russians weren't traveling a lot. So it was kind of mixed picture but relatively stable and also it's important to highlight that the U.S. has been very strong, as has North Asia and we also did great business during the World Cup out of Brazil, but I think what's happening now the primary is not Ebola. It's more \u2013 the travel business is very headline driven and headlines create perceptions that can lead to reality and of course people already know in a lot of our core markets that their currencies have devalued. There is a discouragement for maybe international travel, so maybe they will stay more domestically which will often lead to maybe a lower ADR, even a lower length of stay and we do see that a little bit and are more concerned that those perceptions can become more significant negative reality even though today we haven't seen any major drop off. It's just been more a concern that there are concerns building particularly outside the United States. Ebola is out there. We've had issues in the past like SARS that have been much more impactful. I want to be clear we are not seeing that kind of impact in our numbers, but I would have it on the list of negative things. It's big enough to be on the list but probably at the bottom of the list relative to other effects that we've already highlighted on this call. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin Kopelman with Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Kevin Kopelman \u2013 Cowen & Company: Could you just give us an update on Kayak, how that's performing, as a standalone business and how international expansion is going? Thanks. Darren Huston : Well maybe I can answer this, Dan maybe you can chime if you want to add. I would say that Kayak since the day we acquired it has exceeded our expectations from a profit standpoint. And I'm really proud of the work that Steve and his teams have done. I would say we are not as aggressively investing. We certainly don't want to invest at a loss to build the Kayak business, so we have done a lot of experimentation and we feel pretty good about the results in particular in Europe. We've also expanded Kayak very methodically into other languages and we continue to want to see the brand grow and be more successful but in the very sustained fashion. The other area that I'm really proud of at Kayak is the product continues to improve. We get great accolades from the customers who use Kayak and the investments that we're making there seem to be at least from the data seem to be paying off very well and we're still very optimistic that there is more that we can do at the Kayak investment over time but to-date, I would say overall quite pleased and beyond our expectations but look to see the effect of the various experiments that are going on and our ability to profitably roll this business out to more parts of the world. Kevin Kopelman \u2013 Cowen & Company: And if I could just ask a follow-up on FX impact, you talked about having hedging contracts in place to cover you for one quarter. Are those included in the Q4 EPS guidance? Thanks. Dan Finnegan : They are, Kevin, so we take the contracts out right around the point where we're reporting and so we're essentially hedged against any movements from FX here forward for Euro and pound. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Sena from Evercore Partners. Your line is open. Ken Sena \u2013 Evercore Partners : I was just wondering if you could update us maybe on the enterprise efforts in terms of boutique and hotel and just what's the reception that you're seeing from suppliers at this point in terms of the new products and also their willingness to allow a demand channel to manage that for them? Thank you. Darren Huston : Overall, what we have done with those acquisitions is they become the cornerstone of what we call Hotel Marketing Services. We continue to market boutique as a website quite successfully but we have really been spending let's call it a dark period, really architecting the products and rethinking them to put together on what I would call a Hotel Marketing Software Stack and it's something we haven't yet launched. But we\u2019ve been doing a bunch of testing, we\u2019ve been doing many focus groups talking to our property partners and I would generally say the reception has been very positive. The large majority of our partners or I would call in a lien-in mode, they like Booking.com in particular as a very cost efficient way to build demand and they are very receptive to us helping them with their direct websites and helping them build demand. So to-date I'm very positive, experiments are going really well and I'm excited that we're getting into it and the teams integration has been seamless and we hope to have further things to announce in 2015. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies. Your line is open. Brian if your line is on mute can you please unmute it? Brian Fitzgerald \u2013 Jefferies: I wanted to drill down a little bit on OpenTable. Is the integration so far happening as expected? Is the cadence as you expected? Any unique insights as you go through that process and then I might have missed it. Could you comment on the ability to cross sell that you're seeing so far from travelers, and the diners? Do you see it going the other way also? Thanks. Darren Huston : So with regard to OpenTable, as you know the major pillars of that integration are co-marketing, international expansion and Pay with OpenTable which we highlighted at the time of acquisition where there has been a lot of planning that have gone into those. We're now in experiment if you look hard enough, you'll see us co-marketing and promoting off of various tools within Booking.com and we'll expand that over time to other brands. International expansion if you look carefully you'll see we posted a number of positions. We're now \u2013 our plans are completed and we look to expand the product to many other top cities around the world. So all of that and Pay with OpenTable, we're expanding that to more cities around the United States and the pickup isn't very good. I would say outside of those three pillars though the biggest learnings have been in how much we as a team can help OpenTable with their B2C efforts. So in a way OpenTable was really built as a B2B software play into restaurants and they've had success in B2C but they've only come very recently and they've done some great work to re-architect the B2C \u2013 or this is their website basically for consumers, and it's just is happening at the right time. They can learn a lot from the group on how to experiment and optimize and do various forms of marketing to drive more and more diners to the OpenTable restaurants and that's been a real positive and a ton of learning have gone back and forth and we've put a couple of folks now into OpenTable from Booking.com to help them with that B2C side of the business. I would also say that their B2B competency back to the previous question is also assisting us in how we think about Hotel Marketing Services. They've had a tradition of selling in basically software annuity contracts into restaurants and building relationships that were both B2B and B2C and that's something that we as a group have not had that experience and we've really learned a lot from them on how to manage that and how to manage expectations around how that delivers and how to manage any inherent conflict in providing both software and B2C booking experience. So to-date I would say as I think we've highlighted OpenTable financially has performed about where we thought it would perform, if not maybe a little bit better than that but really what I'm most excited about is the things that we're doing to build a new more exciting platform for OpenTable as part of the group looking forward into the future. Operator : Our next question comes from Ronald Josey with JMP Securities. Your line is open. Ronald Josey \u2013 JMP Securities : Two please. Wondering if you can give us an update on how you're preparing for the Spring/Summer travel season in Asia and Latin America. Anything different this year as those markets increasingly shift online? I think Dan you mentioned that things have recovered somewhat in Southeast Asia. And then the second one, second quarter in a row where we've seen increased percentage of user whose are now logging into Priceline, wondering if this has increased due to mobile or something you are doing in the marketing spend? Thank you. Darren Huston : Dan, do you want to take Asia a little bit and then I'll jump into the account? Dan Finnegan : Sure, so getting ready for spring and summer is just kind of normal operating procedure in the business. It's going out and trying to make sure that we\u2019ve got \u2013 constantly adding properties and then for the properties that we've got in our system making sure we've got good availability, best prices for our customers and then aggressively tapping into demand through variable channels at reasonable ROIs and then when we bring the traffic to our websites having what we think is the best in market experience for our customers to make sure that we convert that traffic into a booking. Ronald Josey \u2013 JMP Securities : And Southeast Asia is back online to a certain extent given the unrest in Thailand? Dan Finnegan : I wouldn't say completely back online. We said it improved to an extent but still not back where it was prior to the unrest there and Martial Law. Darren Huston : Yes. I would say generally that Dan framed it well that Southeast Asia is no longer in the whole [ph], but with the combination of everything that happened there \u2013 the burning of factories in Vietnam and of course the two Malaysian air tragedies in particular have shaken a lot of confidence for a lot of travelers who are not experienced travelers, maybe their first or second time out of the country. Obviously time is what will heal this but I think that's also been part of the reason why you've seen such a pickup in North Asian travel. I think for a lot of North Asians right now it's just feels a little bit more safe, but I'm really confident that over time obviously these things will work their way through. And your second question was just about how do we get more logged in users? We're using various techniques. We have 10s of 1000s of closed user group rates on the site, but you have to be logged in to be able to see. You don't by the way see these rates on any meta, you don\u2019t see them on Google and that's been a real asset for us for to get people to logged in because they basically say, they login to see lower rates, that\u2019s pretty compelling. But also I think having an account allows you as you've noted to go across screens. So if you book on a PC, having your account is what allows your booking to show up on your mobile phone. It sounds like so simple but it's extremely powerful, then you don't have to print off your confirmation and also I think logging in gives consumers just more comfort that they're able to get to their stuff a lot easier. The other thing is generally speaking we've done a lot of work to make the creation of account and the maintenance of an account have a lot less friction than it did in the past and I think that's been a big positive for all of the brands actually. Operator : Thank you. That concludes the Q&A session. I'll now turn the call back over to management for closing remarks. Darren Huston : Yes, we want to thank everyone again for joining the call. I think you see that our guidance reflects appropriate level of prudence on the things that we don't control but we remain very optimistic. This was the largest quarter in the Priceline Group's history and we will \u2013 I'm sure print many quarters like that looking forward into the future. So thanks for joining the call everyone. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude today's conference. You may all disconnect and everyone have a great day.",

And now I would like to introduce the Priceline Group's speakers for this afternoon, Darren Huston and Daniel Finnegan. Sir you may begin. Darren Huston : Okay, thank you very much. And welcome to The Priceline Group's fourth quarter conference call. Thank you for joining us before the markets open this morning in New York. I'm here with Priceline Group's CFO, Dan Finnegan. The Group reported consolidated gross bookings for the fourth quarter of approximately $10.7 billion, up 17% year-over-year or about 23% on a local currency basis. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $10.85 up 23% versus prior year surpassing FactSet consensus estimates of $10.10 per share and our guidance for the quarter. For the full year The Priceline Group reported gross bookings of just over a $50 billion, 346 million room nights, $3.5 billion in adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP earnings per share of $53.31 all up about 28% year-over-year.  Gross bookings benefited from growth in hotel supply of Booking.com which now has over 600,000 hotels and other accommodations in 212 countries and territories up 41% over last year. Booking.com continues to invest aggressively in its global supply platform building substantially differentiated hotel and accommodation supply, content and availability. Much of that growth in supply is driven by vacation rentals which more than doubled to 247,000 properties including villas, chalets, apartments, apart-hotels and other self-catered product all of which are instantly confirmable. It is important to note that because many of our vacation rental properties have multiple units our 247,000 properties actually represent over 1 million instantly bookable and confirmable units within these properties. We continue to believe in the large untapped potential of the global vacation rental opportunity which has historically been burdened by our high friction research and fulfillment process.  In addition to aggressively growing our number of accommodation partners the group invested nearly $2.6 billion in marketing during the year. While the preponderance of that investment was in online channels Booking.com continued to build its offline competencies. Following successful TV launches in the U.S and Australia in 2013 we also ran effective campaigns in the UK, Canada and Germany. We are pleased with the return on total advertising we're seeing in these markets and will continue to explore new markets where the data tells us it makes sense to diversify our ad spend.  2014 was a tale of two cities for Priceline.com with solid growth in its retail businesses offset by declines in its opaque businesses. We believe that pressure in opaque is a reflective of a historically healthy overall travel environment in the United States which is beneficial to the balance of our group wide business.  The fast growing Asia-Pacific market was another critical component to the group's success in 2014. We believe Agoda.com and Booking.com lead the region in intra-Asian hotel and accommodation bookings and we're now harvesting the fruit of our new commercial agreement with Ctrip that we entered last year. China is a material and fast growing portion of our Asia-Pacific business and we're leaning into that opportunity in a smart and responsible fashion. RentalCars.com accelerated in Q4 comping a quarter in last year in which it also had accelerated. RentalCars has exited 2014 from a position of strength and has seen its momentum continue into 2015. KAYAK has delivered an outstanding first full year as part of the group delivering strong top-line results and bottom-line results significantly exceeded our expectations at the time of acquisition. KAYAK is heads down innovating to extend its product leadership and build its brand in Europe. Early signs for KAYA in 2015 are so far quite positive.  OpenTable our newest member to the group remains very busy laying the ground work for its cloud based re-platforming and international expansion. As I mentioned on the last call our vision for OpenTable is expansive and 2015 will be year of profitable investment. It will take time to staff and scale a European sales organization and there is no shortage of product enhancements, internal plumbing improvements and infrastructure investments to make so that OpenTable is best positioned to scale to its true global potential. I will have more to share on OpenTable's progress as the year unfolds but we're optimistic from everything we're seeing so far and our team is super motivated. In the U.S OpenTable continues to achieve high diner growth as it transitions its restaurant base to its cloud based offering and continues its rollout of Pay with OpenTable.  Mobile remains a continued bright spot for all of our brands. Just this past week Booking.com exceeded 100,000 gross transactions before cancellations or amendments on just mobile phones on two different days and we're still not in high season for bookings. On January 15 we also launched Booking Now on the Apple platform in the United States. Booking Now is our app for spontaneous or last minute bookers. Our international launch of Booking Now including the addition of all of our supported languages will start in earnest next week.  Priceline.com leads the group in the percentage of travel bookings completed on mobile on some days now approaching 50%. KAYAK and OpenTable both have flourishing businesses on their app especially in the United States which drives strong repeat traffic. From a very small part of our business just a few years ago mobile has become a mission critical part of the group both to deliver transactions and to deliver great end to end experiences for our guests. Excellent execution of our mobile platforms has been critical to the group success and overall market share gains this year. The group performed well in 2014 exceeding expectations throughout the year and growing more in one year on an absolute basis than in any year in our history. As we enter 2015 we see continued strong momentum in our business across the board. Our biggest short-term challenge is currency. With over 90% of our business in our international brands and a significant majority of that being transacted in non-U.S dollar currencies mostly the euro and the British pound but also to a lesser effect the Brazilian real, Australia Canadian dollars, Russian ruble, Thai baht and Turkish lira this presents mostly a translation challenge.  Our fundamental growth momentum as measured by units or in constant currency remains strong. Unlike some other companies who have reported a currency challenge again is largely a translational challenge and not a mismatch of revenue and expenses. We remain steadfastly committed to our formulae of out-executing and out-innovating the competition. We are in this scheme for the long run making a smart and sustainable investment in our products and services every day of the year.  We invest in profitable growth and our earning our customers loyalty through superior customer offerings and branded experiences. We believe we have a winning sustainable strategy and have observed a growing mix of direct business all year while delivering market leading organic performance on both the top-line and bottom-line. We also believe we can win with strong margins in the face of heated competition and have a long history of managing our costs extremely well and plan to continue our track record of strong leverage and margin management.  All that said we're also not afraid to use our resources to invest assertively when investments make sense as we believe it currently does in online demand channels and most recently into our OpenTable and booking suite investments in particular. We looked at various options to use our capital in the current environment. Today we're announcing that the Priceline Board has given us the authority to repurchase up to $3 billion of our common stock. We believe this is a good use of capital and reflects our confidence in the long-term prospects of the group. It has been a privilege this year -- past year as group CEO to lead a team of such talented and dedicated people at all the brands. There is no better job on the planet in my opinion and I am enthusiastic about all of the opportunities facing each of our brands. I want to thank our employees around the world for delivering another terrific year for their brands and for the group. I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review. Daniel Finnegan : Thanks, Darren. I'll discuss some of the highlights in operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the first quarter of 2015. Q4 was a strong quarter from both the top and bottom-line perspective. Unit growth is an important metric to focus on for our business to understand core performance excluding the impact of currency.  Room nights booked grew by 24% in the fourth quarter decelerating modestly compared to the 27% growth rate for Q3. Rental car days grew by 16% in Q4 reflecting accelerating retail growth offset by a decrease for Name Your Own Price rental car reservations. Strong momentum in room night and rental car day unit growth has carried over into Q1 as we will see in a moment when we review Q1 guidance. Average daily rates for accommodations or ADRs for Q4, 2014 were up on a local currency basis by about 1.5% for the consolidated group.  Q4 gross bookings grew by about 23% on a local currency basis and by about 17% in U.S dollars compared to prior year. Our Q4 international gross bookings grew by about 27% on a local currency basis and by about 19% in U.S dollars. Gross bookings for our Priceline.com brand business in the U.S grew by 3%. The Priceline team is doing a great job improving the experience for customers on the website which is driving nice conversion improvements. The result has been accelerating retail room nights and rental car growth.  However our Name Your Own Price services continue to be hamstrung by lack of discounted rates. Gross profit for the quarter was $1.7 billion and grew by about 33% on a constant currency basis and by 26% in U.S dollars compared to prior year. Our international operations generated gross profit of $1.4 billion which grew by about 32% on a constant currency basis and by 24% in U.S dollar compared to prior year. Gross profit for our U.S. operations, including OpenTable's U.S. business amounted to $241 million which represented 35% growth versus prior year. OpenTable generated total growth wide revenue in Q4 of about $59 million non-GAAP operating income amounted to 41.4% of gross profit for Q4 which is 132 bps lower than last year. Operating margins reflect investments we made in offline advertising and other OpEx, to build our brands and support growth initiatives in restaurant reservations and our booking suite of hotel marketing services. Operating margins did come in better than our guidance however due mainly to less than forecasted year-over-year decline in online advertising ROIs. Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 amounted to $712 million which exceeded the top end of our guidance range of $665 million and represents 23% growth versus prior year. Non-GAAP net income grew by 22% and non-GAAP EPS grew by 23%. In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $755 million of cash from operations during fourth quarter 2014 which was about 36% above last year. We invested $41 million on CapEx and repurchased 443,000 shares of our common stock in for $505 million in Q4. As Darren mentioned earlier this month our board authorized us to repurchase up to $3 billion of our common stock. We expect to execute the program going forward to return capital to shareholders at a pace that we think makes sense relative to available cash in the U.S and potential other uses for such capital. Our cash and investments amounted to $8 billion at year end, with about $1.2 billion of that balance in the U.S.  We were pleased to recently receive a strong investment grade credit rating from Moody's which is in line with our current rating from S&P. This positions us well as we continue to monitor debt markets in the U.S and Europe for opportunities to raise capital at attractive rates. The full year 2014 Priceline Group grew room nights and gross bookings by 28%. Adjusted EBITDA amounted to about $3.5 billion and grew 29% while the business generated $2.9 billion of cash from operations. The companies delivered an operating margin expressed as non-GAAP operating income divided by gross profit of 44.7%. I thank our people around the world for their hard work and dedication to deliver these strong results. Their talent and relentless execution to add properties rental car suppliers and restaurants continuously innovate on our website and apps and officially bring new customers to our brands with online and offline advertising this responsible for our success. I am also pleased with the balance of outstanding top line and bottom line growth and in ultra-competitive market.  Now for Q1 guidance. I'd like to take a moment talk about the impact of the foreign currency exchange rates on our financial results. As Darren mentioned about 90% of our gross bookings and operating income for 2014 are generated by our international brands. Therefore as we've seen in the past during the financial crisis and the European sovereign debt crisis, extreme volatility in foreign exchange rates significantly impacts our operating results as we translate them into U.S dollars. Our Q1 forecast assumes foreign exchange rates for the remainder of the quarter are equal to yesterday's closing rates at this exchange rates are gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income will mathematically translate into significantly fewer dollars than they would have last year's exchange rates for Q1 and the remainder of the year.  Specifically our forecast for two of our most impactful currencies the euro and the British pound assumes rates remain at a $1.14 per euro and $1.54 per British pound which would result an average exchange rates to would be weaker by about 17% for the euro and about 8% for the British pound for Q1 as compared to the prior year.  I highlight that $1.14 euro exchange rate assumed that our forecast is about 9% weaker than the dollar 25 exchange rate that prevailed that time in reported Q3 and most analysts last updated their forecast.  On the positive side our expenses are denominated in foreign currency on a basis similar to our revenues. So our expenses will also translate into fewer dollars. Therefore our operating margins are not significantly impacted by currency fluctuations and we believe that the impact of currency are our bottom line is generally similar to the top line impact. However due to our normal business seasonality but the bottom-line currency impact is somewhat less pronounced in Q1 and slightly more pronounced in Q3. Below the stronger dollar has a significant negative impact on our growth expressing dollars the fundamental performance of our businesses is still evident in the resilient unit growth driving our forecasted total gross bookings, international gross bookings and gross profit growth on a constant currency basis. We believe the true performance of our business will eventually show through at our U.S dollar financial statements when the dollar stabilizes relative to other currencies in general and the Euro in particular. We're pleased with the high growth rates the business has consistently delivered over the past several years despite its size. The travel market remains fundamentally healthy from an occupancy and ADR perspective broadly and in Europe.  Our guidance reflects a strong start to the first quarter and our assumption that our growth rates will decelerate as we proceed through the remainder of the quarter due to the size of our business. For Q1 guidance we're forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 14% to 21% on a constant currency basis and by 2% to 9% in U.S dollars with U.S gross bookings growing by about 0% to 5%. We expect international gross bookings to grow by 17% to 24% on a constant currency basis and by 3% to 10% in U.S dollars.  Our Q1 forecast assumes that local currency ADRs for the consolidated group will be up by slightly less than 1% compared to the prior year period. We expect Q1 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 4% to 11% and gross profits grow by 21% to 28% on a local currency basis and by 9% to 16% in U.S dollars. We expect the declines in our Name Your Own Price service will continue to negatively impact revenue growth rates in Q1.  We expect about 550 bps of deleverage in non-GAAP operating margins compared to prior year expressed as operating income as a percentage of gross profit driven mainly by non-advertising operating expenses. As we have done in the past we are investing in OpEx to add people, offices and IT capacity to build up the capability of the business to handle future growth. Q1 also reflects OpEx for OpenTable and our booking suite of hotel marketing services. Our Q1 online advertising forecast reflects our actual results to-date and assumes increased pressure on add efficiency throughout the remainder of the quarter based upon the trends we have experienced over the last couple of years.  Investments in OpEx and advertising typically have a more pronounced impact on profitability in Q1 where we earn a lower percentage of our annual gross profit due to the normal seasonality for our business. While we're not giving earnings guidance beyond Q1 we do expect pressure on operating margins from non-advertising OpEx to significantly diminish as we proceed throughout the year and lap the OpenTable acquisition and the launch of booking suite initiative.  Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $475 million and $510 million which at the midpoint is a decrease of 4% versus prior year. Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately 15% comprised of international income taxes and alternative minimum tax and state income from taxes in the U.S. We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $7.20 to $7.75 per share which at the midpoint is a decrease of 4% versus prior year. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 52.7 million shares based upon yesterday's closing stock price.  We forecast GAAP EPS between $5.25 and $5.80 per share for Q1. The difference between GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed in our earnings release. Consistent with past practice we have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our first quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any further fluctuation in the euro and British pound versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter. But these hedges do not offset the impact on translation on our gross bookings, revenue, gross profit or operating income, do not hedge us against fluctuations in other currencies and do not hedge our earnings beyond the first quarter.  Although we remain concerned about economic conditions in general and in our key European markets in particular our forecast does not assume any further deterioration in macro-economic conditions. We will now take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Heath Terry of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Heath Terry : Just a couple of questions. If you could provide us a little bit more detail on, you mentioned ADR growth being less than 1% in the quarter. But if you look more specifically, particularly at the Eurozone, what you're seeing from a consumer demand perspective and just willingness to spend on travel, whether the day-to-day data points you're seeing are positive or negative from any trend perspective. And then you mentioned that as we go through or past Q1 that the operating margin pressure should diminish. As that happens are there incremental positive ROI growth channels from a customer acquisition or business acquisition perspective that you see out there that you can allocate those dollars to accelerate growth or do you simply expect to see that fall to the bottom-line? Darren Huston : This is Darren I'll take the ADR growth European economy issue and maybe Dan can comment on operating margins. No in general certainly everyone knows what's going on the euro but we're not sensing overall that there are big issues with consumer demand in Europe. Its kind a mixed bag certainly Russian outbound is down for obvious reasons, although Russian domestic travel is still quite strong. France specifically is still in a bit of malaise both as a destination and as bookers, but that's made up for the fact that the Brits as bookers are very strong the German as bookers are very strong and Southern Europe it looks like it's going to be very popular this spring and summer. So overall the U.S. is definitely one of the hottest markets in the world, but that Europe is holding up quite well at least the early signs in 2015. Daniel Finnegan : And Heath on operating margins so yes we said that we expect the pressure to diminish as we go throughout the year as it relates to other non-advertising OpEx expenses. We already advertise aggressively in all variable channels and we'll spend an unlimited amount of money there regardless of what's going on with OpEx as long as we can get a fair return on our investment, so the impact of less margin pressure from OpEx should benefit bottom-line and the how advertising plays out is just completely separate story. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Post of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now opened. Justin Post : Just talking a little bit on a high level on the space, obviously Expedia has had a lot of acquisition news lately. Does that really change anything for Priceline? And they do have their room nights up at a faster rate, so how does that affect the overall environment, if you can provide any help on that?  And then, secondly on mobile, it looks like mobile is growing as a piece of your business. Are the upfront costs to acquire customers more there? And do you expect a longer pay pack? Are they coming back more frequently direct on mobile? Maybe a little bit about the mobile channel versus PC. Thank you. Darren Huston : This is Darren. I guess I'll take both questions. First of all as it relates to what if Travelocity the pending deal with Orbitz, it's hard I'm not Expedia, so I can't exactly -- don't know exactly what they're doing but it sounds like a consolidation strategy. Our focus as a group is quite different than that. We're very focused primarily on organic growth and acquisition. And from an acquisition standpoint, we're focused on buying premium winning brands that either add new geographies or business verticals or competencies new channels that we can add to our existing brands so if you look at our history as a group whether it was buying booking.com to compete in Europe, Agoda Asia Rentalcars in rental cars, KAYAK in meta, OpenTable in restaurants and then recently Buuteeq to help build our booking suite business it's all been adjacent growth versus doubling or tripling down on similar brands.  My own view is I don't see the deal that Expedia if it passes as being a negative for our group I think of anything it consolidates and clarifies competition and there's still plenty of room to grow. If you think travel market it was 1 trillion market recently someone said it was 1.3 trillion market so if you add both all of our business and Expedia's business together still less than 10% of the total opportunity space. And if you look at the U.S. specifically for us it's all upside and we plan to work very hard to continue to increase our share in the U.S. market, so to me it just shows that there's a tremendous potential ahead and we're just staying very focused on what we do well and I'm sure Expedia will do the same so I don't see it overall as a negative. In terms of Expedia's growth rates we obviously have always prided ourselves on being very highly profitable and continuing to grow very fast I'm super proud of this the 28% growth on top and bottom-line that we printed in 2014 it's always good to remind you that when we talk about our room nights are all 100% organic and that's just a very different result the way you're saying Expedia but I do give them a lot of credit they seem to have printed a great quarter but we just have a different philosophy as it relates to building business for the long-term. And then mobile specifically, yes mobile is I've been here now 3.5 years and by far is the biggest thing that changed in our business. And it's causing all sorts of issues and questions in terms of how do you generate demand, how do you build experience but as I've always said for an e-commerce player like us mobile is a net-net positive. It's allowing us to serve customers over multiple streams and whether they arrive first on our phone or a tablet or a PC it's not important to us as how do we basically become relevant to them other than being just a transaction how does OpenTable are booking or Agoda create more relevancy in the end-end experience that they're having on a local basis. True enough we do spend money on buying business that originates on mobile phones and that market is still it's still not been most perfect market it's still quite chaotic but we feel we've gotten a lot smarter about how buy our business. Some brands are very app driven, if you look at OpenTable or KAYAK, other brands are very mobile web driven and then brands like Booking have a bit of both.  And we feel if anything or the skills we built on the desktop we're feeling as good or if not better about the skills that we're applying in the mobile environment to buying new demand and I don't think increase in mobile to any degree because we have a common ROI standard I don't think the increase mobile to any degree has driven us to any lower standard, if anything the one real positive is driving more of our business direct to our brands versus having to buy it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Doug Anmuth : Great, thanks for taking the question. Can you guys talk a little bit more about the investment in 1Q in OpenTable and Booking Suite and just talk about the key initiatives there? And then, also, you mentioned that you're starting to harvest the fruit from the Ctrip relationship. Can you provide some more color on some of the benefits that you're seeing there, as well? Thanks. Darren Huston : Okay, I'll take Doug. This is Darren again, I'll take those. So first of all let me talk first about OpenTable, since we bought it we made a massive investment replatforming the OpenTable B2B software as now going to be all cloud based. The whole frontend has been replatformed so we can run AB experimentation on it. There's been a lot of best practice sharing, you're going to see the OpenTable product now improve at a very dramatic pace because we put it on to this new modern and cloud based platform.  We've also now posted our position that our beginning hiring for a number of international cities,. I'll let you do your own research there in terms of which cities we're expanding into So, I would say it's time to date has been a lot of best practice sharing. Betting some of the plumbing done in 2015 for us is a big investment year for OpenTable. And, as we've always said, we're going here to create something that is going to be truly a global platform and a modern eCommerce platform and where we remain very bullish on the opportunity with that asset and certainly today we've been performing above the level of hat we had expected it too, but really the best is yet to come.  And then as it relates to Booking Suite, we bought Buuteeq and a smaller company called Hotel Ninjas. That team now has been completely brought into booking.com. We've rebranded it Booking Suite. We're now in the market with a number of products, mostly Web site products. The demand for those products is very strong. And we're just now in a rhythm of really trying to scale the old Buuteeq business now that is fully integrated with Booking and the receptivity from the market has been very strong. So, what we're doing there is building out a SaaS-based business. It takes a little bit of time to get going but it's a really nice annuity revenue stream. But almost as importantly, it's bringing us closer to hotel partners and showing that as a company we can add value fame as well as a marketing service to software provider.  And then, finally, with Ctrip, there I'd say that the biggest highlight has been a significantly growing outbound business, both with Agoda and Booking.com on Ctrip. That reflects of course a very strong Chinese market. We have also seen our non-Ctrip business by the way growing very strong. Ctrip now is a branded experience so customers are learning ability Booking.com and Agoda, a and that's obviously very valuable to us. The other side of the Ctrip deal was getting Ctrip hotels onto the Booking.com Web site. We now have, let's call it, a few handfuls of their hotels on our Web site. It's taken a little bit longer because we've had to work to make those hotels and upgrade the product so that it was at the level of the product we have on our Web site otherwise. But we're getting good traction there and we look in the coming quarters to significantly accelerate our rollout of Ctrip properties in China. I had mentioned this before but one of our biggest challenges in China is most business at Chinese hotels is domestic and we really are really strong on inbound and outbound and the feature our product portfolio is going to allow us have a very competitive selection of properties for domestic Chinese guests, as well. So, those are the three. C trip in particular, if you've all followed it, they are in a super competitive environment. We're really supportive of James and his team. We think they have the strongest hand in the market. And we still believe that today and we're proud of the deal we have and we're working really closely with them as they fight the competitive battles that they are fighting, which has largely been a domestic Chinese challenge. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Sandler of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Ross Sandler : Great, thanks guys. Congrats on the quarter. I just had two questions. First one, Airbnb called out that they had 550,000 travelers that used them for New Year's Eve this past year in 20,000 cities or something. So, this isn't exactly apples to apples to your 800,000 to 900,000 room nights per night average in the fourth quarter, but just big picture how do you view Airbnb competitively in the hotel space longer term? And then a quick follow-up to the earlier question on mobile unit economics. I'll ask this a different way. As you guys move away from paid searches and marketing channel. Do you see the online marketing as a percent of gross profit staying in this kind of 31% range or could that get better one day? That's all, thanks. Darren Huston : This is Darren I will take first one and a fair shot at the second if Dan can have anything to add. Yes with respect to Airbnb we have a lot of respect for what they are doing. It is still as good as their website is as it's still a relatively high friction process of booking on Airbnb but the whole sharing economy peer to peer is a real force. I will remind people that on average every day we have more than a 1 million guests if we do the math and if you look at the total number of units that are actually bookable on Booking.com it far exceeds what's available on Airbnb.  The interesting dynamic is really happening in the vacation rental space. We're coming into the market with an instantly bookable, immediately confirmable product -- they are coming from the bottom up with a sharing economy and there is a lot of interest among our consumers in self-catered product and whether that product ultimately ends up being somebody's sofa or being in a aparthotel room in Paris nobody knows but one of the things that Airbnb is really helping us with is the rules in this space have traditionally been very foggy and gray and city by city around the world the rules are now getting written and that helps us a lot because we're always going to play on the right side of the rules but they have always been a little bit foggy and we will see where that all goes at the end of day.  We're seeing some -- we don't see a big impact on hotel demand based on this new advent of what I would call self-catered demand I mean that's all up Airbnb, us, other players but maybe one day you will see that shift and obviously the big hotel brands I don't think are sitting still either. We see a lot of properties for instance in Europe where they will have the hotel and then they have an apartment block in behind the hotel you use the hotel front desk but then as a family you might stay in the apartment. That's kind of new behavior is a reaction I think to some of this current trend at least.  And then as it relates to mobile unit economics I should also qualify that mobile web search is primarily still a Google business and it is working better and better. So even when we acquire a customer on the phone one of the best ways to do it is through Google and through their web search. But as I look forward what we've generally done is our business has become more direct we're leaning even heavier into some of these channels.  We certainly keep ROI standards but I can't particularly say if along long-term online will be a lesser percentage. But we will continue to adjust our marketing mix and we think that our margin level we need to keep throwing out the fishing net to find more and more customers. And we're not satisfied just to work off the loyalty of our existing customer base. So a lot of it depends on the opportunity to cast the fishing net in a ROI positive fashion and it's hard to really predict that based on the competitive dynamics in some of these markets.  But the one thing that is real is we're having to adjust our marketing mix overtime based on mobile specifically but also based on the ability of let`s call it, the non-Google participants to create products that are ROI standards but I positive for us and we're seeing progress at places like Facebook for instance. I mean others where they are improving the ability for direct responsible to performance marketers like The Priceline Group to buy their products and that's a real good thing for us and because it hasn't been that case traditionally over the past. Daniel Finnegan : I agree we're not moving away from paid search we're moving closer to we're looking for every opportunity to spend money with our partners to drive business profitably and we're seeing nice growth in our direct business which we hope will continue over time but -- and that may cause what you would perceive to be moving away but we're actually diving in with both feet partnering with our HR partners to drive more opportunities for both of us. Operator : Thank you our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open Mark Mahaney : Thank you. Two questions please. I think two quarters ago you'd quantified vacation rentals as a percentage of your total bookings. Could you give us an update there? Has it exceeded 10% perhaps on a trailing 12-month basis? And then, secondly, Darren you talked about having used acquisitions to expand into newer areas, and you mentioned a couple of them. I want to ask your thoughts about expanding into things like local attractions and air, especially internationally. How do you think about those as incremental or adjacent market opportunities? How high on the priority list or low on the priority list are those two things, particularly attractions and international air? Darren Huston : Okay. Thanks, Mark. So we don't have any new numbers on vacation rentals, we gave a trailing 12-months but I will say is the vacation rental business is outgrowing our business. And so the next time we say a number maybe we do it a year from the first time we said the number and you can think about it in that way. So it's becoming a greater proportion of our business. I always also flag you have to be careful with property count.  That's why we added the vacation rental sub number because those properties do come in with less units than our traditional hotels. And that's why you will see our property count continue to expand at a rate faster than our overall business because we're bringing on less units per property. And I think that will continue to be the case going forward. I'd say and I don't we're not by any means done with acquisitions as a lot more to do and then next move in vacation rental is to really address the home owner versus property managed vacation rental product and we're well in our way to doing that.  And in terms of acquisitions or opportunity space, number one, I would say we have a lot to digest right now, and we're in what I consider to be the most attractive spaces. And the addition of restaurants is just an amazing opportunity for the group. Areas are very low margin business and its right with customer service concerns and our plan right now is a little piece of Priceline but also growth KAYAK which plays about OTA and direct air. And even though air is not a very attractive business from an EBITDA perspective, it is an important part of travel and we want to make sure that whatever we do in air that we remain relevant in air. And certainly with over 90 partnerships of airline build around the world including Ryanair and EasyJet and KLM, et cetera, we play an important partnership of did you monetize air into things like hotels bookings.  But as I look forward, yes, attractions are interesting. We're doing a lot of experimentation right now with various elements of cross sell. Always we're looking at things that, yes, we could make money off of but much more importantly. What are the things we can cross sell it improves the experience of a consumer and it enhances their loyalty. If you follow Booking right now, for instance you'll see us do a lot of pre-trip e-mails. And you'll see us now, we have insider guides of the top cities in the world and within those guide you'll see us testing and experimenting with various things. But again we're going not become the charge key shop itself 50 different things to just make a little bit more money we're really conginets in this. What is the use of really wanted to do. And if any of those things gets big traction then we'll figure out should we enter this space organically, through acquisition, or an alliance, or some other mode, is the way I think about it. But at this specific moment, we've got our hands full and we're by and large focused on organic execution. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Olson of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Mike Olson : Thanks, good morning. You mentioned vacation rentals again as a focus and, I think you just said, you'll be looking at addressing the homeowner property category. Does that present more challenges than what you've done so far in this space with the property manager inventory? So, should the pace of BR inventory addition slow in the coming quarters because of that? And then, secondly and totally separately, does the $3 billion buyback have any specific time frame on it? Like, is it authorization for one or two years or is it just an open-ended authorization? Thanks. Darren Huston : Since we started primarily focusing on hotels even moving into bed and breakfasts and hostels and even treehouses and igloos and everything we've added to the site as presenting new challenges. And what we do is we bring in we experiment with it we adjust our business system.  Recently we rolled out a simple extranet and we've got a lot of other things in the pipeline to specifically address the needs all the way down to the single unit, single property single owner model. I mean that ultimately as a company it's our destination we're here to be the world's largest inventory and selection of accommodation at the best price of the simplest experience and it's very much fits that.  I honestly don't believe the challenges are insurmountable but it takes a lot of work in an industry that's traditionally operated in a very different fashion than modern eCommerce which is the ability device things that a price and we'll actually booked them without ever having to talk to the seller of the product and that's what we're working towards And, frankly I'm quite optimistic -- not that we have the answer to everything at this moment but we've got really smart teams working on this right now and over to Dan on the $3 billion. Daniel Finnegan : On the stock buyback authorization Mike similar to all of the authorizations we've had in the past that's open ended there is no specific time frame by which we need to execute that. If you'll look at our tract record we've been active in the market and Q4 we bought back over 500 million over the last couple of years we bought back $1.6 billion for worth of stock. That said this is the biggest buyback authorization we've ever gotten from our board. We got it because we want to use it will be active in the market. But we're not going constrain ourselves by stating the pace at which we will execute it. Operator : Our next question comes from Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open Naved Khan : Yes hi, thanks. Just two questions. One on the TV ad spend -- last year it grew faster than your online spend as well as the growth in gross profits. And I know you're not guiding 2015 but can you just talk about what to expect for the year in terms of TV ad spend?  And then on a different topic, have you tested the traffic cross-sell synergies between the core travel and OpenTable? And what have you seen so far? Darren Huston : Yes, I'm going to let Dan take the first one, I'll take the second one. Daniel Finnegan : Hi Naved. On the TV ad spend, we're not giving any guidance for the year, we didn't mention it as it relates to Q1 being a factor positively or negatively related to guidance so you can assume it's fairly neutral. As we added more and more markets over the last couple of years and then you continue to spend on those markets at the same amount or some relative increase that's not growing as fast as our business the pressure on operating margin subsides to an extent that said we still like the results we've seen in all the markets where we've launched our advertising and we'll likely to launch an additional market for this year particularly for Booking.com and so when we do that you can't see from quarter-to-quarter some operating pressure when we add those new markets. Darren Huston : And Naved on the second question, the way I like to think about the cross sell is a very narrow way to think about it, that would be I made a hotel booking and immediately I'm going to make a restaurant booking and I think of the much bigger opportunity as cross-promotion meaning A, I live in Italy and I love using Booking.com -- oh and you can also do that with restaurants and that's the part that we've seen the biggest interest. If we look at our insider guides and our pre-trip e-mails the biggest thing people are interested in who book accommodations is restaurants. The restaurants nearby or they booked and the ability on that first night if they arriving late, where can I eat, any of our hotels have restaurants and as a competitive thing within the space the persons sitting in there and that we're absolutely confident that there is significant interest in that but we need to then get of course is great relevant content get the OpenTable reviews, the photos, et cetera and really lace those two things together but we're quite optimistic, I'd say all of that in OpenTable's proposition is not going to grow as a primary just because of Booking.com. OpenTable will need to stand on its own as a business which it has in the United States and I'm confident will internationally.  Booking.com will be a nice new group of tens of millions of customers we can introduce the concept to and that's really the way I think about it versus get a hotel booking, get a restaurant booking. Although by the way we've tested that it works but it's not like the biggest idea in terms of the synergy between the brands. Naved Khan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, our next question comes from Tom White of Macquarie, your line is now open. Tom White : Thanks for taking my question. I think in your prepared remarks you talked about Booking and Agoda, you guys believe now are the leaders in intra-Asia travel. Could you maybe just talk a bit about what metrics that's based on and why you believe the playbook there is working? And then, just quickly, you talked about less pressure on online ad ROIs in quarter than expected. Maybe talk a bit about what's driving that. I'm curious if any of it relates to your emerging markets. Are you seeing any of the recent investments you've made there starting to pay off in terms of repeat visits? Thanks. Darren Huston : Thanks Tom. It's really we say intra-Asian travel because it really has been the strength of the group, if you look at the Agoda brand in Southeast Asia really is the leading people way book accommodations in Southeast Asia, and then with the addition of booking.com which brings travelers from all over the world in Asia and Asians amongst Asia, it really plays to our strong suite of brands. There are very large domestic OTAs in the market, the Ctrips, the Gilands, the Rackatins, who do actually very high volume business but their business is largely domestic and we have a pretty good sense from our hotel partners that we're the leading players from market share standpoint in terms of how Asians move within Asia, meaning from country to country. Daniel Finnegan : And for the second part Tom, regarding Q4 we said the favorability for operating margins was mainly driven by better than forecasted online ad ROIs. So not so much of a mix issue direct growing faster and that's also in there but that was in our forecast. We don't get into the specifics of much driving those better ROIs but you know all the elements that go into it, it's got CTCs conversion which we got are great teams, had all of our brands working hard every day to approve cancellation rates, unit economics. So the way that all blended our in Q4 was favorable to what we had assumed in our forecast. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Fitzgerald of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Brian Fitzgerald : Thanks. A quick question on your thoughts around loyalty programs and their impacts on consumer travel behavior. Is that something that's important to you guys? Are you going to be investing around that? Do you feel like you're at a bit of a disadvantage relative to some of the other OTAs that have been investing around loyalty programs? Thanks, guys. Darren Huston : Thanks Brian. Agoda has a loyalty program that was very points driven. It's as much my philosophy as some of the brand CEOs. I grew up at Starbucks and other places. My own view, and what we've seen in the data, is that customers are most loyal when you give them a great experience. And that's what we've been focused on. And it's driven if you look at repeat behavior if you look at a number of bookings share of wallet in a year we've seen in our biggest brands it won't have a formal and post loyalty program significant increases in those kind of metrics every single year that we've been in a business. So, that's what we focus on. The other question though is for high volume travel what you do and most of our business is built off of leader travelers they don't actually book that often  But for high volume travel it seems like loyalty is an aspect. By the way, it is a very deep aspect more in the United States than it is in many other parts of the world where people take a lot more leisure travel versus pure business travel. So, we've always been interested in what is the role of points and loyalty programs, what role should The Group play in that. By the way, some of these programs, you think they drive people to be more loyal but they can actually make them more dissatisfied with you because people will give you points and then make it harder and harder for you to use your points that's what marketers do and CFOs do at times looking at Dan so there's also cautions with these things, but we're obviously very interested it hasn't been a big issue for us in the past or when you do look at specific pockets of high volume traveler that's where probably we have the greatest going forward interest in this topic. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from Ron Josey of JMP Securities. Your line is now opened. Ron Josey : I'll be brief. I was just following up on an earlier question I believe that Darren, you'd answered, specifically on segmentation and one of that perhaps and finding non-Google participants. I wanted to get your thoughts on marching to Millennials. I think you've said in the past Millennials have a pension for non-hotel activity. You launched Booking. Now recently, the new TV ad campaign I think maybe focused on them, as well. So, as you think about sort of the new segments not resting on your existing customers, curious on those on your approach there. Thank you. Darren Huston : We're are cognizant of Millennials I think another thing I would add to your list, its MHAs it's things like Booking Now they basically like not to go to Paris or London or New York, they like to just wander off into the countryside many of them don't have computers they only have phones. So thinking of all of those things and as well as having product on the site, we're one of the world leaders in hostels. If you go to our any hostel in Europe a lot of people using booking.com to book hostel so making sure that we're relevant to this next generation of travelers is also helping us to make sure relevant with the emerging lifestyles of consumers. So we do a lot of work not I wouldn't say traditional marketing work like we're now buying ads on just programs that Millennials watch that's never been something we do but we target them more from the data perspective and also making sure that the product that we have is relevant to their lifestyles and at least the data that we see shows that we have a very large group of young people who use booking.com on a regular basis even backpacking through Europe we're thing. We're not just a rich person product and that obviously keeps the brand healthy and we hope that the hostel stayers become hotel bookers et cetera through their life cycle. But it's a great question and certainly watching my own children the world is changing very-very fast and we want to make sure relevant the way that they use their screens versus the way that Dan and I would use our stream which was quite different. Operator : Thank you. And at this time I'd like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks. Darren Huston : Okay well thank you very much and thank you all for joining the call and we look forward to getting back into the weeds on execution there I think Dan mentioned the currency is the translation challenge for us but as the team we continue to be very focused in organically executing through the way that we've always done and we're very optimistic in where the business will be going in the coming quarters years et cetera. So thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.",

And now, I would like to introduce the Priceline Group\u2019s speakers for this afternoon, Darren Huston and Daniel Finnegan. Go ahead gentleman. Darren Huston : Okay, thank you very much. And welcome to The Priceline Group\u2019s first quarter conference call. Thank you for joining us, before the markets open this morning in New York. I\u2019m here in Amsterdam with Priceline Group\u2019s CFO, Dan Finnegan. The Group reported consolidated gross bookings for the fourth quarter of approximately $13.8 billion, up 12% year-over-year or about 26% on a local currency basis. Room nights exceeded 100 million for the first time during the quarter while growth accelerated slightly to 25%. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $8.12, up 4% versus prior year surpassing FactSet consensus estimates of $7.72 per share and our guidance for the quarter. Our U.S dollar denominated growth rates were substantially impacted by the stronger dollar. Our international business recorded 29% gross bookings growth on a local currency basis, up from 27% last quarter. Gross bookings benefited from growth in hotel supply at Booking.com which now has over 640,000 hotels and other accommodations in over 200 countries and territories, up 40% over last year. We are continuing to ramp new property acquisition including individually owned vacation rentals with new on-boarding tools that allow owners to list their property quickly and easily on our websites. Vacation rentals nearly doubled year-over-year to 275,000, instantly bookable and confirmable properties including villas, chalets, apartments, aparthotels and other self-catered products. Two important innovations were also launched at Booking.com in the first quarter. Booking Now, our mobile phone app for spontaneous bookers and Booking Suite, our partner facing software services platform, both launches were executed well and early results are encouraging. Each of these growth expansions represent innovation beachhead that will be further expanded upon in the coming weeks, months and quarters. International results also benefited from agoda.com and rentalcars.com, both of which accelerated in the quarter. Kayak and OpenTable continue to pursue the international opportunity; and where much work has been done and both businesses are growing, there is still a lot of potential ahead of us. Kayak is focused on product innovation and brand building and has made some solid business progress, particularly in Europe. OpenTable has now more or less completed its technical REIT platform into more modern cloud based architecture. We are now executing plans to optimize the product and roll it out globally. Against these plans, we will take a determined by test and learn approach over the coming quarters as we have with all our businesses. Demand for OpenTable solutions from both restaurants and customers remains very strong. Priceline.com\u2019s domestic growth continued to be hampered by the shrinking opaque business. Priceline.com\u2019s retail business remains healthy including acceleration in the retail hotels and the new management team there is poised to rejuvenate and maximize the potential of the Priceline.com brand. We also acquired Rocketmiles in the first quarter, an innovative hotel booking platform for frequent flyers based in Chicago. Rocketmiles is being managed independently as part of our Priceline Ventures portfolio. Mobile\u2019s interrupted growth in share of our business continues. From Booking.com\u2019s Booking Now app for spontaneous or last minute bookers to priceline.com\u2019s iWatch app to our pay with OpenTable Mobile Payments app to Kayak\u2019s mobile itinerary management tools, innovation and execution on mobile is in our DNA and critical to the Group\u2019s continued success. Across the Group, our customers completed over 100 million reservations from their smartphones in the last 12 months, and that number continues to grow very rapidly. We believe the Group\u2019s business performed well in the first quarter and we are pleased with the progress of our brands in growing and improving their platforms. Our fundamental growth momentum as measured by units and in constant currency remains strong. We again delivered strong organic performance on both the top and bottom-line, providing substantial earnings to reinvest in profitable growth and share buybacks while maintaining attractive operating margins. We repurchased $309 million of our common stock during the quarter and have the remaining authorization of $2.8 billion remaining for future quarters. I believe as strongly as ever that our formula of out-innovating the competition, smart and sustainable organic growth and earning versus buying our customers\u2019 loyalty through best-in-class consumer experiences end-to-end and across devices is the winning long-term formula. I commend my colleagues around the world for their focus and execution. I will now turn over to Dan for a more detailed summary of our financials. Daniel Finnegan : Thanks Darren. I will discuss some of the highlights and operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the second quarter of 2015. As we highlighted when we gave guidance for Q1 in February, our U.S. dollar reported results are impacted more dramatically by extreme currency volatility than most companies because about 90% of our full year 2014 gross bookings and operating income were generated by our international brands. Our two most impactful currencies, the euro and the British pound were weaker by about 18% and 9% respectively for Q1 as compared to the prior year. The euro was also about 2% weaker compared to the rate assumed in our Q1 guidance. The strong U.S. dollar means our gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income mathematically translates into significantly fewer dollars than they would have at last year\u2019s exchange rates for Q1, Q2 and the remainder of the year. Since our expenses are denominated in foreign currencies on a basis similar to our revenues, they will also translate into fewer dollars. Therefore, our operating margins are not significantly impacted by currency fluctuations and we believe that the impact of currency on our bottom-line is generally similar to the top-line impact. However, due to our normal business seasonality, the bottom-line currency impact is somewhat less pronounced in Q1 than the top-line impact. Although the stronger dollar has a significant negative impact on our growth expressed in dollars, the fundamental performance of our business is still evident in our unit growth rates and our growth rates expressed in constant currency for gross bookings, international gross bookings and gross profit. Q1 was a strong quarter for Priceline Group, accelerating unit growth paired with less margin pressure than forecasted, resulted in over-performance compared to consensus at both the top and bottom-line. Room night growth was strong relative to Q4 across all our key regions. Room nights booked grew by 25% in the first quarter accelerating slightly compared to the 24% growth rate for Q4. Rental car days grew by 18% in Q1, also accelerating compared to Q4 growth of 16%. Average daily rates per accommodations or ADRs for Q1 2015 were up on a constant currency basis by about 2% for the consolidated group. Q1 gross bookings grew by about 26% on a constant currency basis and by about 12% in U.S dollars compared to prior year. International gross bookings grew by about 29% on a constant currency basis and by about 14% in U.S. dollars. Gross bookings for our priceline.com brand business in the U.S. grew by 2%. Similar to recent quarters, the results are a mix of solid growth in retail room nights and rental car days offset by declines in Name Your Own Price services which continue to be challenged by a lack of discounted rates. Gross profit for the quarter was $1.7 billion and grew by about 32% on a constant currency basis and by 19% in U.S dollars compared to prior year. Our international operations generated gross profit of $1.4 billion which grew by about 30% on a constant currency basis and by 15% in U.S. dollar compared to prior year. Gross profit for our U.S. operations, including OpenTable\u2019s U.S. business amounted to $277 million which represented 38% growth versus prior year. OpenTable generated worldwide revenue in Q1 of about $61 million. Non-GAAP operating income amounted to 31.1% of non-GAAP gross profit for Q1 which is 448 bps lower than last year. As I said when we gave guidance for the quarter, we are investing an OpEx to add people, offices and IT capacity to build up the capability of the business to handle future growth. Q1 also reflects deleverage from the inclusion of OpEx for OpenTable and our Booking Suite of hotel marketing services. Online advertising also had deleverage due to lower ROIs and gross bookings acceleration that benefits revenue in Q2 and Q3 when Easter and summer travel takes place. Investments in OpEx and advertising typically have a more pronounced impact on profitability in Q1 when we earn a lower percentage of our annual gross profit due to the normal seasonality of our business. Operating margins did come in better than our guidance however due mainly to lower than forecasted non-advertising OpEx. Adjusted EBITDA for Q1 amounted to $532 million which exceeded the top end of our guidance range of $510 million and represents 4% growth versus prior year. Non-GAAP net income grew by 3% including interest expense from our recent bond offerings and non-GAAP EPS grew by 4%. In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $209 million of cash from operations during first quarter 2015 which is about 18% above last year. We invested $31 million in CapEx and repurchased 251,000 shares of our common stock for $309 million in Q1. We expect to execute the remainder of our $3 billion common stock buyback program going forward to return capital to shareholders at a pace that makes sense relative to available cash in the U.S. and potential other uses for such capital. We completed two successful financing transactions in Q1 at attractive interest rates. We raised EUR 1 billion for our U.S. parent company by offering a 12-year bond in Europe at 1.8% interest rate. We also raised $500 million by issuing a 10-year bond in the U.S. investment grade market with 3.65% interest rate. Our cash in investments amounted to $9.6 billion at March 31, 2015 with about $2.5 billion of that balance in the U.S. Now for Q2 guidance. The travel market continues to be fundamentally healthy from occupancy and ADR perspective broadly and in Europe. We are pleased with the resilient unit growth that our business has delivered historically and is inherent in our Q2 forecast. Our guidance assumes that our growth rates will decelerate for the quarter due to the size of our business. Our Q2 forecast assumes foreign exchange rates of $1.12 per euro and $1.51 per British pound for the remainder of the quarter which would result in average exchange rates that would be weaker by about 19% for the Euro and about 11% for the British pound as compared to the prior year. As a result, our gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income will mathematically translate into significantly fewer dollars than they would have at last year\u2019s exchange rate for Q2 and the reminder of the year. Barring further deterioration in exchange rates we believe that Q2 represents our toughest year-over-year currency comp for 2015. For Q2 guidance, we are forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 15% to 22% on a constant currency basis and by 0% to 7% in U.S. dollars with U.S. gross bookings growing by about 0% to 5%. We expect international gross bookings to grow by 17% to 24% on a constant currency basis and by 0% to 7% in U.S. dollars. Our Q2 forecast assumes that local currency ADRs for the consolidated group will be up by less than 2% compared to the prior year period. We expect Q2 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 0% to 7% and gross profit to grow by 17% to 24% on a local currency basis and by 1% to 8% in U.S. dollars. We expect the decline in our Name Your Own Price service will continue to negatively impact revenue growth rates in Q2. We expect about 550 bps of deleverage in non-GAAP operating margins compared to prior year, expressed as non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of gross profit. Q2 forecast reflects the impact of investing in OpEx to add people, offices and IT capacity to build up the capability of the business to handle future growth. Q2 also reflects OpEx for OpenTable and our Booking Suite of hotel marketing services. While we are not giving earnings guidance beyond Q2, we do expect pressure on operating margins from non-advertising OpEx to significantly diminish over the back half of the year as we lap the OpenTable acquisition and the launch of our Booking Suite initiative. Our Q2 advertising forecast assumes lower online ad ROIs and increased investment in offline advertising including rolling out campaigns in new markets. Our approach to advertising spend is consistent with our past approach. We invest in a manner that we believe is sustainable over the long-term with the goal of building our brands with the consumers. We then strive to win the loyalty of our customers by giving them the most choices and the best booking experience across all devices they use to search and book. This approach has resulted in the nice balance between top and bottom-line growth and loyal customers that over time are increasingly coming to us directly rather than through pay channels. Our adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $715 million and $765 million which is the midpoint to the decrease of 9% versus prior year. As I mentioned a moment ago, we estimate the currency impact on EBITDA growth dissimilar to the impact that we\u2019re forecasting for gross profit. Adjusted EBITDA growth is also impacted by deleverage and operating margins just discussed. Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately 15% comprised of international income taxes and alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S. The non-GAAP EPS forecast also reflects the dilutive impact of a full quarter of interest expense from the bond offerings we did in Q1 without any assumed share repurchases we may make using the proceeds. We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $10.95 to $11.75 per share which is the midpoint to the decrease of 9% versus prior year. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 52.8 million shares based upon yesterday\u2019s closing stock price. We forecast GAAP EPS between $8.85 and $9.65 per share for Q2. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed in our earnings release. Consistent with past practice, we have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our second quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any further fluctuation in the euro and British pound versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter. The hedges do not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue, gross profit or operating income. They also do not hedge us against fluctuations in other currencies and do not hedge our earnings beyond the second quarter. Although we remain concerned about our economic conditions in general, our forecast does not assume any further deterioration in macroeconomic conditions. We will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. You may begin. Justin Post : When we look at your bookings guidance for 2Q, it looks pretty healthy and consistent with Q1 but it does seem like gross profit is decelerating ex FX. Can you just talk about the dynamics there? And then as you look at the marketing deleverage, are you seeing really pressure on ROI or what\u2019s really driving that; is it mix of businesses or what\u2019s really guiding? Thank you. Daniel Finnegan : So, in terms of gross profit, we\u2019re seeing very healthy performance there. The impact of OpenTable is a little bit more significant in Q1, the inorganic impact, just given the normal seasonality of our travel businesses. And in terms of the online advertising forecast, ROIs are the key driver there. We don\u2019t go into the all the building blocks behind what are putting the pressure on the ROIs. But it\u2019s a story we\u2019ve been telling you now for a couple of years and we saw in Q1 and we\u2019re forecasting it to continue in Q2. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. You may begin. Mark Mahaney : Darren, I think you mentioned that Agoda bookings showed acceleration. Could you give any more color on what\u2019s happening there? And also talk about the China outbound market to the extent that that\u2019s building up in materiality? Thank you. Darren Huston : So first of all, the way I think about Agoda is more broadly how things are going in Asia. And as you know, we have two big brands in Asia, Agoda and Booking.com and together we have a really strong business. Agoda has traditionally been a business of Southeast Asian bookers but it\u2019s really expanded nicely to include a lot of North Asian bookers and Oceania. At the same time, Booking.com, we started the European business. It\u2019s had a lot of success expanding into Asia. And really the real strength of the two brands has been Asians moving around Asia. So, you have a lot of movement right now between China and Japan, Taiwan and Japan, Korea and Japan, and there\u2019s a lot of movement also Australian going to Southeast Asia, Southeast Asians also going to North Asia. So we participate then in a lot of movement within Asia; and both brands continue to grow and have a lot of success. China specifically is an amazing market. You know we have our relationship with Ctrip. We are constantly meeting with the teams. I just got back from China and met with James and Jane and its\u2019 turning out to be a great partnership. Our outbound business with them is up quite significantly year-over-year. That said, we have more work to do still. We haven\u2019t on-boarded Ctrip\u2019s inventory as fast as I\u2019d hoped. There are a lot of issues we\u2019re working through. We\u2019re also exploring the need to ramp up our own efforts in China to bring on inventory. And also Ctrip is not our only relationship in China; we\u2019ve got a lot of deep partnerships with various other source of demand. So we are very bullish. I believe the Group is really leading in independent travel outbound from China. I mean most Chinese do still travel in packages and over time that\u2019s going to change. And I think we\u2019re in a really nice position in that specific market which is going to be likely in the next 5 to 10 years, the largest outbound market in the world and we\u2019re making sure that we\u2019re serving it as well as we can. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Tom White with Macquarie. You may begin. Tom White : Dan, could you may be just clarify a bit about some of your comments around FX impact on EBITDA in 1Q. It sounds like maybe it was less impacted due to FX. And I am just kind of curious, did that sort of reverse; how does that play into the 2Q guidance? And then just quickly on the European competitive landscape, one of your competitors is making concessions on their take, hotel take rates in Europe to get more competitive. Are you guys seeing any sign that that\u2019s impacting your ability to, I guess get share of rooms for given properties? And may be just comment on how badly may be your international hotel partners, do they need additional sources of distribution generally? Thanks. Darren Huston : Dan, why don\u2019t you take first one and I will take second one. Daniel Finnegan : So, on that first question, we give you a specific calculation for the impact of currency on the top-line, both for gross bookings and gross profit. It\u2019s easy for us to precisely calculate -- may be not easy but we can precisely calculate that because we know the currencies that all of those bookings and gross profit are generated in. It\u2019s a little bit more difficult at the bottom line because particularly online advertising we\u2019re making various assumptions as to the currencies that some of the keywords would pertain to. What we determine based upon our estimates is that generally the impact at the bottom-line is similar to what we\u2019re quantifying for you at the top-line. In Q1, the impact is not as dramatic because just seasonally less of our earnings are denominated in euros in Q1. So, it\u2019s about 14 percentage points at the gross profit line, you can assume it something less than that at the EBITDA line. Darren Huston : And Tom, on your question on competition in Europe, we haven\u2019t seen any specific impact. We really set the low bar on take rates. And as we continue to grow in Europe, I am sure there is a lot of pressure on our competitors. It\u2019s hard to take commission that start with the 2 in Europe when we\u2019re -- everything we have starts with the 1. But we\u2019re really the one setting the standard. And I think there\u2019s probably -- competitors have to match that if they are going to ultimately get access to availability. We\u2019ve always believed that any hotel, any partner should have various sources of demand. We don\u2019t cover every customer base in the world. So, we would encourage them to use channel managers, have all the sources of demand that they can find. And of course, we want to build our fair market share of those rooms. So, I don\u2019t see anything specifically that\u2019s coming from that rather than just probably a long overdue balancing, rebalancing in the market as it relates to take rate. But our business just got out of the market in Europe; it\u2019s very healthy and our position I feel very good about. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. You may begin. Stephen Ju : Thanks. So Darren, from a unit growth and units sold perspective, rental car days, you just outpaced the growth of your hotel room nights sold but more recently that has slowed. It seems like that should be a less online penetrated center in travel, so the growth rate should be higher as a result. So, can you help us reconcile what may be going on; is the supply a lot more constrained or is online penetration a lot higher than we think? Thanks. Darren Huston : I don\u2019t think I would take either one of those conclusions because in both cases, even though I believe we\u2019re likely the leaders in rental car bookings in the world online among independent parties and certainly the same on hotel room nights, in neither one are we such a big player that it reflects either one market maturing fast than the other; it\u2019s largely our own execution. I am actually really proud of acceleration we\u2019re now seeing in rental cars, in particular our rentalcars.com business as we\u2019ve talked about before, used to be a very opaque model; and last summer we went to a transition to make it much more retail. So adding reviews, adding brands and that was a lot of work but we feel really good how we\u2019ve come out of that transition and really improved their direct business, their loyalty. Much of more let\u2019s call it a Booking.com approach to rental cars. And we\u2019re quite excited about the momentum. But I don\u2019t think the market specifically, neither one of them we\u2019re reaching any kind of feeling on potential and really how fast and how hard can we execute to get to the ultimate potential of the business. Daniel Finnegan : And just one other point I\u2019ll add Stephen. Our retail unit growth for rental car days is much healthier than the consolidated growth rate that we quote. So Name Your Own Price rental cars are down year-over-year because of lack of availability of discounted prices. So, the growth rate for retail is more similar to what you\u2019re seeing with the hotel business. Operator : Our next question is from Eric Sheridan with UBS. You may begin. Eric Sheridan : Maybe one big picture topic for Darren. Given your continued comments around marketing deleverage, and appreciated the color on direct versus paid, how do you think longer term that directed more your business, the direct channel versus the variable channel? And how much to accomplish that and how might mobile, might get into that as evolve over the next couple of years? Darren Huston : The very highest level, our businesses becoming more direct and that\u2019s also allowing us to lean into pay channels more. But we like as the combination of online marketing as well as our offline marketing is helping to build or brands. And we always judge things on the basis of positive ROI in the transaction. So, if I can get positive ROI in a transaction and there is enough opportunity to do that, we\u2019re going to lean into it. It\u2019s like fishing, here we are going to fish and then you actually have no work with the customer to make them loyal over the long term. So that rhythm in our entire business is working very well. Obviously the more direct business you have at some point as an end game where you are completely direct but open, that obviously dramatically improve the marketing economics. But we\u2019re not as that high and we\u2019re still, very much having to search out more and more customers to bring on to the platform. So that\u2019s one area. I don\u2019t Dan if you want to make comment as well on marketing. Daniel Finnegan : No I\u2019d say the same thing. It\u2019s likely that some business forever will come to us through paid channels. So many people use Google as their entry point to the internet. And Meta-search with search players and TripAdvisor just having very strong brands to that some customers buy will always prefer to start there. So we like the trends that we see in terms of people continuing to increasingly come to us directly. Darren Huston : Then your second part of your question was on mobile. Obviously there is a lot of talk, if you get somebody on a mobile app that in theory is the panacea because then their entry point to the Internet is always through you. And it\u2019s a very vital customer but to get people on your mobile itself is marketing spend. But also there is a large chunk of business that still has to pursue mobile web. And we\u2019re big partner of particularly Google but other search engines and meta engines. And I feel really good about how our mobile web product performs. So, I don\u2019t think there is a place specifically in our business. We\u2019re not a high frequency thing like Facebook or Twitter. So, our business is never going end up being 100% app and it\u2019s always going to be a nice balance between web and app. I should say, and a of couple exceptions to that in the portfolio; OpenTable is very heavy app because of the nature of our restaurant reservation. Actually KAYAK is very heavy app because people are always checking flight schedules. There is much more frequent occurrence than actually going out and booking a hotel room or renting a rental car. And that\u2019s why mobile web by the way performs a lot like desktop web. It\u2019s a different product you\u2019re buying but you\u2019re holding it to similar ROI standards and spending as well. Operator : Our next question is from Naved Khan of Cantor Fitzgerald. You may begin. Naved Khan : Can you talk a little bit about the vacation rentals business and how meaningful of the competitors is it to the acceleration in room nights. Darren Huston : So, we\u2019re really -- I\u2019m very happy with the progress there. As I mentioned, we\u2019re now over 275,000 properties. I always like to remind people, the way we count properties, I would count an aparthotel as a property or a block of apartments. We actually have over 1 million rentable units. So, we actually have a very competitive supply relative to others in the market. Our vacation rental business, we don\u2019t have a number to announce; we talked about it; maybe each year we\u2019ll talk about that. But I will say it\u2019s growing faster than our core business. It is a product that\u2019s very demanded by our customer base. And we feel like our tools and our various rhythms are getting better and better at ingesting this kind of stock. We have a lot of innovations now we\u2019re working on to get to the single owner, single property market which is a whole new market that we haven\u2019t as to-date been addressing as well. Most of our vacation rental homes are through property management companies but there\u2019s a large take in the market where the homeowner actually manages their home. So really excited about it; our customers seem to want the product, which obviously is important and to balance out the supply and the demand side. And we\u2019re going to continue to push there and innovate in the coming months and quarters. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray. You may begin. Mike Olson : You mentioned Priceline brand domestically is facing some headwinds right now, especially in the opaque business, which makes sense. But you have some new management of that brand to try to revitalize growth. So, can you talk more specifically about how the Booking.com brand is doing in U.S. and how the initiative to grow that brand domestically is, may be comparing to your expectations at this point? Darren Huston : So we don\u2019t release specific numbers but generally speaking, if you dig around and you ask the average U.S. hotel, they would generally say we\u2019re the fastest growing of the players; we\u2019re growing off of a smaller base. We\u2019re trying all sorts of things in the U.S. For us, it\u2019s a big growth market because we\u2019re just starting, we under index in the U.S. And it seems it takes time and the market is also sticking with the American customer base. So, we\u2019re excited. It\u2019s a super high priority on my list. The Booking.com model works particularly well in really small countries that don\u2019t speak English and people who move around countries. And for us, we generally under-index in really large countries where people don\u2019t leave the country. And that\u2019s where our growth, one of the angles of our growth potential is. So that\u2019s why we focus so hard on China, Japan, United States, even Germany to really work on getting that domestic booker base as well. And so far so good but like everything in this business, it\u2019s a lot of hard work and a lot of small steps. And we continue to invest and push forward in the U.S. market. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Douglas Anmuth with JP Morgan. You may begin. Doug Anmuth : Dan, can you talk a little bit more about the spending and the profit guidance for 2Q? And you obviously pointed out the lower ROI for advertising as you have for several years now. But is there a difference in the marketing strategy in this 2Q versus in the past and how do we think about how much impact here is coming from OpenTable and Booking Suite spend? And I know of course you are not guiding for the rest of the year but can you just comment on how you are thinking about that more in the back half? Thanks. Daniel Finnegan : So spending for Q2 starting off with other OpEx non-advertising, you get a sense from what you see in Q1 for what you can expect in Q2 and then pressure should subside as we move beyond that; we lap the OpenTable acquisition. In terms of advertising, no change in our approach; I actually said that in the prepared remarks. So we have been very consistent all the way through. One thing that is different in this quarter is that there is more of ramp in offline spend. So some markets that we\u2019ve introduced recently, France for 1; Germany which we launched in the back half of last year is in our spending in Q2 this year against no spend last year, and we will be looking to roll out into additional markets as well which you will do see as we proceed through the quarter. So that\u2019s having more pressure on Q2 margins than it did on Q1. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank. You may begin. Ross Sandler : Just two questions; one, sticking with the marketing. On the offline campaign, can you talk about the impact that this is having on the overall business; I guess how many countries you are in right now? And are you seeing any improved efficacy with your online in the countries where you had the TV going for some period of time? And then the second question is around the newer hotel software business, boutique plus the other pieces. So, can you just talk about the strategy around this area; is the goal to improve the transaction side of the business or could this get built up to be a meaningful standalone business within the Group? Thanks. Darren Huston : First of all on the offline, again it\u2019s just a Booking.com statement. The markets we\u2019re in now are U.S., Canada Australia, the UK, Germany and France. And the way we think about it is obviously we have a lot of micro data. So, we are trying everything we can to measure the effect of this on running an and out on this channel versus that channel and we\u2019ve built a great team that can optimize the way we spend our advertising relative to the bookings we get from that advertising. But then when you go to the macro level, the goal is to hit in a return on advertising standard that adds both our online spend and our offline spend. And of course what you want to do is have a higher return on that total spend after you begin spending offline than you did when you only spent online. So, you always get a combination of more and more your business coming direct but also an improvement in your online spend because people might click on your ad because they saw you on television when they might not have clicked on you ad because they are like, who are these guys. And we\u2019ve been measuring that. It usually takes some months to figure out that you\u2019re into a positive ROA territory. And with almost every market so far we\u2019ve proven that we can get to positive ROA, maybe not always in 12 months but we can ultimately get to positive ROA and that\u2019s what encourages us. It doesn\u2019t mean we can spend offline today and tomorrow our ROA is higher than it was before because that doesn\u2019t happen that fast. So, that\u2019s the big challenge with offline marketing. But more or less, we know have enough experience to know that that metric is getting where we want to do it and that\u2019s why we continue to lean in the market. And ultimately the ROA improves because of the clicking but again we\u2019re getting more and more direct business. Booking Suite, so the play there is two sides, one is building a SaaS business. This is a software business and we think because we already have a sales force in place which is the toughest thing in the SaaS business, the distribution that\u2019s where all the costs go. But we have a sales force in place, so we can have specialists sit on our sales force and we can go and talk to many, many hotels everywhere in the world and have a set of specialists help with that. But we also already have a lot of the hotel content; we have the availability; we have a booking engine, so we can build a hotel site very fast with almost no variable costs. And that\u2019s why the Booking Suite product is basically free, the base product. And then we earned money off the transaction. And we\u2019ve done all of our modeling that will be a good material business for the Group. I don\u2019t see it likely ever being bigger than our core transaction booking business but it\u2019s a sizable business on us own. The other side of the reason of doing Booking Suite is helping our partners become more capable with technology. And the more capable they are with technology and keeping their calendars up-to-date and keeping their pricing right, the more able they are to plug in to our platform. And a third thing that is really a third is that we can do all of this and save our partners\u2019 money and they can trust us more as a company that we do more than just building transaction, we actually make it easier to run a property. That\u2019s another benefit. So it\u2019s really three-fold but we\u2019re not just doing this to be nice; it\u2019s a real business. And we expect in let\u2019s call it, the medium to longer term to have a pretty substantial impact on our overall business. Operator : Our next question comes from Ron Josey of JMP Securities. You may begin. Ron Josey : I wanted to ask on the price parity clauses; I think agreement this quarter with the EU feels like hotels now some of more control on inventory availability while acquiring the same price. I\u2019m just wondering what\u2019s changed and what the potential impact could be. And then a quick follow on just Ross\u2019s question around Booking Suite. I know you said it launched this quarter and a medium long term could be bigger. But where are you in sort of -- it launched but what does that mean; is the sales force telling it, that\u2019d be helpful. Thank you. Darren Huston : So first on the parity clause, we\u2019re pleased with the outcome; we wouldn\u2019t propose it otherwise. For us, party is not a construct of the online industry; it\u2019s actually the whole travel industry, like if you have to go to a site that sold a delta airline ticket and it will be always $10 more, it\u2019s hard to be in business. Apple has the same thing. If you go by a Mac at an apple store and then you go to a third-party distributor, it is $10 more; there won\u2019t be any third-party distributors. So parity is a very important construct that levels the playing field and allows us to really reach our primarily objective. Our primary objective is to always make sure that our customers get the best price, like we can\u2019t be in businesses if our customers feel like they\u2019re paying more using any of our assets. So, we worked through this comprise. I think it was well understood by the authorities that there is a free riding problem. In a business like ours, if our suppliers who basically load the prices on our system can load higher prices on our system and lower prices on their system. But more importantly, regardless of whether there is parity or not, if a hotel is on our system and the prices are too higher, it won\u2019t convert. And if doesn\u2019t convert, then it won\u2019t show up because there is ranking mechanism anyway. They always make sure that the best product moves to the top. And our best partners have the best products of a very strong incentive to give our customers good value because our customers won\u2019t buy things that aren\u2019t good value. So, there is already a really strong reinforcing element. I don\u2019t see this as having any significant impact on our business. But it\u2019s a moving target. There is always new discussions and things but the way that our business runs and the reason customers use our product, they want to have confidence that we\u2019re getting the best pricing. And this agreement doesn\u2019t at all affect our rights or ability to make sure that they get the best price and that\u2019s what\u2019s important. And then on the booking suite topic, we don\u2019t release right now how many sites we\u2019re putting out maybe in a few quarters; we\u2019ll give everyone an insight into that. But it\u2019s off to a very strong start. So, it\u2019s promising; the team in Seattle which was boutique is our back end team and we now have sales people out in the field; they\u2019re really a second tier sales force. They are not in every office but they are there when a warm lead happens, it\u2019s get handed off to somebody who really knows the depth of what they\u2019re talking about. We\u2019re in the bigger countries but in the smaller countries, we\u2019re just getting to that. Our teams are just getting trained up on that. So, it\u2019s sort of a rolling motion but early signs are very positive and the demand for the product is extremely strong which is a good feeling because it shows our partners trust us and they recognize that the value proposition is really outstanding for people who have a website in the accommodation arena. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. You may begin. Heath Terry : Darren, I was hoping you could kind of give us a bit of an update on how your thinking has evolved about the lifetime value of mobile app customers. I know in the conversation, in the questions you\u2019ve answered before, you\u2019ve generally talked about CPA as the primary value that you are driving towards, driving your ROI towards. Wondering if -- as you\u2019ve learned more about the way mobile customers act on apps and have better understanding of sort of cross platform attribution, if the way that you are thinking about mobile app acquisition or customer acquisition relative to that LTV has changed? Darren Huston : What we find is at least in our business and this is now more a Booking.com, Agoda rental car statement. I\u2019ll put aside Kayak and OpenTable because of the aforementioned that they are primarily on app and they get sort of a really high repeat frequency type customer which is a different set of behaviors. But in our business, our most loyal customers, it\u2019s a bit of a circular arc because our most loyal customers are one that carry the approximately. And our most loyal customers are the ones that bounce overall the screens. So, the app for them is not just the booking experience, it\u2019s the thing that they carry their reservation in. We now have travel guide, so the travel guide is in the app. When they check into a hotel, immediately it says, are you happy or sad? So, all of these things come with the app and help our most loyal customers that are often who have booked with this already many times, continue to repeat with us. So, it would be a stretch to say that everyone that uses the app is a more loyal customer because the input to that generally is the more loyal. But we do find generally now going away from app and talking about mobile more generally, the move, the biggest thing that\u2019s changing our business is the move from a single screen world where you only get one thing with us which was make a booking to a multi-screen world where you have an end-to-end experience from looking to booking to enjoying your trip on the ground is giving us more and more loyalty. The people realize there\u2019s a lot of reasons to use our products but when it can actually make the whole experience better, people see it, well this is just a better way to do things. And it\u2019s hard to make that multi-screen experience all tied together and we are certainly not complete with that work but it\u2019s a huge differentiator. And for a big player like us, we have the assets and the resources to invest to make that seamless and for you to be able to do that anywhere you travel in the world. This isn\u2019t easy work by the way because all of these softwares naturally speak with one another and you\u2019ve got to get the right base architecture where you account can sit in the cloud. And then no matter if you are on the app with the Booking Now or you\u2019re on Apple Watch or you\u2019re on the website that you account immediately gets tied together. But that\u2019s work the team has done and I think does reward the bigger players who can really plum that new sort of end-to-end multi-screen digital experience for our customers. So, I am excited. For ecommerce players, mobile is a real positive. When you are in the media business mobile has this extra trade off that it\u2019s harder to convert something through media on a smaller screen and that\u2019s obviously you\u2019re seeing that trade-off between those who own the transaction and those who don\u2019t. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Kevin Kopelman with Cowen & Company. You may begin. Kevin Kopelman : Could you talk broadly about how you are thinking about margins in the vacation rental business compared to hotel booking, and is there any difference in how you approach ROA, that business? Thanks. Darren Huston : First of all, you start with hotels and then below hotels there is a whole collection of things that you could call self-catered products. So first just commenting on B and Bs [ph] and apartments and things like that, we see that the commission levels and the take rates in that space are equivalent to the hotel space. We don\u2019t feel any extra pressure. Again that\u2019s all with the lens that we have a very low bar as it is around the world compared to most of our competition but we don\u2019t feel pressure to go lower. When you get into the single vacation home space, we still have generally signed up without having to dilute our take rate much. We have a little bit more pressure there because the average vacation home owner, it\u2019s a marketplace with a lot of friction and a lot of uncertainty. We\u2019re the first and only transaction engine that works that\u2019s instantly verifiable. So, our property has actually the calendar that works. There\u2019s no back and forth with the consumer like once the consumer buys then they have to pay. So, there is a lot of work still yet to be done. And a lot of these players are used to marketing themselves through a classified ad or on an Internet website and they are expecting phone calls or may be some of them might be on air B and B, [ph] and there\u2019s just different economics in that that I would say that the story is still out in the vacation home market but least to-date been able to approach in a similar way. The other argument on vacation homes is the length of stay is lot longer. The ADR is potentially higher and therefore they would argue that the take rate percentage should be lower but the absolute take rate is actually very healthy relative to the booking. Sorry, long answer to the question, I don\u2019t feel lot of pressure but in the vacation home single owner market, we of course will compete as aggressively as we need to and be smart about the economics. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. You may begin. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my questions, I\u2019ve have two. The first one is just go back to the gross profit guidance in 2Q and what you saw in the quarter. It looks like constant gross profit per room night, if I back out OpenTable was it about 1% year-on-year versus 4% last year. Is that deal mix from Agoda or there is something else going on that we should make sure we consider in our 2Q modeling? And then a higher level one did you talk about strategies to drive more direct business, any thoughts about offering a broader loyalty program for booking.com or how you think about loyalty programming at this point? Darren Huston : Dan, why don\u2019t you take the first, I will take the second. Daniel Finnegan : So Brian, gross profit relative to room nights; room nights are on an as booked basis and the gross profit is on a stay basis. So, you\u2019ve got a little bit of mismatch there. We had a strong quarter with accelerating growth. And to not insignificant degree those checkouts are going to occur in Q2 around the Easter and Q3 around summer. And the other factor is as I mentioned before OpenTable has a more dramatic inorganic benefit to Q1 because of the travel businesses are just seasonally smaller in that quarter. And so that\u2019s gross profit that\u2019s in our numbers with no room nights associated with it. Darren Huston : Brian, on loyalty programs generally, so we do have a couple in the group. Agoda has a loyalty program although we\u2019re slowly phasing that out. OpenTable has a point loyalty program. This is in the more traditional earn points earn nights, get things free. Booking.com specifically, we believe that kind of mechanism for the really infrequent traveler can be as much of a turn off as a turn on because they may only do two bookings a year, but they may be one to do one booking and they maybe do it quite frequently. And for them they want is just a great experience. So, we focus to drive loyalty; we focus very much on the product and getting them amazing pricing. When you go to a destination, it\u2019s not about what this hotel costs, it\u2019s about what is the selection and assortment allow me to buy and our users love the fact that they can find that place that directly matches what they need at a great value and that\u2019s what\u2019s driven our loyalty over time has really been product experience. That said Brian, I can tell you haven\u2019t booked five times on bookings, because if you do within a year, we have a program called genius that we offer more of a surprise and delight fashion to our most frequent guests. And that allows an access to other close user group rates that are supplied by our hotel partners. Our hotel partners are really interested on more frequent guests; it improves their conversion and therefore improves their placement on our front-end to all customers and that\u2019s something we\u2019ve had in the market now going on a couple of years and it\u2019s been really successful. So that\u2019s been our approach to-date. It\u2019s not that we won\u2019t change that or always questioning these things. Rocketmiles we bought is a really interesting small company in Chicago that\u2019s uses airline miles. That\u2019s more we\u2019re interesting because it\u2019s a real fast growing very unique business but we\u2019re obviously now brining in some people with some deep expertise within Rocketmiles; many of them came from the airline frequent flyer miles business and we\u2019ll see if we learn anything from that that might impact our thinking differently in the future. Daniel Finnegan : And Brian, one follow-up to your first question which is what you might have been getting at. No substantial change in our take rates in Q1 or Q2 forecast. Operator : Our last question will be from Manish Hemrajani with Oppenheimer. You may begin. Manish Hemrajani : As we look at room night growth up 25% year-over-year, how much of that growth is being driven by new properties, let\u2019s say a property that has been on the platform for less than a year? And how much of the growth is being driven by all the properties? Darren Huston : We don\u2019t divulge that specifically but it\u2019s a higher level; I shared this before. If you were a property on Booking.com five years ago, on average every year we\u2019ve given you more booking. So, if you are a brand new property, you come on; and that\u2019s always been our goal is to have enough demand so that all of our existing properties don\u2019t feel like we\u2019re taking business away from them but they can continue to get more and we can also feed our new properties. When you look at our property growth that 40% we talked about, the properties are getting smaller and smaller on average, not that we aren\u2019t finding big hotels, big resorts but on average that\u2019s getting smaller. So, our unit growth in terms of bookable properties is not growing at the pace of our business which therefore allows us to continue to keep our property partners happy is the way to think about it. Manish Hemrajani : And then, can you comment on the recent consolidation of the space and what should we expected response to this, especially in markets where you\u2019re under indexed versus the global travel market share? Darren Huston : As I said on the last call, we think the consolidation clarifies competition; it\u2019s not the strategy we\u2019re following. And we continue to stay focused on what we\u2019re good at. And even if the three players are now one player, we have the same strategy in United States we\u2019ve always had, hasn\u2019t changed our product; it hasn\u2019t changed our value proposition and we continue to push forward and I would say quite successfully. And by the way I say that not saying the other strategy is bad, it\u2019s just different than what we\u2019ve been doing. And the space that we occupy is very large and this has been said many times but it\u2019s either a $1 trillion or $1.3 trillion, even if you add our largest competitor with us, we still make up less than 10% of the opportunity. So, it\u2019s not like we\u2019re running against one another every day, it\u2019s more our segment of the business which is online travel, largely independent travelers, people leveraging Internet is as a nice tailwind behind it and we\u2019re making sure that we do our best to capture as much about it as possible. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer. I would now like to turn the call back over to Darren Huston for closing remarks. Darren Huston : Thank you for all joining us. I know a lot of our employees and others are joining this call as well, I want to thank everyone for a lot of super hard work in Q1 and we\u2019re looking forward to a really strong Q2. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful day.",

And now, I\u2019d like to introduce The Priceline Group\u2019s speakers for this afternoon, Darren Huston and Daniel Finnegan. Go ahead, gentlemen. Darren Huston : Okay. Thank you very much and welcome to The Priceline Group second quarter conference call. Thank you for joining us before the markets open this morning in New York. I\u2019m here in Amsterdam with Priceline Group CFO, Dan Finnegan The group reported consolidated gross bookings for the second quarter of approximately $15 billion, up about 26% on a constant currency basis or about 11% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. Our customers booked accommodation reservations for 113 million room nights in the quarter, up 26% year-over-year reflecting slight acceleration for the second consecutive quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $12.45, down slightly versus prior-year, surpassing FactSet consensus estimates of $11.85 per share, and our guidance for the quarter. Our U.S. dollar denominated growth rates were again impacted substantially by the strong dollar. Our international business recorded 30% gross bookings growth on a constant-currency basis, up from 29% last quarter. Booking.com continues to benefit from further penetration of its existing partner relationships, as well as growth in its accommodation supply. Booking.com\u2019s platform now has about 707,000 hotels and other accommodations in 220 countries and territories, up 35% over last year, including 313,000 instantly bookable vacation rental properties. Vacation rental properties grew 62% year-over-year and now represent 1.7 million rentable units within these properties. In the last 12 months, about 50 million room nights for vacation rental properties were booked on Booking.com and Villas.com, up 39% year-over-year. This quarter, we began experimenting with self-onboarding of individually owned vacation rental properties, subject of course to a set of quality checks on our side and the ability of the property to be instantly bookable. We already have an encouraging pipeline of vacation rental properties to activate via this channel. We\u2019re hopeful this functionality will help us scale our property acquisition even further. BookingSuite, our partner-facing software services platform is off to an impressive start and continues to exceed our expectation, with strong demand and streamlined execution by our teams. We also added to our BookingSuite offering in Q2 with the acquisition of PriceMatch, a simple cloud-based tool that uses big data to help our partners improve their properties\u2019 production through enhanced revenue management. International results also benefited from agoda.com and rentalcars.com. Agoda delivered a solid quarter, consistent with Q1, with special attention to the collection of private sale deals for its logged-in customers. Strong momentum continued at rentalcars.com, which accelerated for the fourth quarter in a row, furthering its lead as the world\u2019s largest dedicated site for multi-supplier rental car reservations. Priceline.com continues to be a tale of two cities with strong retail performance offset by a shrinking but still large Name Your Own Price business. The priceline.com management team is making targeted investments as part of its plan to drive innovation into its business and to solidify its position as the best site for travel deals in North America. There\u2019s a new level of energy at the company and we expect great things in the coming quarters. KAYAK delivered an exceptional bottom-line performance in the quarter, which exceeded our expectations, while OpenTable continue to produce double-digit domestic diner growth. After some amount of work to transition its underlying B2B and B2C infrastructure, it\u2019s on track to begin launching new international markets later this year. We took some steps in the quarter to further expand our growth in Latin America. Booking.com launched a TV advertising campaign in Brazil while the group invested $60 million in a minority stake in Hotel Urbano, one of Brazil\u2019s largest and fastest-growing online travel companies. Our investment includes an exclusive commercial partnership whereby we will provide Hotel Urbano customers access to accommodations outside of Latin America. Finally and importantly, it is worth commenting on mobile. It is difficult to overstate the importance of this trend. Today as a group, about one of three bookings of hotels, rental cars and restaurants happens on a mobile device. At current run rate, this will be more than half of our business in only two to three years. On a Sunday just a week back, we completed 300,000 transactions gross of cancellations on mobile at Booking.com for the first time. All of our brands are investing heavily in making our products relevant to consumers across all their screens in a connected fashion and in ways that are industry-leading. Since the end of Q1, we repurchased about $1.35 billion of our common stock and have an authorization of $1.4 billion remaining for future quarters. The group performed well in the second quarter on both the top and bottom lines. We\u2019ll continue Booking.com\u2019s successful foray into brand advertising in certain international markets and invest aggressively in online variable channels to properly build our book of business for the seasonally strong third quarter. We remain committed to striking the right balance between top-line growth and bottom-line profitability, and you will see in particular more stability in non-advertising OpEx percentage in the second half as we anniversary the OpenTable and BookingSuite investment. We believe we are making the smart and sustainable investments today that will extend our lead as the world\u2019s largest online travel business for years to come. We\u2019re also delivering healthy returns for our shareholders today. I want to thank our employees around the world for their hard work and dedication. I will now turn it over to Dan for a more detailed summary of our financials. Daniel Finnegan : Thanks, Darren. I\u2019ll discuss some of the highlights and operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the third quarter of 2015. We\u2019ve talked the last couple of quarters about how significantly our U.S. dollar reported results are impacted by extreme currency volatility, because about 90% of our gross bookings and operating income are generated by our international brands. Our two most impactful currencies, the euro and the British pound were weaker by about 19% and 9% respectively for Q2 as compared to the prior year. Many other important currencies in which we transact were also significantly weaker versus the U.S. dollar in Q2 relative to last year. The strong U.S. dollar means our gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income mathematically translate into significantly fewer dollars than they would have at least year\u2019s exchange rates for Q2, Q3 and the remainder of the year. Since our expenses are denominated in foreign currencies on a basis similar to our revenues, they also translate into fewer dollars. Therefore, our operating margins are not significantly impacted by currency fluctuations and we believe that the impact of currency on our bottom line is generally similar to the top-line impact. Although the stronger dollar has a significant negative impact on our growth expressed in dollars, the fundamental performance of our business is still evident in our unit growth rates, and our constant currency growth rates for gross bookings, international gross bookings, and gross profit. The Priceline Group performed well for all these key metrics in Q2. Accelerating unit growth paired with less margin pressure than forecasted resulted in over performance compared to consensus at both the top and bottom line. Room night growth was strong in Q2 across all our key regions. Room nights booked grew by 26% in the second quarter, accelerating slightly compared to the 25% growth rate for Q1. Rental car days grew by 20% in Q2, also accelerating compared to Q1 growth of 18%. Average daily rates for accommodations or ADRs for Q2 2015 were up on a constant-currency basis by about 2% for the consolidated group. ADR trends expressed in U.S. dollars would obviously look significantly worse based upon the currency dynamics I just discussed. While we\u2019re in the midst of this period of extreme currency volatility, our growth expressed in constant-currency gives a truer picture of our fundamental business performance and is more in line with what you would expect based upon our strong unit growth and constant currency ADR growth. Specifically, our Q2 gross bookings grew by about 26% on a constant-currency basis, but by only about 11% expressed in U.S. dollars compared to prior year due to the stronger dollar. Similarly, international gross bookings grew by about 30% on a constant-currency basis and by only about 12% expressed in U.S. dollars. Gross bookings for our U.S. business grew by 1%. Similar to recent quarters, the U.S. results are a mix of growth in retail room nights and rental car days offset by declines in Name Your Own Price services. In addition, lower airfares impacted retail air gross bookings growth, but have no impact on gross profit. Gross profit for the quarter was $2.1 billion and grew by about 26% on a constant-currency basis and by 11% in U.S. dollars compared to prior year. Our international operations generated gross profit of $1.8 billion, which grew by about 26% on constant-currency basis and by 8% in U.S. dollars compared to prior year. Gross profit for our U.S. operations, including OpenTable U.S. business amounted to $303 million, which represented 32% growth versus prior year. OpenTable generated worldwide revenue in Q2 of about $62 million. Non-GAAP operating income amounted to 37.3% of gross profit for Q2 which is 469 bps lower than last year. Online advertising grew faster than gross profit due to lower ROIs and gross bookings acceleration that partly benefits revenue in Q3 when summer travel takes place. In addition, as we\u2019ve highlighted over recent quarters, we are investing in OpEx to add people, offices and IT capacity to build up the capability of our core travel business to handle future growth. Q2 also reflects the leverage from the inclusion of OpEx for OpenTable and our BookingSuite of hotel marketing services, which are currently in investment mode as we invest to plant seeds for future growth. Operating margins were, however, better than our guidance due mainly to lower than forecasted non-advertising OpEx. Adjusted EBITDA for Q2 amounted to $805 million, which exceeded the top end of our guidance range of $765 million and represents a 1% decrease versus prior year, reflecting the significant foreign currency translation impact with the stronger U.S. dollar. Non-GAAP net income decreased by 2% and non-GAAP EPS decreased by 1%, including interest expense from our recent bond offerings and the beneficial impact of lower share count from stock repurchases. In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $702 million of cash from operations during second quarter 2015, which is about 2% above last year and is also impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange rate translation. We invested $53 million in CapEx and repurchased 720,000 shares of our common stock for $849 million in Q2. Thus far in Q3, we have purchased an additional 436,000 shares for $500 million. We expect to execute the remaining $1.4 billion of our $3 billion common stock buyback authorization at a pace that makes sense based upon the price at which our stock is trading, available cash in the U.S. and potential uses for - other uses for such capital. Our cash and investments amounted to $9.6 billion at June 30, 2015 with about $1.9 billion of that balance in the U.S. During Q2, we entered into a new $2 billion revolving credit facility to replace our existing facility, which was expiring next year. The facility has a five-year term and provides us with significant additional financial flexibility at a reasonable cost. Now for Q3 guidance. The travel market continues to be fundamentally healthy from an occupancy and ADR perspective broadly and in Europe. Our room night growth has been remarkably resilient, ranging between 24% to 27% over the last four quarters. Our guidance reflects another strong quarter of growth, but assumes that our growth rates will decelerate, mainly due to the size of our business and consistent with long-term trends. Our Q3 forecast assumes foreign exchange rates of $1.09 per euro and $1.56 per British pound for the remainder of the quarter, which would result in average exchange rates that would be weaker by about 18% for the euro and about 7% for the British pound as compared to the prior year. I highlight that the euro exchange rate is worse than the $1.12 rate that prevailed when we last reported and most analysts updated their forecasts. As a result, our gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income will mathematically translate into significantly fewer dollars than they would have at last year\u2019s exchange rates for Q3 and the remainder of the year. Barring further deterioration in exchange rates we believe that year-over-year currency comps will become less challenging after Q3. For Q3 guidance, we are forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 13% to 20% on a constant currency basis and by minus 1% to positive 6% in U.S. dollars, with U.S. gross bookings about flat with prior year. We expect international gross bookings to grow by 16% to 23% on a constant currency basis and by 0% to 7% in U.S. dollars. Our Q3 forecast assumes that constant currency ADRs for the consolidated group will be up by less than 2% compared to the prior-year period. We expect Q3 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 1% to 8%. We expect gross profit to grow by 19% to 26% on a constant-currency basis and by 3% to 10% in U.S. dollars. We expect that declines in our Name Your Own Price services will continue to negatively impact revenue growth rates in Q3. We expect about 160 bps of deleverage in non-GAAP operating margins compared to prior year, expressed as non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of gross profit, which is a nice improvement from the margin pressure we\u2019ve seen the last couple of quarters. The de-leverage is mainly attributable to assumed continued pressure for online advertising ROIs but to a lesser extent than we saw in Q2. As we indicated on the last couple of earnings calls, margin pressure from non-advertising OpEx diminishes significantly in Q3 and we expect that trend to improve further in Q4. Over the longer term we expect that our non-advertising OpEx will generally grow more slowly than our gross profit and be a source of operating leverage. Our forecast implies a 52% operating margin for Q3 with strong operating margins for our business relative to our competitors\u2019 positions us well to succeed over the long-term in a very competitive market. Our adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $1.425 billion and $1.525 billion, which at the midpoint is an increase of 3% versus prior year. As I mentioned a moment ago, we estimate that the currency impact on EBITDA growth is similar to the impact that we\u2019re forecasting for gross profit. Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately 15%, comprised of international income taxes and alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S. We\u2019re targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $22.95 to $24.45 per share, which at the midpoint is an increase of 7% versus prior-year. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 51.6 million shares based upon yesterday\u2019s closing stock price and reflects the beneficial impact of about $1.7 billion of share repurchases we\u2019ve made thus far this year. We forecast GAAP EPS between $20.84 and $22.34 per share for Q3. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed in our earnings release. Consistent with past practice, we have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our third quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any further fluctuation in the euro and British pound versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter. The hedges do not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue, gross profit or operating income. They also do not hedge us against fluctuations in other currencies and do not hedge our earnings beyond the third quarter. Our forecast does not assume any significant change in macroeconomic conditions. One housekeeping matter. Darren mentioned that Booking.com\u2019s platform now has over 707,000 hotels and other accommodations, including 313,000 vacation rental properties. In September, we intend to adjust our methodology for reporting property counts to include properties that are contracted with Booking.com, but are not currently available to be booked on our site. For example, we will now include properties in our count that are temporarily unavailable on our site because we filled all the rooms allotted to us or the property is closed seasonally or for renovations. Under the new methodology, we would\u2019ve reported about 767,000 properties, including about 353,000 vacation rentals. Our prior year property count on a consistent basis is about 549,000 properties, including about 206,000 vacation rentals. We believe this change will remove volatility from our property count reporting and will reflect a more consistent count of our total active partner relationships throughout the year. This is a small, but important adjustment as we continue to add more and more long tail and sometimes seasonal business. We\u2019ll now take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Eric Sheridan with UBS. You may begin. Eric Sheridan : Thanks for taking the questions. Darren, appreciated the color on mobile and how big it\u2019s becoming inside the business. Wanted to know what you were learning as mobile became bigger in terms of where money is best spent on the marketing budget to earn sufficient ROIs in mobile? How that might develop longer term? And also, Booking.com was mentioned on Facebook\u2019s earnings call as a new partner. You\u2019ve talked about social media in the past and what that might mean as a marketing channel for Priceline. Want to know if we can get some updated thoughts there. Thanks. Darren Huston : Okay. Thanks, Eric. So I think it\u2019s important on mobile to - obviously there\u2019s web-based mobile and there\u2019s app-based mobile. And web-based mobile still largely and traditionally it\u2019s through Google and other search engines, and I have to give Google a lot of credit. That\u2019s working better and better for us, where web-based mobile is a highly converting big base of transactions for us and it ends up - in the hotel space, transactions are relatively infrequent, so a pretty significant percentage happens on web-based, particularly customers we\u2019ve never seen before. Our app-based customers tend to be our more loyal customers and the place that we build those is mostly from our own property sites. We do go out and buy app downloads, although app downloads don\u2019t tend to be very economic because they often get downloaded and then not ultimately used, at least from that space. So this is basically the world of accommodation. It\u2019s very different for KAYAK and OpenTable, primarily because both those businesses are a much higher frequency business. They\u2019re very heavily skewed to app and the whole business of getting people to use the KAYAK app to check for flights or OpenTable to book restaurants is another dynamic, and both of those businesses focus heavier and can find economics and actually getting downloads and building lifetime value to customers that are app-based. In those app based downloads, there\u2019s a little bit of that that comes from Google, but a lot has come from new places like Facebook and other partners. On Facebook specifically, we generate most of our demand from basically search or travel. And travel includes everything from TripAdvisor down to easyJet and airlines and trains and other things. So we\u2019ve always dreamed of a time where we could access demand from any of these big horizontal audiences. Facebook\u2019s obviously one, Twitter\u2019s another. You can think of WeChat over any of these other things - or even the big portals, Yahoo!, MSN, as places. But we\u2019ve always struggled. And I was quite skeptical, but I have to give Facebook a ton of credit. We\u2019re finally getting some good business out of Facebook. Most of it is remarketing or re-messaging. And we\u2019ve now talked with senior management at Facebook about how do we get intent out of their network. And that\u2019s an area that both us and them are focused on. And to the degree to which we can crack the code on intent would make Facebook a real serious source of demand for us as a business. And obviously as a performance marketer, that would be a big deal for Facebook, as well. So I\u2019m excited with the progress we\u2019re making. They\u2019re investing a lot of time and energy into it, which I appreciate. And hopefully by cracking another source of demand, it allows us to also diversify where we spend our money to find hotel customers. Eric Sheridan : Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray. You may begin. Michael Olson : Good morning. So you mentioned strong continued growth in vacation rentals and you\u2019re clearly putting some effort into that space. How would you describe just in general your strategy there and how your partnership with HomeAway fits into that? And overall, what kind of reception are you seeing from travelers on them seeing vacation rental inventory? And has there been any reaction from your hotel partners? Darren Huston : Yeah. Thanks, Mike. Well, first of all, we started out as being a hotel-only site, but it\u2019s been some years now that we\u2019ve built out other forms of multi-room accommodation. And even in our old - in the old Booking.com model, you even said, online hotel reservations was our sub tag. But starting even four years or five years ago, we started adding B&B\u2019s, and we even have tree houses and igloos and stationary boats and basically other things that you could book. So for us, we went from being the world\u2019s largest online hotel player to now being the world\u2019s largest player in online accommodations. So moving into vacation rentals was a very natural thing for us, it\u2019s kind of going down the pyramid and ultimately getting into this self-catered product. And for us, we\u2019re building it out in an instantly bookable verifiable way, which is very different than what say a HomeAway or an Airbnb is doing. We\u2019ve also focused a lot on making sure the customer experience didn\u2019t have all the friction. If you can think of booking a vacation home and having to put down a deposit and having multiple email exchanges and not really knowing you\u2019ve got the property, not really having the trust. We\u2019re doing it in much more of a kind of a pure ecommerce way, just trying to create it ultimately like booking a hotel. And through that strategy, we\u2019ve had to obviously take a lot of friction out of the industry and change the way that players think about that. And it\u2019s a lot of work, because for a vacation rental owner, you\u2019ve got to maintain a digital calendar. You can\u2019t overbook people. When you say the place is available at a certain price, it has to sell at that price. But slowly we\u2019re seeing the ice start to crack a little bit, and starting to see real momentum. And this is great news for vacation rental owners, because this market has a lot of demand. And a lot of people really think of vacation rentals as an upgrade. Like if you\u2019ve got a family or your group and you\u2019re say going to Barcelona, instead of getting like four hotel rooms, you can get a vacation home on the beach and you can make your own meals instead of going out to restaurants every night. So this is a very important addition to our business, but there\u2019s a lot more work to do. We do have some cooperation with HomeAway, but it\u2019s not near to the extent that maybe some of our competitors, and we\u2019re still talking there. We have a fairly high bar. We don\u2019t do on-request bookings. And for us, it has to be truly instant. It can\u2019t be, okay, I\u2019ll let you know in 24 hours. That doesn\u2019t count as instant. And that\u2019s been part of the issues just keeping a very high bar and keeping our product very pure so that it fits with our traditional booker base. And so far so good, and I - and we\u2019re only going to do more of it. It wasn\u2019t really a jump into a segment, it was more of an evolution down the accommodation pyramid into the sort of the bottom of the pyramid. There\u2019s literally millions and millions of single owner property around the world, both in cities, on beaches, at ski resorts, et cetera. So that\u2019s the story there. Michael Olson : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Sena with Evercore ISI. You may begin. Kenneth Sena : Hi. So the bookings in the unit seemed quite strong, but the revenue margin declined 6% or so over the prior - versus the prior year. Maybe you can just elaborate a bit more on that pressure, give us a sense maybe how much of it is related to mix as far as the vacation rental expansion versus maybe some of the competitive factors that you\u2019re seeing. And also, you mentioned that Google is performing better. But any thoughts that you can provide us on kind of the current booking functionality and how you see that progressing? Thanks. Darren Huston : So, I\u2019ll let, Dan. Why don\u2019t you take the first one? I\u2019ll... Daniel Finnegan : Yeah, hey, Ken. So in terms of take rate, what you see in Q2 is an acceleration in the business so very strong gross bookings momentum with a portion of those stays in the revenue taking place in Q3. So if you look at our Q3 forecast, you\u2019ll see kind of a reversal of that trend where now the take rate is going up, so the gross profit growing faster than the gross bookings. So that\u2019s a timing issue. Our take rate - our fundamental take rate on our transactions is very stable. Kenneth Sena : Great. Thank you. Darren Huston : And then your question on Google, specifically on booking functionality. What - did you want to repeat that? Kenneth Sena : Yeah, you mention that Google is performing better and if you could maybe just specify. Is that just in terms of the traditional keyword buys or are you getting more traction in terms of working through like the product listing ads? And do you have any thoughts as they try to rollout booking functionality, if it\u2019s something you\u2019d be interested in or other? Darren Huston : Yeah, yeah, I mean, generally, our relationship with Google is very strong. They have some of their own challenges. I mean, it\u2019s an amazing business, but it\u2019s become less of a percent of our business over time, so we\u2019ve been working with them across our entire business. Of course, always first focus on core search. What are the other things we can do to innovate to get more out of core search and we\u2019ve seen some benefit particularly in mobile web, where we work together to try to get more out of mobile web, and that\u2019s been, I think, very successful. We\u2019re also working with the YouTube team and we\u2019re also doing a lot of work in retargeting. So Google kind of sees us as one of their biggest advertisers in the world, so they are - and we\u2019re very technically performance-driven people, so we work closely together to try to get more out of all the various Google engines. Very specifically, hotel price ads is Google\u2019s price product. We don\u2019t love it because we would rather buy blue links. We don\u2019t need all the extra listings, but we do understand and we have worked a lot with the HPA team to make that a better product. I think, when it started out, there were a lot of savings and thing shown on HPA that just weren\u2019t real savings. Generally, in meta, there\u2019s a lot of challenges with showing customers things that are savings, when a large majority of the time they\u2019re not. It\u2019s exchange rates, people don\u2019t put taxes on, et cetera. It\u2019s a real - it\u2019s not the prettiest space. So, we\u2019ve worked hard with them to improve that product. And then recently, as you mentioned, they\u2019ve launched an instant book product. It\u2019s still very early on. We don\u2019t love instant book products either because we have a really good process of taking cold customers and turning them into paying customers. So anyone who creates a path that ends up becoming a lower common denominator that\u2019s not good for us, because we think we\u2019ve one of the best booking paths. We have an agency model. We don\u2019t even need the credit card in many cases to do bookings, so - but we\u2019re working also with Google on that, not standing away from saying, hey, is there a way to make this work for our businesses as well as what you\u2019re trying to achieve? So it\u2019s always been a close open collaboration, but as I always say, we\u2019re going to put our money where it\u2019s strategic. We\u2019re going to watch this really closely and we have lots of options on where to spend our money. We\u2019d look to continue to create more options to find hotel demand in the future. Kenneth Sena : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Millman with Millman Research. You may begin. Michael Millman : Thank you. The other night, Expedia indicated that the bulk of their profit comes from repeat customers. Can you talk about to what extent profits come from repeat customers? Darren Huston : Yeah, well, yes, we\u2019ve to go across our brands, but we never reveal the exact percentages, but we have a very healthy repeat business. And I would say across all of our brands, every single brand the repeat business every year gets stronger and stronger. A lot of that is related to the new multi-screen environment. A lot of that is related to we did a lot more business with signed-in accounts. In the early days, when it was a single screen, you would do transactional business and every time you booked a hotel or a flight, you\u2019d have to reenter all your information, but once you have an account, we can store your credit card securely, we can store your name and it leads to like one-click booking. And as we\u2019ve gone to more of a multi-screen environment, that advantage for an account holder goes up dramatically. If you\u2019ve ever tried to book an airline ticket on a mobile phone and not have an account, you\u2019ll know what I\u2019m talking about. It\u2019s not a pleasant experience, but once you have an account we can fill out the forms and we can facilitate that, and then you can take your confirmation that maybe you booked on your tablet and you can show up at the rental counter with the confirmation on your phone. These are all positives that have driven to more increased repeat business and loyalty among our customers. Then our challenge becomes really, and has been, how do we bring more customers into the franchise? And that\u2019s what we use paid marketing for. But generally speaking our direct business continues to increase, which is a reflection generally of repeat business. Daniel Finnegan : And with our - with new customers, Michael, we\u2019re running in paid channels at positive ROIs, so they\u2019re profitable, too. I don\u2019t know to what extent maybe other players take a lifetime value approach and perhaps are losing money on the new customers with the hope of making money over time. That\u2019s not the case for us. Michael Millman : Would you say repeat customer profitability is well over 50% of your business profitability? Daniel Finnegan : We wouldn\u2019t comment on that. Michael Millman : Okay. Thank you. Daniel Finnegan : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. You may begin. Mark Mahaney : Thanks. I was going to ask two geographic questions. You called out Latin America a little bit more. Just some more color on how big that - how material that region is for you, maybe a little bit more explanation of the investment in Hotel Urbano? And then any comments on - you didn\u2019t mention the China outbound market. Anything you want to point out as to how well that\u2019s doing with the path to materiality there? Thank you. Darren Huston : Yeah, thanks, Mark. Well, let me give maybe just a little bit of top line geo-commentary. So, first of all, in the second quarter Europe isn\u2019t very strong. The Eurozone in Southern Europe with a little bit of the ripple of the Grexit and the coming back of Greece, but generally Europe has been very solid this year. U.S. is strong for U.S. travelers and China inbound, but generally almost everyone else is going a little less to the U.S. because of the currency effect. And yeah. China outbound continues to be very strong for us, growing at very fast rates. Japan inbound, Taiwan inbound very strong. Korean inbound not so strong because of MERS, not something that gets talked about a lot in the United States, but was a real overhang for us. But then on the other hand we had positive comps. Southeast Asia was a much calmer place in Q2 than it was last Q2, if you remember the Malaysian Air crisis, the coup in Thailand, burning of factories in Vietnam, there were all sorts of things going on. But that\u2019s been a positive from a comp basis. And so that\u2019s some quarterly commentary geographically, but specifically strategically Latin America - we entered Latin America specifically with the Booking.com, ran a number of years ago starting in Argentina, moving to Brazil. I would say this is a year where we\u2019ve really had a breakthrough in Latin America. We launched our TV ads in Brazil, but really despite the fact that Latin America is not in the greatest economic health right now and the two big engines, which are Argentina and most specifically Brazil have all kinds of issues, but this has been a year where we\u2019ve really gotten great traction in the market, maybe past the tipping point. We have offices now across the region and that\u2019s a real positive. And I think if you go to Latin America now our aided brand awareness is quite high. Hotel Urbano specifically, this is actually a site that gets a tremendous amount of traffic, but still is a bit challenged in converting that traffic, but it has a great management team. We\u2019ve always been excited about the volume of audience that they have, largely built through social channels. And you can think of this as kind of a mini Ctrip investment, I mean, we made an investment in the company but it was really also to unlock the commercial opportunity. We\u2019re like, well, if we\u2019re going to help these guys win, let\u2019s participate a little bit in that upside. But the commercial opportunity is - I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a make or break for Latin America, but it\u2019s a good-sized piece of business that will help bring Latin American outbound travelers to the rest of the world. I think, it also is a reflection of the strength of our portfolio. It\u2019s so global that these matchups just make so much sense because the product converts well, it\u2019s a great product, it\u2019s all translated and we can take an audience like this, help Hotel Urbano monetize it, but also create a great commercial opportunity for us as well. Mark Mahaney : Thank you, Darren. Darren Huston : Yep. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. You may begin. Heath Terry : Great. Thanks. Darren, you have talked in the past about your willingness to go down the ROI funnel a little bit further on the advertising side, willingness to take dollars for $0.90 versus requiring $0.70, I think is the way you put it in the past. How much of that willingness is what\u2019s driving the 25% or 26% FX neutral growth that you\u2019re seeing here, clearly well above sort of where the overall market is growing? Darren Huston : Yeah, I should probably be - thanks, Heath. I should probably be clearer, and Dan mentioned this as well. We don\u2019t lose money on the transaction level. So on our paid advertising we have a pretty high bar. We [indiscernible]. Heath Terry : Yeah, no. I understand - I understand that. Yeah. Darren Huston : Yeah, so we don\u2019t really - so we\u2019ll - so I think what you\u2019re saying is we might go down and spend $0.90 to get a dollar, and therefore make $0.10, right? Heath Terry : Right. Darren Huston : And that\u2019s really our push on the paid advertising side. The thing that we go out a little bit on a limb in is our brand marketing. We now know that we can get a pretty good return on our brand marketing, but it may not happen immediately. But we\u2019ve shown that over time in the markets we\u2019ve been in for a while that we can get a better return on our advertising when you add the brand marketing to our performance marketing than the return we got on our performance marketing alone, and we\u2019ve done a bunch to build just a whole bunch of data-driven tools to help us with our media mix, and that\u2019s helped us be smarter and data-driven about where and how we spend our brand marketing dollars. So we\u2019re building over whatever now has been a couple years some more and more confidence in our ability to appropriately spend our brand marketing dollars, which obviously is a big growth potential for the company. Booking.com is not a household name. If you go to America you\u2019d mention OpenTable and Kayak and Priceline before you\u2019d mention Booking. And the ability for us to build the brand and have great performance marketing is still growth potential that\u2019s out ahead of us and we\u2019ve been working hard to methodically attack that. I would say our growth is truly sustainable growth because the paid marketing that we\u2019re spending is earning us profit, and all the direct business we\u2019re coming is earning us of course even more profit. So I don\u2019t feel like, as opposed to some geographies, we have positive unit economics on every single transaction. And we\u2019ve looked to improve that and any incremental that we\u2019re making in marketing generally comes with positive EBITDA. And we\u2019re always trying to get as far as we can to generate positive EBITDA and cash flow for our customers, without worrying about the percentage of our P&L that gets taken up by marketing, and that\u2019s been our general philosophy. Some people may say, well, if you\u2019re that far, why don\u2019t you go a little bit further? And that\u2019s always the balance that we\u2019re striking on what business do we bring in and do we really, truly understand the economics, but always trying to be positive on a transaction by transaction basis. Heath Terry : Got it. Thank you. Darren Huston : Hope that helped. Heath Terry : Yes, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. You may begin. Justin Post : Thank you. Two questions related to marketing. I think you said ROIs are improving in 3Q. Is that a result of all the brand spending? Or are there some technology conversion changes that are helping you? And then secondly, a lot of commentary out there about instant book on TripAdvisor and Google. Any commentary on your exposure to those channels and what your thoughts are, especially with Google maybe taking direct bookings over the next year, how you think about that affecting Priceline? Thank you. Darren Huston : Yes, so thanks, Justin. Dan, why don\u2019t you take the first one? I\u2019ll take the second one. Daniel Finnegan : Yes. Hi, Justin. So just to be clear, ROIs were still down year-over-year, but not to the same extent as they were in Q2. And then just due to the normal seasonality with more checkouts taking place in Q3, we get a benefit there from the economics as well relative to the acceleration that occurred in Q2. We\u2019re not going to go into the drivers specifically for you, what\u2019s happening in the ROIs, because of the sensitive competitive nature, but Darren talked about the benefits. The offline advertising is driving in online. It definitely helps reinforce our brand and make it better known, which helps click-through rates, it helps drive people searching for the brand, and then every day we\u2019ve got hundreds of people that are running experiments to improve conversion on our website. So that\u2019s just a constant battle that our people are very talented and do a great job with. But beyond that, I just don\u2019t want to comment on those specific drivers. Darren Huston : Yes. And then on your question on instant book, yes, it\u2019s a pretty tricky equation. Always the question is, is your advertiser trying to be an OTA, and at the most extreme, being an OTA is really hard work. Like three-quarters of our people are in customer service, they\u2019re in the field, they\u2019re working property by property on pricing and on availability and it\u2019s a business you have to do at scale. And most of our media partners make a lot of money off of us. On TripAdvisor we spend more than $1 million a day. So we have to find a place to spend our money and we of course don\u2019t want to spend it with somebody who\u2019s planning on being an OTA. I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s really what TripAdvisor is trying to do, but we have to make sure that whatever business we participate in is good business and its business that we can ultimately pay for that will repeat on our platform. So that\u2019s why there\u2019s a lot of discussion in this area. There\u2019s not like a big rainbow for anyone that\u2019s in the media business on the other side because they get most of the economics of the transaction anyway. It\u2019s not like suddenly there\u2019s a whole bunch more money there. In fact, all there is, is just a lot more cost. If you have to think of - I can show you my inbox someday and some of the escalations I get of the dirty ocean in Cabo because the person wants a refund or the flying ants and the OTA business sounds very sexy, but in fact there\u2019s a lot of manual work, and that\u2019s why there\u2019s only a few players who do this work and do it at scale. And by the way I\u2019d throw Ctrip in there as well. That\u2019s why they do it so well. They\u2019ve got over 10,000 customer service agents who deal with this kind of stuff every day. So we\u2019re being good partners. We\u2019re leaning in. I frankly think that instant book path ultimately will prove to be cannibalistic. They may help a little bit on mobile, but that\u2019s all to be seen. So we\u2019re trying to be positive partners in the process and try to make sure that if that\u2019s the way our advertising partners are going that we can design a path that is a good auction for us and where we can get good business off of it. Justin Post : Thank you. Darren Huston : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ron Josey with JMP Securities. You may begin. Ron Josey : Great. Thanks. I wanted to follow up on maybe some prior questions around marketing. And Darren, I think you said specifically now, I think a third of traffic is mobile, could see that getting to 50% over time. And as you sort of see the mix between online and offline working together, wanted to understand a little bit more how you think about how brand advertising sort of evolves over time and when you think you can start bringing that back as the brand awareness goes up? Thank you. Darren Huston : Yes, I think it\u2019s an excellent question. When you ultimately do a transaction on mobile, there\u2019s a question of what other screens did the customer engage with you on? How did they get to know the brand? And then there\u2019s an issue, of course, of do you have the force through your brand - by having a stronger brand, do you get more loyal customers who then therefore go more app-based mobile versus web-based mobile. To me at the highest level I think of mobile as a huge positive for a company like ours. For many of our partners it\u2019s tough enough to build a great website. To actually have a multi-screen experience that works with an account is a very difficult thing to do. So that\u2019s why I think net is a positive. I don\u2019t think it necessarily drives a lot of incremental business for us. It\u2019s a little bit maybe more last-minute, but it\u2019s really a shifting in the way that people engage with digital assets. I\u2019m sure marketing mix will change relative to mobile. I talked previously that more and more business is coming direct. It\u2019s a bit of a chicken and egg. Some of that may be because our mobile business tends to be more direct than our PC-based web business. But again, I think it\u2019s all one customer and it\u2019s all related to the fact that people are living multi-screen lifestyles versus single screen lifestyles, which I think is a net benefit to us, and ultimately I think also leads to more direct account driven traffic versus purely off of the web transactional traffic. I guess the last thing I would say, and you certainly see this in China, the impact of mobile and how like Ctrip [ph] buys their demand. We\u2019ve learned so much from that relationship and always appreciate all the time I get with James and Jane, but it\u2019s amazing how they just buy traffic differently. There are whole marketplaces for apps in China exist that don\u2019t exist in the Western world, and how they built that up is quite fascinating and amazing and I think there\u2019s a lot of lessons for us to learn as this environment changes. But yes, today again, as I said before, most of our app downloads are from our own properties, which means we would\u2019ve had to find that guest some other way in the past. So the more and more of them that use apps in a sticky way, obviously that\u2019s great business for us because it\u2019s always coming direct by definition and is very profitable. Ron Josey : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. You may begin. Lloyd Walmsley : Thanks. Last August you guys gave us some disclosure around the trailing 12-month vacation rental bookings. Wondering if you could update that number or maybe whether we should just use the 39% room night growth that you gave on that $4 billion base number. And then I guess as a follow-up, curious if you can just give us some color on how different you see demand for that space? So, for example, are a lot of people coming specifically to look for VR properties from marketing campaigns and keywords driven specifically to VR, or is a lot of that also people kind of looking also at hotels? I\u2019m trying to get a sense for how different that growth trajectory can be without cannibalizing the core. So any color you could give there would be great. Darren Huston : Dan, why don\u2019t you take the first? I\u2019ll take the second. Daniel Finnegan : So, Lloyd, the reason we gave you growth rate and room nights is because of the impact of currency on that metric as well. So it wasn\u2019t useful really to give it to you in U.S. dollars. So I would recommend that you use those two data points we gave you in your model to try and understand the size of that business. Lloyd Walmsley : Okay. Darren Huston : Yes, and in terms of the vacation rentals incremental or not, our general belief is, first of all, it\u2019s one customer. And either a customer is just a consumer or they\u2019re a business person and a consumer. And they take a number of trips every year, and every trip has a different rationale. And if somebody is a hotel booker on three of their trips, they may be on a trip with their family and become a vacation rental booker. We want to be able to provide all of those instances and all of those scenarios through Booking.com, so they become comfortable with that, rather than in the past, they feel if I need a hotel, I go to booking, and if I need a vacation rental, I go to company X, Y or Z. The markets have traditionally been very different because the nature of the markets were very different. But more and more over time, and I think we\u2019re partly shaping that, and I believe that\u2019s ultimately going to be the outcome, the markets get a little bit mixed because a person says, hey, I\u2019m going to Barcelona or I\u2019m going to Rio de Janeiro and I need to find a place to stay. It\u2019s a very common question asked, where am I going to stay. And relative to that scenario, we want to provide them an option. And by having more optionality in that, you can drive incrementality because the person may not find quite the right thing on a site that has a more narrow set of options. But on a broad set of options, maybe they have a certain price range and a certain thing they\u2019re looking for we\u2019ll be able to satisfy that. Or in a market like San Francisco or New York, if ADRs in hotels are really high, maybe a business person ends up in an apartment. Or if you\u2019ve got a big event on like the World Cup or the Olympics where everything gets sold out, having all of this incremental supply offers more beds that people can sleep in. So I think about it if today the market is very different between the vacation rental buyer and a hotel buyer, over time that\u2019ll only coalesce to become a more similar market, because all it is human beings looking for a place to stay. And I think that\u2019s generally the case that we\u2019re seeing on our site. Now certainly vacation rental stays are generally bigger groups, they\u2019re generally longer length of stay, slightly higher ADR, relatively good take rate, there\u2019s all these fundamentals that reflect the market of today. But I do believe that those things will continue to change. And I think just like B&Bs used to be a very different thing than hotels, I think over time accommodations will become more similar than less similar because it\u2019s the same customer. Lloyd Walmsley : Thanks. That\u2019s helpful color. Appreciate it. Darren Huston : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. You may begin. Douglas Anmuth : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Dan, I was hoping you could just provide some more color on the commentary on the non-marketing OpEx in the back half. Is this purely just a function of lapping OpenTable and BookingSuite? Or is there anything else going on there? And then also can you comment on the take rate environment, what you\u2019re seeing particularly in Europe now? Thanks. Daniel Finnegan : Sure, Doug. So in terms of take rates, I mentioned before, our take rates are very stable. If you look at our margin picture in general, the different ways that our margins are impacted, take rate stable, also in terms of revenue we are not aggressively discounting out of our margins, so we\u2019re stable there. In terms of take rate, just with what we believe to be one of the lowest cost distribution alternatives for our accommodation partners, we feel like that\u2019s stable for the long run. And then in terms of advertising, we talked about offline advertising. Over the long run, we should see stable to margin leverage there as we end up spending in the markets we want to spend at the levels we want to spend. We could see pressure from time to time as we enter a new market or we increase our spending in the market, but over the long run we should have leverage there. The online advertising is a big variable. It\u2019s very hard to predict. But the OpEx is much more under our control. And we\u2019ve had a good track record there over many years, so we feel comfortable that over the long term we can have operating leverage in that line item. For Q3 and Q4, it is largely that we\u2019re lapping the acquisition of OpenTable and the acquisitions we\u2019ve made in the Booking Suite area, but as we\u2019ve seen from time to time in the past, we have some lumpiness in the investments that we make in the core business. So in the early part of the year, we typically ramp up our customer service teams, our hotel teams to get ready for peak travel season, and then we see leverage in that line item. Over the long run I think we\u2019ll continue to see leverage there. Douglas Anmuth : Okay. Great. Thanks for the color. Daniel Finnegan : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our last question is from Kevin Kopelman with Cowen & Co. You may begin. Kevin Kopelman : Hi. Thanks a lot. Could you just give us an update on the rate parity landscape in Europe given the changes to your agreements with hoteliers there? Thanks. Darren Huston : Yes, thanks, Kevin. So at the highest level I think for those who follow this, we worked with the competition authorities in France, Sweden and Italy, came to an agreement on what we call a narrow MFN, which basically allows us to keep parity with the hotel\u2019s website and Expedia\u2019s also agreed to that. We\u2019ve had a number of countries come out formally, Austria, Denmark, [ph] saying they agree to us. Many others informally have dropped their cases against us. We\u2019ve got one challenge in France a law that\u2019s come out banning parity, which we weren\u2019t consulted on or anything, but will come into effect. We of course will follow the law. But I think the basic bottom line to understand in this whole discussion, we will never charge our customers more. You can\u2019t say it clearer and we will never charge our customers more. So we will adjust to whatever environment it is and we\u2019ll make sure that we get the best pricing for our customer. And in some case we have so much innovation we could do to make sure our customers don\u2019t get shown prices that are uncompetitive, and I don\u2019t believe the new law in France is good for consumers, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good for the French tourism, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good for small properties in France, I actually think it\u2019s quite negative, but it is what it is and we will adjust our model. And our business in France is really strong, both from a booker standpoint as well as bookings coming into France. So it doesn\u2019t concern me too much other than just a lot of the time invested in this whole area. And I strongly believe - parity was an invention of the hotel industry itself. I strongly believe it\u2019s a good way that all travel should be sold on a basis where customers don\u2019t spend too much time searching and that they decide which channel from an agnostic standpoint that they want to buy through. But we\u2019re more than ready to compete under any set of standards and hope that the narrow MFN will be accepted more broadly across Europe. Kevin Kopelman : Thanks, Darren. Darren Huston : Thank you. Darren Huston : Okay. I guess that\u2019s it. Thank you all for joining our conference call and look forward to speaking to you next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thanks for your participation, and have a wonderful day.",

And now, I'd like to introduce The Priceline Group speakers for this afternoon, Darren Huston and Daniel Finnegan. Go ahead, gentlemen. Darren Richard Huston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, thank you very much, and welcome to The Priceline Group's third quarter conference call. Thank you for joining us before the markets open this morning in New York. I'm here in Norwalk, Connecticut with Priceline's Group CFO, Dan Finnegan. Let me point out that due to technical difficulties at NASDAQ, our press release is only available under the Events & Presentations section of our website, pricelinegroup.com, and should be over the Newswire momentarily. The Group reported consolidated gross bookings for the third quarter of approximately $14.8 billion, up about 22% on a constant currency basis, or about 7% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. Our customers booked accommodation reservations for over 115 million room nights in the quarter, up 22% year-over-year. Gross profit was up 12%, or about 29% on a constant currency basis. EBITDA was also up 12%, to $1.6 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $25.35, surpassing FactSet consensus estimates of $24.21 per share, and our guidance for the quarter. Our U.S. dollar denominated growth rates were again impacted substantially by the strong dollar, and this will continue into Q4 hopefully abating on a year-over-year comparable basis as we head into 2016. Our international business recorded 25% gross bookings growth on a constant-currency basis reflecting strong momentum at Booking.com. Booking.com's performance benefited from further penetration of its existing partner relationships, as well as growth and its accommodation supply. Booking.com's platform now has over 820,000 hotels and other accommodations in 220 countries and territories, up 38% over last year. Today, we are releasing data that shows how these properties represent a combined total of 21 million potentially bookable rooms. Of this number, 14.4 million are within our traditional hotel partners, 1.8 million are vacation rentals, for example, apartments, aparthotels, villas, chalets and other self-catered product, and the remaining 4.8 million are other multi-room unique properties, for instance, B&B's, guest houses, ryokans, riads, et cetera. Hopefully, this gives you a sense of the sheer scale of our accommodation platform, by far the largest directly bookable accommodation selection in the world and provides a better comparison to some of the other players in our space. And all of these different types of rooms are bookable with the least amount of friction on any platform; all without fees to consumers, and all with instant verification. We are also helping guests find and book accommodation on Booking.com at unprecedented levels. Since Booking.com's inception in 1996, we have helped more than 1 billion guests find a place to stay. And in just the last 12 months, 285 million guests stayed with us. Coincidentally, in 2015 OpenTable will also seat its one billionth diner as well. Two industry-leading double-sided marketplace platforms providing scaled experiences for users around the world. Following our successful launch of BookingSuite which continues to gain traction in the B2B arena, we recently introduced another important B2B innovation, Booking.com for Business. This new offering is geared to both the business traveler and the travel organizer. Our tools allow organizers to link travelers to the company account without losing oversight or to book on their behalf. Spending can be managed through budget filters and spending reports. All the company's hotel reservations can be viewed and managed in one place. And best of all, all enrolled Booking.com for business travelers automatically benefit from our rewards program including closed user group discounts and special benefits at over 100,000 select properties worldwide. We were aware that Booking.com had become a popular service for business travelers and we wanted to create an offering that was more tailored to their unique needs. We have high hopes for Booking.com for Business and early results are very encouraging. Booking.com's direct share of business continues to grow reflecting the solid retention of the loyal and satisfied customer base we've accumulated and nurtured over the past decade, as well as the offline advertising we're now conducting in eight major markets around the world. As our direct business grows so too does our investment in online paid channels. We are always looking for new sources of demand and ways to diversify our marketing mix. We invest our money in channels where we believe we can build our brand franchise for the long-term, while also earning an attractive ROI within the transaction. Consistent with these tenets, we agreed to participate in TripAdvisor's Instant Booking platform. Our agreement includes the prominent branding and marketing potential we require to begin participation. As with all of our channels, we'll experiment and optimize with partners at TripAdvisor and expect to achieve healthy ROIs while being given the opportunity bring new customers into our fold for the long-term. We will also work to make adjustments in a similar Instant Booking path we have at KAYAK, and are willing to work with other media owners who adopt similar principles that allow both the media owner and the advertiser an opportunity to promote differentiation in their branded offerings and to grow their businesses. Testing on TripAdvisor is scheduled to go live this week starting with a small sample. Let me also make a comment on China. First, we fully support the recent M&A activities specifically regarding eLong and Qunar buyer investment and commercial partner Ctrip. We hope that these will ultimately lead to a more rational market environment inside China. But outside of our Ctrip relationship, we are not standing still waiting either. For instance, we started 2015 with only 8,000 properties in China on Booking.com, and now it's over 25,000 properties. We expect this to grow rapidly over time in part with Ctrip's assistance. As well, Chinese customer growth has exceeded the overall growth in our business for many quarters now, and the Chinese are now the primary inbound nationality to many important destinations for us. The case of China is a good reminder that travel is inherently a non-local business. It's a global scale combined with win-win partnerships like we have with Ctrip, are critical for our mutual success. Some commentary now on the other brands of The Priceline Group; priceline.com posted modest growth in hotel and rental car reservation and in overall gross profit. With new leadership, we have been busy repositioning and reinvigorating our namesake brand. A critical platform migration of priceline.com is nearing its final phases, and the team is eager to start innovating at a faster pace as the new tech stack rolls out in early 2016. Agoda also had a challenging quarter and was negatively impacted by the August bombing in Bangkok and various currency headwinds. No strangers to challenge, the Agoda team continue to innovate in all aspects of its business and launched in October a substantially revamped mobile app. We are also seeing positive results from recent work to integrate Booking.com agency inventory into Agoda. Similarly, although we continued to see strong diner growth in OpenTable, the pace of innovation needs to be improved, and we've made a number of management changes as a result. In particular, Christa Quarles, OpenTable's Interim CEO, has done an outstanding job leading the team through this transition. We remain excited by the growth potential of OpenTable and are confident that a renewed focus will help us get on the right path to capitalize on its tremendous potential. Moving on to rentalcars.com and KAYAK, both brands delivered strong quarters. rentalcars.com posted solid unit growth despite a tough comp, while KAYAK made some important changes in the way it markets its business internationally, and as a result, accelerated on both the top and bottom lines. The Group performed well in the third quarter, and we believe our brands are taking the right actions to best maximize their share of their attractive and expanding online marketplaces. Booking.com has established clear global leadership in the online accommodations market, and we plan to continue to profitably invest to improve and extend our services and bring more consumers to our sites. Mobile execution remains a bright spot across our Group and we steadfastly adhere to our formula for earning our customers' loyalty through delivering best-in-class consumer experiences end-to-end and across devices. I would like to thank our employees around the world for their hard work and dedication in delivering terrific performance during our peak summer season. I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review. Daniel J. Finnegan - Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer : Thanks, Darren. I'll discuss some of the highlights in operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the fourth quarter of 2015. Throughout 2015, we've seen the strong U.S. dollar significantly impact our U.S. dollar reported results because about 90% of our gross bookings and operating income are generated by our international brands. Our two most impactful currencies, the euro and the British pound, were weaker by about 16% and 7% respectively for Q3 as compared to the prior year. Many other important currencies in which we transact were also significantly weaker versus the U.S. dollar this year in Q3 relative to last year. The strong U.S. dollar means our gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income mathematically translate into significantly fewer dollars than they would have at last year's exchange rates for Q3 and Q4. Since our expenses are denominated in foreign currencies on a basis similar to our revenues, they will also translate into fewer dollars. Therefore, our operating margins are not significantly impacted by currency fluctuations, and we believe that the impact of currency on our bottom line is generally similar to the top line impact. The Priceline Group performed well for all these key metrics in Q3. Room nights booked grew by 22% in the third quarter, decelerating compared to the 26% growth rate for Q2. Rental car days grew by 13% in Q3 compared to Q2 growth of 20%. Average daily rates for accommodations, or ADRs, for Q3 2015, were up on a constant currency basis by slightly less than 2% for the consolidated Group. ADR trends expressed in U.S. dollars would obviously look significantly worse based upon the currency dynamics I just discussed. While we're in the midst of this period of extreme currency volatility, the fundamental performance of our business is still evident in our unit growth rates and our constant currency growth rates for gross bookings, international gross bookings and gross profit. Specifically, our Q3 gross bookings grew by about 22% on a constant currency basis, but by only about 7% expressed in U.S. dollars compared to prior year due to the stronger dollar. Similarly, international gross bookings grew by about 25% on a constant currency basis and by only about 8% expressed in U.S. dollars. Gross bookings for our U.S. business decreased by about 3%. Similar to recent quarters, the U.S. results are a mix of growth in retail room nights and rental car days, offset by declines in our Name Your Own Price services. In addition, lower airfares significantly impacted gross bookings growth, but have no impact on gross profit growth. Gross profit for the quarter for The Priceline Group was $2.9 billion and grew by about 29% on a constant currency basis, and by 12% in U.S. dollars compared to prior year. Our international operations generated gross profit of $2.6 billion, which grew by about 29% on a constant currency basis, and by 11% in U.S. dollars compared to the prior year. Gross profit for our U.S. operations, including OpenTable's U.S. business, amounted to $335 million, which represented 22% growth versus prior year. OpenTable generated total worldwide revenue in Q3 of about $65 million. Excluding the beneficial $13.7 million impact of a favorable travel transaction tax ruling in Hawaii, U.S. gross profit grew by 17%. Our gross profit take rates were broadly stable, as they have been for quite some time now. We believe that our revenue margins have been sustainable due to our position as a lower cost distribution channel that drives significant demand to our accommodation partners. A highlight for the quarter was operating margins that exceeded our guidance and were slightly better than last year. Non-GAAP operating income amounted to 53.7% of non-GAAP gross profit for Q3. Margins benefited as our marketing teams did a good job driving traffic, with a nice balance between top line and bottom line growth. Margins also reflect the benefit of strong gross profit flow-through. The combination of 29% constant currency gross profit growth with stable operating margins results in strong bottom line profit performance. Adjusted EBITDA for Q3 amounted to $1.6 billion, which exceeded the top end of our guidance range of $1.525 billion and grew by 12% versus prior year despite the significant negative foreign currency translation impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. Non-GAAP net income increased by 10% and non-GAAP EPS grew by 14% including interest expense from our recent bond offerings and the beneficial impact of lower share count from stock repurchases. In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $1.3 billion of cash from operations during third quarter 2015 which is about 1% above last year, and is also impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange rate translation. We invested $42 million in CapEx and repurchased 985,000 shares of common stock for $1.17 billion in Q3. Thus far in Q4, we have purchased about 400,000 more shares of our common stock for $520 million. Year-to-date through Friday, total cash returned to shareholders is about $2.8 billion. Our cash and investments amounted to $9.4 billion at September 30, 2015, with about $700 million of that balance in the U.S. Now for Q4 guidance. We often get questions from analysts and investors trying to understand the size of the accommodation market and our share of room night reservations. Darren just pointed out that the accommodations on our websites have about 21 million rooms. We internally estimate our market share by multiplying this figure by 365, and then dividing the sum into our annual room nights. This math implies a mid-single digit market share, which I believe highlights the opportunity for us to continue to grow our share with existing partners, while our supply teams also continue to aggressively add new partners. Our quarter is off to a strong start as is evident in our guidance. Our guidance assumes that our growth rates will decelerate as we progress through the quarter mainly due to the size of our business and consistent with long-term trends. We have not yet launched our recently announced advertising placement on TripAdvisor Instant Book. We are confident that this will be another way for us to reach travelers in a branded fashion with reasonable ROIs. Our forecast for the quarter assumes that TripAdvisor Instant Book will not have a significant impact on our top line growth or add efficiency. Our Q4 forecast assumes foreign exchange rates of $1.07 per \u20ac1, and $1.51 per \u00a31 for the remainder of the quarter which would result in average exchange rates that would be weaker by about 13% for the euro and about 4% for the British pound as compared to the prior year. I also highlight that the euro and British pound, as well as several other important currencies for our business, including the Brazilian real, the Russian ruble and the Australian dollar have devalued compared to the U.S. dollar since we reported earnings in August, and when most analysts last updated their forecasts. Overall since that point in time, we estimate that foreign exchange rate fluctuations have negatively impacted our Q4 U.S. dollar forecasted results by about 2%. As a result of exchange rate fluctuations, our gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income will mathematically translate into significantly fewer dollars than they would have at last year's exchange rates for Q4. Barring further deterioration in exchange rates, we believe that year-over-year currency comps will become less challenging after Q4. For Q4 guidance, we are forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 13% to 20% on a constant-currency basis, and by 1% to 8% in U.S. dollars. With U.S. gross bookings down by 5% to 10% compared with prior year. We expect international gross bookings to grow by 17% to 24% on a constant-currency basis and by 3% to 10% in U.S. dollars. Our Q4 forecast assumes that constant currency ADRs for the consolidated Group will be up by less than 2% compared to the prior period. We expect Q4 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 1% to 8%. We expect gross profit to grow by 14% to 21% on a constant-currency basis, and by 3% to 10% in U.S. dollars. We expect that declines in our Name Your Own Price services will negatively impact revenue growth rates in Q4. We expect about 140 bps of deleverage in non-GAAP operating margins compared to prior year, expressed as non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of gross profit. The deleverage is mainly attributable to our assumptions for online ad efficiency and OpEx. Our online advertising efficiency forecast, as usual, assumes deterioration from current levels and provides us with flexibility in a dynamic market to follow our consistent approach of advertising our brands at reasonable ROIs. OpEx leverage has improved compared to earlier in the year as we have left the OpenTable and BookingSuite acquisitions. We are committed to controlling non-advertising OpEx and expect these expenses to generally grow more slowly than our gross profit in the future, although there could be quarterly variations from time-to-time as we invest to be ready for growth. This cost discipline together with industry-leading operating margins allows us to lean-in more aggressively when we see opportunities to advertise our brands to drive growth. Our adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $710 million and $760 million, which at the midpoint is an increase of 3% versus prior year. We estimate that the currency impact on EBITDA growth is similar to the impact that we are forecasting for gross profit. Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately 17% comprised of international income taxes, and alternative minimum tax, and state income taxes in the U.S. We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $11.10 to $11.90 per share, which at the midpoint is an increase of 6% versus prior year. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 50.9 million shares based on yesterday's closing stock price and reflects the beneficial impact of the share repurchases we have made thus far this year. We forecast GAAP EPS between $9.10 and $9.90 per share for Q4. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed in our earnings release. Consistent with past practice, we have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our fourth quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any further fluctuation in the euro and British pound versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter. The hedges do not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue, gross profit or operating income. They also do not hedge us against fluctuations and other currencies, and do not hedge our earnings beyond the fourth quarter. Our forecast does not assume any significant change in macroeconomic conditions. One housekeeping item, after reporting Q4, we will no longer report U.S. gross bookings as a separate statistical metric. We believe that the usefulness of this metric has diminished due to the relative size of our U.S. business to our consolidated results, and because two of our three U.S. businesses do not have gross travel bookings. We will continue to report revenue and gross profit for our U.S. business to give insight into its performance. We will now take your questions. Operator : Thank you Our first question is from Tom White with Macquarie. You may begin. Thomas White - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. Thank you for taking my question. Room nights, it looks like there was a bit of a slowdown there, also in international gross bookings growth ex-FX. But the international gross profit growth ex-FX remained strong and steady. I think it was 29% versus last quarter. So can you maybe just talk a little bit about the drivers of the delta there? Was it geographic mix, take rate improvements? Any impact from M&A? And then just on the U.S. business, and I think your largest competitor grew organic room nights something like 25% in the U.S. last quarter, impressive, given that that market is considered more mature. Just maybe an update around your U.S. business. Is it mostly priceline.com? Is it mostly Booking.com and kind of what's stopping you guys from getting your growth rates up to more competitive levels there? Thank you. Darren Richard Huston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Well, thanks Tom. I'll let Dan take the first question. I'll take the second question. Daniel J. Finnegan - Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer : Hey, Tom. So on the first one, first of all, relative to the growth in Q3, we think our marketing teams did a great job of bringing traffic with a good balance between strong top line growth, and really strong bottom line growth, so we were happy with the margin performance and the top line performance in Q3. In terms of the difference between the growth rate and room nights and constant currency gross bookings growth versus our constant currency gross profit growth, there's a few things in there. First of all, there is little bit of an acquisition benefit, so we have about one percentage point of inorganic growth from the OpenTable acquisition, which benefits gross profit and has no impact on gross bookings. I mentioned for our U.S. business, and this partly answers your last question too, we had a significant step-down, 13% reduction in year-over-year airfares, which dramatically impacts gross bookings for the U.S. business, but has no impact on gross profit. And then lastly, and probably most significantly, is just we had two very strong quarters of accelerating growth for room nights and we're seeing the benefit of that now flow-through in Q3 together with just a strong performance relative to our forecast for bookings that came over the trends from after we gave guidance and actually checked out in Q3. Darren Richard Huston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, and just building on Dan's point, the U.S. growth numbers you see do not include Booking.com, and we feel very good about our Booking.com business in the U.S. There's two things I would comment. One is, our U.S. inbound, which obviously has been weaker because of the strong dollar, and we do particularly well with Europeans and South Americans coming into the U.S., but still, we put some pretty solid numbers on the board. And the other way to look at the business is U.S. as bookers, which grew even faster than U.S. as a destination and we were serving U.S. bookers not just for booking in the United States, but also overseas. So overall we feel great about our U.S. business, but there's a lot more to do. It's one of the big markets where we are definitely under indexed, and we feel like we have a good set of cards to be able to continue to compete in the U.S. and North American markets going forward. Daniel J. Finnegan - Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer : And Tom, just a follow-up to my answer. You asked about take rates. As I said in the prepared remarks, our take rates were stable. So that was not a driver of the gross profit growth in excess excessive gross bookings growth. Thomas White - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. Thank you. Darren Richard Huston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies. You may begin. Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC : Thanks, guys. I had a couple questions around Instant Book. Can you talk a little bit more maybe about the decision process to move forward there? You mentioned the requirement for prominent branding. How different are the mechanics there versus what you do with KAYAK? And then, at the end of the day, do you kind of view it as it's just another ad format where you can proactively judge the ROI of the channel and you can adjust exposure to that type of format accordingly? I mean, you still own the hotel and the customer relationship, so a little bit about that please? Darren Richard Huston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, thanks Brian. So we \u2013 if you \u2013 KAYAK was actually the original player to create an Instant Book path, and frankly speaking it's not a very well-branded path. And before we bought KAYAK, we had also decided not to participate in that. We participated in it, and then there was a proliferation of these concepts in various meta partners. I'd say TripAdvisor probably the one taking it on most. So we've stayed out of it mostly as we watched the performance of KAYAK, but we wanted to make sure we had an any future Instant Book partnership with first of all great branding, and secondly, the ability to market to the guests that book on our platform. And over the course of over 12 months, we finally came to an agreement where we think we can achieve that. We also believe we're going to get good ROIs off of the TripAssist platform. We think the branding's going to help us, and we also believe that we've protected our content. We don't want our content being used to help other people book. We want our content to be used to help us book, and I think working with TripAdvisor we came to a nice \u2013 a good compromise agreement that allows us to achieve that. It also helps TripAdvisor in their strategic move to try to do more on mobile and other kind of small-screen real estate. So overall, we're really positive. As I said, you guys will be able to see it very soon. We're beginning to test on small samples this week with TripAdvisor, and I'm now quite excited that this will be a nice new addition to places that we can get branded bookings from across our various marketing partners. Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thanks, Darren. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Eric Sheridan with UBS. You may begin. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC : So maybe just following up on that, wondering long-term, when you think about these platforms for sort of book on Trip or book on Google, how do you think about the ROI developing long-term on these platforms, and the interplay between auction and commission rates on those platforms? And then maybe just one quick follow-up on health of consumer. Curious if there were any comments you had around the health of the consumer travel trends you saw coming out of the summer season, especially in Europe? Thanks. Darren Richard Huston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, okay. So let me take both those questions. We are on margin ROI agnostic across various sources of demand. Of course, there are types of demand that work well for us where we will get really healthy customer repeat, that we like the way that the channel's working that we might lean-in a little bit more. And then other channels where we may be getting customers, but we don't like the nature of the customer or they're not repeating in the right fashion, then we'll lean back from that. So we're agnostic in that sense. I think the TripAssist execution is one that we would like to use across other partners. We will make some changes on KAYAK. We have been working very closely with Google, with trivago, other players. And I don't think it's going to enhance our lives. I don't think it will bleed away from our lives, and we're going to have to watch as these things come together and we really get used to the consumer behavior, and whether or not this is a channel we will lean-in to or lean back from. But overall, we always try to earn money on every transaction regardless, and this will be a net positive from a cash flow standpoint for us, although not extremely material given kind of the size and scale of our business today. And then just some comments, geographically, we saw a lot of strength in many areas of the market that we saw earlier in the year. Japanese inbound, China outbound continues to be very strong. UK and U.S. outbound, because both had relatively strong currencies relative to where they were traveling to. Europe, we're seeing some pretty promising trends in Southern Europe; now Greece had a big issue as you know earlier in the summer, but Spain and Italy were both big positives for us in the summer. Maybe there was a bit of travel moving around, but most people in the Eurozone stayed in Europe, and many people came into the Eurozone, so it was a very strong summer in that respect. I'd say, challenges, you have these spot crises going on. We now have this one in Egypt. You saw in Tunisia, the Greek crisis. Russia, generally inbound-outbound is a challenge. There is a lot of travel going on in domestic Russia, but you guys know that whole story. Southeast Asia had the bombing, and then you had MERS in Korea. Those were also negatives in the quarter, but overall, we run a very global and diversified business. So I would say this is certainly our best summer ever if you look at just the volume of business we did, the profitability of the business. And we've now been able to \u2013 our business is such we can take advantage of both the positives and clean-up the negative. And going into Q4, we're feeling really good about the overall travel environment. I always remind people that travel is all about headlines. People lose security when they see negative headlines. And when the headlines are generally not negative, they don't even have to be positive, then people will travel. And we continue to see very positive trends going into Q4 as well. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Naved Khan with Cantor Fitzgerald. You may begin. Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities : Yeah, thanks. Darren, how do you balance sort of the visibility you have on the TripAdvisor meta auction versus now your participation in Instant Book? How do you sort of decide where do you want to play more? And then in terms of just the cost side of the integration, are there any one-time costs that are baked into your 4Q guidance for the Instant Book? Darren Richard Huston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Your first question, I didn't - Daniel J. Finnegan - Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer : Balance between meta and Instant Book. Darren Richard Huston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Oh, balance between meta and Instant Book. Okay. Well first, I'll take the second question first, there aren't really any costs. There wasn't a lot of dev work that had to happen to make the Instant Book path work. We've been working with TripAdvisor very closely, and already have established fees and things like that. So that was not a big cost on our side. Yeah, certainly, when we look at all of our sources of paid demand, we're always looking for the right balance. We tend to prefer blue links, I call them, versus paths where somebody else tries to build a booking path, probably because we think our booking path is the absolute best in the industry, or an agency model. So we use the credit card as a form of guarantee, not a form of payment. These are all reasons why these Instant Book paths at times have not been as strong of opportunities for us as blue links or meta links. On the other hand, there are some benefits in terms of the branding and the marketing and also the connectedness that we will be showing with TripAdvisor, because when they pick you to do their Instant Book, they're basically saying, hey, here's a great preferred partner to do business with. And that positive shine on us as well as TripAdvisor, I think, is something that we're going to have to see how that works over time. And I'm actually kind of excited to see that, because in a way, we never really \u2013 in many of our other channels we don't get that kind of endorsement. But in an Instant Book path, that is one of the positives, given that it's a branded path, that we're looking forward to. And you guys will be able to see again very soon what that looks like, and you'll get a better sense of what I'm referring to. Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities : Okay. Thanks. And then quickly on the \u2013 I think you mentioned a new tech stack for priceline.com which you're launching. So can you elaborate a little bit on that and what do you expect to see there? Darren Richard Huston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, priceline has been an outstanding business for many, many years. But we found that the tech stack wasn't near as flexible and fungible as for instance, the tech stacks we have at Booking.com or even rentalcars.com. So now that we're getting into that, it'll be \u2013 we've already had an experimentation framework, but it is just a much more flexible stack to allow for much more rapid philosophy in innovation, and we hope in Q1 that will be fully in place. Paul who's leading that business has decided to put the focus there. Forever, we had sort of two stacks running in parallel and now we'll be able to go onto a single stack that'll also increase innovation speed so people aren't creating code for two different stacks of software. It's not the funnest thing to go through, but we're seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, and we expect hopefully to get some good innovation velocity out of that, and certainly the team at priceline.com is very excited to get through this process. Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities : Thank you. Darren Richard Huston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. You may begin. Mark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Two questions please. First has to do with consumer fees. Darren, you mentioned earlier that you're not charging consumer fees, do you? And there's two, you know, Expedia, HomeAway talk about doing that with the HomeAway asset, and obviously Airbnb is doing that. Is it something that your research indicates is important to consumers? And is that why you're sticking with it or do you think that that's something you could toggle on at some point? And then could you also secondly just talk about Facebook as a marketing channel and any new thoughts you've had on that? Thank you. Darren Richard Huston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Thanks, Mark. Basically, in vacation rentals, we're building a very different product than what Airbnb has, or what HomeAway has. And our whole business is based on no fees for consumer. So it wasn't a strategic move. It's just a reflection of the way that our business works, and we charge our accommodation partners between 12% and 15% commission, so that's where the take rate is. When you're in a classified ad business, it's more difficult to get that kind of take rate from the accommodation partner, so many players will try to also charge a fee or increase fees to consumers. We certainly believe that having a no-fee product drives conversion for us, but we obviously have the benefit of having a digital calendar and an instantly verifiable booking, even the online bookings on HomeAway are on request \u2013 or on Airbnb, are on request, so the whole process where the consumers are still deciding, and the properties still deciding whether they want the product that they booked. So no, we feel really good about our positioning. It's more just reflective of the way our entire business works on Booking.com, but if you look at the way their competitive landscape is shaping up, we feel great that our product is both something the consumers love, but is also has the least friction of any of the products in the market. And then your next question on Facebook as a marketing platform, we have been doing more and more business with Facebook. Most of it though is in the category or re-messaging or re-targeting. It's not really in the big sweet spot which is intent-based marketing. That's really what search gives you is intent-based marketing. Somebody types in, I want a hotel in New York, and then you are responding to that request. But the folks at Facebook very much understand this. They're working to try to win that kind of businesses. It's direct response business, it's a big prize for any marketing channel, and we're also trying to work with other large audience versus in Silicon Valley to try to get out that Holy Grail of intent-based marketing. It's really valuable to us as it is to any of them and we're one of the world's best at it. And I feel like it's a little bit strange the advertiser is going and working with the media partner to figure these things out, but there's a lot to be gained by both, and I'll look forward to seeing where it goes. I've been really pleased in particular with Facebook's cooperation is an area and we have engineers working with engineers which is usually a good sign that they're going to figure out something. Mark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you, Darren. Darren Richard Huston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Mark. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Ken Sena with Evercore ISI. You may begin. Kenneth Sena - Evercore ISI : Hi. Thanks. On the U.S. bookings metric, I understand the limitations that you cite, but are there modifications to the metric that you considered before deciding to discontinue it? And maybe, as we look forward, maybe any substitute metrics that we might be able to have to kind of give us a sense of your traction in the U.S. more on the bookings basis? Thanks. Darren Richard Huston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Ken. We could consider at some point giving some stats on the U.S. in terms of our total hotel business. We haven't until now, but as we've have given milestones like on the size of our European business, or our Latin America business. So I wouldn't preclude the possibility of us doing that at some point. We've opted not to do that as an ongoing metric. We split our business now based upon where the brand is located, and we've stuck with that for a long time, and we'll stick with that for the future. But we will consider that at some point in the future. Kenneth Sena - Evercore ISI : Okay. Thank you. Darren Richard Huston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. You may begin. Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Going back to just online advertising, it looked like that as a percent of gross profit was only slightly higher than a year ago. How much of that was just more mature like, markets like Europe increasing the mix versus better efficiencies within those geographical regions? Darren Richard Huston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Dan, you want to take that? Daniel J. Finnegan - Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer : Yeah, I won't parse our ROIs by region for you, Lloyd, but I'd just say we were very pleased with the performance that the marketing group delivered. We're pleased with top line growth, we're pleased with the improvement in ROIs that we saw in the quarter, and then that metric also benefited by some of that flow-through of bookings that we had made in prior quarters, incurred the advertising then, and recognized the gross profit as our customers traveled in Q3. So it was a good performance. I wouldn't split it by region for you. Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, okay. And then, if I can ask another on BookingSuite, can you just give us any sense for how big that might be right now in terms of the partnerships? And then, how you're kind of going to market with that? Are you leveraging your existing sales force, and kind of what are response rates like from hotels there? Darren Richard Huston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay, Lloyd. Yeah, overall our BookingSuite is going very well. For competitive reasons, we don't want to talk about how many contracts or anything, but we have multiples more than when buuteeq was an independent business. The way it's basically working is our account managers will introduce the concept of websites and other technical solutions to partners and then ask them would you like to hear more. And then we have a secondary team that will then speak with the partner about the offerings that we have. We started out with websites. We've now bought a company called PriceMatch out of France, so we're developing business intelligence tools. The ultimate goal of BookingSuite is to have a whole suite of products that meets the needs of accommodation partners in the cloud, and that's what we are building towards. So a lot of innovation happening in the business. I am very happy with where it is. It's not a big contributor to EBITDA or anything at this point, but it's on a good pace, and certainly ahead of where I thought it would have been at this point. It's really strategic for us. It's an area that getting into the software business scenario we can build close relationships with our partners and more to come. Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Ron Josey with JMP Securities. You may begin. Ron Victor Josey - JMP Securities LLC : Great. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to switch topics and maybe ask about business travel. I think it's now 20% of bookings. Is it something that's ramped relatively recently for you all, and have you placed an emphasis on this before? I'm just wondering, 20% number seems very high. And then also wanted to ask about loyalty rates of these travelers, please, meaning, do you see them coming back in higher amounts for repeat usage? Thanks. Darren Richard Huston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, thanks Ron. Yeah, we've \u2013 it's funny, before we launched Booking.com for Business, we had never really specifically targeted the business traveler, but we had a pretty good sense that business people were starting to show up to the platform. You see them using their business email address is the one indication we have. So starting about two years ago, we began to say, okay, how do we address the business traveler better? As you'll notice on our website, you don't even have to sign up for the tool, but if you say you're traveling on business, we'll highlight the hotels that are great for business people, we'll show you the review score just from business people, we'll show you amenities that business people care about, things like free Wi-Fi, breakfast, fitness facilities, things like that. That was the beginning of it. And then we started to see that people who marked their booking as business booking was growing faster than even leisure bookers. So then we built a really lightweight tool that helped the systems book on behalf of business bookers, help them track budgets, things like that. And then we saw another pretty good boost to the business. So yeah, it's one out of five today. There's various people who think that it should be, I would say, one out of two sometime in the long-term, because business is basically half of accommodations around the world. There's different reports. It might be 40%, might be 60%, but it's a wide variance. So we're going to continue to build in this space, but we've seen really positive traction. The benefits of business bookings to us are, generally they smooth out seasonality, which is nice; don't cancel as much, generally higher ADR than leisure bookings. So is a lot of positive benefits to business bookers, but I always remind people of is, every business person is a leisure traveler, not every leisure traveler is a business person. But when you do both kinds of travel, and if you're able to do them on one platform, there are a lot of benefits to that, and we of course give the tool for free, we give customer service for free, which is not the case with a lot of the travel management companies who support businesses today. So step-by-step, we're optimizing the product and we're quite optimistic about it for the future. Ron Victor Josey - JMP Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray. You may begin. Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Hey, good morning. I have two questions. First, is there any detail that you could give us to quantify the impact that the bombing in Thailand had on Agoda during the quarter, and any impact that has on your guidance? And then secondly, when you talked about adding hotels in China, is that in partnership with Ctrip or are you adding that inventory independently from Ctrip? Essentially, what I'm wondering is if you're doing much or anything in China outside of your partnership with Ctrip at this point? Thanks. Darren Richard Huston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay, Mike. I'll get Dan to take the first one. Daniel J. Finnegan - Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer : Yeah. Darren Richard Huston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'll take the second. Daniel J. Finnegan - Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer : Yeah Mike, I won't quantify for you specifically, but I will say it's a significant impact for Agoda, because it's by far their largest market as a destination. Definitely noticeable principally for our Agoda business. Darren Richard Huston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, and to the increase of properties in China, it's good you asked, actually the vast majority of them were built by Booking.com. They weren't acquired through the Ctrip partnership. We do have let's call it a small handful of hotels that we have with the Ctrip partnership, we're still optimizing; we had a lot of issues connecting systems, a lot of issues with the high bar that Booking.com has on content, and we want to make sure that the product in China is working absolutely in an outstanding fashion, and the Ctrip team has been responding to that. We haven't given up on it, but the numbers you're seeing have been largely self-built by Booking with a few handfuls. The other side of the commercial partnership with Ctrip is our product on their site, and that's gone very well and continues to grow. So I appreciate you asking, but if we do unlock on Ctrip, it will provide an extra boost to our property count, but right now, this is organic efforts going on at Booking. Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Thank you. Darren Richard Huston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may begin. Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. I have a couple of questions. It looks like the booking upside you had this quarter versus prior quarters was a little bit less, were there any changes in trends in the quarter that you'd like to call out versus say 2Q? And then the TripAdvisor partnership, after not being partners for a while, is very interesting. Any concerns you might have on kind of helping build a competitive platform over time, and just how are you are thinking about that? Thank you. Daniel J. Finnegan - Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer : Hey, Justin. So I'll take the first one. No change, nothing that I'd call out in terms of any kind of change in our approach. I think it was a really spectacular performance in the first couple of quarters for the business to accelerate, and if anything, maybe that's more the outlier than seeing a little bit of deceleration in Q3. If you look at the business over kind of the balance of the three quarters I think it's just very solid growth, and that's pretty much what we've seen over a number of years now is business that's been very resilient, growing at very high rates. Every now and then there will be a step down maybe a little bit bigger than what we're anticipating, and then there's other points there will be a quarter where we accelerate. But overall, we're pleased with the performance year-to-date and in the third quarter specifically. Darren Richard Huston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, and on the TripAdvisor thing, I think I've largely answered this; obviously, it's a very tricky area and what we would never want to do is be a dumb pipe to somebody else's brand and we would never want to give our content away to somebody to book other people's bookings. And you'll see that we've done neither of those, so I feel great about where we came out at, and time will tell. Of course, every paid marketing partner we have, starting with Google all the way down, there's always that threat and you have to make a really strong balance between the challenge you're participating and how you're participating relative to the ROIs, and I think we do a really good job of that every single day, and I believe time will tell. I also by the way think it's great for TripAdvisor, and that's kind of the nature of partnership is they've got something that they need to achieve, we've got something we need to achieve and there was opportunity to come up with an answer and that's what we did, so let's see. I mean the best thing to do in these situations is find a good way to get in and begin experimenting and optimizing, and ultimately we both win if we can find a way to get a lot more bookings. Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks. Maybe if I could ask a follow-up. If TripAdvisor goes well for you, could it be actually material for your overall bookings at all? Daniel J. Finnegan - Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer : We didn't build any assumption in, Justin. I think it's premature to make a call in that fashion. We'll see what the trade-off is between meta and Instant Book, and how much traction it gets, and then we'll report back to you after we have more information. Darren Richard Huston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, we have a very \u2013 I guess it's worth saying, we're a very large business and we have a lot of varied channels and some are coming and going at all times. As Dan said, there's a whole cannibalization impact we don't know. A lot of that's going to be up to TripAdvisor as the media owner, how much do they expose of this product versus the other product, what's the balance that the customer wants to go to, do they want to go down the meta path, do they want to go down the Assist path, lots to learn. TripAdvisor's obviously a big player for us, but they're still overall a small percentage of our overall business. So it would have to be quite a significant incremental uptick to have a material impact on our results. Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks. Thank you. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Steven Zhu with Credit Suisse. You may begin. Steven Zhu - Credit Suisse (Hong Kong) Ltd.: Okay. Thanks. So Darren, my understanding is that Agoda is a merchant-based platform, and now it seems like you're integrating Booking.com's agency inventory there. So is agency the direction you want to take with Agoda in the future, or are you leaving the option open to the consumer? Thanks. Darren Richard Huston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah thanks, Steven. I would say more leaving the option. If you look at priceline.com, it's a real mix of merchant and agency and there's ways to merchandise the product. We've always had Booking.com on Agoda, although it was pretty varied, and only recently did we really up Booking.com's presence on Agoda, and now there's a really nice mix. For the customer, often it comes down to, well, do I pay now or do I pay later, how cancellable is the product, things like that, which can be messaged in the path. They don't necessarily see it as an agency versus a merchant product. It's just a different way to experience the accommodation from a payment standpoint. Steven Zhu - Credit Suisse (Hong Kong) Ltd.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Heath Patrick Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks. I wanted to dig a little bit deeper into the math behind the advertising deleverage that you talked to, and just get a bit of an update on the mix there in terms of what you're seeing that's driving that, whether it's deleverage within specific channels, sort of a same-store sales basis, or it's just a mix shift to less efficient channels as you've sort of maxed out the traffic that you can get through more efficient channels like Google? And then Dan, I do want to come back on this U.S. bookings question, and just get a sense, I know you've talked about maybe some incremental disclosures, but as we try and analyze the business going forward, and obviously, the trends in the U.S. or the trends as you guys pointed out in your comments, the trends in individual geographic regions start to matter a lot more. Is there a sense or any sort of guidance you want to give us in terms of the best way to look at that geographic exposure in the business since we're not going to be getting the kind of disclosure that you've given in the past? Daniel J. Finnegan - Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer : Sure, Heath. So I'll take both of those. On ad deleverage, what are you talking about specifically? In the guidance, or in the Q3? Heath Patrick Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.: More in the guidance, but just sort of general trends either way. But the comments that you made earlier in the call during the prepared remarks on the ad deleverage implied for Q4; mainly just looking to get a better sense of whether that's specific channels becoming less efficient over time, or mix shift as you're having to explore other channels that are less efficient because of capacity within your more mature, more efficient channels? Daniel J. Finnegan - Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer : Got it. No. So it's no significant assumed change in mix or channels. It's more just looking at what we've delivered thus far to-date in the quarter in terms of ad ROIs, and then building a level of conservatism on top of that for the go-forward, really just to give our marketing team some flexibility that if they do see channels that they think are attractive and they want to lean-in a little bit, or the marketplace becomes more competitive, we've got the ability to hold position and maybe accept somewhat lower ROIs. So it's really just to give us some flexibility to compete in a very dynamic marketplace and look for opportunities to again try and strike a good balance between top line and bottom line growth without feeling that they're handcuffed having to deliver a specific ROI. Darren Richard Huston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: The other thing you might just talk about Q4 a little bit and how acceleration in gross bookings can actually cost you in Q4, they have to check out (55:06) in Q1. Daniel J. Finnegan - Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer : Yeah, so Q3 we got the benefit of the acceleration that happened in the first couple of quarters and checked out in Q3. A little bit of a deceleration in gross bookings growth is generally helpful to that ad efficiency metric, and that top line forecast that we have for Q4 is relatively stronger, I would say. And so when you don't have that kind of deceleration in top line growth, that puts a little bit more pressure on the ad efficiency metric. Darren Richard Huston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: In terms of U.S. gross bookings, I'd say that the best way to look at our U.S. business and understand the trends will be the revenue and gross profit numbers that we'll continue to report. So revenue for OpenTable and KAYAK are reported in advertising and other, and then we'll give you the total U.S. revenue which will kind of give you a proxy on priceline.com so you get a sense for our U.S. travel business. Heath Patrick Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thank you very much. Darren Richard Huston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our last question is from Kevin Kopelman with Cowen & Company. You may begin. Kevin Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks a lot. I just had a question on your vacation rental business. Can you give us an update there? Are you seeing any increase in competitiveness from Airbnb? And can you talk about your strategy for the U.S. in that business, because it seems like you only have a few listings there today? Thanks. Darren Richard Huston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, thanks, Kevin. Well, first of all, it's always worth reminding people this is a very large market, so it's a competition you don't necessarily see on a day-to-day basis, and most of this market is booked in quite an inefficient way. But when we look at what we call vacation rentals which is our self-cater product, we have an inventory of 1.8 million bookable rooms. That's in the ballpark of what HomeAway and what Airbnb have. We may be booking different kinds of properties. HomeAway is actually quite focused on vacation homes. We're quite heavy in in-city apartments and things like that. We're also indexed very heavily in Europe. HomeAway indexes and Airbnb quite heavily in the United States. But we feel really good about the scale of our business, its growth. The nature of our booker may be different. There may be somebody who's looking for any form of accommodation versus a vacation home specifically. And this is a really critical market for us in the future. When you think about where we've come from, we came from the hotel space. We've now built a massive amount of inventory and multi-room unique accommodations that one wouldn't technically call a hotel, and now we're adding vacation homes, so that's the way we've approached the market. We feel good about our growth. It's quite fast and comparable, and we're a profitable company which is quite a difference as well. So we continue to build it out. I like the cards that we have, and I'm excited to look forward to where this all ends up. I think in the United States for sure there's more work to be done, and we now \u2013 if you look at our total property count, we're right in there with Expedia, if not a little bit more. You can see these on the website and we're going to continue to build out our unique accommodation portfolio in the United States and places that Americans like to go. That's a really high priority for us and a big focus in the coming quarters. Kevin Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks, Darren. Darren Richard Huston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, thanks. Darren Richard Huston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I guess that's the last question. Thank you all very much. It's been the biggest quarter in history of The Priceline Group, however, we continue to be very optimistic about the future. And, again, I want to thank all of our employees for a fantastic summer and looking forward to a great 2016. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful day.",

And now I'd like to introduce The Priceline Group's speakers for this afternoon, Darren Huston and Daniel Finnegan. Go ahead gentlemen. Darren Richard Huston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Welcome to The Priceline Group's fourth quarter conference call. Thank you for joining us before the market opens this morning in New York. I'm here in Amsterdam with Priceline Group's CFO Dan Finnegan. The group reported another solid quarter with consolidated gross bookings of approximately $12 billion up about 24% on a constant currency basis, 13% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. Our customers booked accommodation reservations for over 99 million room nights in the quarter, up 27% year-over-year. Gross profit was up 12% or about 23% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA was also up 11% to $790 million. And finally, our non-GAAP earnings per share was $12.63 surpassing FactSet consensus estimates of $11.81 per share and our guidance for the quarter. Now, I'd like to take a moment and reflect back on our full-year results. Our customers made reservations for over 432 million room nights on Priceline Group platforms in 2015, over twice as many as our next biggest competitor. Despite the law of large numbers, we organically grew this business at 25% down only 3 percentage points from 2014's growth rate and exited the year growing more quickly than we were growing when we entered it. The business was very profitable generating $3.7 billion of adjusted EBITDA and a 42.6% non-GAAP operating profit margin. I believe that the solid performance in 2015 and many consecutive years of strong growth and profitability have been made possible by competitive advantages we have developed through the skill and hard work of our people around the world. Our capabilities and scale in partner acquisition, customer experience and efficient demand generation plus our large installed base of accommodations and loyal travelers give The Priceline Group a competitive moat that is deep and wide. Let me expand on this point a bit, being a leader on online travel and building and experienced marketplace isn't achieved by simply electronically connecting demand with supply. It may be a surprise to some but about two-thirds of our employees are working in either the supply or customer service organizations. Only KAYAK, our one media asset does not have a similar model. Our employees work out of 239 support offices in 173 cities around the world working daily with partners and customers to deliver the absolute best booking experience wherever our customer comes from and wherever they're going. On the supply side, we added 200,000 properties during the year on Booking.com covering everything from igloos to shared estates while maintaining stable take rates and a fee-free model to the customer. Booking.com now has over 850,000 hotels, homes and other places to stay in over 220 countries and territories across the globe, up 34% from last year. The hard work of making this a daily reality is achieved by thousands of dedicated and energetic people around the world having these properties and then working with our partners on an ongoing basis to ensure that our customers have the most choices of places to stay at the best prices available. We offer by far the most directly bookable lodging choices to our customers, with over 22.6 million rooms potentially available on our websites, including 6.9 million rooms in vacation rentals and other non-hotel properties. With our worldwide team and market-leading profitability, we are expanding this low friction model more aggressively into the single-owner, single-room market as it continues to mature. We strongly believe that this fee-free experience-centric model, which makes booking homes and apartments as easy and trustworthy as booking a hotel, will be the winning model long term. On the customer experience side, the complexity of providing a world-class digital experience for customers becomes more daunting each year with various browsers and operating systems offered on desktop and mobile devices. On top of that, you have new platforms and capabilities being built every day, and for each of these, we need to make an intelligent decision about where and how to participate. The good news is the tools are becoming better and customers continue to want to live more of their lives digitally. We have over 2,500 talented developers and other technology professionals working across our brands to offer our customers the best online booking experience on our desktop and mobile websites and app optimized through hundreds of thousands of experiments. We believe Booking.com has the highest converting online accommodation reservation path in the world, achieved through a deeply ingrained culture of innovation, the result of experimentation at a transactional data scale and velocities that few companies can match. Our content is best in class with high-resolution photos, detailed property descriptions and 77 million plus verified and fresh reviews for properties in even the most far-flung destinations. We have thousands of customer service professionals stationed all over the world, helping our customers in 42 languages 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. We think our approach adds up to a great experience for our customers, which helps us continue to grow the direct share of our business with outstanding everyday pricing and repeat traffic versus the alternative, which is to buy the business with coupons or discounting, transaction by transaction. Booking.com surpassed 100 million customer accounts during 2015 and had our one billionth guest stay at one of our partners, approximately 300 million of those in 2015 alone, another testament to our success at earning long-term loyalty. We invested $3 billion in marketing during 2015 to build our brands around the world and bring new customers to our websites at profitable ROIs. Our historical competitive strengths on the desktop have translated very well to mobile. Our talented teams use proprietary quantitative tools to manage bidding on hundreds of millions of multilingual keywords across desktop and mobile platforms, successfully balancing ROI discipline with strong growth. We continue to command a leading share of the demand channels we participate in, profitably converting shoppers into buyers and buyers into loyal long-term customers. Every year is an investment year at The Priceline Group. Well, every year is also an opportunity to deliver outstanding bottom line results. We evaluate every opportunity with a long-term lens, requiring that it deliver value for our brand franchises tomorrow beyond just delivering transactions today. 2016 will be no different as we invest in exciting new opportunities like OpenTable's international expansion or BookingSuite cloud software offers, or Booking.com for Business while maintaining superior operating margins that will allow us to win in the face of heated competition. And you can be confident that we're not standing still. The Priceline Group will continue to work hard to stay a step ahead of the competition with our unique combination of institutional knowhow, culture, systems and focused passion. We don't take any competitor lightly, and we compete ferociously every day, continuously seeking a higher executional gear in every facet of our business. Booking.com, of course, makes up the majority of our business. However, the group also has a portfolio of valuable and complementary brands, each of which makes money and has the aspiration to grow and build vertical mastery in their respective area of focus. We have new leadership at Priceline.com and OpenTable and both businesses are responding with a renewed energy and a strong commitment to profitable growth. Agoda and Rentalcars.com both continued to improve and differentiate their respective products and both look to drive more business direct and through improved mobile experiences. And finally, KAYAK is an outstanding business that is being smartly run and continues to contribute to the group beyond our initial expectations. I give these other brand teams a lot of independence, and this has engendered a real performance-driven culture. Through our portfolio of brands we aspire to achieve the group's mission to help people experience the world and become a global marketplace for experiences. I thank my colleagues around the world for delivering another great year. Their skill and dedication has helped build a great business with strong competitive advantages that have been responsible for our past success and will help us continue to succeed in the future. I'll now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review. Dan? Daniel J. Finnegan - Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer : Thanks, Darren. I'll discuss some of the highlights in operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the first quarter of 2016. All growth rates referenced in my comments are compared to the prior year comparable period unless otherwise indicated. Q4 was a strong quarter for The Priceline Group with accelerating room night growth and a second consecutive quarter of solid operating margin performance. Growth was strong across all channels and geographic regions, which we believe indicates a generally healthy macro travel environment. Our global room night growth rate declined by more than 10 percentage points for a two- to three-week period after the terrorist attack in Paris compared to what it had been before the attack. Growth bounced back strongly in December and this momentum has carried over in Q1, as I will discuss further when I get to guidance. Room nights booked grew by 27% in the fourth quarter, accelerating compared to the 22% growth rate for Q3. Rental car days grew by 11% in Q4 compared to Q3 growth of 13%. Average daily rates for accommodations, or ADRs, for Q4 2015 were up on a constant currency basis by 1% for the consolidated group. Foreign exchange rates again presented a significant headwind to our growth rates expressed in U.S. dollars due to the strong dollar and our business mix, which skews heavily international. Our Q4 gross bookings grew by about 24% on a constant currency basis but by only about 13% expressed in U.S. dollars compared to prior year. International gross bookings grew by about 29% on a constant currency basis and by 16% expressed in U.S. dollars. Gross bookings for our U.S. business decreased by about 8%. We believe U.S. performance was impacted by TV advertising decreases in the second half of 2015 as the Priceline.com team transitioned to their new brand campaign, which recently launched in Q1. In addition, global airfares were down by about 15% over the last several months, according to KAYAK flight search data, which significantly impacts Priceline.com's gross bookings growth but has no impact on gross profit growth. Gross profit for the quarter for The Priceline Group was $1.9 billion and grew by about 23% on a constant currency basis, and by 12% in U.S. dollars compared to prior year. Our gross profit take rates remained stable, as they have been for quite some time now. We believe that our revenue margins have been and should continue to be sustainable due to our position as a relatively low cost distribution channel that drives significant demand to our partners. Our international operations generated gross profit of $1.6 billion, which grew by about 25% on a constant currency basis and by 12% in U.S. dollars compared to prior year. Gross profit for our U.S. operations amounted to $268 million, which represented 11% growth versus prior year. Advertising and other revenue, which is mainly comprised of KAYAK and OpenTable revenues, grew by 17% in Q4 compared to the prior year. Operating margins exceeded our guidance and were similar to Q4 last year. Non-GAAP operating income amounted to 41.3% of gross profit for Q4 compared to 41.4% in Q4 last year. Online ad ROI's were better than our forecast, but online advertising de-levered compared to the prior year, due to the acceleration in gross bookings late in the quarter, which will benefit revenue in Q1 and beyond when checkouts occur, as well as the impact of the terrorist attack on cancellations. Offline advertising came in slightly favorable to our forecast and is down year-over-year due to a shift in spend from offline to online advertising for KAYAK, reduced advertising at Priceline.com as I mentioned a moment ago and the impact of foreign exchange rates on Booking.com's offline advertising expense, which grew by 18% in euros. Non-advertising operating expenses were also favorable to our forecast and only generated 11 bps of margin pressure compared to prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 amounted to $790 million, which exceeded the top end of our guidance range of $760 million and grew by 11% versus prior year despite the significant negative foreign currency translation impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. Non-GAAP net income increased by 11% and non-GAAP EPS grew by 16%, including increased interest expense from our recent bond offerings and the beneficial impact of lower share count from stock repurchases. In terms of cash flow, we generated $881 million of cash from operations during fourth quarter 2015, which is about 17% above last year and is also impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange rate translation. For the full year, we generated operating cash flow of $3.1 billion and spent $174 million on CapEx, which means about 34% of our gross profit converted into free cash flow. We used our cash during the year to repurchase 2.5 million shares of our common stock for $3.1 billion. Darren just spoke about some of our operational competitive advantages, I believe that our market-leading profit margins, free cash flow, impeccable balance sheet and solid investment rate credit rating collectively constitute a competitive advantage that gives us significant financial flexibility to invest in our business to drive growth and positions us favorably versus our competitors. Our board recently gave us a new authorization to repurchase up to $3 billion of our common stock. We expect to execute this program consistent with the pattern we have established over the last couple years to return capital to shareholders at a pace that we think makes sense based on the price at which our stock is trading and potential other uses for such capital. Our cash and investments amounted to $10.6 billion at December 31, 2015, with about $800 million of that balance in the U.S. Now for Q1 guidance, our quarter is off to a strong start, as I mentioned a moment ago. Some of the strength in December, and thus far in Q1, is likely attributable to Chinese New Year, Carnival and Easter happening earlier this year. Leap year also helps our forecast slightly relative to last year by adding an extra day to the quarter. Although we worry about macro weakness evidenced in slowing economic growth, dropping oil prices and stock market volatility, the macro travel environment appears healthy to us. Lower oil prices have contributed to significantly lower airline ticket prices and leave consumers with more discretionary funds that are available for travel. Lastly, and most importantly, a combination of strong core execution and the benefits of a number of growth investments we've been making are helping to drive the group's success. And I sincerely thank my colleagues around the world for their efforts. Our growth continues to be strong across all channels and regions. Our guidance assumes that our growth rates will decelerate as we progress through the quarter, mainly due to the size of our business and consistent with long-term trends. We are pleased with the brand marketing we get through TripAdvisor's Instant Book ad placement, but given the relative size of our business and our experience so far, we don't expect that Instant Book will significantly impact our top line growth or ad efficiency. Our Q1 forecast assumes foreign exchange rates of $1.12 per euro and $1.44 per British pound for the remainder of the quarter, which will result in average exchange rates that would be weaker by about 2% for the euro and about 5% for the British pound as compared to the prior year. Many other currencies in which we transact are also significantly weaker versus the U.S. dollar than they were in Q1 last year. As a result, our gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income will mathematically translate into fewer dollars than they would have at last year's exchange rates for Q1. As you can see in our guidance, the Q1 impact of currency fluctuations on our dollar reported figures, while still meaningful, is less severe than what we experienced during 2015. Barring further deterioration in exchange rates, year-over-year currency comps will become even less challenging after Q1. As I mentioned when we reported last quarter, we will no longer report U.S. gross booking business as a separate statistical metric. We believe that the usefulness of this metric has diminished due to the relative size of our Priceline.com business to our consolidated results, and because our other two U.S. brands, KAYAK and OpenTable, do not have gross travel bookings. The metric also excludes the U.S. inbound, outbound and domestic business for Booking.com. We will continue to report revenue and gross profit for our U.S. business as we have in the past to give insight into its performance. We're also adding guidance for consolidated room night growth to give visibility for this important metric. For Q1 guidance, we are forecasting booked room nights to grow by 20% to 27% and total gross bookings to grow by 18% to 25% on a constant currency basis and by 12% to 19% in U.S. dollars. Our Q1 forecast assumes that constant currency accommodation ADRs for consolidated group will be up by about 1% compared to the prior-year period. We expect Q1 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 9% to 16%. We expect gross profit to grow by 20% to 27% on a constant currency basis and by 14% to 21% in U.S. dollars. We expect about 140 bps of deleveraging non-GAAP operating margins compared to prior year expressed as non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of gross profit. The deleverage is mainly attributable to our assumptions for online ad efficiency. Our online advertising efficiency forecast, as usual, assumes deterioration from current levels and provides us with flexibility in a dynamic market to follow our consistent approach of advertising our brands at reasonable ROIs. Our adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $580 million and $620 million, which at the midpoint is an increase of 13% versus prior year. We estimate that the currency impact on EBITDA growth is similar to the impact that we are forecasting for gross profit. Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of 16%, comprised of international income taxes and alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S. We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $9 to $9.60 per share, which at the midpoint is an increase of 15% versus prior year. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 50.5 million shares based upon yesterday's closing stock price and reflects the beneficial impact of the common stock repurchases we made in 2015. We forecast GAAP EPS between $6.90 and $7.50 per share for Q1. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed in our earnings release. Consistent with past practice, we have hedged contracts in place to substantially shield our first quarter EBITDA net earnings from any further fluctuation in the euro and British pound versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter. The hedges do not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue, gross profit or operating income. They also do not hedge us against fluctuations in other currencies and do not hedge our earnings beyond the first quarter. Our forecast does not assume any significant change in macroeconomic conditions in general or in the travel market in particular. We will now take your questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question is from Tom White with Macquarie. You may begin. Thomas White - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Good. Thanks for taking my questions. Just one on the TripAdvisor Instant Booking. I think you said no kind of impact contemplated in 2016, but was there any sort of discernible impact to the 4Q room night growth? And then just on your comments on take rates, it sounds like things are stable. I guess \u2013 I know this isn't a perfectly clean calc, but if I look at gross profit growth kind of on an FX-neutral basis, that kind of lagged room night growth a bit in the fourth quarter for the first time in several quarters. Can you maybe just comment a bit on the drivers of the delta there if take rates are stable? Thanks. Darren Richard Huston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Tom. I'll take the first one on TripAssist and I'll let Dan take the second one. I think one of the headlines is TripAssist is still very early, and as Steve would tell you, they're still rolling out the product. It's important to understand that TripAdvisor makes up low single-digit percentage of our business, and TripAssist within our TripAdvisor business is a small percentage of our business. We have found at least we're happy with the brand impact. That was one of the reasons we did that. We're happy with the consumer behavior we see, but it's still small, and to be honest if it becomes two or three times the size it is today, it's still quite small for us from a materiality perspective. Again, we're happy with the execution. The teams have been connecting really well and we're curious to see how big it can become. Daniel J. Finnegan - Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer : And on your second question, Tom, if you look at the gross bookings we generated in Q4 and the take rate, the revenue that will ultimately generate from those, the rate is stable. So it's really just a book versus stay difference. We typically see this when we have a quarter where we accelerate to the extent that we did, but due to the lag between when the booking occurs and travel occurs, the growth in gross profit typically lags that growth in gross bookings. And in particular the strength at the end of the quarter last month will benefit to a greater extent Q1 and beyond than Q4. Thomas White - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. Thank you. Darren Richard Huston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You're welcome. Daniel J. Finnegan - Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies. You may begin. Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC : Thanks, guys. Maybe on OpenTable \u2013 first, congrats to Christa as she stepped into that OpenTable CEO role this quarter. You've mentioned OpenTable international expansion in 2016. Can you remind us how many countries they're in currently and where do you see opportunities for expansion? And then along the same lines, there are many players that are attacking that local reservation market on a global basis, how important are the relationships there versus maybe having an all-encompassing platform with reviews, with reservations and maybe even with delivery options, or does it come down to having the best tech and the best competitive rates? Thanks. Darren Richard Huston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Thanks, Brian. Yeah. As mentioned in my prepared remarks, we feel really good about where OpenTable is. We knew at the time we acquired it that we might have to make some changes in leadership. Christa has done an awesome job. The team hit all of its Q4 KPIs and these are all about how do we get medium to long term momentum. We are currently primarily in the United States, we also have operations in Japan, the U.K., Germany, we've made an acquisition of AS Digital that put us into Australia. There are also by the way a number of restaurants that use OpenTable software all around the world, although we may not have a consumer-facing site. The whole process of globalizing OpenTable has been \u2013 you'll see recently their latest app update allows Americans to book in London. You'd think that was the simplest thing and that should have been done years ago, but there you go. It's done now, and this allows the app to become global. There's more things around languages as well so that if you go to book a restaurant in Germany and you're from the United States, you'll be able to see the menu and the product in English. And that's the kind of work that's going on and as that re-platforming gets done and we expect that work to be done in this year, then we have some amazing tools to be able to offer both the software proposition to restaurants as well as the demand proposition. You'll see on Booking.com, for instance, if you search New York, we've got a beautiful little ad there that says, hey, book a restaurant in New York for OpenTable, those things we found to be positive experiments. So that's where we are. I'm optimistic. I think ultimately there is a traveler network effect, restaurants are more local business than say hotel staying of course, but on the other hand, transient travelers are extremely valuable to restaurants. I man, selling those last few tables can often be the difference between making money and not making money and they realize that those travelers have choice and they're relatively not near as informed as maybe local people and we think that's a valuable business. And we're seeing good results so far but there's still a lot more work to do. Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thanks Darren. Darren Richard Huston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Naved Khan with Cantor Fitzgerald. You may begin. Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities : Thanks. The growth in properties continues to be pretty strong. Darren, can you add some color as to where you are adding more properties, which regions you see more strength in? Darren Richard Huston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, okay. Thanks, Naved. So, the really important math here is the diversity in properties and rooms. And we talked about the 22.6 million rooms we have on our website. In Europe, we are actually still adding a lot of properties but because this is our most mature market those properties are becoming smaller and smaller. By the way they are still tremendously valuable because all of these smaller properties add tremendous diversity to our accommodation base, therefore being able to fit very specific needs. They also help us in low availability times. If there's a conference or something, these properties could help fill demand when you're in a supply-constrained environment. So Europe is a lot of properties that are getting smaller and smaller, and that's the nature of the European business. For instance, in Italy at a time we're adding 100 properties a day because these are very small properties in small places, kind of mom-and-pop operated type product. In other parts of the world, we're still adding many large, multi-room. I think India and China, in particular. China, we've entered the year with about 6,500 properties, exited the year with 35,000 properties, a lot of that was organically built. In China we have a lot more to do just adding really large hotels and properties. The challenge in China is making sure you have enough domestic demand to fill those. Inbound China is not a huge market, but domestic China is a huge market. And we're filling those beds through partnerships within China including our relationship with Ctrip. India is another one that just seems to have unending potential for us and we are busy there building out that marketplace. I'd say another part of the world is Africa, Central America; these are areas still where we're adding hotels. But at some point, we will have most of the world's hotels and then there's still a lot of extra property count in these single-owner, single-apartment type products, almost endless to some degree it seems. But we're having to add those a room/property at a time and that's obviously important and tough work. Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities : Okay. That's very helpful. And then one follow up, earlier in your previous calls, Darren, you've talked about how Europeans were sort of more inclined to stay within Europe just because of maybe FX becoming somewhat of a headwind to travel abroad. What kind of flows are you seeing in terms of tourism or people sort of, staying within boundaries or not? Darren Richard Huston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Thanks, Naved. There's two effects we always see of currency. One is the absolute level of the currency and the other issue is volatility. And a lower euro has a big impact, but it's also the movement in the euro because people need to get used to the fact that the euro is now a $1.11 and no longer $1.35. So we certainly see now that the euro has stabilized that that's had a positive impact on year-over-year base of Europeans starting to travel back to America, starting to travel to the UK, starting to travel to higher currency zones. I think the other point that Dan made, the KAYAK data, that shows that flights are down 15% year-over-year; that actually plays into the travel budget as well. So we're seeing more positive flows of Europeans into these higher currency markets. It certainly hasn't recovered to the time of the $1.35 euro, but it's more positive than it was a year ago. That said, intra-EU travel is still \u2013 we're seeing very positive impacts there. There's a number crises in the world, Tunisia, Egypt, even Turkey. The positive there for us is that many of these markets are wholesale package travel markets. We have properties there but they're traditionally sort of the Thomas Cook's, the Tuohy's (33:17) of the world and a lot of that travel is now ending up in Italy and Spain and southern France and that's more of a retail market that plays also to our strength and that's another trend we've been seeing recently. Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray. You may begin. Michael Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Good morning. Just one question, I know you aren't guiding beyond Q1, but high level how are you thinking about go-forward operating margin trends as we lap the acquisitions which could help non-advertising operating leverage balance with dynamics of advertising ROIs and the related impact on advertising expense leverage or deleverage in 2016? Daniel J. Finnegan - Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer : Hi, Mike. We don't have guidance for you beyond Q1, but as we said on previous calls, we expect that we can deliver operating leverage in the non-ad OpEx over time. The business is growing fast, it's scalable and so even with the investments that we're making to drive growth in the future, we think that we can deliver leverage there. Off-line advertising, we're going to heavy up in periods where we think we've got good creative and it's moving the needle for us, but over the long term we expect that we would have leverage there too. We'll hit a level of spending that we think is the right level in a market and we'll hit the number of markets that we think we should be in and then our business should continue to grow faster than our spend would. So then the biggest expense is also the biggest variable and that's the online advertising. We're very pleased with what we've seen with the efficiency over the last couple of quarters, but we've had three years before that of seeing pressure on that metric and pressure on ROIs year-over-year. And so it's difficult to predict what will happen there for the future. I have great confidence that we are probably better positioned than anybody else in the market with the most choices to try and convert that paid traffic into a booking on the best websites, the best converting websites from a desktop and mobile perspective with the most clever advertising teams really tailoring our bidding approach and using best-in-class tools to make sure that we spend our money efficiently. So I like our competitive hand there, but I think that it's very difficult to predict exactly how it's going to play out in the future. We have a couple of good quarters in the books there. Michael Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Thank you. Daniel J. Finnegan - Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. You may begin. Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Let me try two questions please. Booking.com for Business, it's something that seems to be \u2013 I mean, you've had it for a while but you maybe have emphasized it a little bit more these last two quarters, so could you talk about the growth strategy there and how material that is to business today? And then secondly, the China outbound market, I know you've called out the Chinese New Year for Q1 and I know this is still a relatively small part of your business, but could you also talk about the materiality there and anything unusual you're seeing in terms of the growth of that segment, particularly the China outbound market? Thank you. Darren Richard Huston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Thanks a lot, Mark. So Booking.com for Business, it's worth giving a little bit of background. So we \u2013 our sites has primarily been targeted at leisure and over time we've seen more customers come in for business purposes. And that's when we started to make some changes to our site and see if we could get positive conversion and that seem to work. So now you can go on to our site and say am I traveling for leisure or business, if you pick business we highlight things important to business people and they seem to like that. We've also discovered that about 20% of our business is business bookings versus leisure bookings. And the thesis of course is that nobody really knows, but maybe half of travels business, it could be more or less than that, but that points to a pretty big opportunity if we serve the customer wealth. So then secondly, we built a very simple tool that allows the systems to book for business people, it allows you to track budgets, it allows a manager to track where all their people are from a care of duty perspective and now we're also optimizing that tool. We are seeing that our business bookings are growing faster than our leisure bookings which means they're taking share on the site, that's what we want to see. But it's a process of optimization in investment and obviously, if you just think of the sheer size of the numbers going from 20% to 50% for instance, that's a huge opportunity, but we're approaching it in a very typical Booking.com Priceline Group way, which is many small steps, lots of optimization. And we are feeling positive. I think it'll be one of those things that continues to contribute. There's no massive revolutionary move, but more an evolutionary optimization and today feeling great about the progress, but a lot more to do. Your second question, China outbound, some of it's hard to pick through because of Chinese New Year, it's just such a big holiday, and you guys have seen the pictures on the Internet and the train stations full of hundreds of thousands of people. It was another great Chinese New Year, but the real question is where do things swing out? We did see, let's say, a little bit of softness. Now, with China softness is all relative. It's still a fast-growing market, but a little bit of softness in outbound in kind of Q3, Q4, a strong Chinese New Year, and then we have to see from there where it goes. Obviously, the situation in China and the headlines can also rattle travelers, we haven't seen any large material effect. And I also believe our long-term thesis around China certainly hasn't changed. They are the world's largest outbound travelers, and we're going to continue to try to take a bigger share of that business going forward. Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you, Darren. Darren Richard Huston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. You may begin. Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks. I know chain hotels are a much smaller part of your mix, but Hilton in particular has been kind of vocal over the last few months about ending last room night availability, and MFN pricing. And they now seem to be getting pretty aggressive in marketing their channels against the OTAs. What do you believe is driving these efforts? And are you seeing any other chains beginning to make similar moves? Darren Richard Huston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Heath. Yeah, as you point out, depending on what you call a chain, we booked 10% to 15% of our business as a combination of global and regional chains. And we're always in contract negotiations with the chains. In fact our take rate is quite stable. With many chains we never or had last room availability, but over time they've given us more availability, partly because it's good business. We bring in a transient traveler. Very few of our travelers stay at the same hotel twice. And this is valuable business because it's incremental. I think what you are seeing is discomfort with maybe the way the world is changing, but you should know our relationships are quite tight. There's also a difference between the chain and the owner of the hotel. I mean, the owner of the hotel wants more of this kind of business, and most of them want to lean into our model. For me, the average chain hotel only gets about half of the business that should be coming to us, partly because of all of these restrictions that are put on it. But many chain owners are also agitating to make sure they get their fair share because the business they're not getting is either going to another chain or it's going to an independent hotel. So, yeah, I don't appreciate some of the actions that get taken at the chain level at times, but our relationships on a day-to-day basis are actually quite constructive and cordial, and our Chain business is actually quite healthy. They have great product, our customers want the product. And most of our customers when they come to Washington DC for instance, they're not looking for the Hilton or the Marriott in Washington, they're looking for a great bed in Washington. And our ranking system presents to them business is well priced. And if the product is not well priced or it's not available, it's not going to convert, and therefore it won't be presented to the customer. That's basically the way it works. And I'm always hopeful we can work through many of these issues when they arise. Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks, Darren. I appreciate the color. Darren Richard Huston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may begin. Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Darren, maybe you could comment a little bit about your philosophy on vacation rentals charging the owner as opposed to the renter? Obviously, one of your competitors is going through a transition, why you like that business model? And then Dan, could you quantify at all the Paris impact in Q4? And maybe the Easter impact in Q1? And then Europe really had some good RevPAR over the summer last year. I know you won't guide 2Q or 3Q, but how do you think about those comps in Europe as you approach the summer? Thank you. Darren Richard Huston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks Justin. Our model, partly the reason we get to our model is we default to it. That's the way and our entire business works. But if you look at our take rate in vacation rentals where we are charging the vacation rental owner and HomeAway or Airbnb, we'll charge a lot to the consumer. The take rates are actually quite equivalent when you look at the total take rate. I think anyone would rather charge to the owner, but if you don't have instantly verifiable deal then you might be worried that the owner is going to say, well, the person never showed up or he didn't stay or we didn't close the transaction. So we're actually in an enviable position to be able to do it the way we do. Obviously, I don't think I've ever met a consumer who likes to pay fees, and we're betting that consumers won't want to pay fees, but more importantly what we're trying to do is make booking a vacation rental or a home or an apartment as easy as booking a hotel room with the same level of trust, with the same feeling like you're going to get what you pay for. There's no post-negotiation on price, which happens sometimes on an on-request model. There's no post-negotiation. Maybe I want you to stay, or actually my room is not available now. And I believe that's where the model will ultimately end up. Getting from where we are today to where we need to there's certainly still a lot of friction, but we're finding pretty positive response to this model and it also, I think, is a nice way to set expectations with both the booker and the place that they're booking. And so we're sticking with that model. It seems to be working for us, but still a lot of work to do. But we're playing sort of a long game here that I think that more experience-centric friction-free models are the future versus how the business is being done today. Daniel J. Finnegan - Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer : And then your other question, Justin. So Paris impact, I did say in my prepared remarks that we saw about two or three weeks after the attack where our global room night growth rate dropped by more than 10 percentage points. And that was a combination of less people booking and significant increase in cancellations of bookings or that were already in our system. But then such a solid bounce back in December and such a great quarter overall from a top line and bottom line perspective that we didn't go and try to quantify any kind of an EBITDA impact to report to you. I don't feel like there's really anything to explain there, so I feel good with the quarter that we delivered despite the impact. For Easter, we don't have a number there either. I mean, there's a lot of travel that happens right around Easter and we expect that that will move from Q2 last year into Q1, but there are other breaks that people get that are just kind of around the time of Easter, or \u2013 I know for my kids, their break is still going to be in April this year, so I don't know that we could precisely quantify for you the exact impact there. But it is beneficial to revenue in Q1. It will be a little bit of a detriment to revenue in Q2. From a gross profit perspective \u2013 sorry, gross bookings perspective, it's probably a little bit net negative to Q1 and that during that period where people are traveling the bookings really drop off to a lower level because they're not booking while they're traveling. So that is the way to think about that in terms of gross bookings. And then summer comps, yeah, it was a very strong summer season for us. It's too early to predict now. We're not giving guidance for summer, but we said in our prepared remarks we feel pretty good about the macro travel environment right now and hope that will continue into the summer and paired with lower fuel prices, lower airline ticket prices, hopefully mean some good tailwinds for summer travel. Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you. Daniel J. Finnegan - Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. You may begin. Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to go back, Dan, to the comments kind of post-Paris and the 10 points of impact that you mentioned, and just in particular was there something that you can point out that drove such a strong bounce back in terms of business? And was there anything that you guys did marketing or promotion-wise that really contributed there? And then secondly if you could give us an update on the BookingSuite business as well? Thanks. Daniel J. Finnegan - Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer : So in terms of Paris, there was nothing \u2013 I mean, our approach with advertising day in and day out is very consistent. So we're looking to generate as much business as we can at a reasonable ROI, and we didn't change anything that caused the trajectory of the business to change. That was consistent. And I think it's just amazing the resilience of people, that even a horrific event like those attacks in Paris, in a relatively short amount of time people became comfortable again with the idea of traveling. Paris still isn't back to where it was pre-attack for us as a share of our business, but has bounced back from where it was. And so I think we benefit also from being a global player with so many different choices where people can travel to, but if they're not comfortable with a particular destination they can find other places where they may feel more comfortable with traveling. So really just the resilience would be the one thing that we'd point to that, thank God there were no additional attacks and so the business bounced back. Darren Richard Huston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: On Just on BookingSuite, we feel really good about the business. We don't have any numbers to share for competitive reasons. But we've built up a team, we added a new product, PriceMatch, it's a revenue management cloud-based tool, in 2015, which has been a nice addition. But generally, the demand for the product is very high and it's been as much an issue, how do we fulfill the demand for the team. But I'm proud of where it's at and we hope 2016 will be another big year for BookingSuite. Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you, both. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Ken Sena with Evercore Partners. You may begin. Ken Sena - Evercore Group LLC : Hi. Thank you. Can you maybe just, in terms of the bookings acceleration, talk a little bit more maybe about the vacation rental contribution, and maybe the opportunity there? And then anything on the hotel room night side also? And then you mentioned that IB for TripAdvisor won't be a significant, it won't offer significant impact to the top line or add efficiency, but maybe can you expand on that a bit from a branding standpoint and how satisfied you are with the partnership right now, or the product? Thank you. Darren Richard Huston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think I can take both of those, Ken. Well, on vacation rentals generally, and I would say self-catered product, as well is what we call it, this includes apartments and homes and aparthotels, that part of the market has traditionally had a lot more friction in it than the hotel booking side. And as that friction gets removed you begin to see growth. Certainly, there is the Airbnb effect of this being a new way to travel, but more importantly for large groups, families; booking a self-catered product or a home is actually a really good deal, the price value equation looks great. But it's always had all kinds of friction around, well, is it going be there? Where does my money go? They want a deposit, et cetera, et cetera. And as we remove those points of friction, we're seeing good growth in that area. I don't have any numbers to share but that space is growing faster than our core business, which is what you would hope. And we feel like we have plenty of demand as we get ready supply to fill those rooms with guests who are looking for them. The other question was on Instant Book, yeah, it's still very early days, but we're happy with the way that TripAdvisor has fulfilled their side of the deal. The branding looks great. It seems to, particularly in the U.S. market where the early rollout has been, where the Booking.com brand is not as strong, I think that's helped us a lot. They're now rolling out in the markets maybe where we're stronger, maybe we'll help them a bit, where our brand might even be stronger than TripAdvisor's. But I think from a mutual perspective, it's been positive. There's a lot yet to optimize, but we sort of think about it as, wow, we've got an ad and we have a performance tool to drive more business and that's always a real positive thing for the company. I'm still, by the way, optimistic, still very supportive and let's see where things end up as Steve and his team get to roll this product out to more markets. Ken Sena - Evercore Group LLC : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. You may begin. Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks for taking the questions; two if I can. First, just there's been a lot of changes in rate parity regulations in France and Germany and wondering if you guys are seeing any discernible trends in how hotels in France may be responding to the Macron Law, how it's impacting conversion and how you think this ultimately plays out in the E.U.? And then second question, similar, the Innovation Box tax regime in the Netherlands seems like it's in a bit of flux, can you just give us a sense of how much of your pre-tax income flows through at the reduced tax rate and how you think either rates or the magnitude of the shield are likely to change over the next few years? Or perhaps maybe grandfathering gives you a long period of time before you see this, any comments on either of those? Darren Richard Huston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. I will take the first one, Dan you take the second. We haven't seen any major impacts, but it's been a great experimental bed and I think one of the biggest learnings, and I had mentioned this in a previous comment, is customers aren't going to overpay for product. So if the properties are free to price the product the way they went to price it, but if it's overpriced then it won't convert and then they don't get any business. So in a way, the marketplace has this self-actualization to it, regardless of what the rules are. We still believe parity is a very important construct. We think it frankly offers a lot of opportunity also for the properties to have a level playing field so that we're not using our margins to undercut them. But I'm now more comfortable with any regime that people realize that if you want to get bookings on Booking, you have to have a well-priced product, and the marketplace deals with that. And if you don't, then nothing sells. Conversion goes down. Your ranking goes down, and then you don't get any business. So it's been interesting. All of our checks would say that parity in France is at least if not more healthy than most of our markets in the world. And I think that's overall good news. Daniel J. Finnegan - Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer : And Lloyd, on your second question, Innovation Box, the 10-K will be out shortly and quantifies that exactly. So I'm going to leave it to the 10-K to take care that one for you. It's a significant benefit for us, as you point out. We have a risk factor in our 10-K that I'll also point you to that clearly delineates what we see as the risks related to the Innovation Box. We need to continue to qualify as being innovative, and we need to receive extensions from the Dutch tax authorities. We've done well with that since the advent of the Innovation Box. So I feel confident there. And then there's also developments at the OECD, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, where they're looking to harmonize tax treatment across European Union. And one of the things they're taking into consideration is these Innovation Box type regimes. And they've talked about doing away with them sometime in 2021. So that's certainly a risk out there. 2021 is still a long way away and tax is still subject to change, rates could change, and the OECD's interpretations could change. So those are the things that you should look to and, again, I'd refer you to the specific wording in the 10-K. Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, guys. Daniel J. Finnegan - Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo Securities. You may begin. Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions; a couple of quick ones. First, regarding the bidding program that allows your hotel partners to improve their ranking in the results, wondering if you could comment on the appetite you're seeing for that in the market? And is participation large enough here to impact blended take rates? Or is it really kind of a non-material service offering that you're presenting to the market? And secondly quickly, any expectation for negative impact due to Zika virus fears? Thanks. Darren Richard Huston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay, Peter. So the first one I'll take. I think, first of all, it's important to understand how the ranking algorithm works. The primary driver of helping us get ranked is conversion. So it really is consumer interest, and you always have to be very careful on how you balance monetization with consumer interest, because if you overweight on monetization you can have a really poor quality result and then no one once wants to come to your website. So at least the way we've done it in the past is we have standard hotels and preferred hotels, and preferred hotels are only allowed to become preferred if they meet a number of experience criteria. And then they pay us a slightly higher commission and can often as much as double their bookings by being preferred. That's been our primary driver. The second one, we do allow some override, they're not used broadly, but a hotel can pay us even more commissions if they want. Say, it's a new hotel, they don't have a lot of reviews or something to try to get a slightly higher ranking, but we never allow them ultimately to buy the very top of the ranking from the very bottomed. It doesn't work that way. So we feel comfortable with the model that we have. I think it's a very \u2013 like in any auction site, you have to be really careful with this dial, because you think you might win a monetization, but if you crap up the product then you're not going to have any customers. So that's the way I think about it. And your next question was \u2013 Dan, I think you want to take Zika? Yeah. Daniel J. Finnegan - Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer : So Zika virus, Peter, thus far we haven't seen a significant impact. Most of the travel within southern hemisphere is from other destinations in southern hemisphere, so it's generally people traveling from an area that's been impacted to another area that's impacted. And so we haven't seen it as deterring travel. We don't want to predict what the impact could be for the future, but that's been the impact to-date. Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks so much. Daniel J. Finnegan - Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the Q&A session. I will now turn the call back to Darren Huston. Darren Richard Huston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I guess just in conclusion, we're really pleased with the quarter. I hope you are. It's nice to end the year where we're growing faster than when we entered the year at our size and scale. We always are facing the law of large numbers, but a big thanks to all of our people and mostly just great execution and seeing a lot of growth initiatives begin to pay off is a great feeling. So thanks all for joining the call, and we'll see you next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thanks for your participation, and have a wonderful day.",

And now, I'd like to introduce The Priceline Group's speakers for this afternoon, Jeffery Boyd; and Daniel Finnegan. Go ahead, gentlemen. Jeffery H. Boyd - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you very much and welcome to The Priceline Group's second (sic) [first] quarter conference call. I'm joined today by our Priceline Group's CFO, Dan Finnegan, in our Norwalk office before the market opens this morning in New York. The Group performed well in the quarter and we made good progress executing against our key initiatives. The Group reported consolidated gross bookings for the second (sic) [first] quarter of approximately $16.7 billion, up about 26% on a constant currency basis or about 21% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. Gross profit was up 21% or about 27% on a constant currency basis, and adjusted EBITDA was also up 27% to $676 million. And finally, non-GAAP earnings per share were $10.54, up 30% versus the prior year, surpassing our guidance for the quarter. GAAP earnings per share were $7.47, up 17% versus the prior year. Our U.S. dollar denominated growth rates were again impacted by the strong dollar, but less than we have experienced in previous quarters. Our customers booked accommodation reservations for 137 million room nights in the quarter, up 31% year-over-year, reflecting acceleration for the second consecutive quarter. We are pleased with this consistent robust growth in reservations, which reflects continued solid execution in the market for global travel. Booking.com continues to not only grow its accommodation supply, but also increase its penetration within its supply base. Booking.com's platform now has approximately 900,000 hotels and other accommodations in over 220 countries and territories, up 31% over last year. This platform also includes 422,000 instantly bookable vacation rental properties, which grew 40% year-over-year. We believe this inventory of unique properties represents an important source of future growth for the business, particularly when we can offer it with the best dynamic booking experience and great customer service. While our core business remains strong, Booking.com continues to invest in the future through innovation; for example, providing a rich customer experience for customers early in the travel planning process. Booking's new Passion Search is a unique search tool that helps our customers find and experience their true passions, with rich content and an elegant interface. We also remain focused and committed to helping our business customers with their unique travel needs. Booking.com for business had another successful quarter in extending its services from individual business travelers to small and medium-sized businesses. We are seeing solid growth in business bookers and Booking.com will continue to innovate and develop new tools to help these customers travel more easily and efficiently. priceline.com's results continue to be impacted by pressure on its opaque business due to greater marketplace competition in hotel discounting. Substantial investment in technology and people are underway to drive improvements to product, user interface and experiment velocity, and a new brand campaign launched in the first quarter aims at a more broadly-appealing message and brand promise. Cost discipline contributed to a good bottom line quarter for Agoda. As they push their pace of experimentation and innovation, they are positioning the platform for continued expansion. As mobility remains critically important across all of Agoda's primary Asian markets, we are pleased to note that the share of mobile transactions on Agoda is among the highest of the Group's travel businesses. KAYAK finished the quarter posting solid growth in queries, revenue and profit. Like our other brands, the pace of experimentation and innovation remains fast. Development around core search processing and functionality, mobile enhancements and new products all advanced during the quarter. We remain convinced that KAYAK's product breadth will continue to differentiate their services in the marketplace. Turning to our rental car services, rental car days grew 11% year-over-year for the Group. The largest contributor of this total, Rentalcars.com, executed another solid quarter despite challenges in some of its largest markets. OpenTable had a good quarter in its core U.S. business and continued adding restaurants to its cloud-based solution. OpenTable continues to make progress developing its technology platform for scaled international expansion and working with companies in the Group to test cross-promotion opportunities. In summary, the Group had a strong first quarter, led by its international hotel business. Bottom line results were aided by an early Easter and a shift of brand marketing expense from Q1 to Q2. The second quarter will be negatively affected by the seasonal Easter shift and by year-over-year increases in brand and performance-based marketing that represent important investments in building the business and our brands but will pressure operating leverage in the quarter, as you can see from our guidance. We do not believe that the higher expenses associated with the launch of new brand campaigns in the second quarter necessarily represents the long-term run rate for the business. Our outlook is also forecasting weakness in hotel average daily rates, which is representative of volatility in macro market conditions. Finally, while the circumstances of my return to the business as Interim CEO are unfortunate, I'm looking forward to working with our talented brand leadership, including Gillian Tans, who I congratulate on her promotion to CEO of Booking.com, as we continue moving our business forward. We believe the business is well-positioned to build on its long record of solid financial performance. I would like to thank our employees around the world for their hard work and dedication. I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review. Daniel J. Finnegan - Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer : Thanks, Jeff. I'll discuss operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the second quarter of 2016. All growth rates referenced in my comments are compared to the prior year comparable period, unless otherwise indicated. Q1 was an exceptionally strong quarter for The Priceline Group, with acceleration in room night growth to 31% compared to 27% in Q4. We also had solid operating margin performance. Growth was strong across all demand channels and key geographic regions. Rental car days grew by 11% in Q1, consistent with the Q4 growth rate. Average daily rates for accommodations, or ADRs, for Q1 were down slightly versus prior year on a constant currency basis for the consolidated Group, which was below our forecast that ADRs would be up by about 1%. Foreign exchange rates again presented a headwind to our growth rate expressed in U.S. dollars due to the strong dollar. Our Q1 gross bookings grew by 21% expressed in U.S. dollars but grew by about 26% on a constant currency basis compared to prior year. Gross profit for the quarter for The Priceline Group was $2 billion and grew by 21% in U.S. dollars and by about 27% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. Gross profit growth was helped by Easter falling in Q1 this year versus Q2 last year. We estimate that the early Easter timing shifted about $40 million of gross profit and adjusted EBITDA into Q1 that would have been recognized in Q2 if Easter fell in Q2 as it did last year. The timing shift benefits are Q1 gross profit, operating profit, adjusted EBITDA, net income and operating margins and will exert pressure on those metrics in Q2 in both cases compared to the prior year. Our gross profit take rate, representing the amount we earn in commission or gross margin relative to the gross bookings generated through our websites, continues to be stable as it has been for quite some time now. Our international operations generated gross profit of $1.7 billion, which grew by 23% in U.S. dollars and by about 31% on a constant currency basis compared to prior year. Gross profit for our U.S. operations amounted to $296 million which represented 7% growth versus prior year. Growth versus prior year Q1 was negatively impacted by a favorable travel transaction tax court ruling in the amount of $16.4 million included in Q1 2015 gross profit. Advertising and other revenue, which is mainly comprised of revenues for KAYAK and OpenTable, grew by 21% in Q1 compared to the prior year. Operating income grew by 27%, non-GAAP operating income grew by 28% and non-GAAP operating margins exceeded our guidance and increased by 152 bps compared to Q1 last year. Operating margins for Q1 2016 compared to the prior year Q1 were favorably impacted by the aforementioned Easter timing and phasing of brand advertising shifting into Q2. Solid ROIs for performance marketing were better than our guidance forecast. As highlighted in more detail on our soon-to-be-filed 10-Q, in Q1 we changed from presenting online and offline advertising to performance advertising and brand advertising. As a result, brand advertising done in online channels, such as YouTube and Facebook and display advertising, is now combined with offline advertising and presented as brand advertising. We think the new presentation is helpful to investors as it distinguishes between performance marketing that is typically managed on an ROI basis and brand advertising, which is typically managed to a planned level of spend. Non-advertising operating expenses were also favorable to our forecast and generated margin leverage compared to prior year in part due to the gross profit benefit of earlier Easter this year. Adjusted EBITDA for Q1 amounted to $676 million, which exceeded the top end of our guidance range of $620 million and grew by 27% versus prior year. Net income increased by 12% and fully diluted EPS by 17%. Non-GAAP net income increased by 24%, and non-GAAP EPS grew by 30%, including increased interest expense from our 2015 bond offerings and the beneficial impact of lower share count from stock repurchases. GAAP net income in Q1 includes a non-cash charge in the amount of $50.4 million related to an other than temporary impairment in the value of our cost method investment in Hotel Urbano based on the performance of the business, which has been impacted by the deteriorating economic and political situation in Brazil. We excluded the impairment charge from adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS, because it is not driven by core operating results and renders comparisons with prior periods less meaningful. In terms of cash flow, we generated $344 million of cash from operations during first quarter 2016, which is about 65% above last year. We used our cash during the quarter to repurchase 202,000 shares of our common stock for $259 million. CapEx amounted to $53 million. Our cash and investments amounted to about $11 billion at March 31, 2016 with about $700 million of that balance in the U.S. Now, for Q2 guidance, gross bookings have continued to grow strongly across all channels and key geographic regions thus far in Q2, but growth has decelerated compared to Q1. Our guidance assumes that our growth rates will decelerate further as we progress through the quarter, mainly due to the size of our business and consistent with long-term trends. In addition, we believe that the EURO CUP and earlier timing this year for Ramadan will negatively impact our year-over-year growth rate in June. Our Q2 forecast is based upon recent foreign exchange rates and assumes that our growth rates in U.S. dollars will not be significantly impacted by foreign exchange rate fluctuations. This is the first quarter in quite a while where FX is not expected to be a headwind. For Q2 guidance, we are forecasting booked room nights to grow by 15% to 22% and total gross bookings to grow by 11% to 18% in U.S. dollars and on a constant currency basis. Our Q2 forecast assumes that constant currency accommodation ADRs for the consolidated Group will be down by about 1% compared to the prior year period. Our forecast for decreasing ADRs relates to the shifts in the geographic mix of our business, ADR weakness in markets experiencing soft demand due to travel or safety concerns and the impact on demand of economic weakness in certain international markets. Not surprisingly, these conditions have also resulted in elevated cancellation rates. We expect Q2 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 7% to 14%. We expect gross profit to grow by 9% to 16% in U.S. dollars and on a constant currency basis. The difference between forecasted gross bookings and gross profit growth relates to the lag between the timing of reservation booking and travel. A meaningful portion of the bookings recorded in Q2 are expected to benefit our gross profit in Q3 when summer travel takes place. We expect about 575 bps of deleverage in non-GAAP operating margins compared to prior year, expressed as non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of gross profit. Almost half of the margin pressure is due to the shift of Easter gross profit into Q1 and significantly increased brand advertising associated with the launch of new ad campaigns. Consistent with prior years, operating leverage is also pressured by investments in non-ad OpEx for our accommodation reservation business to be ready for peak travel season and future growth. Although, we occasionally experience periods of lumpiness in the growth of brand advertising and non-advertising OpEx investments, which can pressure margins as our guidance assumes for Q2, we expect over the longer-term to have operating leverage in these two expense categories. Finally, margins are also impacted by our assumptions for performance advertising efficiency. Our performance advertising return on investment has been solid thus far in the quarter, but as usual our forecast assumes deterioration from current levels and provides us with flexibility in a dynamic market to follow our consistent approach of advertising our brands at reasonable ROIs. Our adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $740 million and $795 million, which, at the midpoint, is down 5% versus prior year. Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately 16% comprised of international income taxes and alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S. We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $11.60 to $12.50 per share, which at the midpoint is down 3% versus prior year. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 50.6 million shares based upon yesterday's closing stock price and reflects the beneficial impact of the common stock repurchases we made in 2015 and Q1 2016. We forecast GAAP EPS between $9.35 and $10.25 per share for Q2. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed in our earnings release. Consistent with past practice, we have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our second quarter EBITDA net earnings from any further fluctuation in the euro and British pound versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter. Our forecast does not assume any significant change in macroeconomic conditions in general, or in the travel market in particular. We'll now take your questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question is from Tom White with Macquarie. You may begin. Tom White - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. Thank you for taking my question. Just on the hotel room night guidance and the deceleration there, you talked a little bit about the soccer tournament and Ramadan. I'm just curious if the differences in kind of the geographic seasonality of your business maybe is increasingly playing a role here, given that some of your faster growing geographies like Asia have peak travel in kind of 4Q and 1Q versus the middle part of the year? And then just secondly on the increased brand campaign spend, could you maybe just give a little bit of color? Is that sort of increase in spend in kind of countries where you guys are already advertising? Is it rolling out the campaign to new markets and new languages? Any detail there? Thank you. Jeffery H. Boyd - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. So maybe I'll take the second question and Dan can handle the first. With respect to the increased brand spend, an important part of that is a new advertising campaign for Booking.com here in the United States. Booking's product has enjoyed good growth and consumer acceptance, and we're very, very happy to be increasing our investment in building its market position and supporting that growth. There's no end (19:13) new market that represents a significant portion of that increased spend. Daniel J. Finnegan - Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer : And then as far as geographic mix goes, Tom, what I said in my prepared comments was for Q1 and Q2, we're happy with the growth we're seeing across all of our key geographic regions, and that's been the case for quite a while now. So, we've got regions other than Europe growing faster than our consolidated gross rate, typically. Europe, growing a little bit slower, but still posting really solid growth rates. So, the shift in mix amongst regions has been pretty gradual. The impact of EURO CUP has been \u2013 we've seen that in the past as well, and typically what happens, it's the last two weeks of June and the first two weeks of July. So, at the outset, when all the teams are still playing, people are paying attention to the tournament and not necessarily booking travel. As their teams get knocked out and the tournament wraps up, typically people will then book their summer vacation. They're not going to forego their vacation, but it may impact the timing of when they book it. And in terms of Ramadan, we've seen impacts every year. We have a big business in the Middle East and Asia Pacific region. It moves 10 days earlier, and so this year we have 10 extra days in the month of June. Typically at the outset of Ramadan we see a slowing in bookings as Muslims are observing Ramadan, and then at the end of Ramadan we see an uptick in travel, which is beneficial for our business. And that was in July last year and will be in July again this year. Tom White - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Daniel J. Finnegan - Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Eric Sheridan with UBS. You may begin. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just two, one on the measurement advertising side, the performance side, the stable ROI, curious just to understand what you're seeing in the marketplace from a competitive standpoint that informs the decisions and the statements on ROI in performance-based advertising, and how you think about that moving through the rest of the year? And then second on the CEO search, maybe understanding a little bit of what you're aiming for in the CEO search, timing and sort of how we should think about that going forward? Thanks, guys. Jeffery H. Boyd - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Again, maybe I'll answer the second question and then Dan can take the first. Our board, as we said in our public disclosures, is commencing a search straightaway for a long-term successor to me as Interim CEO. We don't have a prediction as to how long that will take, but I think folks can use their common sense to come to some concept of what a search for a position like this could take in terms of time. In terms of the type of person that we're looking for, obviously, we need to have a person who has broad experience and a demonstrated track record of success in managing large global organizations, where technology is a very important part of the business, and where they have demonstrated their ability to deal with changing market conditions successfully. Daniel J. Finnegan - Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer : And on performance advertising, Eric, our approach is consistent with the way we've always handled it. So we're looking to bring traffic to the website at a reasonable return on investment. We've had several years, I guess since the middle of 2012, where we've been under pressure with that metric, and now we've had a few quarters in a row where we've seen ROIs pretty solid \u2013 without categorizing them as better or worse than prior year, pretty neutral. So, much better than the trend we'd before that. For going forward, I feel good about our ability to compete in these variable channels with the number of properties we've got available on our website, the breadth and depth of selection. The work that our marketing teams do to continuously innovate and become more sophisticated in the way we compete within these channels, and then the great work that our front end teams do also to continuously improve conversion on our websites and mobile platforms. Those all are good competitive advantages as we compete in that marketplace. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. You may begin. Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. Just one question on alternative accommodations, could you talk about trends there and you could give out some data on the inventory that you have there, but could you talk about the bookings trends you're seeing and your thoughts on integrating that over time more and more into the core purchase path, if that's something that you want to do? Thank you. Jeffery H. Boyd - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Mark. So, we gave statistics with respect to the increase in the number of properties, vacation properties. In terms of our inventory, those types of properties are growing faster than inventory overall, so the share of available properties is increasing. I want everybody to keep in mind that the number of rentable rooms or units per property for these kinds of accommodations is usually a lot smaller than a typical hotel, and that's something that we've been pointing out now for years. The growth rates that we're seeing with respect to these properties are attractive. They're definitely helping deliver the kind of 31% year-over-year room night growth that we saw in the first quarter and as I said in my prepared remarks, we view this sector of the market as a very important source of growth for the business going forward, and our aim here, really, with respect to not just vacation properties but other non-hotel accommodations, is to build the inventory substantially, provide a dynamic booking experience that is superior to any other alternative in the marketplace for these kinds of accommodations and a customer service and customer experience that is consistent with what we've been providing for customers for years and what's made us a leading player in the space. So, I think we couldn't be more enthusiastic about these types of accommodations and we couldn't be more convinced that the product that we're building and the service that we're providing is better than anything else out there in the marketplace. Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Jeff, one quick follow-on on that, on the non-hotel accommodations. Could you just comment on the economics to Priceline of a booking of a non-hotel accommodation versus a regular hotel accommodation? Daniel J. Finnegan - Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer : The take rates are in line with our overall take rate, Mark. Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you, Dan. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. You may begin. Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow up on your comments about the deceleration into 2Q. Could you just help us understand the timing a little bit better here, kind of as you were exiting 1Q and going into 2Q and the degree to which you think that's law of large numbers versus some of the other factors you mentioned specifically into 2Q around security and macro concerns and other? Thanks. Daniel J. Finnegan - Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer : Hi, Doug. So, the growth rate in Q1 at 31% was clearly not sustainable. If you look at the growth we posted for Q1 together with the midpoint that we've guided to for Q2 and kind of average them out, you'd come to about a 25% growth rate year-to-date, which is the growth that we posted for all of 2015. So, I feel pretty good if we can check the box of getting halfway through this year with no deceleration versus last year. When we were asked a lot of questions last quarter about why are you growing so much faster, what are you doing differently, did you figure something out? We said the good news was no, we think that we're just continuing to perform well and the market is healthy. I think that's also the case with what we're seeing now in Q2. We're continuing to perform well. From data that we can monitor, we think that our share in variable channels is stable. The share of business going to us direct is stable. So, I think the growth for Q1 was not sustainable. The growth we've seen thus far in Q2 I categorized in my prepared remarks as I consider it to be strong growth. And as we typically do, we assume that our growth will decelerate as we move through the quarter. We have the couple of external factors with EURO CUP and Ramadan that we're calling out for the month of June, which has caused us to build maybe a little bit more conservatism in, or I'll call it that actually it just reflects the fact that we think that's going to negatively impact our growth for that month. Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks, Dan. Daniel J. Finnegan - Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may begin. Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. A couple of questions. Jeff, welcome back. And why the increase in brand spend in 2Q? And any other initiatives for the company that you're doing this quarter since you've come back? And then it sounds like in the prepared remarks you've had some higher cancellation rates and lower ADRs, so maybe some industry pressure. Talk a little bit about what you are seeing out there. Thank you. Jeffery H. Boyd - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. So, Justin, in terms of the increase in brand spend in Q2, I think typically in this business and more specifically in the United States because of the way demand for travel ramps up, your brand advertising spend usually is heaviest in the first half going into the early part of the third quarter. And then it sort of tends to trend down. So, I think the ramp-up in spending for brand advertising at least in this market is consistent with demand trends. And again, we have a very profitable hotel business that allows us to make these kinds of investments in marketing. And as you know, we have a very strong culture of metric driven management. So you can expect us to look very carefully at the returns on the brand investments to make sure that it's paying off in terms of strengthening our brand and driving traffic to the website. With respect to the market conditions, I think that we all have seen over the last year since the financial crisis what has been essentially a very fragile economic recovery that's been characterized by periods of apparent strength followed by periods of apparent weakness, whether it's driven by headline risk associated with sovereign debt crisis or other political considerations and more recently oil prices. To me, some of the weakness that we're seeing is essentially consistent with the fragility of the economic situation that we've experienced over the long-term. But as Dan mentioned, we have seen in industry statistics at a minimum a deceleration of increasing average daily rates for hotels in a lot of markets around the world. And in our case, what we've seen is on a constant currency basis a reduction, a slight reduction in ADRs for the first time in a long time as well as Dan also mentioned increases in cancellations in certain markets. And so, we wanted to flag that for investors as something that's a component of our forward-looking guidance for top line growth Daniel J. Finnegan - Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer : And just to add on one other point there, Justin, with the ADR decline, I pointed out that mix is also impacting that. So we're seeing strong travel to Russia and APAC's strong as a destination. Those are typically at lower than our average ADRs. We're seeing some weakness in markets like France impacted by terrorism, which is a higher ADR market. So mix is also contributing to that trend in our financials. Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thank you. Daniel J. Finnegan - Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Naved Khan with Cantor Fitzgerald. You may begin. Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities : Yes, hi. Thanks. Curious to know if you guys have seen any impact on your SEO traffic because of the changes that Google made to the search engine results pages this past quarter? Jeffery H. Boyd - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think that our emphasis and the lion's share of our business really comes more from page search than it does from organic search in the travel space in particular. KAYAK and OpenTable may get more business from organic channels but in the OTA space in the Group, it's typically much more of a page search channel than it is an SEO channel. Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities : Okay. And then any impact from TripAdvisor's Instant Book? You guys sort of started participating in that a few months ago. Anything to call out there in terms of trends, what you're seeing in the channel? Daniel J. Finnegan - Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer : Hi, Naved. We didn't call anything out in the prepared remarks because there's really no change from what we said last quarter. So, given the relative size of TripAdvisor to our business, we haven't seen any significant impact to our numbers. Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities : Thank you. Daniel J. Finnegan - Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Ken Sena with Evercore. You may begin. Ken Sena - Evercore Group LLC : Hi. Just going back to the ADR question, you mentioned change in geographic mix, some safety concerns and also some macro weakness. But can you also attribute it to just growth overall in alternative accommodations, whether your own in terms of the strong room night growth or competitors like Airbnb? And then also when you're thinking about the alternative accommodations market, is there more you can say as far as how you're segmenting it in terms of whether it's managed by property managers or for rental by owner or other, just to kind of give us a sense of how you view the addressable market? Thank you. Jeffery H. Boyd - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Ken, on the ADR side, no significant impact on our overall blended ADRs from our increasing share of vacation rentals. And it's still fairly early days in the vacation rental space and we've got teams of people at Booking.com that are continuing to innovate and grow that business. Right now, it's mostly through property managers but we are going to continue to add properties there and we're looking to make our tools easier for single property owners to also be able to participate. So we're going to continue to advance there, but right now it's mostly property managers. Ken Sena - Evercore Group LLC : Thank you very much. Jeffery H. Boyd - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. You may begin. Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. As you guys kind of ramp up your brand advertising spend this quarter, I think you characterized YouTube and Facebook as part of that bucket. So wondering if those channels have a good measurable ROI such that you can really scale up those spend and track the results or if kind of moving into that brand bucket suggests it's a less direct impact? And then a second if I can. Jeff, you're coming back after two years of perhaps thinking about the space from a more strategic level, so wondering if you can just kind of give us your views on what you think the biggest changes have been in the space in general and the position of Priceline over the last couple of years and kind of your outlook on the space as a whole going forward? That would be great. Thanks. Jeffery H. Boyd - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. So, Lloyd, thank you for those questions. In terms of online brand spend, that's something that has grown in brands around the Group in the last couple of years. And it does provide the opportunity for different ways of measuring effectiveness, and at least in our view, in some cases more effective ways to measure the effectiveness of your brand spend. So, I'm actually very optimistic that moving of brand spend to those channels has the potential to help us drive better long-term returns on investment on our brand spending. But at this point in time it's not being measured like performance-based advertising, where you're looking at the same session, unit economics divided by cost per click kind of thing. It's just not those kind of measurements, and so I don't want to represent that we are or ultimately will be looking at it the same way. But I think it bodes well for our ability to better manage our brand spending over time. With respect to, from a higher level, the changes that we're seeing in the space, I think that I continue to be very impressed by the size and the scope of the opportunity that The Priceline Group and others in our space have in front of us. Year after year, good execution is rewarded when demand goes to new distribution channels. When you look at the importance of two businesses that you just mentioned in terms of sources of demand, YouTube and Facebook and others, it's an opportunity for companies that can execute quickly and well to diversify and build on their demand. I also continue to be impressed by how attractive the global nature of the business is and the scale that we've developed, and in particular Booking.com has developed, that just gives us an opportunity in markets around the world to build really big businesses despite the turmoil that characterizes not only the world economy but the political situation around the world. And one thing that has impressed me about this business since I started running it as Chief Operating Officer of priceline.com in late 2000 is the resiliency of our businesses in the face of some of these challenges, which is not to say that we don't see the impact of terrorism or financial crisis. We absolutely see it. The economic cycles do affect our business, but time after time after time they recover quickly and they build because of the very substantial tailwinds that we have benefiting us in terms of movement of this activity from offline channels to online channels, the growth of economic activity and middle-class spending in emerging markets around the world and finally the ability of our talented teams around the world to improve the edge we have in trying to drive demand in these channels. I hope that's responsive to your question. Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes, it's very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray. You may begin. Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Hey, good morning. So you're giving some fairly specific reasons for Q2 bookings growth being a bit below expectations with Easter and Ramadan, and maybe some macro issues impacting ADR. So I just want to make sure that outside of those you're not seeing any changes in competitive dynamics like alternative accommodations growth, Hotel Direct potentially getting more aggressive, metasearch gaining a higher share of direct traffic or other OTAs getting share or any other factors that are impacting your bookings. In other words, is it fair to say that the more cautious booking outlook is entirely market or timing-based versus competitive issues? Thanks. Jeffery H. Boyd - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No, I don't think that the deceleration that we're pointing to here has really anything to do with competitive factors in the marketplace. We obviously have a number of brands that are out there, and I think it's fair to say that not each one of them has the exact same competitive strength and positioning, but as we look at the share of the business that we're getting from major distribution channels, we feel very comfortable that we're holding or gaining share. When we look at what's happening in alternative accommodations, and particularly the growth that Airbnb is advertising in the marketplace, I personally think that represents an opportunity for us because we're in a position to build our business in that space and to drive very substantial demand to those properties to convert them with an experience that's great for the customer and profitable for us. So, I view that as a net substantial positive in terms of marketplace conditions for the Group. Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. You may begin. Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Just the first one, going back to the branded campaign in the U.S. around Booking.com, I guess I'd be curious to hear about learnings you have on U.S. in Booking.com the past couple of years, what you think has worked, what has been more challenging? And what drives the decision to kind of further increase branded ad spend to grow rather than use your paid search expertise to kind of continue taking share? And then secondly, just an update on OpenTable, kind of how we can think about an OpenTable rollout in Europe or next big milestones to look for this year? Thanks. Jeffery H. Boyd - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Thank you. With respect to branding and branding spend in the United States, I would start off by saying that we are very pleased with the progress that Booking.com has made in building its business and in building its brand in the United States. From time to time, we've given some insight into what our overall growth rate is in the United States and we're not providing that color today, but I will say that we are pleased with the absolute and relative rates of growth of the Booking.com business here in the United States. We were very pleased with the results of the original brand launch on television of Booking.com in the United States and saw a demonstrable impact in terms of not just awareness, but also the business and ultimately the total cost that we experienced to drive customers as a whole were attractive to us. As to why brand spending versus performance-based marketing, in the United States it's a different market than international markets. First of all, our competition has very substantial share of voice on television. And if you don't participate, you are conceding awareness and ultimately demand to your competition. And when you think about the size of the U.S. market in terms of population and the travel market, and the fact that it's a homogeneous market that you can advertise to with one campaign across the country, it really makes sense to have brand advertising here. And I think that strategy is spot on. And as we said in our prepared remarks, having a push associated with the new campaign is not something that's going to happen every quarter of every year, but we think it's a solid and sound strategy to continue to build awareness for our brand, which today, research is available everywhere under indexes in terms of awareness with other major travel brands in the space. In terms of OpenTable and their plans to expand internationally, I think I said in my prepared remarks that there's a technology job to do in terms of revisions to their tech platform that make international expansion easy versus having to build a new platform in every different country, and that work is underway. And I think once it's completed, we'll be in a better position to essentially build on the international footprint that we have as a Group in helping OpenTable bring its product overseas. I'll mention that they have done some work in Australia on a preliminary basis to try to understand what the potential impact of that is. And while it's very small and very early days, we think it's showing us that this strategy is the right strategy to help build out the brand. Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Daniel Powell with Goldman Sachs. You may begin. Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Actually it's Heath Terry. Just wanted to get a sense with the EBITDA coming in about $50 million above the high end of your guidance for Q1, is there any reason that wasn't invested back into driving booking growth even into Q2? Just curious if the returns that you were seeing on incremental spend were lower than your threshold, if there was something beyond that? And then I also realize it's extremely early, but we've now had Marriott, Hyatt, Hilton and InterContinental all announce lower rates and other benefits for people that book direct. Do you foresee any impact to that even if it's just to your business with those chains? Jeffery H. Boyd - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Why don't I do the second one and Dan will do the first. With respect to the major hotel chains, a couple of things to keep in mind. First is, just say at the outset that our relationships with hotels in particular and with the hotel chains is an important part of who we are as a Group that we have a traditional supply of friendliness of bringing demand to our hotel partners at very low distribution costs. And in particular because of the international footprint of our business, we uniquely can provide access to demand around the world that even the most sophisticated chains cannot access themselves because they don't have the functionality, the language capabilities or the distribution capabilities that we have on a global basis. So, we're providing a little bit of a different and, and at least in my judgment, more valuable service to our hotel partners really than anybody else in this space. With respect to their efforts to drive traffic directly to their website, it's understandable. They have a strong desire to strengthen their brands, and we understand that. On the other hand, we believe our customers are entitled to competitive pricing and the best availability that is out there for intermediaries, because we provide the largest business to most of the hotels that we work with. So, we try to maintain that balance. I think people should keep in mind that the share of business that The Priceline Group does with the chains is relatively small. It's not like it used to be for Priceline when the chains for the U.S. business were such a major part of the whole. It's really a much smaller part of the business. And ultimately for any hotel that wants to maximize the benefit they get from working with our brands, the most important things are going to be their pricing, their content, their availability, the competitiveness of the offer that we can show to our customers. Daniel J. Finnegan - Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer : And, Heath, in terms of the EBITDA over-performance in Q1, we typically don't manage our brand spending that way, so we don't say, okay, we over-performed, therefore let's just churn a lot more money into advertising. Our performance advertising approach has been very consistent over many years now. It's consistent in Q1 and Q2 with what it has been in the past. In terms of the brand advertising, timing was more in Q2 than Q1 based upon when the campaigns were available to roll for Booking.com and for priceline.com. It was a strategic decision to hold back a little bit on running the campaign until we were further along with the tech platform relaunch. So, we're trying to spend what we think is the right amount to build our brands for the long-term rather than overspending because we had some over-performance in EBITDA in a quarter. Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Daniel J. Finnegan - Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Kevin Kopelman with Cowen and Company. You may begin. Kevin Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks a lot. So you quantified the Easter impact for us of $40 million. Can you help us just think about how large the EURO CUP and Ramadan impacts are? And then also the brand campaign, if you could quantify that for us? Thanks. Daniel J. Finnegan - Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer : Yes, so we're not going to quantify the Ramadan and EURO CUP impact. But I will say growth is strong thus far out of the gate and we typically then assume that growth will decelerate as we move through the quarter given the size of the business. There's no change in our approach there, and then we factored in a, what I would say overall for the quarter, is a relatively small impact related to the two specific issues. And then the brand spending, what we said is that the deleverage in Q2, almost half of it is driven by a combination of the Easter shift in timing and the increase in brand spend. So you can get a pretty good idea on what that amount is by doing the math. Kevin Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks very much. Daniel J. Finnegan - Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Stephen Ju (50:49) with Credit Suisse. You may begin. Unknown Speaker : Okay. Thanks. So is there anything you can share with us in terms of the overall impact you may be noticing from outbound travel activity and hopefully new demand out of the APAC region, especially China? And do you feel like those travelers are opting more for the larger hotel chain inventory as opposed to the more independent or even the alternative properties where you guys are stronger? Thanks. Jeffery H. Boyd - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Stephen (51:18), I don't think we have any particular comment to make about the relative strength or weakness of outbound APAC. I think the performance of the business in APAC in general has been consistent with our expectations. The only regional comment I would make there is that inbound travel, international travel to China, has continued to be under pressure for primarily pollution reasons, honestly, more than anything else. And in terms of hotel quality, I don't have a comment to make to you there. Operator : Thank you. Our last question is from Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies. You may begin. Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Maybe a really quick question. Any differentiating trends you're seeing in terms of alternative inventory on a regional basis? Daniel J. Finnegan - Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer : No. Nothing to call out, Brian. I mean, it pretty much tracks the footprint of our business. So we're adding vacation rentals in all of our markets, principally in Europe, which is our biggest market. So nothing I would call out there that's noteworthy. Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thanks, Jeff. Jeffery H. Boyd - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks. Jeffery H. Boyd - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you all for participating in the call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thanks for your participation, and have a wonderful day.",

And now, I'd like to introduce The Priceline Group's speakers for this afternoon, Jeffery Boyd; and Daniel Finnegan. Go ahead, gentlemen. Jeffery H. Boyd - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you very much and welcome to The Priceline Group's second quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our Priceline Group's CFO, Dan Finnegan. I am pleased to report that the Group produced another solid quarter despite an often challenging market backdrop. Execution was consistent across the brands as we achieved several important milestones as a group. The Group reported consolidated gross bookings for the second quarter of approximately $17.9 billion, up about 21% on a constant currency basis, or about 19% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. Gross profit was up 16%, or about 18% on a constant currency basis, and adjusted EBITDA increased 8% to $867 million. Earnings per share were $11.60, up 17% versus the prior year. And finally, non-GAAP earnings per share were $13.93, up 12% versus the prior year, surpassing our guidance for the quarter. Our customers booked accommodation reservations for 141 million room nights in the quarter, up 24% year-over-year. We are pleased with our reservation growth considering the competitive nature of our markets as well as macro volatility in many travel markets experienced throughout the quarter. We believe the consistent growth we are reporting demonstrates the strength of our brands, the value of a diversified global footprint and solid execution by our brand management teams. Booking.com recorded another impressive quarter, and we are excited to announce that we now have over 1 million properties on the Booking.com platform, which represents an increase of 30% over last year. The Booking team has nearly doubled the number of properties on its platform in just two years, a truly remarkable accomplishment that reflects the hard work and dedication that the Booking team employs on behalf of its customers and supply partners. The Booking.com platform includes approximately 493,000 instantly-bookable vacation rental properties, which grew 39% year-over-year. Our properties represent a combined total of approximately 23.7 million potentially bookable rooms. Of this total, 16.3 million are within our traditional hotel partners and 7.3 million are bookable rooms in homes, apartments, villas and other categories of unique places to stay. We believe that Booking.com has one of the largest platforms for vacation rental and alternative accommodation properties and offers the most customer-friendly booking experience in the market. Booking.com also reached another milestone in the quarter as it surpassed over 1 million reservations booked in a single day on its website, an impressive measure that demonstrates the meaningful scale of our business. Agoda produced another solid quarter on both the top and bottom-lines as it continues to grow its global accommodation platform. The Asia-based Agoda team has built a world-class merchant supply platform capable of amassing and serving a wide variety of private discount deals that has proven to be a great asset for the Group. We are especially pleased to see group members leveraging the supply platform and availability for our customers. Consistent with the first quarter, KAYAK exceeded our expectations, posting strong growth in queries, revenue and profit. KAYAK continued its pace of innovation with the launch of several new products and enhancements centered on new verticals, planning and travel tools, and conversational travel services such as KAYAK's Facebook Messenger service, an exciting new way to search and book travel experiences. Rental car days for the Group grew 8% in the quarter, driven primarily by Rentalcars.com. Rentalcars.com delivered a strong quarter and witnessed robust demand for its services across all of its major geographical regions. Rentalcars.com continues to make investments in expanding its global supply base as well as enhancements to its customer service organization. priceline.com made good progress on its efforts to reposition the business, including strengthening the management team, building more sustainable marketing programs and designing improved product offerings and customer service, all in an effort to position the business for a strong start in 2017. OpenTable delivered good bottom-line performance in the quarter driven by a healthy balance of top-line growth and cost efficiencies. OpenTable is working on attractive growth opportunities, increasing the size and scope of its restaurant footprint in North America, using innovation to drive greater diner frequency and pursuing growth in international markets. I am particularly excited about the pace with which our brand teams have built the business on mobile platforms. It is clear that progress in building share in the mobile channel is a critical component of delivering overall growth in the business. Product excellence, distribution and mobile marketing and monetization are all key components. You can see why this remains a top priority for all our brands. In summary, the Group executed another solid quarter. Focus by our brand leadership on controlling spending contributed to better-than-expected margins, underlining that a core strength of our business is control of operating expenses which allows us to deliver attractive returns to our shareholders while investing in future growth. We have now turned our attention to the third quarter and our busy summer travel season. We feel good about our outlook for the third quarter, albeit in a global travel market that is certain to remain volatile due to economic uncertainty and the scourge of terrorism. All of our employees are intently focused on delivering an exceptional customer experience during this busy season. As always, I would like to thank our employees around the world for their hard work and dedication. I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review. Daniel J. Finnegan - Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer : Thanks, Jeff. I'll discuss operating results and cash flows for the quarter, and then provide guidance for the third quarter of 2016. All growth rates referenced in my comments are compared to the prior year comparable period unless otherwise indicated. Q2 was a solid quarter for The Priceline Group with room night growth of 24% compared to 31% in Q1. Our growth did not decelerate to the extent assumed in our forecast, resulting in room night and gross bookings performance that exceeded the top-end of our guidance range. This momentum has carried over into Q3, as I will discuss in a moment when we get to guidance. We are pleased with the performance broadly across our key geographic regions. While recent terrorist attacks impacted gross bookings and cancellations in the markets affected, they did not have a significant discernible impact on our overall growth. Also, the Brexit vote caused a sizable devaluation in the British pound and creates uncertainty for the U.K.'s economic outlook, but our exposure for the 12 months ended June 30, 2016 to U.K. destination gross profit and U.K. source market gross bookings was 10% or less as a share of our business. Rental car days grew by 8% in Q2 compared to 11% in Q1. Average daily rates for accommodations, or ADRs, were down by less than 1% for Q2 versus prior year on a constant currency basis for the consolidated group which was consistent with our forecast. Foreign exchange rate impacts were slightly unfavorable to our results expressed in U.S. dollars as compared to prior year and our forecast. Our Q2 gross bookings grew by 19% expressed in U.S. dollars and grew by about 21% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. The difference between constant currency gross bookings growth and room night growth is due to a decline in airline ticket gross bookings, lower accommodation ADRs and relatively slower growth for rental car gross bookings. Gross profit for the quarter for Priceline Group was $2.4 billion and grew by 16% in U.S. dollars and by about 18% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. As I mentioned when we last reported in May, we estimate that earlier Easter timing shifted about $40 million of gross profit and adjusted EBITDA into Q1 that would have been recognized in Q2 if Easter fell in Q2 as it did last year. The timing shift negatively impacts our Q2 gross profit, operating profit, adjusted EBITDA, net income and operating margins compared to the prior year. Gross profit grew at a slower pace than gross bookings in Q2, primarily due to the impact of Easter timing and bookings recorded in Q2 that will benefit gross profit and subsequent quarters when travel occurs rather than due to any significant change in commission rates or gross margin relative to the gross bookings generated through our websites. Our international operations generated a gross profit of $2.1 billion, which grew by 17% in U.S. dollars and by about 19% on a constant currency basis compared to prior year. Gross profit for our U.S. operations amounted to $327 million, which represented 8% growth versus prior year. Advertising and other revenue, which is mainly comprised of non-intercompany revenues for KAYAK and OpenTable, grew by 22% in Q2 compared to the prior year. Operating income grew by 8%. Non-GAAP operating income grew by 6%, and non-GAAP operating margins exceeded our guidance but decreased by 315 bps compared to Q2 last year. Operating margins for Q2 2016 compared to prior year Q2 were pressured by the Easter timing I referred to earlier, performance advertising, and phasing of brand advertising shifting into Q2 from Q1. Performance advertising leverage was impacted by growth in paid marketing channels and growth in gross bookings that will partly benefit gross profit in subsequent quarters when travel takes place. Performance advertising ROIs were stable for the quarter but were under year-over-year pressure towards the end of the quarter and thus far in Q3, as we have lapped the comp last year when ROIs started to improve. Operating margin performance was better than our forecast due to better-than-forecasted ROIs for performance marketing, trimming of brand advertising by our brand teams, and less non-ad OpEx spending than assumed, partly due to phasing shifting to Q3. Adjusted EBITDA for Q2 amounted to $867 million, which exceeded the top end of our guidance range of $795 million and grew by 8% versus prior year. Net income increased by 12%, and fully diluted EPS grew by 17%. Non-GAAP net income increased by 8% and non-GAAP EPS grew by 12%, including increased interest expense from our recent bond offerings and the beneficial impact of lower share count from stock repurchases. Net income also benefited from a lower effective tax rate in Q2 2016 due to the impact on deferred tax balances of a change in state tax law. GAAP net income in Q2 includes a non-cash charge in the amount of $12.9 million related to an other than temporary impairment in the value of cost method investments, mainly related to the write-off of our remaining investment in Hotel Urbano, based on the performance and funding needs of the business, which has been impacted by the deteriorating economic and political situation in Brazil. We excluded the impairment charge from adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS, because it is not driven by our core operating results and renders comparisons with prior periods less meaningful. In terms of cash flow, we generated $1 billion of cash from operations during second quarter 2016, which is about 38% above last year. We repurchased 236,000 shares of our common stock for $299 million during the quarter, and we have purchased an additional $69 million of our common stock after quarter close in July. CapEx for the quarter amounted to $60 million. Our cash and investments amounted to $12.3 billion at June 30, 2016, with about $1.6 billion of that balance in the U.S. Now for Q3 guidance. Q3 is off to a solid start, with gross bookings continuing to grow nicely across our key geographic regions. Our guidance assumes that our growth rates will decelerate as we progress through the quarter, mainly due to the size of our business and consistent with long-term trends. Our Q3 forecast is based upon recent foreign exchange rates and assumes that our growth rates in U.S. dollars will be slightly dampened by foreign exchange rate fluctuations. I highlight that the basket of foreign currencies in which we transact weakened on a weighted average basis by about 2% versus the U.S. dollar since we reported our earnings last quarter and most analysts last updated their forecasts. For Q3 guidance, we are forecasting booked room nights to grow by 18% to 23% and total gross bookings to grow by 14% to 19% in U.S. dollars, and by 15% to 20% on a constant currency basis. Our Q3 forecast assumes that constant currency accommodation ADRs for the consolidated Group will be down by less than 1% compared to the prior year period. We expect Q3 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 12% to 17%. We expect gross profit to grow by 15% to 20% in U.S. dollars and by 16% to 21% on a constant currency basis. We expect about 260 bps of deleverage in non-GAAP operating margins compared to prior year, expressed as non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of gross profit, principally related to our assumptions for performance advertising. As I mentioned a moment ago, we have seen pressure on ROIs thus far in Q3 as we compare to periods with improved ROI performance last year. Our forecast assumes further ROI deterioration over the balance of the quarter to provide us with flexibility in a dynamic market to follow our consistent approach of generating gross bookings at reasonable ROIs. Our adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $1.73 billion and $1.83 billion, which at the midpoint is up 11% versus prior year. We forecast GAAP EPS between $26.10 and $27.60 per share for Q3. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed in our earnings release. Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately 16%, comprised of international income taxes and alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S. We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $28.30 to $29.80 per share, which at the midpoint is up about 15% versus prior year. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 50.3 million shares based upon yesterday's closing stock price and reflects the beneficial impact of the common stock repurchases we have made to date. Consistent with past practice, we have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our third quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any further fluctuation in the euro, British pound and various other currencies versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter. Our forecast does not assume any significant change in macroeconomic conditions in general or in the travel market in particular. I would now like to outline some changes we will make in reporting non-GAAP financial metrics, which will be effective for guidance, and reporting for the fourth quarter and going forward. First, our earnings releases and commentary in our earnings calls with respect to historical results will focus primarily on GAAP results. Second, we will continue to present adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income, but will no longer deduct stock-based compensation, which for us has ranged between 2% and 3% of gross profit for the last few years. We will also discontinue adjusting for the impact of net operating loss carryforwards, as that benefit now represents a smaller contribution to non-GAAP net income and will eventually sunset. We estimate that our non-GAAP tax rate for 2016 after we change to our new approach will be approximately 17%. Apart from the items above, our non-GAAP reporting will be generally consistent with prior practice, and we will provide information to assist investors in comparing our results from the fourth quarter on with prior periods on a consistent basis. We will now take your questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. Can I ask you to talk about two growth areas? One, the China outbound market \u2013 just an update there and then on the alternative accommodations market, you gave some numbers there for total number of room nights. Could you just talk about traction? And what you're doing in terms of trying to include that in the purchase path? To what extent you're trying to do that and just a general update on end market. Thanks a lot. Jeffery H. Boyd - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Mark. The China outbound market continues to be a market that is large and growing and that we all view has great potential because of the demographic factors that are well known affecting China. We have a number of different ways to participate in it. We participate in it through our partnership with Ctrip where our international hotels are shown to their customers, and Booking.com and Agoda also participate directly in selling outbound to international travelers coming from China. I know there's been a lot written about a slowdown in overall economic growth in China, but we still view it as a very, very attractive market that will have substantial macro tailwinds helping build both the middle class and travel demand, and we want to participate in it. With respect to alternative accommodations, as you can see by the numbers that we disclosed and sort of the ongoing property counts on Booking.com in particular, we have built a very large inventory of dynamically-bookable non-hotel accommodations, and we view it as a growth opportunity for our brands and for Booking.com in particular. And most importantly, our customers have gotten used to having a world-class content and a great experience both in booking and at stay, and that's something that we're determined to deliver. With respect to alternative accommodations, we also have, I think, one of the best distribution networks; in other words, one of the best ways to market those properties of any player in the space and look forward to doing that. In terms of how those are presented on the website, that's something that's determined by technology and the experience we have with users on the website. There's always an opportunity to select those properties for customers who want to use the various filters that are available. So there's a lot of different ways to get to them. But the most fundamental element of it is that we are trying to show the particular customer what they're most likely looking for and that drives the presentation. Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you, Jeff. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Justin Post of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. I would like to focus on the performance advertising. One of your competitors, Expedia, mentioned maybe a competitor benefited from some of their challenges. Has that helped at all in your third quarter outlook? And then on a bigger picture basis, guiding to margin deleverage picking up there, what's causing that and how do you think about margins longer-term for the Group? Thank you. Daniel J. Finnegan - Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer : Hey, Justin. So for performance advertising, we specifically called out in Q2 that one of the drivers of the pressure \u2013 in fact, the principal driver as it relates to performance advertising \u2013 was growth in those channels outpacing growth overall in the business. So we did have some success there. For Q3, that is part of the assumption again, but we are also seeing some pressure on ROI trends relative to prior year. And we think that's principally due to the fact that we're now lapping the period where ROIs started to improve year-over-year a year ago. And \u2013 I'm sorry. What was your second question? Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Just longer-term, it looks like you are going to have some marketing pressure maybe over the next year. How do think about long-term margins? Can you keep them stable or how are you thinking about that? Daniel J. Finnegan - Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer : So similar to what we've said in the past in that regard, we feel if you break it into three pieces, brand advertising, although we've had deleverage pressure from that from time to time, for the long run, we feel that we will be able to deliver operating leverage there. Similar story for non-advertising OpEx where the business has typically grown more quickly than those expenses have, and we feel good about being able to control that for the future. So that leaves the performance advertising, which is by far the biggest expense bucket. We've had several years now of pressure on that metric. Our Q2 results show some pressure and our guidance for Q3 expects there will again be pressure. So beyond that, we don't have a forecast for you. You can make your own prediction as to how that will play out, but that's been the track record to date. Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great, thank you. Daniel J. Finnegan - Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer : You're welcome. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks a lot. I have got two. Just to go back to the performance marketing and the incremental pressure you are seeing, can you just help us out a little bit? Are you seeing deteriorating ROIs on a like-for-like basis or is this more geographic mix or channel mix? Just kind of talk a little bit about the drivers of the extra pressure you are seeing? And then secondly, on cancellations, I think last quarter, Dan, you talked about cancellations picking up a bit. I don't think I heard any mention at all this quarter. Just talk about cancellation trends you are seeing. Thanks. Jeffery H. Boyd - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So, Brian, I'll take the first one and Dan can take the question on cancellations. With respect to getting into more detail on performance marketing, we typically have tried to shy away from that because very often the color that we could give you would essentially be \u2013 tip our hand in terms of what we are doing in the market. We're such a large player in the marketplace that a lot of times, the trends are in part driven by what we're doing. So I don't want to get into a lot of detail on that. I think as Dan said, we have seen pressure on that over the last several years, and I think it's fair to say that some of that is competitive pressure with scale players like Expedia being able to be more aggressive in the market as their operational execution has improved. And essentially, our goal is to continue to build market share of the business at reasonable ROIs, and our outlook has not changed on that in any fundamental way over the last several years. Daniel J. Finnegan - Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer : And in terms of cancellation trends, Brian, no big change from last quarter. So the longer-term trend has been that our cancellation rates have increased. There was a little bit more volatility in it last quarter, and so we called that out, but the cancellation increases that we've seen are built into our gross bookings and room nights booked, which were all net of cancellations. So we feel like the growth even net of that increase in cancels is pretty solid. Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. Jeffery H. Boyd - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Unknown Speaker : Hi. This is (27:36) for Doug. Thank you for taking my question. My question is on the brand spend. I think you made a comment about trimming brand spend in 2Q. Is this (27:47) pushed back over a change in strategy? And then for the brand spend going forward, are you guys planning on doing any more brand spending in the U.S.? And as a follow-up, can you talk about the growth in U.S. versus Europe, given the macro and security uncertainty in Europe? Jeffery H. Boyd - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So I'll answer the first question on brand spend, and Dan can talk about the macro impact on the U.S. versus Europe. We said in the prior \u2013 in our prior call that we expected to have a seasonally higher brand spend than we typically would have in the second quarter as spend in Q1 was essentially shifted into Q2. We did experience a higher brand spend than we typically would, but just not to the degree that we forecast. The spending in the United States in general will continue. I think you will continue to see brand advertising by Priceline.com and by Booking.com in particular in the United States. So our outlook on making that investment over the long-term hasn't changed, but the absolute amount of that investment in the second quarter was a little bit less than we had forecast. Daniel J. Finnegan - Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer : And in terms of performance by region between the U.S. and Europe, and Europe is our biggest market by far. It's our most mature, so it's growing more slowly than our consolidated growth rate typically. We're pleased with the growth performance for Europe in Q2 and year-to-date. There were impacts in France and Belgium from terrorist attacks, but overall the region is still growing well. U.S. is one of our newer markets, and it's typically growing faster than our consolidated growth rate. And Booking.com in particular continues to build its business in the U.S., and so we're pleased with our overall growth rate in the U.S. Unknown Speaker : Thank you. Daniel J. Finnegan - Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer : You're welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. I had a couple questions on the vacation rental, the non-hotel business. The last few years, you have given us a room night number or a booking number in that channel over the last 12 months. Wondering if you can give us an update there. And then, as a follow-up, just curious, as you get more regulatory pressure on that type of inventory, I am curious what your approach is to listing in markets where they have made certain types of it illegal. Are you still taking a really conservative approach? And then, have you seen any \u2013 I guess any tick-up in your core hotel business in markets where they have gotten more restrictive on regulation of alternative accommodations? Curious what you are seeing there. Thanks. Jeffery H. Boyd - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : With respect to the first question on quantifying the number of room nights in the non-hotel business, that's not something that we have done in the last couple of quarters, and we're not doing it this quarter. We've given the room counts, but we haven't given that level of detail. With respect to regulatory pressure, the Group is not taking the position that we would operate this business in markets and with properties where it's contrary to the law. We're a law-abiding company and we're not trying to disrupt the legal system. So I guess, if you would characterize that as being a relatively more conservative approach to it, that is our approach. And what was the third question? Daniel J. Finnegan - Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer : Pickup in hotels. Jeffery H. Boyd - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Oh... Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: In terms of impact to the core hotel. Some markets that have gotten perhaps more restrictive on alternative, are you seeing a benefit in your core hotel business? Jeffery H. Boyd - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No. I don't think that the size of the non-hotel accommodation business that's being done away from us is big enough where that level of disruption would be visible to us in the positive sense. Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Merwin of Barclays. Your line is open. Christopher David Merwin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So, I guess last quarter, Expedia talked a bit about spending more dollars on Facebook and I think in your 10-Q, you listed Facebook as a brand advertising partner. So just curious if you have any plans to increase spend in that channel going forward? I know obviously, it is not quite a performance-based channel like Google, but if you can still track ROI in a platform, does that make it easier to scale up spend there? Thanks. Jeffery H. Boyd - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think we would like to spend more money on Facebook going forward. We have a good relationship with them, and we've found that a number of things that we've done on Facebook works well, particularly retargeting, which really is more of a performance-based analysis the way we look at it. So, I would look for us to be doing more. As you could see by Facebook's announcement, the scale of their advertising business is growing, and while it traditionally has been more of a brand advertising platform, we like to work closely with Facebook to find ways to make more performance-oriented placements work for us. And that's something that we continue to be interested in doing. Christopher David Merwin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom White of Macquarie. Your line is open. Tom White - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just one on the corporate travel opportunity. You guys have been quietly innovating there recently. And I think a few quarters ago, you said one in five bookings was corporate or business travel. How do you guys think maybe that mix looks like in three years to five years? I mean, can you guys kind of ever get to 50-50, you think, with the product offering you have now? And then just a quick follow-up, in terms of the marketing efficiency of some of your newer customer cohorts, specifically for some of your newer geographies, just curious where you think you are or where they are trending relative to your more mature markets in areas like return on investment or repeat purchase behavior, direct traffic, those types of metrics? Thanks. Jeffery H. Boyd - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Tom. On the corporate travel opportunity, we always suspected that we had a substantial number of business users that were using our product, but we didn't until more recently have data on it, which is where that one in five number comes from. And that intuition gave us reason to look at the market more aggressively and try to build some functionality that would be targeted directly at corporate travelers. And so that one in five number represents the self-reported usage of our customers, and what the opportunity is, is to build a business of business travelers using the tools that we provide for them and to try to get that share to go up. I wouldn't hazard a guess as to whether it would ultimately be 50-50. In the United States, the average hotel has 30% business traveler, 30% leisure traveler and 30% large groups for big hotels, so that gives you sort of a breakdown at least in the U.S. market as to what the market kind of looks like. But we think there's a great opportunity to build awareness among business travelers that Booking.com in particular is a great place to go and for business owners to use the tools that we're building which we think will help us build share there. With respect to marketing efficiencies in newer markets, it's traditionally been the pattern that we have been willing to invest in marketing in new markets in order to build share and to build awareness of our brands until we got to a point where we'd achieved enough scale where the more normal ROI patterns would obtain. I don't have anything particular to report to you on that front. There may still be some markets where we're not long-tenured and are doing some investing, and that would be very, very consistent with how we've run the business over the long-term. Tom White - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Fitzgerald of Jefferies. Your line is open. Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Jeff, you talked a bit about performance advertising on Facebook and maybe just wondering, are you currently using dynamic product ads for travel there on Facebook and Instagram? Any dynamic to call out with those formats specifically? And then you also mentioned KAYAK's Facebook Messenger service in your prepared remarks. What's been there the traction initially on that product? Thanks. Jeffery H. Boyd - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So, I'll answer the second one first, which is the KAYAK product on Facebook is fairly new as are most of the technology that's interacting with either with robotic texting or natural language processing with a voice like an Alexa. So that stuff is all in the very early stage and I think it's terrific for our teams to be innovating on those platforms because it puts us in a position to participate and benefit if those platforms ultimately grow to be meaningful sources of demand for e-commerce like ours. With respect to the particular advertising products that are available on Facebook, our teams look at everything. I don't have any particular comment on dynamic product ads or others. Dan, I don't know if you have any comment to make on that. Daniel J. Finnegan - Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer : No. No, we're working closely with the Facebook team. Our teams are very innovative and they're looking hard to spend as much in those channels as they can at a reasonable ROI. Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC : Got it. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ed Sheridan (sic) [Eric Sheridan] (39:37) of UBS. Your line is open. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just two. One that we get a lot from investors, Jeff, I'd love to get your take is how the competitive environment might be changing as a result of some of the hotel groups pivoting more towards trying to drive direct booking awareness either through couponing or discounting or loyalty reward programs, how you think that's impacting the competitive environment? And the second one on BookingSuite. Wanted to know if we can get an update there on how the product set continues to evolve, what that might be doing more broadly for the platform, especially with respect to driving loyalty around inventory? Thanks, guys. Jeffery H. Boyd - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Thank you, Ed (sic) [Eric] (40:22). So with respect to the competitive environment and the hotel direct book, the hotels have consistently been working hard over the years to maximize the traffic that goes to their own direct websites, and they've done it over the years through driving single image pricing, through a very substantial investment in their own web experience, and we look at the availability of different prices for their members on the website as an evolution of that effort. Our approach is to try to make sure that our customers have the best prices that are published and available, and I think we're doing a pretty good job of accomplishing that. And I think that given the scale of our business, we're in a position where it's a reasonable ask that the largest player in the space be able to show competitive prices to its customers. My belief is that those efforts will continue, and we'll continue to press to make sure that we've got competitive pricing. And I will say that if over the long-term the efforts by the chains or others is essentially starting to drive consumers to expect to book only discounted prices rather than published retail prices that the ultimate impact of that on hotel ADRs is probably not going to be great for the chains. And companies like ours and other large competitors are in the space are very well-positioned to advertise substantial discounts as well. And so my comment there is at some point, it actually might not be a great idea to push the market and push consumers into expecting to book only at discounted prices. On BookingSuite, the product continues to evolve. I think the team is excited about revenue management tools that are now being made available to customers, and I think the customer interest and uptake on that has been good. Ultimately having our engine drive direct bookings for small and medium-sized hotels we still believe is a good thing \u2013 a good thing for the hotel because it allows them to participate in a channel that they were not participating in and help build their brand via a direct website that we can build for them and certainly provide the booking engine for. And ultimately, it does help us because it provides us with excellent inventory and builds our relationship with the hotel which is over time very important to us as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Perry Gold of MoffettNathanson. Your line is open. Perry Gold - MoffettNathanson LLC : (43:47) question. At what point in the lodging cycle do you believe hotels are generally forced to lean in more aggressively to drive demand through your brands? Is it when RevPAR first goes negative, slightly before or some time afterwards? Thanks so much. Jeffery H. Boyd - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We actually think it's good for the hotels to lean into our products in any market because ultimately if they use our channel to drive strong demand for their property, it puts them in a position to maintain or increase their ADRs even if the market is relatively strong. So, our look at it would be that hotels should participate aggressively at all times in order to maximize their RevPAR. There's no question that if ADRs start to drop, and in particular occupancy starts to drop, then hotels may have more of an incentive to participate in programs that could enhance the demand that they get from us, but we think it's a good idea regardless of market cycle. Perry Gold - MoffettNathanson LLC : Great. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Kopelman of Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Kevin Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks a lot. So you mentioned hitting about 24 million bookable rooms. Can you give us any color on how you are thinking about runway for properties and rooms and what kind of addressable market you have there? Thanks. Jeffery H. Boyd - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We still think there is a substantial opportunity to increase the number of properties on our websites, and on the Booking.com platform in particular, and as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, a fairly substantial growth in the size of the platform over the last couple of years, I think, is evidence of that. You can tell from the math, and we've said on prior occasions a number of times that the typical average size of the property that we're bringing on to the platform now is smaller because we're dealing with non-hotel accommodations to a large degree, and those tend to be much smaller than the larger hotels, most of which we've already addressed although there still is opportunity in the hotel space as well. So in some, substantial opportunity to continue to increase the size of the platform, although diminishing return in terms of the number of rooms available per property. Kevin Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Justin Patterson of Raymond James. Justin T. Patterson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much. Going back to vacation rentals, we have seen one of your competitors put up some pretty solid results; you are still having solid results. Can you talk about just the advantage that you have from having the \u2013 not charging the consumer a fee here with bookings? How long do you think charging the consumer is actually sustainable in this market? Thanks. Jeffery H. Boyd - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think we like our model compared to the other models out there. We have a scale customer base that's used to doing business with us on these terms, and I think we're doing a good job of building the relationships and the business processes and the automation to enable us to deliver the experience to the user when they're booking a non-hotel accommodation or a property that's not being managed by a professional owner. So we like that business model. We like that hand of cards that we've been dealt. I think that HomeAway's customer bases and their owners are chafing a little bit at a substantial increase in fees, and ultimately, in a competitive marketplace for these types of properties, consumers have been shopping around for hotels for 15 years, 17 years now. And it's probably the case that over time, they'll shop around for vacation rentals, and ultimately it'll be about finding the best value. And I'm hopeful that we'll be able to provide the best value. Justin T. Patterson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Peter Stabler of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks. I got a quick follow-up to Eric's question on the hotel and direct initiatives. Is it safe to assume that, to the extent that hotels are offering significantly discounted prices on their direct channels, that they will suffer a negative impact in terms of their ranking position on Booking.com? Thanks very much. Jeffery H. Boyd - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I'm not going to get into a conversation about, if they do this, will you do that? That's between us and the hotels, and judging by the questions, I just want to underscore that we have great long-term relationships with the hotel chains. We've been in business with them since I started in the business in 2000, and I would expect those relationships to continue to be strong, and we provide a lot of business for the hotel chains, and we provide business in languages and in destinations that it's hard for them to access directly, but we have a unique benefit that we provide, and we absolutely value the inventory that we're getting from our partners here. So I wouldn't express it as if they do this, we'll do that kind of a situation. This is a partnership. Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks for the color, Jeff. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Millman of Millman Research. Your line is open. Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates : Thank you. Following up some other questions regarding the effects of the economy and terror, particularly in Europe, would you suggest that you are seeing about the same number of travelers? Are you seeing \u2013 and in the U.S. However, particularly in Europe, are you seeing them move more to the south, where there are lower ADRs? And are you seeing an effect from that? And secondly, you talked about the long-term corporate, but is the conditions affecting corporate travelers; in other words, corporations are trying to keep their people \u2013 they think keep their people safe? Jeffery H. Boyd - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : On the first question, Michael, we have seen some relative strength in the South Spain and Portugal have been very strong markets. Turkey is not. Turkey has been an impaired market, between terrorist attacks and then the attempted coup. Some of the other markets that have been strong, like Ireland and Germany, so people shying away from some of the markets where terrorist attacks have been taking place in the past, and where maybe they have more of a fear of safety for traveling there at the moment. Daniel J. Finnegan - Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer : Yeah. And, Michael, I wouldn't \u2013 there's nothing that we can see from our results that indicates a major trend of corporations pulling back travel because of safety concerns. I'm certain there are some business travelers who have canceled trips in the immediate aftermath of some of these events, but broadly speaking, a major pullback is at least not obvious in the numbers we're looking at. Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates : And the Spain and Italy question, is that affecting your ADRs? Daniel J. Finnegan - Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer : Well, Spanish ADRs have been very strong. So all of that demand shifting there is actually having a positive impact on the ADRs in those markets. And overall, you can see our ADR trend has been roughly stable, down slightly, less than a percent. So nothing really to call out there. Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates : Great. Thank you. Daniel J. Finnegan - Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer : You're welcome. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Naved Khan of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open. Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities : Hi. Thank you very much. Jeff, I think in your prepared remarks you touched upon KAYAK and its strong performance. Can you give us some more color on what is actually working here and if you've launched in any new markets? And then I have a follow-up. Jeffery H. Boyd - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So, KAYAK has had a good run of performance here this year. They've done a very nice job of not only building query demand in the United States and elsewhere, but they're doing also a good job of continually innovating with respect to their product and with respect to mobile in particular, which helps with the flow-through of the economics. So they're doing a very nice job and their international expansion continues. I don't have anything to tell you particularly about this market or that market but KAYAK continues to, I would say, in a measured way build its footprint internationally. Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities : Okay, thanks. And then, Dan, can you talk a little bit about, what does your guidance include with respect to any kind of impact on the Olympics positive or negative? Daniel J. Finnegan - Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer : We don't see any major impact one way or the other on that, Naved. So we didn't call anything out. We didn't build anything specifically in there. Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities : Okay, thanks. And then one more question, if I may, since nobody asked it. So, any update on the CEO search? Jeffery H. Boyd - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Naved, the CEO search continues in the normal way with a committee of our board and the recruiting firm and they are right in the middle of it. Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities : Thank you. Operator : We have no further questions in the queue. This does conclude the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to The Priceline Group team for closing remarks. Jeffery H. Boyd - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you all very much for participating in the call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect.",

And now I'd like to introduce The Priceline Group's speakers for this afternoon, Jeffery Boyd and Daniel Finnegan. Go ahead, gentlemen. Jeffery H. Boyd - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Thank you very much, and welcome to The Priceline Group's third quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our Priceline Group's CFO, Dan Finnegan. The Priceline Group brands executed well, delivering on peak summer travel demand in the quarter. All of our global employees worked hard to make sure our customers had fantastic travel experiences, from our property teams driving availability in the quarter to our customer service teams handling the volumes of requests during our busiest season. Our financial results indicate favorable trends in the business. The group reported year-over-year room night growth of 29% for the third quarter, which represents acceleration over the second quarter. Consolidated gross bookings for the third quarter were approximately $18.5 billion, up about 26% on a constant currency basis or about 25% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. Gross profit was up 22% or about 23% on a constant currency basis. Earnings per share were $10.13 which was negatively impacted by a $941 million non-cash impairment charge that I will discuss in a moment. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $31.18, up 23% versus the prior year surpassing our guidance for the quarter and FactSet's consensus estimates of $29.92. Booking.com executed another strong quarter, showing acceleration in both room night and gross bookings growth. This acceleration for such a large business is a testament to Booking's growing inventory of hotel and non-hotel accommodations and its ability to optimize peak season travel demand with tools and automation to make sure it has the best availability combined with a seamless customer experience. Booking's property teams remained active in the quarter as its total property count now stands at approximately 1,065,000, which represents a year-over-year increase of 29%. The Booking.com platform includes approximately 529,000 instantly bookable vacation rental properties, which grew 39% year-over-year. Booking.com's properties represent a combined total of approximately 24.4 million potentially bookable rooms. Of this total, 16.9 million are within our traditional hotel partners and 7.5 million are bookable rooms in homes, apartments, villas, and other categories of unique places to stay. Our non-hotel properties continue to grow nicely as we build one of the largest platforms of instantly-bookable vacation rental and alternative accommodation properties in the market today. Adding supply of these growth rates creates momentum in the business beyond the current quarter as new properties typically become more productive over time once brought onto the Booking.com platform. Booking.com is also making substantial investments to drive future growth, including constant front-end experimentation, new product development such as Booking for Business and building more extensive distribution partnerships to extend the reach of the business. Exciting new relationships such as Southwest Airlines demonstrate how we are able to bring the power of our deep global distribution platform to enhance our partner's customer experience. The priceline.com team is working hard to improve performance and marketing, product, front-end, and mobile offerings. We believe the priceline.com's leadership team is making smart decisions to position this leading brand for growth in the future. We are pleased to announce the promotion of Brett Keller to CEO from Interim CEO recognizing the passionate and skilled leadership he has brought to the brand since taking the helm. KAYAK delivered another quarter of top and bottom line growth while also investing in the future. KAYAK work towards executing on its key initiatives for the year, usability improvements, customer optimization, and the development of new mobile tools. KAYAK also announced its expansion in Asia-Pacific and Latin America, two key geographic regions. With a greater presence in Asia-Pacific, KAYAK will be better positioned to capitalize on one of the largest online travel markets in the world. Additional resources in its Miami office will allow KAYAK to continue its fast-paced growth in Latin America where it already has operations in Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, Chile, and Peru. Agoda posted a strong quarter with accelerating top line growth. It is particularly important to note that the growth came primarily through direct channels, which grew faster than its paid channels. Moreover, Agoda continues to see high rates of mobile growth across its customer base. Agoda continued investments in its merchant supply platform which enables it to control its content, innovate, and participate aggressively in closed user group and other discount offerings, which play an important role in the APAC market. Rental car days for the group grew 13% in the quarter, driven primarily by Rentalcars.com's strong performance. Rentalcars.com saw its rental car days accelerate in the quarter and witness robust demand across most of its key geographies. The team delivered on a busy summer season and executed a very solid quarter despite continued macro and currency pressures resulting from Brexit. Finally, turning to OpenTable, you will see in our recently filed 10-Q that we reported a non-cash impairment of goodwill of approximately $941 million. The impairment is the result of a change in OpenTable's business strategy relating to the pace of its international expansion and other growth initiatives. Importantly, this change in strategy allows OpenTable to invest in building its inventory of bookable restaurants and restaurant listings, in innovation around user experience and cloud-based restaurant tools, in new product development particularly in casual dining and in international expansion. OpenTable has delivered good results over the past two quarters with earnings growth driven by cost discipline versus plan, and growth in diners making reservations on OpenTable's branded sites. OpenTable's investments in future growth include completion of its international technology platform which will allow it to sell more effectively into the global traveler market, and to work on important product enhancements aimed at driving diner growth. We remain enthusiastic about the long-term prospects for OpenTable. In summary, the group executed well during our busiest quarter, producing record financial results. As always, I would like to thank our employees around the world for their hard work and dedication. I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Thanks, Jeff. I'll discuss operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the fourth quarter of 2016. All growth rates referenced in my comments are relative to the prior-year comparable period unless otherwise indicated. Q3 was a solid quarter for The Priceline Group with acceleration in room night growth to 29% compared to 24% in Q2. Performance was strong across each of our key geographic regions and this momentum has carried over into Q4 as I will discuss in a moment when we get to guidance. Rental car day growth also accelerated to 13% in Q3 compared to 8% in Q2. Average daily rates for accommodations, or ADRs, were down by less than 1% for Q3 versus prior year on a constant currency basis for the consolidated group, which was consistent with our forecast. Foreign exchange rate impacts were slightly unfavorable to our results expressed in U.S. dollars as compared to prior year and were in line with our forecast. Q3 gross bookings grew by 25% expressed in U.S. dollars and grew by about 26% on a constant currency basis compared to prior year. The difference between constant currency gross bookings growth and room night growth is due to a decline in airline ticket gross bookings, lower accommodation ADRs, and relatively slower growth for rental car gross bookings. Gross profit for the quarter for The Priceline Group was $3.6 billion and grew by 22% in U.S. dollars and by about 23% on a constant currency basis compared to prior year. Non-GAAP gross profit as a percentage of gross bookings for Q3 is 41 bps lower than prior year Q3. The decrease is mainly due to normal book versus day time lag with accelerating gross bookings growth in Q3, and an expanding booking window. Other smaller contributing factors for the variance are the level of accommodation participation in preferred placement and commission override programs, business mix, and discounted closed user group rates. We continue to believe that our commission rates are sustainable over the long-term based upon the value that we deliver to our travel partners at relatively low distribution costs. Our international operations generated gross profit of $3.3 billion, which grew by 25% in U.S. dollars and by about 26% on a constant currency basis compared to prior year. Gross profit for our U.S. operations amounted to $335 million, which was about flat with the prior year. U.S. gross profit for Q3 2016 and 2015 includes benefits in the amount of $5.1 million and $13.7 million, respectively, related to favorable travel transaction tax rulings in Hawaii. Advertising and other revenue, which mainly comprised of non-intercompany revenues for KAYAK and OpenTable, grew by 11% in Q3 compared to the prior year. Operating income declined by 44%, including a $941 million non-cash impairment charge to write-down the carrying value of goodwill related to OpenTable. OpenTable has delivered healthy growth in diner reservations and improved operating results under the leadership of Christa Quarles and her management team. The impairment results from a reduction to our long-term forecasted results for the business based upon actual results since the acquisition and a change in strategy for the business going forward. The OpenTable team will continue to pursue its international expansion opportunity and other growth initiatives going forward, but will invest at a measured pace that is more commensurate with the current growth trajectory of the business. The non-cash goodwill impairment charge is excluded from non-GAAP operating income, adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP EPS because it is not indicative of our core operating results and renders comparisons with prior periods less meaningful. Non-GAAP operating income grew by 19% and non-GAAP operating margins exceeded our guidance, but decreased by 161 bps compared to Q3 last year due to performance advertising. Performance advertising deleverage was impacted by lower advertising ROIs and our acceleration in top line growth that will partly benefit gross profit in subsequent quarters when travel takes place. Operating margin performance was better than our forecast due to slightly better than forecasted advertising efficiency and less non-ad OpEx spending than assumed, partly due to spend shifting to Q4. Adjusted EBITDA for Q3 amounted to $1.9 billion, which exceeded the top end of our guidance range of $1.83 billion and grew by 19% versus prior year. GAAP net income decreased by 58% and fully diluted EPS decreased by 57%, in both cases inclusive of the $941 million impairment charge I discussed a moment ago. Non-GAAP net income increased by 20% and non-GAAP EPS grew by 23%, including interest expense from our recent bond offerings and the beneficial impact of a lower share count resulting from stock repurchases. In terms of cash flow, we generated $1.5 billion of cash from operations during third quarter 2016, which is about 15% above last year. We repurchased 144,000 shares of our common stock for $199 million during the quarter, and we have purchased an additional $25 million of our common stock after quarter close. CapEx for the quarter amounted to $54 million. We entered into a contract in Q3 to build a 753,000 square foot building with capacity for 4,600 employees in Amsterdam to serve as the headquarters for Booking.com. Our Booking.com team in Amsterdam is currently housed in several buildings across the city. We believe bringing the team together in a modern headquarters in the center of one of the greatest cities in the world will produce operational benefits. The project also makes sense from a financial perspective, as we will use international cash to build what we believe will be valuable real estate in the Amsterdam market. We expect the building to be completed in 2020 for a total cost of approximately \u20ac270 million plus the cost of office fit-out, furnishing, and fixtures. Q3 investment cash flows include about $54 million paid towards the project, including $48 million paid to obtain use rights to the land upon which we will build. We expect to pay about $40 million of the project cost in 2017, with the remainder paid over 2018 through 2020. Our cash and investments amounted to $13.7 billion at September 30, 2016, with about $1.5 billion of that amount from the U.S. Now for Q4 guidance, as I mentioned when we reported our results last quarter, starting with our guidance and reporting for the fourth quarter and going forward, we are changing our reporting for non-GAAP financial metrics. The guidance for Q4 that I'm about to give for adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income includes the cost of stock-based compensation. We are also no longer reducing income tax expense for the impact of net operating loss carry-forwards, as that benefit now represents a smaller contribution to non-GAAP net income and will eventually sunset as our NOLs are used or expire. Apart from the items above, our non-GAAP reporting will be generally consistent with prior practice. Our Q3 earnings release that was just issued includes a reconciliation of non-GAAP information to the corresponding GAAP measure prepared using this new methodology for each quarter of 2015 and the first three quarters of 2016 to assist investors with the transition. Q4 is off to a solid start, with gross bookings continuing to grow nicely across our key geographic regions. Our guidance assumes that our growth rates will decelerate as we progress through the quarter, mainly due to the size of our business and consistent with long-term trends. Our guidance also reflect a difficult comp starting in December and running through Q1 2017 because our room night growth accelerated fairly significantly in the prior-year comparable periods. Our Q4 forecast is based upon recent foreign exchange rates and assumes that our growth rates in U.S. dollars will be slightly dampened by foreign exchange rate fluctuations. For Q4 guidance, we are forecasting booked room nights to grow by 20% to 25% and total gross bookings to grow by 16% to 21% in U.S. dollars and by 17% to 22% on a constant currency basis. Our Q4 forecast assumes that constant currency accommodation ADRs for the consolidated group will be about the same as the prior-year period. We expect gross profit to grow by 13% to 18% in U.S. dollars and by 14% to 19% on a constant currency basis. Our adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $755 million and $795 million, which at the midpoint is up 8% versus prior year. We forecast that adjusted EBITDA will grow more slowly than gross profit due to forecasted ROI pressure for performance advertising. Our forecast assumes further deterioration in ROIs over the balance of the quarter to provide us with flexibility in a dynamic market to follow our consistent approach of generating gross bookings at reasonable ROIs. We are pleased with the balance struck by our brand teams in Q3 and thus far in Q4 to deliver exceptional top line growth with healthy bottom line growth and market-leading adjusted EBITDA margins. We forecast GAAP EPS between $11.40 and $12.00 per share for Q4, which at the midpoint is up about 17% versus prior year. Our EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 50 million shares based upon yesterday's closing stock price and reflects the beneficial impact of the common stock repurchases we have made to date. Our EPS guidance also benefits from a forecasted tax rate of 12% compared to the prior-year tax rate of 18% which results from forecasted mix of pre-tax earnings between our U.S. and international businesses. Our U.S. earnings, which include interest expense on our debt and the cost of our corporate group, are taxed at a substantially higher rate than our international earnings and are down in our Q4 forecast compared to the prior year. We are targeting Q4 non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $12.20 to $12.80 per share which at the midpoint is up about 17% versus prior year. Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated income tax rate of approximately 14%, which is lower than the prior-year rate for the same reasons discussed a moment ago for the GAAP tax rate. As you model 2017, we estimate a full year non-GAAP tax rate of about 18%. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed in our earnings release. Consistent with past practice, we have hedge contract in place to substantially shield our fourth quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any further fluctuation in the euro, British pound, and various other currencies versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter. Our forecast does not assume any significant change in macroeconomic conditions in general or in the travel market in particular. We will now take your questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. Our first question comes from the line of Justin Post of Bank of America. Your line is open. Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Obviously, the room nights came in well above your forecast and you're forecasting strength in Q4. Can you describe or discuss any market dynamics that maybe gotten more favorable in the quarter? And then on ROI on the marketing spend, it looks like it might have come in better than you forecast; maybe relate that to the room night comment. Thank you. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Okay, Justin. So yes, room night performance was strong in the quarter. I said it was strong across all of our key geographic regions. I'd say it was broadly strong across all our demand channels too, so there's nothing I could call out in particular for you there and it was broad-based strength, the macro environment feels relatively healthy for us. That same story has continued thus far in Q4. We assume that we'll decelerate from here on out I think to a lesser extent than typical for November because we have the comp against the Paris terrorist attacks into a greater extent than usual for the month of December given the difficult comp that we had in the prior year. And then the ROI is better than the forecast. I think you can get a sense for the split between how much of the margin pressure is driven by the acceleration in the business relative to ROI pressure by looking at the growth and performance advertising relative to our gross bookings growth and then the disconnect there would give you an indication of ROI pressure and then the remainder, the performance advertising relative to gross profit is due to book versus day time lag. Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. And maybe one follow up, any pressure you're seeing from the hotel change discounting directly on their own sites, any change there? Jeffery H. Boyd - The Priceline Group, Inc.: We haven't seen, Justin, much of a change in that situation since we reported last quarter. I think the statements coming from the chains have been consistent and we haven't seen anything in the marketplace to indicate a change in the general dynamics associated with that. Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right. Thank you Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. You talked about, with the Agoda property, seeing direct traffic grow faster than paid channel traffic. Could you elaborate on that? Is that something you hadn't seen before? Do you think something like that is sustainable? Was there a particular strategy that paid off there that maybe you could replicate in other areas? That would obviously be big for the business model if, you as a whole, could get more direct versus for paid channels. And then one other question, please. Any comment on Booking.com's traction in the U.S. market? I think Booking.com's CEO at an industry conference in September made a comment that you were gaining real traction in the U.S. market. So anything you can elaborate on that would be appreciated. Thank you Jeffery H. Boyd - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Okay. Thank you, Mark. Agoda's had a long-term goal and objective to try to increase the amount of direct business and you've seen across other of our brands, for example, a push to spend money on brand advertising in addition to PPC and I think that's consistent with that objective that's reflected in Agoda's results. I wouldn't say that there's some macro trend in that regard that you should expect to see reflected in the entire business. And keep in mind that Agoda, being in the Asia-Pacific market, that's a market where mobile is growing particularly fast and the mobile experience in many of those markets is much more driven by your success in getting customers to download apps, and obviously once you've got an app download, you've got direct business. Booking.com is doing well in the United States. They've been in this market for years now. They've built a competitive inventory set. And while in the early days, the business was more characterized by inbound international travel. They are doing a good job building the business from U.S. customers' booking accommodations for purely domestic travel. And I think we've said in the past that based on the best information available to us, we think that Booking.com is gaining share of the market here in the United States for U.S. bookers and domestic travel and we still believe that to be the case. Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you, Jeff. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Heath Terry of Goldman Sachs. Your question, please. Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks. As we look at the leverage on sales and marketing, we obviously got a little bit less of increase in performance advertising as a percentage of gross profit than we saw last quarter. Can you give us a sense of how you view that trade-off between the gross bookings and the room night outperformance you saw this quarter, and if there is a \u2013 whether it's a target return on advertising spend or a target margin that you're aiming for or growth rate that you're aiming for there? Or is there a point where you could see that percentage of advertising \u2013 or advertising as a percentage of bookings or gross profit starting to settle out? Jeffery H. Boyd - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Heath, I don't think we have undertaken ever to project where that long-term relationship between performance-based advertising and gross profit dollars will ultimately shake out. We've been forecasting and experiencing modest deleverage on that line as a fairly long-term trend, but I think the performance of the business has shown that we're doing generally a better job than our competition of managing those trade-offs and able to drive share, gaining organic growth in the business on the one hand, and better overall operating margins on the other. So we don't want to put our brands in a position where they have to make some pre-determined ROI decision and not be able to respond with flexibility to market conditions, as Dan mentioned in his prepared remarks. Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking my questions. The first one, can you talk about the business mix shift toward paid or more toward direct in the quarter? I know last quarter you mentioned a little bit of a mix shift toward direct, which is a change from what we saw for the couple years when you weren't manning the helm, Jeff. So just curious as to \u2013 is the mix shifting toward paid? And if so, why is that? And then secondly, can you just talk a little bit about capital structure and how you think about the potential for larger buybacks over time? Thanks. Jeffery H. Boyd - The Priceline Group, Inc.: So, I think, we've had a consistent \u2013 as I mentioned earlier, Brian, a consistent goal of trying to build our direct business, and I think for Booking.com in particular, which is our largest business, and is very active and effective in advertising in paid channels. The relationship between the share of direct and share of paid is driven by a couple of different things and while one of those is our success in building direct business through brand advertising, through direct business from repeat customers who are loyal to our brands and in mobile channels, to the degree, we can drive app downloads and app usage. But on the other side, the other factors are the relative attractiveness of the paid channels with which we do business, and I think it's our view that if we can drive business in an attractive ROI whether it's through paid search, through meta-search channels, through partnerships which is something that we've worked hard and gotten some good results on, we'll absolutely do that. And the opportunity in the paid market has been attractive. So I don't think we view there has been a sea change in either our goals around this, or an abrupt change in mix shift. I think we mentioned with respect to Agoda that they had a good quarter of driving growth in their direct channels, but I don't think you all should extrapolate that that's representative of some very significant change in how we look at or operate the business. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: And then with respect to capital structure, I think the answer is similar to our answer to what we've done, I think we've established now a pretty good track record of consistently buying back our stock. We have an authorization in place, and I don't see any reason at this point in time that that would change dramatically from what we've done in the past. Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth of JPMorgan. Your question, please. Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great, thanks for taking the question. Jeff, you were talking about KAYAK and some of the enhancements you're doing there around usability and customer. I was hoping you could elaborate there a little bit and talk about some of the new things and how you're driving that business. And then secondly, can you give us any update on the progress for group CEO? Thank you. Jeffery H. Boyd - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Sure, Doug, so a couple of things that I would mention for KAYAK. First is they have great velocity in just the day-in and day-out front-end testing user experience. They run a lot of experiments, and some of those experiments represent what might look on its face to be a trivial change to the way something is presented or the way a particular call-to-action button is identified. But the sum total of all those experiments and the ones that make their way to deployment on the website drive conversion, drive growth, and can drive improvements to monetization. So those are very, very important, they take up substantial development efforts, and it's a big part of not only what KAYAK does but what all of our brands do. I think some of the more interesting things that KAYAK has been working on are around artificial intelligence, natural language processing with Alexa, Facebook Messenger trying to be able to respond to a customer's spoken query, which is at its early stages now. It's not generating a ton of business, but I do believe it's at the front end of some pretty important changes in the Internet in general and the way people interact with technology. And KAYAK is doing a very good job of being out in the front of that. In terms of the CEO search, there's no particular update to report today other than to say it continues apace with our board committee, who is working on it and I think making progress. And when we have an announcement, you guys will be the first to know. Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. You guys called out distribution partnerships and Booking.com for Business in the prepared remarks for some of the strength in room nights. Is that becoming a meaningful portion of the acceleration? Is there any update you can share on the mix of room nights coming from Booking.com for Business? And then I guess a second one, if I can, you touched on this around KAYAK improving, I guess, iterating and testing on conversion rates. But in core Booking.com, do you guys still see good meaningful conversion gains, particularly in mobile, or do you feel like you've just gotten to the point where there's limiting marginal conversion benefits? What kind of update can you give us there? Thanks. Jeffery H. Boyd - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Sure, Lloyd. So I think with respect to the partnership business, and I'd make this answer for all of our brands. We definitely are interested in affiliate relationships where the affiliate has a brand-independent content, a reason for customers to go to their site independent of purely hotel booking, and I think those partnerships are bringing growing business to the group. I don't have a particular number to associate with their contribution. But if we can make the right kind of deals, if we can have partnerships that allow us to show our brand to consumers and have them experience the product, we like them. And I think we're in a very strong position to compete for that business in many markets because of the comprehensiveness of our inventory and the quality of our technology and customer experience. With respect to Booking for Business, Booking for Business is off to a good start. It's still a relatively new initiative. I'm not in a position to give you a number as to the specific contribution of the business to our total growth. I can say that business travelers represent a reasonable amount of the business we have on Booking.com and are generally participating in the overall growth of that business. That's distinct from businesses, companies that are actually signing up for and using the Booking for Business tools. That represents a smaller amount of business today but it's growing nicely. And I think we have a very attractive product for business users, and I expect that to do good things in the future. We're quite optimistic about it. I don't think that Booking.com or any of our other brands are at a point of diminishing marginal returns from front-end experimentation and innovation. And when you think about it, because the technology that surrounds us and that we employ in our business and that we interact with our partners is constantly changing, that means that the opportunity and the need for innovation is constantly there. So we could have thought that we were potentially running into diminishing returns in desktop, and then a new technology comes up that allows you to show additional database returns without leaving the page, which just created a massive opportunity for our engineers and product people to code great innovation and things that help the customer while they're in the shopping process. It's one very small example of a change in technology that happened several years ago that was a very significant game-changer in terms of the things that you could do on a desktop website. And there's just more and more of those happening on all the platforms that we interact with. So I don't see there ever being a time when the opportunity and also, quite frankly, the need to innovate on the front end is marginalized because of these changing technologies. I hope that's helpful. Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Merwin of Barclays. Your line is open. Christopher David Merwin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right, thank you. So I guess as it relates to alternative accommodation, you posted another quarter of really healthy growth. So I was just wondering if you could update us a bit on the bookings number that you're getting from those properties, and if not, I was hoping maybe you could talk a bit more about your strategy to grow listings count for alternatives. I know historically you've mainly sourced properties from large property managers, I just was curious how much runway you see there and if there's an opportunity perhaps to go after more of the individual owner market, as well? Thanks. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Hey, Chris. It's been a nice driver of our growth for several years now. It has been a big area of growth in our property count, and it's an area where we continue to add properties and we look to for the future as well. We've made initiatives through #BookingHome, where we're trying to make it an easier proposition for a homeowner to participate in the platform. So I think our ability to signup individual homeowners, apartment owners, and let them present their supply on our platform where we can bring great demand to them at a reasonable price, will only grow over time. So it is a big opportunity. I mean, the number of non-hotel accommodations out there is huge compared to the number of properties we have signed currently. And so I think it's going to be a continued area of growth for us in the future. Christopher David Merwin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Your line is open. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe two. One, on the performance advertising, you've referenced a number of new channels over the last couple of conference calls, Facebook, looking at the IB product through Trip. Google has also innovated around booking products at the top of the funnel. Maybe understand a little better how those are as a percentage of the mix of performance today with your relative ROI versus traditional paid search and how you see that evolving over time. That would be helpful. Thanks so much. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: So some of those new channels you talked about, Eric. Facebook, we continue to experiment with them. They're still in the pretty stages of trying to find the best way to work with us to put ads in front of their customers at a time when they're interested in seeing them. So we're doing some retargeting there through dynamic ads. It's still early days. It's still relatively small but it's growing nicely and we're going to continue to work with Facebook and we'd love to spend more money with them at a reasonable ROI. In terms of Trip and Instant Book, no update really from what we've told you on prior calls. We're happy to be participating in that channel. We think it gives us good brand advertising, particularly in the U.S. for Booking.com as we continue to look to grow the brand here. But the overall impact of Instant Book on our growth and our ad efficiency has not been significant. And then Google is continuously experimenting and iterating with different ways of answering travel queries for their customers and we work closely with them. They've been a great partner for us. We'll continue to work with them as they add new channels in the future, new ad placements, and look for ways that it will work for us and for them. To-date, it's mostly been about them trying to give their customer a better experience and give us and other OTAs a more qualified lead. And they've had some success with that. When we get a more qualified lead, it converts better and so we're able to pay more. And so I think that they're going to continue to experiment in the future and with our position as being one of their leading customers, we get good access to them during the experiment stage, typically, so that we can help work with them to make sure that the offering is going to be most successful for them and for us. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks for the color. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Stabler of Wells Fargo. Your line is open Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good afternoon. Thank you. Jeff, I was wondering if you could comment a little bit on the mobile migration? You touched on Trip, but outside of Trip, just wondering if you could talk a little bit about mobile usage trends, app usage trends, and whether you're seeing improvements in conversion as customers become more accustomed doing rather complex transactions on mobile devices? Thanks so much. Jeffery H. Boyd - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Sure, Peter. I think the numbers that we've been reporting for the last couple of quarters are showing that the group is doing well, our brands are doing well in participating in the migration of the business to mobile. And I think in some markets, particularly in the developing markets, it's not per se a migration, it's more that the business is developing initially as a mobile business because for many users in those markets the mobile devices their primarily or their only access to the Internet. And so, for example, you mentioned app usage, in some markets, and particularly in Asia-Pacific, access through downloading of apps is a much more important factor than it is in other more developed markets where apps can tend to represent a relatively smaller percentage of overall business. I think that our brands have done a good job building world-class mobile user experiences. I think that we've found ways to experiment on those platforms and in those operating systems which have allowed us to continue to improve the user experience. I think we've been able to take the expertise that we've had in performance marketing in non-mobile channels and, over time, build up that same kind of expertise in mobile channels so that we're able to gain share of business coming in paid channels, and our scale is obviously a big help in that regard because we have the most comprehensive inventory and great conversion so that allows us to compete aggressively for placement in mobile advertising venues. So, the mobile business continues to grow and to grow as a share of the total business. I think, over time, it becomes a more mainstream channel than perhaps it was in the early days of mobile where it was a venue for discounting, and for a special way of looking at the business now. In many regards, it really is a mobile-first world and the product view that you have really starts off with a mobile view. I think our brands are doing a good job in that regard and I think you all should realize that that's absolutely a first priority for us in terms of how we look at the world from both a development perspective and from a marketing perspective. Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you, Jeff. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Kopelman of Cowen & Co. Your line is open. Kevin Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks. Could you give us an update on the Booking Genius program? What's the uptake been like on that, and to what extent are the discounts on that program being funded by the hotel partners versus Booking.com? Thanks. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: So, the uptake on that Kevin has been strong. It's a great offering for Booking.com loyal users, special discounts that aren't widely available to people that haven't qualified for the Genius program. And the discounts are made available by hotels that want to get access to those high-frequency travelers and Booking.com's most loyal users, and get the opportunity to market to those travelers and get them to become loyal customers for their hotels as well. So it's a share between the hotel and booking in terms of the cost of the discount. The lower rate would result in a lower absolute commission for us when you apply our commission rate to the discounted price. Kevin Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Got it. Thanks a lot. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Naved Khan with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open. Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities : Hi. Thanks. Just a couple. So, Google introduced a fourth link to mobile search results in the third quarter and they also made some tweaks to the algo for organic. Can you talk about any kind of impact you might have seen on the business as a result of that? And then I have a follow-up. Jeffery H. Boyd - The Priceline Group, Inc.: With respect to the organic, again, I think you can see in our results that we've had a good quarter and so I think it's safe to assume from that that whatever changes they made in organic have not had a substantial effect on the momentum for our growth. I'm sorry but I didn't catch the first one. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: The fourth paid link. Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities : The fourth link, yes. Jeffery H. Boyd - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Sorry. The fourth paid link. Excuse me. So typically because we are more active in the pay channels, the existence of an additional link I would generally view as a positive for us rather than a negative. Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities : Okay. Thanks. And then quickly on some of the international markets, can you just comment on destinations like Paris or Brussels, if you saw an improvement in these markets and how China outbound might be performing for you? Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Yes, so some of those markets, Naved, France has bounced back but continues to be impacted since the terrorist attacks last year. We'll be lapping that now in November and so that will create an easier comp for us in terms of ADRs and growth going forward. Turkey's also negatively impacted but bouncing back a little bit. China outbound is still growing nicely but has slowed a little bit over the last couple of quarters. So I think that's more tied to macroeconomic conditions there than anything with our business. Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities : Thank you. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom White of Macquarie. Your line is open. Tom White - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great, thanks for taking my question. Dan, when you were talking about gross profit as a percent of gross bookings, I think you characterized take rates in the hotel business as stable. But could you just maybe give a bit of color on the other drivers of the change there? And I thought that you said something about booking windows being longer. I feel like that in the face with some of the steps that we see around mobile and what mobile is doing to booking windows. So if I heard you correctly there, maybe just if you could clarify. Thanks. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Sure, Tom. So I said it was about 41 bps of pressure we saw in the quarter. About half of that was due to the normal lag between the time when a booking occurs and travel occurs. We had accelerating growth in the quarter, so that would typically put more pressure on that metric. And then we have seen pretty steady expansion in our booking window, so there's been somewhat of a barbelling. You're right that close-in bookings have been very strong, and that's been driven to a large degree by mobile. But we've also seen an expansion in booking window, so people also are comfortable making their bookings farther in advance than they have in the past. That could be just a function of people continuing to get comfortable with our model, particularly the agency model for Booking.com and the flexibility that gives them in terms of making the booking, having their vacation secure, and then if they need to change their plans they're able to do that. The other drivers that put some pressure on the take rate in the quarter, I referenced the level of participation by hotels in preferred placement and commission overrides. That's a function of experiments that we run from time to time to work with sort order and see if we remove hotels from preferred placement that maybe aren't converting as well. Is that going to be a net positive experiment for us? It's not necessarily going to be a trend long term. And then commission overrides, the expensive hotels participate in that is generally driven by the lower levels of occupancy and their desire to push up their commission rates in order to drive more demand. I also mentioned business mix, so just the mix of properties and regions that are propelling our business, and we saw that to an extent was with lower commission regions and properties and put some pressure on the metric as well. Tom White - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Fitzgerald of Jefferies. Your line is open. Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC : Thanks, guys, maybe two quick ones. TV seemed particularly crowded this quarter with Olympics, with Presidential races. Any puts and takes there in terms of the effectiveness of that channel for you? And then continuing decline in airline ticket bookings, any specific drivers around that? Jeffery H. Boyd - The Priceline Group, Inc.: So with respect to television being crowded and it certainly has been with election season advertising, but by the time you get to this time of year, it's because you're passing peak travel season. We're not really in the peak season for running television advertising in the United States anyway. And our brand advertising, and I think you can see it in the numbers, has not grown the way you may have seen it grow last year in particular and maybe the earlier part of this year. So the spending has come down a little bit, and in part that's probably because of some of that crowding. With respect to the decline in airline tickets, I think that's a priceline.com metric, and it's driven over the long term by a general deterioration in the economics that are available to an online travel agent for selling an airline ticket, which means it gets less marketing support in general. And in the short term, as part of the efforts by Priceline to reorient the business here for better, sustainable long-term positioning, there's been a further diminishing of investment in performance-based marketing, in particular for airline tickets. So I think those are probably the two principal drivers of that trend. Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC : Got it. Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Sena of Evercore. Your line is open. Kenneth Sena - Evercore Group LLC : Thank you. Just in terms of building out some of your platform capabilities, any additional updates on your enterprise efforts with BookingSuite, signs of traction there, and maybe your verified review efforts or other? And then maybe second, just any pockets of ROI improvement that stood out by variable channel, meta, social, or other, maybe outside of search? Thank you. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: So BookingSuite, Ken, is still in the pretty early stages. We're excited about the opportunity. We've got a great team working on it day-in and day-out, but it's still in investment stage, still in the early stage, so not a lot to say there. And we're not going to comment on ROIs by any channel, so nothing I would call out for you there. Certainly, the actual results that we reported in Q3 and the guidance we're giving for Q4 point to more pressure than pockets of strength. Kenneth Sena - Evercore Group LLC : Thank you. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Good afternoon. With some changes in thinking around OpenTable and what kind of emphasis to put on future investments there, does that change your interest or willingness to look at other peripheral booking products and how challenging it may be to have success in non-core categories? And I guess if you are looking at other peripheral booking categories, can you share any details on what kinds of categories you consider? Thanks. Jeffery H. Boyd - The Priceline Group, Inc.: So on the second question, we typically wouldn't comment on what we were looking for from a strategic perspective. I think we continue to believe that the relationship that our brands are building with their traveling customers can provide an opportunity for us to offer value to them while they're in destination. And you may have seen a release about Booking.com experiences in a few cities where they're testing a program to provide access to attractions, and so forth, to their customers. And from our perspective, that provides a real opportunity to build a deeper relationship with the customer if they're interacting with your product while they're traveling, while they're in destination. And because we have that connection and the data around their travel; where they're going, when they're going, et cetera, in many cases the customer's traveling with one of our apps on their mobile device. We continue to be very, very interested in that opportunity. I think specifically with respect to Open Table, we also remain convinced that that logic applies to dining and that travelers are all dining when they're on their trip, and that we've got an opportunity to provide content reservation making ability to those travelers. But we have an appreciation of the challenges inherent in doing that, and I think that those learnings will definitely inform us with respect to future acquisitions, but I don't think they're necessarily going to discourage us from considering them, or ultimately doing them. But we do have a better appreciation of the challenges of making those connections with our existing brands. Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks. Gentlemen? Jeffery H. Boyd - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Thank you all for participating in the call. Operator : That does conclude your program. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Have a wonderful day.",

And now I\u2019d like to introduce The Priceline Group\u2019s speakers for this afternoon, Jeffery Boyd, Glenn Fogel and Daniel Finnegan. Go ahead, gentlemen. Jeffery Boyd : Thank you very much, and welcome to The Priceline Group\u2019s fourth quarter conference call. I\u2019m joined by Group\u2019s CEO, Glenn Fogel; and Group\u2019s CFO, Dan Finnegan. I will make some brief opening remarks, Glenn will provide a business update and Dan will give the detailed financial review. The Group performed well in the fourth quarter with both room night growth and earnings exceeding our expectations. This is a fitting conclusion to a strong year with the benefits of favorable industry dynamics, the scale of our accommodations business and solid execution by our teams allowed us to record impressive organic growth with attractive margins. At the same time, our brand\u2019s made substantial investments in marketing, supply, content and product innovation to position the business for continued growth. As we look forward we will continue to pursue the strategy of driving growth and attractive margins, while investing for the future. I would like to thank my colleagues around the world for their support during my tenure as interim CEO and congratulate Glenn on his appointment as Group\u2019s CEO. I will now turn the call over to Glenn for the business update. Glenn Fogel : Thanks Jeff. And I and the entire company want to thank you for the leadership you provided over the last eight months as interim CEO. It\u2019s an exciting time to become The Priceline Group\u2019s CEO and I look forward to working with the talented leadership teams at our brands. I\u2019m pleased to say that the company is performing well and is in a strong competitive position. We have substantial momentum as we execute against a very large market opportunity. I am happy with the progress our brands made last year and even more thrilled about the groundwork we\u2019re laying for continued growth in the future. Now I\u2019m going to talk a little bit about our individual brands. Booking.com executed another strong year in 2016 with accelerating room nights and gross bookings growth. Booking.com held over 289,000 properties over the last year, an increase of 33% driving real choice for its customers. Booking.com now has over 1,155,000 hotels, apartments, homes and other places to stay in over 220 countries and territories across the globe, and the platform includes approximately 591,000 instantly bookable vacation rental properties, that is a 49% year-over-year growth rate. Booking.com properties represent a combined total of approximately 25 million potentially bookable roams. Of this total, 17.2 million are within our traditional hotel partners and 7.8 million are bookable rooms or units in homes, apartment, villas, and other places to stay. We continue to expand aggressively into the alternative accommodations market, and we believe we offer more choices on an instantly bookable, no fee basis than anyone else. For our priceline.com brand 2016 was a year of investment. With the new leadership team in place, Priceline made progress rebuilding its technology platform and completely overhaul in the front end consumer experience on both desktop and mobile. These fundamental changes have enabled us to increase our experiment philosophy and introduce new features more rapidly. Also we\u2019re excited about our expanded best deal brand campaign, which started in February. This consumer value proposition is an important evolution of the priceline.com band and we look forward to it contributing to the future growth. KAYAK recorded another solid year for the Group, posting good, top, and bottom line growth. We are positive about KAYAK\u2019s prospects as it remains the only true multi-product global meta-search platform today. KAYAK furthered its global footprint this year, expanding into APAC and Latin America, and we recently signed a definitive agreement to acquire the Momondo Group, a leading European travel meta-engine to enhance KAYAK\u2019s position in the European market. We are pleased with the Agoda\u2019s performance in 2016, posting solid growth and profitability; despite operating in a challenging market, where aggressive discounting is prevalent. The team executed well in mobile and made smart investments in pricing strategies, user improvements and brand advertising campaigns in target markets. And in 2017 the Agoda team looks forward to continue to build a very strong global merchant supply. Rentalcars.com executed exceptionally well in 2016 and delivered a very good year despite the turmoil and impact of the Brexit booked. Rentalcars.com made some key metrics in 2016, which included growing its mobile mix, increasing its share of direct business, improving the customer experience and growing the number of suppliers on the platform. These achievements will continue to pay dividend for the business in 2017 and beyond. OpenTable achieved several important milestones this year, which we believe positions our company for a long-term sustainable growth. The company launched its global platform in October, which enables diners to search and book any restaurant in any of its domains. We believe this is a fundamental first step in providing a truly integrated global platform. The OpenTable network continues to grow in 2016 with over 40,000 restaurants utilizing its online reservation system. As we look forward to the balance of 2017 and beyond, The Priceline Group will continue to follow the strategy that has made us successful. Our supply chains will continue to aggressively add suppliers to our network, giving our customers more and more choice. Our front end customer service and IT teams will continue to innovate and work hard to expand our lead as the best place for customers to book. Our marketing teams will bring more customers to our desktop and mobile sites and promote our mobile apps while optimizing our return on investment in order to deliver profitable top line growth with market leading markets. In summary, I would like to thank my colleagues for delivering another great year. Their hard work and passion is the foundation upon which our business has been built. I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review. Daniel Finnegan : Thanks, Glenn. I\u2019ll discuss operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the first quarter of 2017. All growth rates referenced in my comments are relative to the prior year comparable period unless otherwise indicated. I highlight that as we discussed the last couple of quarters the non-GAAP figures for our Q4 results and Q1 forecast includes stock-based compensation and do not reflect the reduction to income tax expense related to available NOLs. Q4 was a solid close to a very good year for The Priceline Group, with acceleration in Q4 room night growth to 31% compared to 29% in Q3. The 31% room night growth rate is the highest quarterly room night growth we have achieved since the first quarter of 2014. For full year 2016, room night growth of 29% accelerated by 380 bps compared to 2015, and represents a year in which we believe we grew our market share in U.S. and internationally through outstanding organic execution by our brands. Performance was strong across each of our key geographic regions and this momentum has carried over into Q1 as I will discuss in a moment when we get to guidance. Rental car day growth also accelerated to 14% in Q4 compared to 13% in Q3. Average daily rates for accommodations or ADRs, were down slightly for Q4 versus prior year on a constant currency basis for the consolidated group, which was slightly below our forecast. Foreign exchange rates unfavorably impacted growth rates expressed in U.S. dollars for our Q4 as compared to prior year and to our forecast. Q4 gross bookings grew by 26% expressed in U.S. dollars and grew by about 28% on a constant currency basis compared to prior year. The difference between constant currency gross bookings growth and room night growth is due to a decline in airline ticket gross bookings, relatively slower growth for rental car gross bookings and slightly lower accommodation ADRs. Gross profit for the quarter for Priceline Group was $2.3 billion and grew by 21% in U.S. dollars and by about 24% on a constant currency basis compared to prior year. Gross profit as a percentage of gross bookings for Q4 is 58 bps lower than prior year Q4. The decrease is due import to book versus day time lag with accelerating gross bookings growth in Q4, and an expanding booking window. Other contributing factors for the variance are discounted closed user group rates, business mix, and the level of accommodation participation in preferred placement and commission override programs. We believe that our commission rates are defensible over the long-term based upon the significant values delivered to our travel partners at relatively low distribution costs. Our international operations generated gross profit of $2 billion, which grew by 23% in U.S. dollars and by about 26% on a constant currency basis compared to prior year. Gross profit for our U.S. operations amounted to $293 million, which grew about 9% compared to the prior year. Advertising and other revenue, which is mainly comprised of non-intercompany revenues for KAYAK and OpenTable, grew by 12% in Q4 compared to the prior year. GAAP operating income grew by 20% and GAAP operating margin decreased by 29 bps compared to Q4 last year due to performance advertising, partially offset by leverage in brand advertising and non-ad operating expenses. Performance advertising deleverage was impacted by lower advertising ROIs and increase in share of business coming through performance advertising channels and acceleration in gross booking growth that will partly benefit gross profit in subsequent quarters when travel takes place. That results in more performance advertising expense in Q4. Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 amounted to $869 million, which exceeded the top end of our guidance range of $795 million and grew by 22% versus prior year. EBITDA margin performance was better than our forecast due mainly to gross profit growth and advertising efficiency that exceeded our forecast. GAAP net income grew by 34% and fully diluted EPS increased by 35%, including increased interest expense from our bond offerings and the beneficial impact of lower share count resulting from stock repurchases. Non-GAAP net income per share was $14.21, up 32% versus the prior year, exceeding our guidance for the quarter and FactSet consensus of $12.89. For full year 2016 adjusted EBITDA of $4.1 billion grew by 19% and represents a 40% EBITDA margin. I\u2019d like to thank our people around the world for their talents and hard wok to deliver such strong performance from both the top line and bottom line perspective. In terms of cash flow we generated $1.1 billion of cash from operations during fourth quarter 2016, which is an increase of about 26%. For the full year we generated operating cash flow of $3.9 billion and spent $268 million on CapEx and land use rights which means about 35% of our gross profit converted into free cash flow. During the year we purchased 763,000 shares of our common stock or $1 billion. Our Board recently gave us a new authorization to repurchase up to 2 billion of our common stock, which increases our total open stock repurchase authorization to about $4 billion. We expect to execute this program consistent with the pattern we have established over the last few years, returning capital to our shareholders at pace we think makes sense based upon the price which our stock is trading, liquidity available in U.S. without incurring sizable incremental tax friction and potential other uses for such capital. We are hopeful that the new U.S. administration\u2019s promised tax reform will give us future access to our international cash and cash flows with little or no additional U.S. tax cost. We also have access to U.S. liquidity in debt markets at attractive rates while remaining committed to a strong balance sheet and our investment grade credit rating. Our cash and investments amounted to $13.9 billion at December 31, 2016, with about $1.3 billion of that balance in the U.S. We recently announced the acquisition of the Momondo Group for $555 million subject to regulatory review which we hope will be completed later this year. We are excited to add this leading European meta-search business to our KAYAK portfolio. We intend to use international cash for the purchase at closing and we expect the acquisition to be modestly accreted to our non-GAAP EPS in the first year after close. We will not comment further regarding our post-close strategy pending regulatory approval. Now for Q1 guidance. Q1 is off to a solid start with gross bookings continuing to grow nicely across our key geographic regions despite a year-over-year room night growth comp about 400 bps more difficult than Q4. We estimate that the shift of Easter into Q2 has a slightly beneficial impact on Q1 gross bookings growth with an offsetting negative impact of Q2 gross bookings growth. The Q1 impact is offset by prior year Q1 including an extra day for the leap year. For Q1 guidance we are forecasting book room nights to grow by 20% to 25% and total gross bookings to grow by 17% to 22% in U.S. dollars and by 19% to 24% on our constant currency basis. Our Q1 forecast assumes that constant currency accommodation ADRs for the consolidated group will be up by about 1% compared to the prior year period. The strength in gross bookings comes with associated performance advertising expenses, which pressures Q1 earnings growth and margins, because the ad expenses recognized as incurred, but a meaningful portion of these bookings won\u2019t be recognized as revenue until travel occurs in Q2, Q3 and beyond due to the normal seasonality of our business. The shift of Easter from Q1 last year to Q2 this year will also negatively impact our Q1 gross profit, operating profit, EBITDA, net income and operating margins and we will benefit those metrics in Q2 in both cases compared to the prior year. Therefore for Q1, we expect the gross profit to grow more slowly than gross bookings, due principally to the dynamics of book versus day timing I just mentioned and to a lesser extent the other factors that impact the gross margins for Q4. We forecast gross profits grow by 9.5% to 14.5% in U.S. dollars and by 11% to 16% on a constant currency basis. GAAP operating margins express the GAAP operating income as a percentage of gross profit are expected to be lower than prior year Q1 by about 540 bps, due largely to the seasonal timing issues I just discussed, which creates more deleverage in the performance advertising line. Our Q1 forecast assumes that the long-term trend of year-over-year pressure on performance marketing ROIs will continue. But to a slightly lesser degree than experienced in the last couple of quarters and that paid channel growth will continue to be strong. We expect the pressure on performance advertising efficiency over the first half of 2017 to be slightly favorable what we experienced over the second half of 2016. Our forecast assumes further deterioration in ROIs over the balance of the quarter to provide us with flexibility in a dynamic market to follow our consistent approach of generating gross bookings at reasonable ROIs. Non-ad OpEx and brand advertising are also forecast that the pressure Q1 margins as we invest in our brands in advance of peak travel season and comp against a relatively later rollout of brand advertising campaigns last year. We continue to expect to have leverage in non-ad OpEx and brand advertising over the long-term. Q1 adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $550 million and $580 million which at the midpoint about 7% versus prior year. EBITDA growth and margins are impacted by the same factors I just discussed for GAAP operating profit. We forecast GAAP EPS between $7.50 and $7.90 per share for Q1, which at the midpoint is up by about 3% versus prior year. Our EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 50 million shares based upon yesterday\u2019s closing stock price and reflects the beneficial impact of the common stock repurchases we have made to date. We\u2019re forecasting Q1 non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $8.25 to $8.65 per share which at the midpoint is down about 8% versus prior year. Our forecasted non-GAAP income tax rate is about 19% for Q1 and 18% for the full year. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed in our earnings release. Our Q1 forecast is based upon recent foreign exchange rates and assumes that our growth rate in U.S. dollars will be negatively impacted by foreign exchange rate fluctuations. I highlight that the basket of foreign currency in which we transact weakened on a weighted-average basis by about 2% versus the U.S. dollar. Since we reported our earnings last quarter and most analysts plan to update their forecast. Consistent with past practice, we have hedge contract in place to substantially shield our first quarter EBITDA, net earnings from any further fluctuation in the euro, British pound, and various other currencies versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter. Our forecast does not assume any significant change in macroeconomic conditions in general or in the travel market in particular. We will now take your questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Mark Mahaney : Great. Two questions please. Dan you talked about the seeing long-term, that long-term trended performance market and deleverage, seeing it less than you have in the past. So any thoughts on why that is, do you think that there\u2019s for some reason less competitive intensity. What would be causing that? And then Glenn, if I could ask you. You talked about one of the three priorities being growing the supply base and is that something you think you can continue to do largely organically. Are there other options for doing that and I\u2019m sorry \u2013 I\u2019m going to layer in a third question which is do you think there\u2019s enough brand awareness of the advantage the size you have in instantly bookable non-traditional alternative accommodations or is that potential area of growth of marketing spend for you in the future? Thank you. Daniel Finnegan : So Mark, on the first part the trend for deleverage and performance advertising, we\u2019re pleased to see a little bit of an improvement in that trend thus far into Q1 and forecasted for the remainder of the quarter. It\u2019s a function I think of all the good things our brand teams do \u2013 continuously adding to the supply available on our websites to give our customers more choice, continuous improvement in conversion. And then also just discipline that the marketing teams employ in these markets to try and bring us good top line growth at a very strong ROIs and profitability. And I think just all those things converging has been helpful for us. The comp, it was difficult for the back half but it\u2019s also difficult for the first half of the year. So I think it\u2019s really more a function of those things that our brand teams are doing. In terms of competitive intensity just who are listening to the calls from some of the other place \u2013 in this space of anything they appear to be as competitive or even more competitive that they have been in the past. So I wouldn\u2019t attribute the slight favorability in trends to competitor dynamics. Glenn Fogel : And Mark, thanks for the call. I think those are two quick questions. And the first one about growing supply and the question can we do it organically or not. As I made the comment a few moments ago about last year being able to add 289,000 properties it was an increase of 33% that was all organic. We believe that we can continue to grow the supply greatly organically. And I\u2019ll just make the point that we look many, many times about ways to add to it inorganically through some type of acquisition. One on the critical things is very important is, when you go out and you buy a company that has some supply approximately you may not have, you have to think about the way their systems work and help easier, they are going to be \u2013 to bring in that supply into our system or the amount of distraction make it worst and just go ahead in getting those properties our own. So if you see in the history of our company, we haven\u2019t done a lot of going out recently in getting supply inorganically. So I think that\u2019s the part we\u2019re going to go with. In terms of your question about the brand advantage of the instantly bookable vacation rental product and I will add to the fact, I\u2019ll repeat to think about no feed at the traveler. You may have a point there and I may take this to the marketing people afterwards because I believe we have the absolute best product in that space out there right now. And we definitely believe that this is where we can drive very hard and it\u2019s going to provide a good growth area for us in the future. Thanks for the call, good question. Mark Mahaney : Thanks, Glenn. Glenn Fogel : So do we have the next question? Operator : Our next question comes from Justin Post of Bank of America. Your line is open. Justin Post : Great, thanks. Glenn, congratulations on the job. You\u2019re inheriting a pretty well-oiled machine, but just wondering if you have any thoughts about changes, the strategic direction or the M&A appetite of the company. And then one for you Dan. It looks like you\u2019re bookings guidance and your room nights is very robust in Q1, but earnings and EBITDA a little bit below Street expectations. Can you help us at all understand how much gross profit might be pushed out into 2Q relative to last year due to Easter or any other factors? Thank you. Glenn Fogel : Thanks for that question and it doesn\u2019t surprise me that that question would be asked. I\u2019ve been in the company now 17 years and started out in corporate development, M&A, either on strategy title sometime later. And I worked with all the CEOs very closely on our strategy. So what I would say is, well, my title has changed and the role has changed, but the company strategy has absolutely not changed. The strategy that we\u2019ve employed over the last 17 years has been very successful for us, and we\u2019re going to continue going forward the same way. And that\u2019s using incredibly talented people who are able to come up with very innovative ideas and implement them to make sure that we\u2019re accomplishing our mission which is to help people experience the world. In terms of M&A specifically, I think we\u2019ve done a very good job of that in the past. We look at a lot of, lot of potential deals but we\u2019re careful about it. We understand the risk and we try to be prudent. So that have done in the past, I expect this is how we\u2019re going to do it going forward. Daniel Finnegan : And Justin, in terms of a top line versus bottom line growth for Q1 forecast, I think you nailed it well. We\u2019re pleased with the top line strength in our forecast, growth that the business has delivered thus far in the quarter. And that strength in top line, pressures the bottom line in the first quarter, we get the gross bookings, we incur the advertising expense, but a significant portion of them are going to check out in Q2 and Q3 and even beyond when travel occurs. I guess the easiest thing I could point to for you is the differential in growth rate between gross bookings and gross profit. Eventually, I would expect those gross bookings to turn into gross profit. We last year gave you an estimate on what we taught the Easter impact was we quantified it at $40 million. We haven\u2019t done a new estimate on that, we figured we\u2019d let that one to stand. So that gives you some sense of what the user impact was in last year benefits Q1. And we would expect strong gross bookings performance in Q1 will benefit Q2 and Q3 to a large extent as well. Justin Post : Okay. Thank you. Daniel Finnegan : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Douglas Anmuth of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Douglas Anmuth : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Glenn, I just wanted to ask you about your views on meta. I mean, you obviously talked a lot about how the business is kind of increasingly shifting toward performance spend and we\u2019ve seen that obviously over the last few years, we can see it in some other companies numbers as well. So, I guess the question is with KAYAK which you acquired a few years ago and then recently with Momondo, I mean, do you really \u2013 can you make this a much bigger push within sight of within Priceline just given how much you\u2019re spending outside currently? Thanks. Glenn Fogel : That\u2019s also a very good question. And I think it\u2019s very obvious that consumers \u2013 more and more consumers are liking the meta experience. And our goal is to have the service that the customer wants. We don\u2019t force customers how to enter and do their travel search. People who want to use meta, we want to make sure we\u2019re providing the best meta which we think we are doing. So I think in terms of answering your question, we believe that it can become a much bigger business, but this is in meantime a much more by what the consumer want, not that what we want. Is that helpful? Douglas Anmuth : It is. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Lloyd Walmsley : Thanks. Two, if I can. First, if you can just give us a sense for where you\u2019re seeing the most strength in the room night growth particularly in the first quarter where you\u2019re clearly growing nicely in the face of tough comps. Do you feel like the macro environment is improving or there any particular geographies you\u2019d call out or product types you\u2019d call out is driving that supply? And then I guess a related follow-up, if I can. Can you just give us a sense for volume growth out of some key marketing channels or do you feel like core search continues to provide nice growth? And are you seeing a ramp in ad channels like Facebook or they starting to become more meaningful? Anything you could share there would be appreciated. Glenn Fogel : Yes. Why don\u2019t you, Dan? Daniel Finnegan : Sure, Glenn. Hey Lloyd, so I said in the prepared remarks that the strength in room night growth is across all our few geographic regions, I would say it\u2019s across all channels. I did make the point that paid channels are growing faster than direct at the moment. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a surprising trend given that the strength in top line that we are seeing with acceleration over the last few quarters. I think anytime we see that kind of health in the top line growth, it\u2019s largely due to new customers coming to the franchise. And hopefully we will be able to repeat the trend that we\u2019ve seen in the past by winning them over to become loyal customers in the future. So we\u2019re pleased across geographies, across channels. From a macro perspective, the reported results and forecast that we have is strong, and I\u2019d say that, what we saw from other players in our space and the large chains from a RevPAR perspective leads us to conclude that the macro is healthy, particularly in travel. And then in volume growth, the paid channels are growing faster than direct. So we\u2019re pleased with the work our brand teams and our marketing teams are doing to continue to drive strong growth, but it was a very good profitability. We do care about our margins. We do care about bottom line growth and I think that the teams are striking a good balance between the two. Core search is still an important part, PPC and Google is our biggest advertising channel. So we\u2019re pleased with the results we\u2019re seeing there. Lloyd Walmsley : All right. Thanks guys. Daniel Finnegan : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Your question, please. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my questions, I have two. The first one to go back to your last comments on paid growing faster than direct, guess I\u2019d be curious to know, is that true generally across all your markets, you\u2019re including the more mature European markets. And if that\u2019s true in Europe is there any anecdotes or examples you can give us of how you\u2019re still finding ways to grow even faster paid traffic and even your more mature markets to be really helpful. And the secondly, just to go at your prepared remarks. You mentioned some commission overrides. What are those and how should we think about that for 2017? Thanks. Daniel Finnegan : I\u2019m not going to get too much into paid growth rates by market. And that could have some competitors sensitivity to it how progress so we are in one market versus another. Can you assume that in the markets we\u2019ve been longer the brand is better known and we typically get more direct traffic without going to specific growth rate to market by market. And commission overrides are a tool that Booking.com makes available to our supply parkers, whereby they can ratchet up the commission rate that they pay us in order to improve their ranking and drive more business in their website. And when the travel macro is healthy and the hotels and properties are successful in filling their rooms, without pinpoint machine, we actually particularly see them not use those to the same extend, I think that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the trend over the last couple of quarters. Brian Nowak : Okay, great. Thanks. Daniel Finnegan : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line is open. Eric Sheridan : Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe two if I can. One, on the shared accommodation piece of the business, what to understand a little bit of the strategic decision to switch decommission or deemphasize the villas.com brand and sort of we incorporate all of the inventory at Booking.com. Just wondering still a bit how you felt that positioned you strategically for the medium- and long-term. And then second on the brand advertising piece, you talked before about pushing it in branded which are the return you\u2019ve gotten. Any color you could give us there about when you have pushed in on brand advertising spend, what does done for traffic or what does done to remarketing would be helpful. Thank you so much. Glenn Fogel : I\u2019ll do the first one and I\u2019ll let Dan take the second one. About villas.com, this is a good example to show how innovative and how the people at Booking.com are able to come up with new ideas, experiment, put something out into the marketplace, see if it works not, see how well it\u2019s working; and if it\u2019s not working, then more than wanting to pull it done and change it around, and that\u2019s really an example of villas.com. It was an idea to help us in that non-hotel accommodations area, we put it out there, we experiment, we optimized; and sometimes the customer prefers to have all its inventory in one place on Booking.com and that\u2019s where we should spend our time, energy, effect in optimizing that and so that\u2019s what they did. It\u2019s one of those things that just shows, I just love the way that the people throughout our organization do is that they\u2019re not \u2013 there are willing to \u2013 let\u2019s say it doesn\u2019t work put it down, let\u2019s move on to something else that will work. And I\u2019m very pleased with the way we\u2019re making progress with that product and I think we\u2019re seeing some substantial growth. Daniel Finnegan : And on the brand advertising side, Eric, we think it\u2019s important to the long-term health of our brand to support them and advertise them in various markets around the world. Typically when you make a push it maybe ROI negative in the beginning, we\u2019re pleased with the continuous improvement and sophistication at each of our brands to really look at the analytical metrics as they roll out new campaigns to be able to understand the impact of this, and hold back if they feel the creative isn\u2019t working and roll out with different creative, they are testing creator running it in digital channels that fairly low cost for rolling it out in major campaigns on television. So I think we\u2019re improving now. We\u2019ve done a good job in the past and we will continue to support our clients in brand advertising in the future. Eric Sheridan : Thank you. Daniel Finnegan : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark May of Citi. Your line is open. Mark May : Thanks for taking my questions. I just want to circle back on the comment that you made earlier about paid channels growing faster than direct right now. That\u2019s being driven more by changes in consumer behavior you mentioned greater use that I would include social greater use of search on mobile et cetera or is that being driven more by your own marketing efforts that\u2019s driving it out? And then secondly, I think a year ago, you made some efforts to \u2013 that has help to grow your merchant business. Just wondering how sustainable do you think the accelerate growth that you seen in that channel over the last few quarters? Thanks. Daniel Finnegan : Sure, Mark. So the paid channels growing faster, the time will tell how successful we are in converting those new customers that we found into loyal customers that come back to us directly. But our track record in the past has been good in that regard. We\u2019ve seen good growth in repeat rates, we saw a positive trends in terms of direct to the channel for business before a good period of time there until we saw a such strong acceleration in top line growth. And I\u2019m not surprised to see some pressure on direct share when you\u2019ve got that kind of growth. It\u2019s likely that it\u2019s going to new customers coming to the franchise. So we\u2019re hopeful and we\u2019ll track that and hopefully we will have some good news to report to you some point in the future in that regard. And then our merchant business is driven by a couple of different factors. So Booking.com has been entirely an agency business, since it was founded and over the past year has added the ability to process transactions on a merchant basis. They\u2019ve done that for a number of reasons but one of the principal ones was, they were getting into more vacation rentals, a portion of these properties don\u2019t have the ability to charge credit cards. And so that would create a complexity for our guest that\u2019s checking into one of these properties and have come with a pile of cash to pay. And so we charge the customer\u2019s credit card and then we remit payment to the property. So it\u2019s really just a facilitate business and that\u2019s driven some faster growth in our merchant gross bookings. Interestingly at the same time Agoda which is \u2013 has only been principally a merchant business, and that has good growth rates for us over the past several quarters has been adding more and more agency capability by using inventory that they share from Booking.com. And so I wouldn\u2019t focus so much on is merchant growing faster agency but more of how is the total doing. In different as to \u2013 that means by which the customer wants the book if they want to have us to charge their credit card or they want to book agency and pay at the hotel. We\u2019re okay, either way and so that\u2019s what\u2019s impacting the growth from quarter-to-quarter with the merchant rate. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Bieber of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Paul Bieber : Thank you for taking my question and congratulations Glenn on becoming the CEO. When we think about the growth opportunities for Priceline globally what are the geographies where you feel there is the largest opportunities to gain incremental market share over the coming year? Glenn Fogel : Thanks, Paul. There is certainly are some areas where we know we should be able to go in and get some more share where we think its important area to be. We want to be careful with that because I certainly don\u2019t want to give our competitors a roadmap until where we\u2019re going to put our emphasis. But I will talk about some of its, there is well known, I\u2019m not give you that we believe over the next decades China will continue to be one of the largest opportunities for travel growth. And we\u2019ve done a lot of effort over the last, I\u2019ve been seeing China for 30 years now. I started going to China when it first came to Priceline to help make sure that we are part of that market. We\u2019re going to continue to do it. We do it in number of different ways, we have a partnership with Ctrip but we also have two great companies that are operating in China, we have Booking.com is there and we have Agoda in there. And we operate for all different areas we are doing the outcome business. That meaning Chinese people want to try outside and we have a great advantage because of the breadth of our properties. We\u2019ve got a great inbound business because we have been an incredible customer base. We have who want to go and visit China and then there\u2019s the domestic business, which is not as big for us but we\u2019re growing nicely there. So if you\u2019re asking me to give you one area which I think everybody knows is important for travel, China is it. Now we also want to look, where there is some big markets that \u2013 we are the biggest player in the world, whether call it big market but we\u2019re not number, I\u2019ll point out the U.S. We are not number one in the U.S. would that give us more intension to try harder and make a bigger and make more share here. And so we\u2019ll keep working on that. Is that helpful? Paul Bieber : Very helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Merwin of Barclays. Your line is open. Chris Merwin : All right, thank you. Do you think that the growth in alternative accommodations has the potential to change the margin structure of the business overtime and I guess in another words do you finding that younger cohorts of travelers looking to book alternative accommodations or coming to you via direct mobile channels. And is that helping with advertising efficiency or do you think if alternatives as yet another source of supply that should drive demand through traditional paid channels? Thanks. Daniel Finnegan : So I think its more to the latter, Chris. So the alternative accommodations have financial metrics similar to the rest of our business in terms of ADR and take rate. One area that the margin can be negatively impacted for that business is just because the properties are less efficient and that they\u2019re smaller they may only be single unit properties. The touch rate for our supply teams and for our customer service teams also given just the unique nature of some of these properties and could be a higher level questions for guests that are looking to stay in one of them. It can create and has created a modest level of pressure in our non-ad OpEx. Our teams continue to work on ways to make the business as efficient as possible enabling these properties to sign themselves up, build their own content, trying to continue to make our website more and more attuned to these differences for this type of business. So the customers can help themselves in terms of questions they may have from a customer service perspective. But in terms of advertising which is by far away our biggest expense. I wouldn\u2019t foresee any significant difference for this business relative to our hotel and other accommodation business. Chris Merwin : Okay, thank you. Daniel Finnegan : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Naved Khan of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open. Naved Khan : Yes. Hi, thank you very much. Can you touch upon mobile? Where are you now in terms of the share of bookings coming from mobile versus desktop? And then I\u2019ll then I had a question on Momondo. Glenn Fogel : We\u2019ll take the first one first. And we\u2019re not going to disclose exactly where we are in terms of mobile versus any of the other was people book. But we will say that we know how incredibly important mobile is to the business. So as I pointed out earlier about another question about we know where the customers are. And we believe that customers are going to continue to want to use mobile they use it throughout their lives, throughout whatever they want to, they are continue to use it for travel. Now we believe we have a great advantage because of our scale and the number of technologies that we have in there. We can develop new ways to use mobile, new ways to optimize experiment to make sure that the best process, the best service for our customers. This is a great advantage for us and if you\u2019re a small player or you are small supplier partner, we\u2019re providing a great benefit to these small supplier partners because they can\u2019t develop these mobile applications or do these developments quickly as we can. So it\u2019s an advantage for us in that area. And your second question? Naved Khan : Actually, just on mobile, just to touch up on the conversion rates there. Are you able to sort of drive significant improvement there, because obviously you\u2019re getting more efficiency in the marketing channel. So is that \u2013 should we then take that to understand that in the mobile convergence that actually doing quite well and maybe the gap between mobile and desktop is narrowing nicely? Glenn Fogel : Well, I\u2019ll give my comments and see if Dan wants to add anything. But I think one has to be very, very careful about trying to figure out internal risk, it\u2019s more better or worse for us in terms of health of the business or not. We continue to try and do the best we can to make sure that the customer is getting what they want and converting as fast as possible. But don\u2019t forget, many, many consumers are going back and forth, back and forth; they looked on mobile, then they go home and use their desktop. To try and get these attributes if you really what is the right calculation, we believe it\u2019s a difficult, difficult thing. And Dan, you want to add anything to that? Daniel Finnegan : I\u2019d just say that only that efficiency has been under pressure for the back half of 2016 and our forecast is for slight improvement going forward. So there\u2019s nothing in there that I would call out specifically related to mobile. Naved Khan : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then quickly on Momondo. Can you just sort of talk about how much of the business is flights and how much is hotels and the growth rate in the business today is know as tenure business? Daniel Finnegan : We are currently in the standard regulatory review process, so unfortunately it\u2019s not the right thing for us to comment at all on them right now. But we will say that, after we\u2019ve our closed transactions we will have some more color to give to you. How about that? Naved Khan : Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Devitt of Stifel. Your line is open. Scott Devitt : Thanks for taking my question. There\u2019s been a long history of consolidation in the industry. There\u2019s also been a few inches of unbundling of assets. And just wondering how you think about the advertising funnel as you move up in terms of the assets that you have in place there, the competitive advantage that you have existing versus the value of vertically integrated further up the advertising stack? Thank you. Glenn Fogel : That\u2019s a great question Scott. There has been a lot of that consolidation up and down and has been unbundling and certainly we\u2019ve seen acquisitions, and we\u2019ve seen people build things organically. Our goal is to provide a great service to two sides of the market. One is the person who\u2019s traveling and the other is to our partner supplier. So on the demand side, obviously we want to try and get that person who\u2019s traveling as quickly as possible, fast as possible, provide them with the content they need. Now we have started our business down at the bottom where we can work right away. And that is a great place to be because that\u2019s where you can make good money. And we also know that by providing more content to help them make their decisions earlier it will help make them more loyal to us, so we build out that too. So as anything we experiment, we test, we optimize, and we see are we getting the returning amount or the amount of money for people \u2013 effect that they were putting into supplement, that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to do it going forward. I will say that I think we\u2019re pretty good at it and I\u2019m looking forward to continuing to do it the way they\u2019ve been doing it for 17 years. Scott Devitt : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom White with Macquarie. Your line is open. Tom White : Great, thanks for taking the question. I think last quarter you guys talked a little bit about focusing more on affiliate deals or distribution deals as a way to drive growth. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but I don\u2019t think you guys have done those \u2013 that many of those types of deals in the past. I guess can you maybe just give us some color about how you\u2019re thinking that is changed and how you kind of weigh the benefits of those deals versus having to split the economics. And just curious if this is a channel that will be big enough where it will have some feasible impact on your revenue margins over the next year or two or is it still quite small? Thanks. Glenn Fogel : Thanks, Tom. And since you referenced remarks made in the last quarter, I\u2019m going to pass this to Dan. Daniel Finnegan : There\u2019s been no big change in our approach to affiliate deals Tom. We\u2019ve been focused on them for a long time now. We have a way of looking at affiliate deals that we want to make sure that we\u2019re getting good branding out of them. And that \u2013 it\u2019s a fair share of the economics with affiliate partner. So we typically wouldn\u2019t participate with a quick former type of affiliate that doesn\u2019t really have a brand and they\u2019re just using our content to potentially compete with us in paid advertising channels and take a slice of our economics. But deals that we\u2019ve done with partners like Southwest Airlines we think those are great. That\u2019s a real brand that has customers, and to the extent they\u2019re also looking for a place to stay. We are the perfect partner to help their customer fine in that place to stay. In terms of the economics, I mean we don\u2019t disclose them obviously but there\u2019s been no significant change over the last several years. And that wouldn\u2019t come out of revenue margin just to be clear. Our revenue would be the full amount earned from the hotel and then the amount that we share with the affiliates is recognized as performance marketing. Tom White : Got it. Thank you. Daniel Finnegan : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Olson of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Mike Olson : Hey, good afternoon. I had two questions. You mentioned increased discounting Agoda is facing and when this happened in China we saw Ctrip margins get hit pretty hard. How significant is the discounting in Agoda as primary markets and you expect any material impact on Agoda margins as a result of it. And secondly do you consider getting more aggressive with some of the strategies that Priceline.com historically emphasize and essentially go back to the future I guess by putting some more resources into opaque or last minute models like what companies such as Hotel Tonight are experiencing success with? Thanks. Daniel Finnegan : Yes. Let\u2019s talk a little about APAC in general. APAC is a competitive, competitive market and we have a number of people out there who are building their business in ways that they believe that offer a lower price by using their own money to discount is advantageous for them in the long-term. So at that time we have to make decisions whether or not we\u2019re going to match or not and I believe I mentioned, some of very good things that Agoda has been doing is pricing strategies very effective. In regards to the Priceline.com Company, as I mentioned they\u2019ve come out with plan and they really are coming out its consumer value proposition that is really to tell the consumer that we\u2019ve got the best deals now, the details are being provided by the suppliers, we\u2019re not discounting them. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that we are hurting our margins at all. In fact it\u2019s a great deal for every \u2013 the hotel gets their customers and we get a similar margin that we get anyway. So I don\u2019t think that we should be too concerned about how I think, you really coming out, there is going to be a big hit to margins in the long-term. I don\u2019t think you should be too concerned about that which is I think we\u2019re driving. Mike Olson : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Stabler of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Peter Stabler : Thanks for taking the questions, just two quick one. Dan, in your prepared remarks you talked about the expanding booking window. I just wonder, if you could give us a little more color on whether this is a trend you are expect to continue. And then this one is probably the last, but Glenn safe to assume no change in guidance philosophy given your tenure, Dan tenure. Thanks so much. Daniel Finnegan : Okay. For the expanding booking window that is a phenomena that we\u2019ve observed for a while now Peter. And I would expect that it will continue not knowing any reason why it wouldn\u2019t maybe a change in the macro healthiness of the travel market could have an impact. You\u2019ve seen the last several quarters with pretty healthy ADR. So I think it\u2019s beneficial for people to book in advance. We have a growing numbers of repeat users that are familiar with our model, love the flexibility that it gives them. And so I think as people are more familiar and they use our service a number of times and become direct customers. They\u2019re more comfortable booking in advance. So you have \u2013 right now I\u2019d say that should continue going forward. Glenn Fogel : And in the second question, we put guidance out there because we believe this is what we believe, the guidance \u2013 should we put out I don\u2019t know, but I think we\u2019re going to change this. Peter Stabler : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Fitzgerald of Jefferies. Your line is open. Brian Fitzgerald : Thanks guys. Maybe a quick follow-up on social. Anything notable to call out \u2013 format specifically with Facebook\u2019s dynamic product ads with travel? And then earlier you said you launched the OpenTable global platform in the quarter at a high level. What\u2019s kind of the next focus for that business specifically? Thanks. Glenn Fogel : Regarding the Facebook marketing, we look forward to continue to work with Facebook to improve their products, so that we can get the opportunity to put more money to work there. We\u2019re always looking for anybody can help us, bring us more customers with ROIs that produce loyal customers who\u2019ll come back to us directly. It\u2019s still very, very, very early. We\u2019re working hard, we work with them and we\u2019re hoping to have success down the road with them. I can\u2019t promise it will happen or not, but we\u2019re going to work with them and try to make it happen. What was your second question? Brian Fitzgerald : Thanks, Glenn, it was on OpenTable you mentioned the global platform launch in the quarter, roll out in the quarter at a high level. What\u2019s the next focus for that business specifically? Glenn Fogel : Yes. Again, we don\u2019t like talk too much about what we\u2019re planning doing next. But as we\u2019ve said we retooled strategy which is to build the business at a more profitable level, less investment and we\u2019re very hopeful that we are growing out that global platform and be able to bring to our customers what they want, which is namely contact and the ability to get reservations for restaurants throughout the world. Now it\u2019s going to take some time, more time perhaps than we thought originally. But we still believe in the product and we believe that when people are traveling they need a place to eat. Brian Fitzgerald : Got it. Thanks, Glenn. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Patterson of Raymond James. Your line is open. Justin Patterson : Great thank you very much. I wanted to circle back to vacation rentals. So you got a lot of moment and supply there. Could you talk about the factors driving that and how we should think about supply growth by geography going forward? Thank you. Glenn Fogel : Well, the factors that drive the growth in supply for us is no different whether it be a vacation rental or regular hotel or rental car or whatever a hotel. But we have people out there who are trying their best to go and make sure that the people will have that supply understand the benefits of our low cost distribution system. And we show them the benefit of general and people say yes, I want to be part of that because I see the incredible number of customers who are coming to our side from around the world in 42 languages who want to find a place to stay or rental a car whatever we offer. So it\u2019s no different at all. Now you\u2019re asking for specific areas whatever, again I want to just make this very, very plain that we believe we need to be everywhere throughout the world. So I\u2019m not going to say we should be more in this place or that place, we want to be everywhere because customers are traveling around the world and the want to stay everywhere and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. Justin Patterson : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Erickson of Pacific Crest. Your line is open. Brad Erickson : Two quick follow ups. First can you just unpack \u2013 are you able to unpack the growth that on room night metric between traditional hotel versus alternative accommodation. And then secondly just curious and it\u2019s about seeing a bit of ROI leverage here on a comparable basis? Just curious how that compares to the alternative and accommodation and what\u2019s contemplated in the forward outlook? Thanks. Glenn Fogel : That\u2019s Dan. Daniel Finnegan : Yes, Brad. You see the property growth on our website and that\u2019s been driven more by vacation rentals. So you can assume that the vacation rentals are contributing nicely to our room night growth. We don\u2019t split up the growth rate separately but that\u2019s been a nice tailwind to our growth rate for several years now as we\u2019ve continued to have more and more vacation rentals. And it\u2019s certainly something that we expect to continue going forward. In terms of ROI leverage, we\u2019re not going to break that down for you by hotel versus vacation rental. I wouldn\u2019t really think of it that way anyway I mean we\u2019re out there trying to bring customers to our website that are interested in a place to stay in Rome. And maybe they\u2019re thinking they\u2019re going to look for a hotel or two hotel rooms for their family. And then their teams have done such a good job of integrating the vacation rentals into the search results in a very intuitive way that customer may to say, I love this apartment in the heart of Rome is perfect for my family. We don\u2019t need to stay in two separate hotel rooms and the price is great and it\u2019s got a kitchen. So this is what I want. So we\u2019re not really trying to target separately there are some keywords that maybe lend themselves more to the vacation rental space but we look at it from an overall portfolio perspective. Brad Erickson : Got it, Thanks. Daniel Finnegan : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from Kevin Kopelman of Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Kevin Kopelman : Hi, thanks a lot and congrats to you, Glenn. Question on KAYAK, you mentioned it\u2019s the only multi-product global meta-search player. Do you see being multi-product as an advantage in meta-search and if so why is that? Thanks. Glenn Fogel : Yes. I think it is when people become loyal to a particular site that try meta particularly specifically because they are offering great services and it\u2019s one of those things where the people who are great providing for our hotel meta-search or fight one final being able to provide those great ways to go out and see those different places. They will see all that different choices and go easily to be able to actually booking. That\u2019s the advantage. Now clearly we believe that KAYAK is when Momondo, that\u2019s mostly a flight one you seeing that in press and et cetera. But we know that where good in both areas, we are hoping to make sure that we continued to do that. Kevin Kopelman : Thanks, Glenn. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over for any closing remarks. Gentlemen? Glenn Fogel : Listen, we want to thank everybody for coming on the call. And thank you very much for attending. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your program. Thank you for your participants and have a wonderful day. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",

And now I'd like to introduce The Priceline Group's speakers for this afternoon, Glenn Fogel and Daniel Finnegan. Go ahead, gentlemen. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Thank you very much, and welcome to The Priceline Group's First Quarter Conference Call. I am joined this afternoon by our Chief Financial Officer, Dan Finnegan. The Priceline Group performed well in the first quarter reporting year-over-year room night growth of 27%. Consolidated gross bookings for the first quarter were approximately $20.7 billion, up about 24% year-over-year or about 27% on a constant currency basis. Gross profit was up about 16%, or about 17% on a constant currency basis. Earnings per share were $9.11, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $9.88, up 7% versus the prior year, surpassing the high end of our guidance. Looking at the group brand by brand, Booking.com executed another solid quarter with strong top line growth. Booking.com's total property count now stands at over 1.2 million, which represents a year-over-year increase of 36%. The Booking.com platform now includes approximately 640,000 instantly bookable vacation rental properties, which is a year-over-year growth rate of 51%. This very strong growth rate demonstrates Booking's focus on rapidly growing its non-hotel accommodation inventory. We believe adding these types of properties creates a more robust marketplace and provides real choice for our customers. Our service is differentiated because all properties are instantly bookable, and we do not charge fees to our travelers. Overall, Booking.com's hotel and non-hotel properties represent a combined total of approximately 25.5 million potentially bookable rooms. Of this total, 17.5 million are within our traditional hotel partners, and 8 million are bookable rooms in our homes, apartments, villas and other non-hotel categories. In our rental cars product, the group grew rental car days 15% in the quarter, which marks the third consecutive quarter of accelerating growth, and the fastest growth rate since the second quarter of 2015. This growth was driven primarily by Rentalcars.com as they continue to make smart investments in product innovation and customer service. Improving trends at priceline.com also contributed to the acceleration in rental car days growth for the quarter. Turning to priceline.com overall, we are pleased to see the team make progress in Q1 as priceline.com began to see benefits from their investments in technology and people. These investments have resulted in improvement to product, user interface, and experiment velocity, and shows that priceline.com is relentlessly focused on delivering the very best deals to its customers. We believe that these efforts along with priceline.com's new best deal brand campaign which highlights its consumer value proposition will drive further improvements. Regarding KAYAK, it delivered attractive profit margins in Q1 and continued to invest in usability improvements, mobile enhancements, and new product development. We expect such investments will enable KAYAK to differentiate itself in the marketplace and grow its audience. As to the Momondo transaction, we reiterate our previous public statement that we expect to close the transaction later in the year pending successful completion of the regulatory review. Now agoda which posted another quarter of strong gross bookings growth with the direct channel growing nicely and increasing share versus the paid channels. agoda continues to innovate and invest in its merchant supply platform and experiment with closed-user group and other discount offerings to enable it to compete in its core APAC markets where the use of discounted rates is a more common practice. Finally, OpenTable produced another solid quarter of healthy diner reservation growth, beating expectations on both the top and bottom line. OpenTable made further progress upgrading restaurants from its legacy electronic reservation book system to its cloud based guest center service which enables OpenTable to easily introduce system changes and improvements. OpenTable has maintained a fast pace of innovation, recently launching a chat extension feature in Facebook messenger. While it is still very early days for this product, we are pleased that OpenTable continues to be at the forefront of new technologies. In summary, I am pleased with the group's performance in the first quarter, but we cannot rest. We are now beginning to prepare for our busy third quarter and are continuously working to improve our services to ensure a successful upcoming high travel season. As always, I would like to thank our employees around the world for their hard work and dedication, our supplier partners, and most importantly, our customers. Finally, I would like to share some news with you, which is that Dan Finnegan, who most of you know by now or at least you know his voice, since this is his 33rd earnings call, has announced that now in his 14th year of dedicated service to The Priceline Group, is going to be retiring. Now, he's not going anywhere just yet. But we will be starting a formal search for the company's new CFO. Dan will remain as CFO for as long as needed until we find the right person and have completed a smooth transition. But we wanted to let you all know about the proposed plans. And I want to take this moment to personally, and on behalf of more than 18,000 employees, to thank Dan for all he has done for The Priceline Group. Dan, thank you for everything. I will now turn the call over to you for your 33rd detailed financial review. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Thanks, Glenn. I'll discuss operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the second quarter of 2017. All growth rates referenced in my comments are relative to the prior-year comparable period unless otherwise indicated. I highlight that as we have discussed for several quarters now, the non-GAAP figures for our Q1 results and Q2 forecast includes stock-based compensation, and do not reflect a reduction to income tax expense related to available NOLs. The reconciliation between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is detailed in our earnings release. 2017 is off to a strong start. Room nights booked in Q1 grew by 27% despite a challenging prior year growth comp. We estimate that the shift of Easter into Q2 had a slightly beneficial impact on Q1 gross bookings growth with an offsetting negative impact to Q2 gross bookings growth which I will discuss further in a moment. The Q1 impact is offset by Q1 prior-year's extra day for leap year. Performance was strong across each of our key geographic regions, and we believe we grew our market share in the U.S. and internationally through outstanding organic execution by our brands. Rental car day growth also accelerated to 15% in Q1 compared to 14% in Q4. Average daily rates for accommodations or ADRs were up about 1% for Q1 versus prior year on a constant currency basis for the consolidated group which was consistent with our forecast. Foreign exchange rates unfavorably impacted growth rates expressed in U.S. dollars for our Q1 results as compared to the prior year. Q1 gross bookings grew by 24% expressed in U.S. dollars and grew by about 27% on a constant currency basis compared to prior year. Gross profit for the quarter for The Priceline Group was $2.3 billion and grew by 16% in U.S. dollars and by about 17% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. Gross profit as a percentage of gross bookings for Q1 is 84 bps lower than prior year Q1. The decrease is due largely to booked-versus-stay time lag, impacted by Easter shifting to Q2 this year and an expanding booking window. Other contributing factors to the variance are discounted closed user group rates and business mix. The shift of Easter from Q1 last year to Q2 this year also negatively impacts Q1 gross profit, operating profit, EBITDA, net income, and profit margins, and will benefit those metrics in Q2, in both cases compared to the prior year. Our international operations generated gross profit of $2 billion which grew by 17% in U.S. dollars and by about 19% on a constant currency basis compared to prior year. Gross profit for our U.S. operations amounted to $315 million which grew about 6% compared to the prior year. Advertising and other revenue, which is mainly comprised of non-intercompany revenues for KAYAK and OpenTable, grew by 8% in Q1 compared to the prior year. Margin performance was better than our forecast due to gross profit growth and advertising efficiency that exceeded our forecast. The timing of investments in non-ad OpEx was also favorable to forecast. GAAP operating income grew by 1% and GAAP operating margins decreased by 341 bps compared to Q1 last year, due mainly to performance advertising. Performance advertising deleverage was impacted mainly by the timing of bookings versus stays that I just discussed and strong growth in performance advertising channels. Adjusted EBITDA for Q1 amounted to $635 million which exceeded the top end of our guidance range of $580 million and grew by 4% versus prior year. GAAP net income and fully diluted EPS both increased by 22%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $9.88, up 7% versus the prior year, exceeding our guidance for the quarter and FactSet consensus of $8.82. Our non-GAAP tax rate of about 16% was favorable to our forecasted rate of 19%, mainly due to nonrecurring discrete tax adjustments in the quarter. In terms of cash flow, we generated $381 million of cash from operations during first quarter 2017 which is an increase of about 10%. We made a pre-payment of income taxes in the Netherlands in Q1 to earn a pre-payment discount, which negatively impacts operating cash flow for Q1 but will benefit subsequent quarters when the taxes would've otherwise been due. During the quarter, we returned $212 million to our shareholders through share buybacks. In March, we raised \u20ac1 billion of cash for our U.S. parent company by offering a five-year bond in Europe at a 0.8% interest rate. Our cash and investments amounted to $15.5 billion at March 31, 2017, with about $2.3 billion of that balance in the U.S. Now for Q2 guidance. We are forecasting booked room nights to grow by 16% to 21% and total gross bookings to grow by 12% to 17% in U.S. dollars and by 15% to 20% on a constant currency basis. Our Q2 forecast assumes that constant currency accommodation ADRs for the consolidated group will be up by about 1% compared to the prior-year period. As mentioned a moment ago, seasonal factors added to growth in Q1 and are forecasted to pressure growth in Q2. We are comfortable with the combined forecasted growth rate for the first half of the year, which we believe is reflective of generally healthy macro travel trends and implies a continuation of market share gains evident in our reported Q1 results. We forecast gross profit to grow by 14% to 19% in U.S. dollars and by 17% to 22% on a constant currency basis. GAAP operating margins expressed as operating income as a percentage of gross profit are expected to be lower than prior-year Q2 by about 140 bps. Our Q2 forecast assumes year-over-year pressure on performance marketing ROIs and that paid channel growth will continue to be strong. Our forecast also reflects brand advertising and non-advertising expenses as we invest towards high travel season and innovation to drive future growth. Q2 adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $860 million and $905 million, which at the midpoint is up 9% versus prior year. EBITDA growth and margins are impacted by the factors I just discussed for GAAP operating profit. We forecast GAAP EPS between $12.55 to $13.25 per share for Q2, which, at the midpoint, is up by about 11% versus prior year. Our EPS guidance includes interest expense on our recent bond issuance and assumes a fully diluted share count of 50.1 million shares, which reflects the beneficial impact of the common stock repurchases we have made to-date, offset by additional equivalent shares related to our convertible bonds due to the increase in our stock price. We are forecasting Q2 non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $13.30 to $14 per share which at the midpoint is up by about 8% versus prior year. Our forecasted non-GAAP income tax rate is about 18% for Q2 and the full year. Our Q2 forecast is based upon recent foreign exchange rates and assumes that our growth rates in U.S. dollars will be negatively impacted by foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Consistent with past practice, we have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our second quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any further fluctuation in the Euro, British pound, and various other currencies versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter. Our forecast does not assume any significant change or macroeconomic conditions in general, or in the travel market in particular. As Glenn just mentioned, I have decided that now in my 14th year with the company, the time is right to start working towards my retirement. Equally importantly I think the time is also right for the company. We are in great hands with Glenn and our brand CEOs running the business. Our brand CFOs and my headquarters finance team are world class and will keep doing great work as we transition to a new Priceline Group CFO. I will stay with the company as long as necessary to help recruit my successor and to ensure a smooth transition. I thank all my colleagues around the world for their incredible accomplishments over these many years. It has been a dream come true to be part of such a wonderful team. And we will now take your questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. You may begin. Dae K. Lee - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. This is Dae Lee in for Doug Anmuth. Thank you for taking the question. First question on gaining share in the U.S. How much of that do you think is taking share from competitors versus adding new properties like vacation rentals? And my second question on share buyback, could you please update us on how you're strategically thinking about buybacks and what could cause that to change? Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Thank you, David for Doug, I believe. Dae K. Lee - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Dae Lee in for Doug. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Let me take \u2013 I'm going to take the second one about the share buyback question, and I'll let Dan talk about the first one. We believe we'll be consistent going forward the same way we have been in the past regarding share buyback. We are opportunistic. We recognize shareholders want us to use our cash effectively, efficiently, and appropriately. So as opportunities are there, we will be buying share back, but we do it in a measured way. I think the best way to look forward is to see how we've done over the last few years and consider that as guidance for going forward. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: And as far as share in the U.S., Dae Lee, we look at the market \u2013 we attempt to size the market based upon the properties that we have on our extranet. So there's over 1.2 million properties on Booking.com today. We know the number of rooms that are in those properties, and so we look at that as a proxy for the market. That includes vacation rentals. So in our room nights booked also include vacation rentals. So we see them as basically interchangeable with hotels and other types of properties as places where people want to stay when they travel and we want to give them the maximum number of choices. So looking at it that way, we can see our growth in total, we still have a relatively low share of the worldwide market single digits. And we can also see our growth for the U.S. market relative to the market's growth and relative to what other players have reported, including our biggest other online travel competitor. And we feel that we're gaining share based upon those metrics. Dae K. Lee - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you very much. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. You may begin. Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking my questions. I have a two-part single question. It's under the U.S. Booking.com on the vacation rentals, you have had really good progress there the last year or so, arguably even more than that. I guess I'd be curious if you could just talk about kind of the one or two areas you really look to improve in the U.S. Booking.com and vacation rentals to kind of further drive growth. What would those one or two areas be? Thanks. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Well, Brian, as I think the way you asked that question, vacation rentals, I'm going to talk about that in general and not narrow it to any specific geography. We believe it is a very important growth area for us. We've been involved with it for some time. We continue to grow it as I mentioned about 41% increase in the instantly bookable vacation rental properties. We are very pleased with the way we do the business, and that is we don't charge those travelers fees. And as I said, these are all instantly bookable. We think that's an advantage. One of the things we need to continue to do is get even more properties. When you look at some of our competitors they have more properties, and breadth is an important thing to make sure that we have the availability, the right properties at the right price for our customers. So we're going to continue to do that. We also need to make sure that all people are aware that this is a great product. I think that it's not unknown that we do not have the same awareness. There's not the same awareness of our vacation rental property, particularly in the U.S., as some other competitors have. So we need to make sure that everyone knows that we've got a great product there too. And your other question was? Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: It's on the U.S. Booking.com. Kind of just \u2013 same kind of question where you've done really well. But if you can kind of point to one or two areas where you say here is some low hanging fruit we could still improve. What would those be? Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Well, I think that we continue to do the same formula that we have done throughout the history of our company and it has helped us get to the level of success that we are. It's not one or two. There is make sure we have breadth of property, make sure we have best price, make sure we have the way a customer goes through our path is the easiest best way for somebody to do it. Be sure that we are offering them in the way they want it. If they want to reserve a property and not have to pay until they show up at the property, we offer that. If they want to pay up-front, we need to be able to offer that. And we have different brands that offer different ways to do it. In fact, most of them offer both ways, though not for all properties. I think in the end, it's just continuing to crank out the same formula we've had in the past, maintain good relationships with the suppliers to make sure we're offering them a great relationship, and we will continue to grow as we have grown in the past. Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may begin. Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch.: Great. Thank you. Sorry to see you leaving, Dan. I hope it's \u2013 I hope you stay for a while. A few questions on guidance. I guess first of all, just help us put the 8% earnings growth in context. It seems like a pretty healthy macro, and an easier comp. And then I think on the prepared remarks you said expect some ROI pressure. I believe on the last call, you indicated that kind of ROI pressure was lessening. Has there been a real change there that's going on? And then maybe did you put your usual amount of conservatism in 2Q guidance given the late \u2013 how it's back-end loaded? Thank you. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Justin. Well, first of all, for the guidance. No change in approach. Same approach that we've used every quarter. It's a little bit different, in that there's volatility in the early part of the quarter here because of the shift of Easter, and so that makes things a little bit more difficult. I'd say that the market remains healthy. We see occupancy in ADRs are strong. The seasonal impact has certainly negatively impacted growth for Q2. We think the booking window expansion that we have been talking about for a couple of years now is probably all else being equal moving some bookings that would have been made in the past in Q2 into Q1, and even into Q4 as people are booking early. If you look at the midpoint of our room-night guide for Q2 together with our actual results for Q1, it would imply a 23% growth rate, which would compare \u2013 it takes the seasonality out of it, with the shift of the hotel or booking window, a shift of Easter timing or booking window. So that 23% growth would compare to a 27% growth for the first half of last year, which we're comfortable with that. We think that's very solid performance. We expect the business to decelerate structurally given the size of it and the long-term trends that we have seen over many years. The growth may decelerate more in certain quarters. We have accelerated in certain quarters. But overall, for the long-term, our growth has been very resilient. It's been a pleasant surprise. The growth drivers that drive \u2013 have driven our growth in the past are still there, so the secular shift from offline to online continues. We still have a single-digit share of a very big market, so there's a lot of opportunity to continue to add properties and to continue to penetrate the properties we have more deeply. Our teams are adding properties at a very healthy rate, as Glenn talked about, and we're working every day to continuously improve conversion on our websites. And then we have maintained a very consistent approach to advertising : no change in our approach, no change in competitive position that we can detect. So we continue to invest in reasonable ROIs to drive a healthy mix of top line growth and profitability. The 8% growth in guidance for EBITDA is a function of that top line growth that we talked about and then just the margin pressure that we're guiding to in the quarter, which is less than what we've seen over many of the last quarters where we've guided, and the drivers are pretty much every line item. So we are assuming that there will be more ROI pressure in Q2, but what I said last quarter, that overall we think for the first half of this year the margin pressure from performance marketing will be less than what we experienced in the back half of last year, I stay with that statement. I still feel comfortable with that. And then we're also investing in brand advertising as we're in peak booking season getting ready for peak travel season, and we're investing in OpEx for our brands, customer service people, property people to continue to sign new properties and continue our growth in the future. And then IT people that are working on innovative projects and just keeping up with the growth in the business. Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch.: Great. Thank you. Appreciate it. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC. You may begin. Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. First, congratulations, Dan. That's a phenomenal 33-quarter stretch both fundamentally and obviously in terms of the stock. So congratulations on that. Two questions, please. First, you talked about an expanding bookings window. Is that \u2013 as you mix-shift more and more away from hotels to non-hotels and vacation rentals, alternative accommodations, is that just a natural outflow of that that will bring you expanded bookings? And then I think you may have just covered this a little bit in Justin's question, but I'll try it again. The advertising efficiency that exceeded your forecast in the March quarter, was there something \u2013 anything new to particular to call out there? Anything that suggests that you'll sustainably improve advertising efficiencies? Or do you think that there was kind of one-time-ish kind of items? Thanks a lot. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Mark. Regarding the expanding booking window, I would attribute that more to people continuing to repeat with our business, becoming familiar with the model, with strong occupancy rates and rising ADRs, looking to book farther in advance and feeling comfortable doing that because they know we have a very flexible model and if their plans change later they're able to change their booking. So I think that's the more fundamental driver there. That I would expect to continue. If there were some significant change in macro or maybe people felt less comfortable about whether or not they were going to travel economically or the ADRs were dropping, maybe they would change their behavior. But it would still be a free option to make a booking and then if prices drop you can change your booking later. So I think that's what's driving that. And then ad efficiency was pretty solid in Q1. It's a mix of what's going on at all of our brands. So we have some brands like KAYAK and agoda leaning a little bit more heavily into brand advertising or discounting to drive demand to their websites. There's still underlying ROI pressure, in general, and it's the trend we've seen for many years now. I would expect to see that going forward too, Mark, until we don't see it for an extended period of time. I would just build that into the forecast. It's what we have built into our forecast for Q2. And so that's what's built in there. I wouldn't \u2013 there's nothing that I have seen that would lead me to believe that there's a sustainable ability for ROIs to improve year-over-year. Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thank you, Dan. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. You may begin. Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks, Dan. You actually kind of touched on this a little bit in response to Mark's question but just kind of curious how we should be thinking about the tradeoff between growth and margins going forward. I understand that the performance advertising line is going to be the biggest variable there, but you guys are clearly outgrowing the industry but we also have seen about 300 basis points of compression so far this year. And it seems to be about that implied in your Q2 guidance. Is that the right kind of run rate in terms of what's necessary to grow bookings and revenues or gross profit at this level given where the macro environment is? Or is there a better way to think of that? Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: I see a little less margin pressure than what you're talking about for Q2, Heath, unless you're adjusting for Easter timing. But then there would be less pressure in Q1. So, yeah, I'm seeing more like 150 bps for GAAP operating margins. It's always a balance between top line growth and bottom line growth. We try to strike a balance. From time to time, we see opportunities to invest in brand advertising. We think that's a good thing to do for our business for the long-term. There are OpEx investments that we've come across in the past, things like investing in mobile which have been critical to the success of the business. If you go back to 2012, we were a business that was generating room night reservations of 200 million and over the last 12 months we're more like 600 million room nights. So I think those investments have paid off and we're going to try to make start investments for the future. We're always looking to manage those expenses as closely as we can and with a fast-growing business we generally expect that we can make the investments that we need to make and not have pressure on margins from non-ad OpEx. But from time to time where we see the opportunity, we won't let short-term margin objectives do something that might be detrimental to the long-term growth of the business. Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Great. I appreciate that. And then I guess just on the alternative accommodations business. How much of an advantage, at least when it comes to gaining share and traction in that space, do you feel like your fee-free model for consumers is for you relative to most of the other competitors in this space who are charging consumer-facing fees at this point? Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: It's Glenn speaking. Well, that's a difficult question to answer in terms of how we're doing versus the competitors given some are private and don't reveal how fast they're growing. I can only attest to our growth rate. And while we don't give out specific different types of growth rates for our different types of properties, I'm comfortable saying that, in the area you're talking about, that is growing faster than the overall average for the entire company. So we are pleased with that stronger growth rate in that area. We believe and our DNA is experiment and test. If we thought another way was better, we would do it that way. We are pleased with the way we're doing it. And we think in the long run this will be the winner. And one piece of evidence that I point to is I notice some of our competitors who have been shifting to our method of instantly bookable and talking about how fast they're going to be able to get those to be instantly bookable. So I think that would kind of indicate that other people believe that this is the better route. Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks, Glenn. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Eric Sheridan with UBS. You may begin. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks for taking the question and congrats, Dan, on the decision. Maybe focusing back on driving engagement with your return customers, I want to understand a little bit about where you're allocating capital either in remarketing to bookers or maybe even the Genius program and how you're thinking about the returns that driving second and third direct traffic back to the site might change some of the marketing efficiency long-term? Thank you. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Hi. So we don't disclose repeat rates, nor do we disclose how much money we're devoting to remarketing. So a lot of the data you would like to hear, unfortunately I can't share that with you. I can share with you, though, how important we believe repeat business is. And the way you get repeat business isn't just marketing type stuff. What you have to do is provide a great booking experience for the customer. That's something that we think we have done no matter which way they're doing it, whether they're doing it online, or mobile. We believe that we provide a great service to our customers and that's why they come back. A couple other reasons. One that I think is so important is customer service. We spend a lot of money on customer service, and right now in this quarter we're hiring customer service people to be prepared for that very, very important third quarter high season. We have to do that right and we need the people to do that. We need to train them now so they will perform well in that high-season period. Because good customer service is where you get loyalty. It doesn't have to be anything that's screwed up in the booking of it. If the customer has a problem, we want to be able to help them out, no matter what the situation is. That's how we build loyalty, and I think that's one of the reasons for our strong growth. And I can give lots of anecdotes, but I won't. But I know we've reached out and we've helped our customers a great deal and I think that's one of the great reasons that we're being successful. Operator : Thank you. Our next question... Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Does that help? Operator : Comes from Mark May with Citi. You may begin. Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. I know that vacation rentals have been a meaningful contributor to room-night growth recently, but I think you recently stated that you're not only in the early process of adding inventory there, but that you haven't maybe promoted it as much as you would like to your users. And just a question is what are your plans for enhancing the promotion of this offering to your users? And then secondly, another question in terms of the advertising, performance advertising leverage. Is there anything that you're seeing, either in the market externally or things that you're doing internally driven, where you actually think that you could actually see some leverage in ad spend in the near to medium term. Thanks. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: So I'll take the first one, and Dan will take the second one. I agree with that statement that not as many people know about our great product as I would like, because I'd like everybody to know about it. Now, in terms of your question about how we're going to make more people be aware of our vacation-rental business, we are acting, we are working on it, and we are coming up with plans. But I think the last thing I want to do is reveal what our plans are to our competitors and how we're going to make more people aware that we do have this great product. So I'm going to have to pass on actually giving away the plans on how we're going to make people aware of our product. Dan? Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: And then performance advertising leverage, Mark, it's all the factors you mentioned. So it's what's happening with external players, what we're doing internally, again trying to strike a balance between top line growth and bottom line growth. So we're pushing into channels where we think we can do that efficiently. There's also the manner in which the auction is run by the advertiser, and we're balancing all of those to try and strike a good balance. What I answered earlier to somebody else's question, I wouldn't forecast that there's going to be leverage in performance marketing. I would have to see that for a number of quarters and have some reason to expect it to continue before I would build that into a forecast. While we have had quarters here and there where the leverage story on performance marketing has been better, in general now for many years, all the way back to 2012, it's been a source of margin pressure. And I've seen it as a source of margin pressure in other players in our space too. In fact, to a greater degree on their margins than what we've experienced with ours. So I feel comfortable that we are continuing to expand our lead in a very competitive marketplace, and performance marketing has been the most important tool that we have used to try and drive traffic to our website over our history and build our brands. We're improving our capabilities with brand advertising, and we look to deploy money there too where we think we can get a reasonable return. Even if it's over a longer period of time because there's typically a lag there between when you spend and then the benefit that you get by having more brand awareness and having people potentially come to you directly, which would improve the performance advertising metrics. And maybe even just cause them to search for our brand or a higher propensity to click on our brand when they search in other paid channels. So I think there's opportunities for us from time to time to invest a little bit more heavily in brand advertising and that would help, but I wouldn't forecast performance advertising leverage until we see that happening. Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Bieber with Credit Suisse. You may begin. Paul Bieber - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you for taking my questions and congratulations, Dan. I was hoping you can provide some color on the puts and takes that drove the lower year-over-year agency take rates. I think some of that is from the Easter shift, but hoping that you can elaborate. And then the second question is I was hoping that you'd provide color on why meta-search is becoming so strategically important across the industry? Is it because of Trivago's growth? Is it because of the breakdown of rate parity? Or are there some other reasons for just the strategic importance of meta-search? Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Why don't I take that second one first, and Dan can take the first one. So meta is important. We have KAYAK. We're pleased with their performance. And there are others, like you mentioned Trivago. But I'd caution you when I say how important it is, I'm not sure it's a qualitative term, not a quantitative term. I'd like to point out that our overall business through meta is still a relatively small amount. So I wouldn't overemphasize it. It's important but I wouldn't overemphasize it. Why is it growing? Why do people like to use it? I could give some potential reasons of people enjoy to be able to see multiple price properties there with different prices so they can see is this the best price or not. And then they can go off to a place like Booking.com or Priceline or agoda and do the actual booking. But the why side of the point to us is making sure that we're there. We try and run our business so we are aware of where the customer wants to be. And customers who want to use meta, we have a great product there for them. And that's how we do it. It's us not trying to tell the customer you should use this; it's us making sure we have the best product service available for that customer who wants to use it. And I think that's the best way to look at it. Dan? Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: And, Paul, your assumption was correct on the agency take rate. So you're looking at agency gross profit divided by agency gross bookings. That's down because of the Easter shift. The fundamental take rates are very, very stable. Paul Bieber - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Thank you. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. You may begin. Ross Sandler - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats, Dan. I just had two questions. One was a follow-up on the earlier question about repeat users. So have some of those efforts that Glenn mentioned to drive repeats, are those metrics actually improving? Or do you guys kind of view this as a space where the potential around repeat, given the low frequency of purchases, just may not be there? Or is there a penetration rate that you think the industry needs to be at where, you know, repeat \u2013 organic repeat can be a source of leverage at some point down the road? And then the second question is, any color on Facebook's new retargeting product for travel? I know you guys have been testing it. How has that been going? Thank you. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: It's Glenn speaking. So going back on that repeat. I think, you know, the way we answered it pretty much answered as much as we can say. Although I will add that we are very pleased with our repeat rate. And I'm not going to give out a repeat number, but I'd caution everybody in trying to think they know what it is. So I just want to caution you on that. The second thing which I didn't mention about repeat, which I think is an important factor, is providing that great service and having them come back is something that not only helps us with that person, but there's that ability for people to be talking about what a good service it is. So you get another benefit in that word-of-mouth type advertising that's also very helpful and very powerful. So we agree repeat is very important. We work to make sure we give a good service. We want them to have that good service, and then there's an echo effect on it going forward. In regards to Facebook, we have mentioned earlier several times that we are working with Facebook, trying to improve the way to get more business out of Facebook. We have people who are dedicated to working with Facebook to create this because we pointed out we would like to spend a lot more money with Facebook. But as Dan has pointed out and we've talked about a lot in the past, we try to be very disciplined about our marketing expense and we want to get the appropriate ROI. So we need to come up with tools and ways to get and products \u2013 ways that Facebook will give us a good return on our spend. When that happens, we are ready, willing, able to spend a lot of money with them to find another way to get customers. Is that helpful? Ross Sandler - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Super helpful. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Perry Gold with MoffettNathanson. You may begin. Perry Gold - MoffettNathanson LLC : Thanks so much for taking the question and congratulations, Dan. Two please if I may. Can you provide any color in terms of any potential impact you saw to inbound travel to the U.S. as a result of the current administration's rhetoric and attempted travel bans? And could you also provide any color on broader macro or regional trends you have seen through the first five weeks or so of 2Q? Any notable changes to call out? Thanks so much. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: I'll just take the first part, and Dan can talk about the second part. Regarding political effects, a couple things I'd like to emphasize. One, we are an extremely global company. We are able to get someone a property in more than 200 countries and territories around the world. And if somebody decides that they don't want to visit one place for whatever reason it is, we are fortunate that we have properties where hopefully they will want to go and they'll be able to use us for that. So that's the first point. The second point is we have heard a lot of rhetoric about this, so we look at our data. And we have not seen a material impact from political events in the U.S. that we can tease out and say, that's a cause of something happening. It's \u2013 we just don't see it there in a material way. Other people may be seeing different things, but we can't comment on theirs. We're just looking at our data. Dan? Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: And, Perry, we feel like the broader macro trends are positive, particularly in the travel market. We see occupancy rates are strong, ADRs are up, the reported results of other players in the space I think we're very strong. So it feels to us like the macro is healthy. As far as it relates to the trend thus far in the quarter, it's a little bit clouded by the shift in Easter. So when there's a holiday like that where people are traveling, what we'll typically see is an uptick in cancellations going into the holiday for people whose plans have changed, and then while people are traveling, they're not making bookings, and so that impacts our gross bookings growth. So I'd say the broad macro is positive. It's a little bit difficult to read because of the impact of the shift in timing for Easter into Q2. Perry Gold - MoffettNathanson LLC : Great. Thank you. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. You may begin. Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Wondering if you can just talk a little bit about the seasonality of the kind of noncore hotel accommodation business versus the core hotel. Do you see kind of more alternative accommodations have a longer booking window that's concentrated in the beginning of the year such that that faster growth kind of influences growth rates in 1Q structurally relative to the rest of the year while it's growing faster? Is there any color you can give that help us understand that seasonality? Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Lloyd, we're not seeing any significant impact on the booking window from the growth in vacation rentals on our site. And maybe that's based upon the way we're presenting them, very integrated into our search results, and so people are still searching the way they would search. Maybe there are some on-the-margin people that are coming in specifically looking for vacation rentals and they're booking a little bit earlier. But we think that the expansion in the booking window is more driven by growth in repeat users and direct traffic than the addition of vacation rental properties. Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And I guess as a follow-up, it sounds like most of the users coming in and booking alternative accommodations are probably coming in on similar marketing channels and similar search terms. But is there any difference in terms of like where you're finding people who end up booking nontraditional or the kind of marketing ROIs associated with those folks, or those channels? Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: We're using the same channels to find people that end up booking vacation rentals. It opens up the panoply of keywords that we can advertise on by having these different types of properties. But the channels are the same. And we have said from time to time in the past that the vacation rental ADRs, take rates and ROIs are fairly similar. I mean, we don't run a separate AdWords campaign just for the vacation rentals. They're part of our broader campaigns and so we look at it in total. Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo. You may begin. Robert James Coolbrith - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good afternoon. This is Rob on the call for Peter. Another question on vacation rentals around instant bookability. Looking at your competitors today, properties that are online bookable with a 24-hour confirmation outnumber instantly bookable properties there maybe by five to one or more, depending on the market. Just wondering how important changing that owner or manager behavior will be for your supply growth into the future and what you think might change that behavior over time. Also just wondering, it's been a while since you gave us a sense of the relative scale of VR room nights. I think the last time was way back in mid-2015. I'm wondering if you might be willing to give us an update there. Thank you. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: So, we're not disclosing the room night data. So, we'll not be passing that over. But in regards to growing the supplier base, 51% supplier base growth in that category is a very rapid growth. So, I don't think we're up to the stage where you have to be concerned about changing property manager behavior right now. If and when that happens, we'll deal with it at that point. But right now just by this most recent data that we've disclosed, over 50% growth rate says that we've got a lot of properties out there to put on with the thing \u2013 the way they're willing to do it right now and not have to convince anybody of anything. We just need to get them signed up and put on the servers. Robert James Coolbrith - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies. You may begin. Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. And thank you, Dan, and congratulations also. Maybe a quick question on TripAdvisor, have you seen any impact to your performance there since Expedia has been added there? And then any \u2013 I think you said it's too small really to move too many needles, but any impact to the business from your Instant Book leads on TripAdvisor? Thanks. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Hi, Brian. No, what we said was when we got added to Instant Book, there was a lot of questions back then what was the impact. And because of the relative size of TripAdvisor to our business, it wasn't a significant impact to our growth or our advertising efficiency. And so the same is true now as Expedia got added. It hasn't significantly impacted our growth trend for ADRs with TripAdvisor. Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC : Got it. Thank you. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Naved Khan with Cantor Fitzgerald. You may begin. Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities : Yeah. Thank you very much. Can you elaborate a bit on the impact of the strong euro on the U.S. inbound and outbound and how meaningful is that as a part of the overall business? And then just on the expense line item, I look at G&A kind of jumped a bit sequentially as well as year-on-year. Anything to call out there? Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Well, strong euro. Times have changed when \u2013 now the $1.09/\u20ac1 is a strong euro. We're used to the good old days of $1.30. So I see nothing to call out there, Naved. It's been relatively stable for the last year or so. It's kind of been in that like $1.05 to $1.10 range. So nothing that I would call out regarding change in travel behavior from the euro. And I'm sorry, what was your second question? Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities : Just the G&A expense that kind of jumped sequentially, also year-on-year. So anything to call out, anything one-time there? Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Sequential G&A, I mean, the key drivers in there would be office-related expenses, so rent and related occupancy expenses and personnel related expenses, travel, and so forth. Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities : Yeah. It's just that it's probably the first time in maybe over a year or so that the line items sort of deleveraged, was the showing leverage. That's why just the reason for the question. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: It would just be investments that we're making in those areas as we're adding head count and being ready for growth in the future. Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities : Got it. Thank you. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: And I would expect that that would be an area in particular, Naved, where we would have leverage for the most part going forward. So for whatever reason, if it's in Q1, it could surely just be from the Easter shift. Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities : Thank you. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Kopelman with Cowen and Company. You may begin. Kevin Kopelman - Cowen and Company, LLC: Hi. Thanks and congrats, Dan, on the retirement and on a great tenure. You talked about seasonality in bookings this year with Q2 slower than usual. Can you also comment on the seasonality of profit? Do you anticipate that the typical weighting of profit toward third quarter high season will be increasing this year versus last year? And if so why? Thanks a lot. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Well, we don't have a Q3 forecast for you, Kevin. So, I won't say whether the weighting will increase, because that could give you a read on the bottom line. But it will continue to be by far our biggest profitability quarter of the year given just the normal seasonality of the business with the great preponderance of travel happening in Q3 for high-season summer travel. Kevin Kopelman - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. Thanks. And then just on the competitive landscape, last year, key competitor was having some issues during this time of year. Are you seeing any change as they've been more ramped up this year? Thanks. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: A couple things about the way we look at the landscape. One is we try and concentrate mostly on what can we do better, and we don't \u2013 we're not as concerned about what our competitors are doing. That's been a part of a culture at The Priceline Group for a very, very long time. So that being said, we're not naive. We do recognize that there is substantial competition out there, and people would like to try and take away some of our business and not let us go as fast as we have been going. I haven't seen any major changes in the last quarter that would indicate any major changes in the competitive landscape. And I'll let Dan, if Dan has any thoughts. Am I missing anything? Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: I'll just add from last year, we couldn't notice anything discernible in our results when they were talking about issues with their website, so... Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Yeah. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Yeah. Nothing that we could detect. Kevin Kopelman - Cowen and Company, LLC: Got it. Thank you. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is Jed Kelly with Oppenheimer. You may begin. Jed Kelly - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Great. Can you assess or expound on any changes you are seeing over the past year with the comfort level that traditional vacation-rental property managers that were typically operating through an inquiry-to-book model are now having with the instantly online-bookable model? Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: You know what? I haven't spoken to enough property managers to be able to answer that accurately or not. I think, we have to just look at the data, and the data is that we have lots of property managers who are willing to put their properties on our system. And as you can see from some of our competitors and what they have said, you can see that's happening in their businesses too. So from that data, I would make the assumption that people are becoming comfortable, or are comfortable, or always were comfortable if there was a system to do it easily. That's the best I think I can answer on that. And I just would reiterate that we are pleased with the growth of our supply in that area, and it is something that we are very focused on. Jed Kelly - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray. You may begin. Michael Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hey. Good afternoon. And, Dan, congrats on a great run. I just have one question for you guys. There's been some chatter that the hotel groups are looking at finding new ways to gain back more direct-booking share, potentially through some I guess alternative methods like more lobbying or legislative or other means. I'd just be curious if you have any thoughts on whether or not this is a risk for Priceline and perhaps generally just how you feel about where your current relationships are with your hotel partners. Thank you. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Sure. Couple things, and I'll start with saying we have good relationships with our hotel suppliers. And if we didn't have good relationships, we wouldn't be able to grow as fast as we have been growing or have achieved the success that we have been able to achieve. And we do that by providing to our hotel partners some great services, helping them in areas that they can't do. We bring them customers, millions of customers. We put a platform out that enables them to see people from around the world and be able to try and get that customer to come into their hotel. And I read in the news some things that you're referring to, and I'd just make couple of points. One, as I think we have talked about before and you can do by just doing some math on the numbers that we've revealed, we have a mid-single-digit percentage market share in this business. There are a couple implications to that. One is we got a lot of landscape in front of us. There's a lot of room for us going forward. Second thing I'd say is in that news item, I heard them use the word like monopoly, and I just point out that I have never heard the word monopoly used in the same sentence about somebody who has a mid-single-digit share. We've done a very good job with our partners since I've come here 17 years ago. And we will I believe continue to do so going forward. Every company wants to try and have customers come to them direct and lower the marketing distribution cost as much as possible. We get that. Well, we'd like to do so ourselves. Believe me, I'd love for our customers to just call us and not have to pay any marketing at all to get them to come. But that's not the way the committed world works, and you have to pay to get people to come and notice you and pay for them to come continuously and come back. That's the way it works. I don't fault anybody for wanting to try and bring people to their business directly. I do fault anybody who makes misstatements or allegations that aren't true. Enough said. Michael Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you Operator : Thank you. This concludes the Q&A session. I'd like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Well, I just want to thank everybody for listening to us, and thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thanks for your participation, and have a wonderful day.",

And now, I'd like to introduce The Priceline Group's speaker for this afternoon, Glenn Fogel and Daniel Finnegan. Go ahead, gentlemen. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Thank you, and welcome to The Priceline Group's second quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our Priceline Group CFO, Dan Finnegan. The Group produced a solid quarter, reporting worldwide accommodation reservations of 170 million room nights, which is up 21% year-over-year and hit the top of our guidance range. Consolidated gross bookings were up about 19% year-over-year on a constant currency basis or about 16% in U.S. dollars. Gross profit was up about 24% year-over-year on a constant currency basis or about 21% in U.S. dollars. Adjusted EBITDA increased 20% year-over-year to $974 million. We believe the growth that we are reporting demonstrates the strength of our brands, the value of a diversified global footprint and solid execution by our more than 22,000 employees located in more than 280 offices around the world. Looking at our individual brands, Booking.com recorded another impressive quarter, adding approximately 150,000 properties to the platform. As of June 30, 2017, Booking.com's total property count was more than 1.3 million, which was a 39% year-over-year growth rate and represented approximately 26.1 million potentially bookable rooms. These properties are located in over 220 countries and territories and show Booking.com's depth and breadth of global accommodation listings. One of the most important parts of the Booking.com platform is its vacation rental properties, which adds real choice for our customers. As of June 30, 2017, Booking.com had over 721,000 vacation rental properties, a growth rate of 54% year-over-year. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of accelerating growth in vacation rental properties. We will continue to add these type of properties across our entire global footprint and note that all of the Booking.com vacation rental properties are instantly bookable. We believe these types of properties not only offer more choice for our customers, but also provides conversion benefits across the entire Booking.com marketplace. We recently closed KAYAK's acquisition, the Momondo Group, and are delighted to welcome the momondo team to The Priceline Group. We believe the Momondo Group's two strong brands, momondo and Cheapflights, will help further our goal of having the world's best meta platforms. The Momondo Group is being integrated into KAYAK, and we are pleased to see early progress in this area. Agoda produced another solid quarter of gross bookings growth, despite the competitive Asian markets in which it operates. Agoda is using technology to maintain a high level of competitiveness, employing machine learning to price effectively and continuously improving its front end through relentless experimentation. We believe that these efforts and others will enable Agoda to continue to be one of Asia's premier accommodation booking sites. Rentalcars.com delivered another strong quarter on both the top and bottom lines, as the team continues to push operational improvements in key areas like customer service. Rentalcars.com is also beginning to build its capabilities to provide multiple ground transportation products for the entirety of its customers' journeys. We are excited about Rentalcars.com long-term vision to significantly reduce customer friction in ground transportation. priceline.com extended the progress it made in the first quarter and is seeing gradual acceleration in room night growth. We believe investments in people, product, technology and marketing are contributing to this improvement. OpenTable produced another positive quarter, driven by top line growth and is meeting or exceeding its key operating metrics for the year, such as scaling its restaurant listings, growing total visitors on the platform and upgrading restaurants from its legacy Electronic Reservation Book system to its cloud-based Guest Center Service. As we turn to the second half of the year and beyond, we note that we are always striving to increase the value of our accommodations platform. First, we believe that adding inventory, especially non-hotel properties and its related content, is an important step. We also believe that building a closer, direct relationship with our customers is an important long-term goal. One way we are doing this is by increasing our focus on brand marketing, which we have been doing and expect to continue to do so. However, even in paid channels, building the direct relationship is relevant. As we choose how much capital to deploy to a given paid channel, we evaluate things like the ROI, the overall user experience and the repeat to direct rates. Once a customer has landed on our site, we want to provide a great user experience with the greatest selection of all types of accommodations at the best prices on the best digital platforms with the best customer support. Overall, we expect to continually measure and analyze all of our marketing mix to ensure that we are building a direct relationship with our customers. Finally, as we continue to move through our busy summer season, our employees are intensely focused on delivering an exceptional customer experience. I would like to thank our employees around the world for their hard work and dedication, especially during this peak travel season. And I would like to thank our supplier partners, with whom we are so proud to be associated with, and most important of all, thank you to our millions of customers throughout the world. I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Thanks, Glenn. I'll discuss operating results and cash flows for the quarter, and then provide guidance for the third quarter of 2017. All growth rates referenced in my comments are relative to the prior year comparable period, unless otherwise indicated. I highlight that our non-GAAP financial results and forecasts include stock-based compensation and do not reflect the reduction to income tax expense related to available NOLs. The reconciliation between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is detailed in our earnings release. Room nights booked in Q2 grew by 21%, which was the top end of our guidance range. Performance was strong across each of our key geographic regions, and we believe that the growth rate achieved represents another quarter of increased market share. Rental car day reservations grew by 12% compared to 15% growth in Q1. Average daily rates for accommodations, or ADRs, were down slightly for Q2 versus prior year on a constant currency basis for the consolidated Group, which was below our forecast for growth of about 1%. Foreign exchange rates unfavorably impacted growth rates expressed in U.S. dollars for our Q2 results as compared to prior year, but were slightly favorable to our guidance forecast. The favorable trend for foreign exchange rates has continued in Q3 as we will discuss in a moment when we get to guidance. Q2 gross bookings grew by 16% expressed in U.S. dollars, and grew by about 19% on a constant currency basis compared to prior year. Gross profit for the quarter for The Priceline Group was $3 billion and grew by 21% in U.S. dollars, and by about 24% on a constant currency basis compared to prior year. We estimate that gross profit growth benefits by about 2 percentage points from Easter shifting to Q2 this year. The shift of Easter from Q1 last year to Q2 this year also favorably impacted Q2 operating profit, EBITDA, net income and profit margins compared to the prior year. Our international operations generated gross profit of $2.6 billion, which grew by 24% in U.S. dollars, and by about 26% on a constant currency basis compared to prior year. Gross profit for our U.S. operations amounted to $351 million, which grew about 7% compared to the prior year. Advertising and other revenue, which is mainly comprised of non-intercompany revenues for KAYAK and OpenTable, grew by 5% in Q2 compared to the prior year. GAAP operating income grew by 22%, and GAAP operating margins increased by 12 bps compared to Q2 last year. Operating margin performance was better than our forecast and prior year due mainly to gross profit growth and some brand advertising shifting into Q3. Non-advertising operating expenses were also favorable to forecast, due mainly to relatively lower bonus accruals and timing of spend. Performance advertising deleverage compared to the prior year was caused by lower ROIs and share of traffic by channel, partly offset by timing of bookings versus stays, including the impact of the timing of Easter that I just discussed. Adjusted EBITDA for Q2 amounted to $974 million which exceeded the top end of our guidance range of $905 million, and grew by 20% versus prior year. GAAP net income and fully diluted EPS both increased by 24%. Non-GAAP fully diluted net income per share was $15.14, up 20% versus the prior year, exceeding our guidance for the quarter and FactSet consensus of $14.20. In terms of cash flow, we generated $1.2 billion of cash from operations during second quarter 2017 which is an increase of about 19%. During the quarter, we returned $344 million to our stockholders through share buybacks. Our cash and investments amounted to $16.6 billion at June 30, 2017, with about $1.9 billion of that balance in the U.S. In July, we paid about $550 million of our international cash to close the momondo acquisition. We are very happy to welcome the momondo team into KAYAK and The Priceline Group. The acquisition is expected to be modestly accretive to our consolidated non-GAAP earnings in its first year post close, but to have a de minimis impact in Q3. We expect the acquisition to have a materially accretive impact to KAYAK's results and to help KAYAK accelerate its international growth and build its scale in the meta-search channel. Now, for Q3 guidance. Our guidance assumes that our growth rates will decelerate, mainly due to the size of our business and consistent with long-term trends. Our guidance also reflects a difficult comp because our room night growth accelerated in the third and fourth quarters of last year. Our Q3 forecast is based upon recent foreign exchange rates, which for the first time in recent memory, are favorable to our growth rates expressed in U.S. dollars. We have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our third quarter EBITDA net earnings from any further fluctuations in the euro, British pound and various other currencies versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter. But the hedges do not protect our gross bookings, gross profit or operating profit from the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. We are forecasting booked room nights to grow by 11% to 16% and total gross bookings to also grow by 11% to 16% in U.S. dollars and by 9% to 14% on a constant currency basis. Our Q3 forecast assumes the constant currency accommodation ADRs for the consolidated Group will be down by about 1% compared to the prior year period. We forecast gross profit to grow by 15.5% to 20.5% in U.S. dollars and by 12.5% to 17.5% on a constant currency basis. GAAP operating margins, expressed as operating income as a percentage of gross profit, are expected to be about 2,400 bps higher than prior year Q3, which included a $941 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge. Q3 adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $2.03 billion and $2.13 billion, which at the midpoint is up 13% versus prior year. We forecast adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of gross profit will be about 230 bps lower than prior year Q3. Our Q3 forecast assumes year-over-year pressure on performance marketing ROIs and increases in brand advertising, partly related to phasing of spend. More than half of the forecasted deleverage relates to non-advertising operating expenses as we invest for high travel season and innovation to drive future growth. Glenn just spoke about some of the areas where we are investing. We are confident that investments in IT talent, supply acquisitions, customer service and advertising will help us continue to stay ahead of the competition and deliver healthy growth in the future. We still expect that our non-advertising expenses will grow more slowly than our gross profit over the longer-term, but in the short-term, these investments will also exert a similar level of margin pressure in Q4. We forecast GAAP EPS between $31.70 to $33.40 per share for Q3, which, at the midpoint, is up by about 221% versus prior year. Year-over-year growth is impacted by the $941 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge recorded in the third quarter of last year that I just mentioned. Our EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 50.1 million shares, which reflects the beneficial impact of the common stock repurchases we have made to date, offset by additional equivalent shares related to our convertible bonds due to the increase in our stock price. We are forecasting Q3 non-GAAP fully diluted net income per share of approximately $32.40 to $34.10 per share, which at the midpoint, is up by about 12% versus prior year. Our forecasted non-GAAP income tax rate is about 18% for Q3 and the full year. Our forecast does not assume any significant change in macroeconomic conditions in general or in the travel market in particular. We will now take your questions. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney of RBC. Your line is open. Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. Could you just talk about demand trends? And I guess conversion rates too for traditional hotels versus kind of the alternative accommodations and what you're seeing there to the extent to which you're able to move the needle and start driving demand over to alternative accommodations? How much success you've had with doing that? Thank you. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Hi, Mark. It's Glenn speaking. So I think you know we don't disclose the individual conversion rates for the different types of properties, but maybe I can give you a little color about how important we think the non-hotel accommodation or sometimes we like to call it the vacation rentals business is. And I made the point in my prepared remarks about how we are continuing to accelerate the number of properties we're bringing on and I think that's evidence of how important it is to us. And certainly sometimes people come to our site or to our mobile apps and they didn't even think that they wanted to get a vacation room instead of a hotel. That's one of the benefits of our platform, where we offer both types of properties right on that results page. So I can even give myself as an example going on a holiday with two teenage kids and my wife, so there are four of us and trying to think do we want a hotel or do we want to do something on a vacation stay. And it's so easy on the Booking.com site to see both types of properties right there and be able to make that decision. So we don't try and drive people to one or the other. The customer makes that decision. It's our job to make sure we get the right product out there at the right prices, giving people the opportunity to choose what they want and if anything were to ever go wrong, make sure that we have that customer service there to back it up. That's the way we're going forward, that's how we're going to win in that business. And, Dan, I don't know if you want to give any added points to it? Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: No, Glenn, I think you covered it all. Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you, Glenn. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Thanks, Mark. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Post of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you for taking my question. Just related to the deceleration in the guidance in 3Q, anything unusual happening in the marketing channels versus competition besides just tougher comps? Or any downtick in your marketing conversion rates contemplated in the quarter? Thank you. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: So, Justin, let me put it this way. Again, we hit the top of our guidance. We're pleased with our growth rate. The deceleration in the growth rate is consistent with our long-term trends and expectation for the business given our size now. The rate of deceleration certainly fluctuates from time to time, but I would say that we're pleased by the resiliency in our growth rate over many years. And I'd like to say that the factors that have propelled us to where we are now are still intact. Some of the factors would be the secular shift from offline to online. We still have a very, very large market opportunity. We're still a single digit market share of the global accommodation business. We're growing the property count. You saw those numbers. We're the best converting mobile and desktop platform in the whole space. We believe we're doing thousands of experiments every day. It's a consistent balanced approach is our marketing. So I'm not going to call one out for this. We're always looking to make sure that we're optimizing in our marketing for all the different ways to market. And I'd just say that we're continuing to do the hard work. We have people who are coming up with innovation all the time, mobile execution, the vacation rentals I just mentioned. So I'm pretty pleased with where we sit right now. And, Dan, anything you want to add? Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: I would highlight that the comp is particularly difficult. So that factors into the deceleration relative to the prior year and our guide. And as Glenn said, our approach in the paid channels is consistent with what it's always been. So, nothing that I would call out there. Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line is open. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you for taking the question. Maybe just following up on your comments on the marketing spend, you called out ROI and share of traffic by channel. Wanted to know if we could get any more color there as you look into the back part of the year or what those pressures might be in terms of the marketing spend or the return you get on marketing spend. Thanks so much. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: So, it's Glenn speaking, Eric. We don't call out the different factors for the different marketing channels. One of the things that we think is very important is to using all the science we have. And we've hired a lot of very, very talented people in all areas; marketing, data scientists, technologists, to try and make sure that we can measure the amount of money we spend in all the different places that we can \u2013 that we're marketing that we can get the best return. And in that return, certainly ROI is an important factor, but it's not the only factor. And we include other things, such as so we mentioned things like repeat rates. Are people coming back direct? How sticky is this? What's the user experience? We factor everything in we can to make sure that in the long run we're going to help build that direct relationship with our customers, which we believe in the long run is the way to become successful. Dan, you've been involved in this for a long time. What are your thoughts? Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Well, we did specifically say, Eric, in the prepared remarks that we are expecting that we'll see continued pressure on ROIs in Q3. So that is built into the forecast. And we didn't talk about our expectations for channel share, so we'll probably update you on that when we report the quarter. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. And, ladies and gentlemen, our next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks for taking the question. Let's just talk about the gross profit growth, and even if we're just looking at it on a FX-neutral basis, it just looks like the gross profit dollars that you're getting there are coming from kind of higher gross profit bookings perhaps relative to what we've seen in recent quarters. So we saw some of that in 2Q and maybe that's implied in the 3Q guide as well. Is there something in particular going on there in terms of the mix? Thank you. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: No, Doug, nothing in terms of the mix. So we had a few quarters there where you were seeing pressure on that metric, gross profit as a percentage of gross bookings. And we said that there was a modest underlying pressure on take rates; things like Agoda, experimenting with discounting in their markets. But fundamentally, take rate is down and more what we were seeing was just a difference in timing between when bookings were occurring and stays were occurring. And when we have accelerating growth or strong growth as we had in the end of last year, in the first quarter of this year, the gross bookings grow faster than the gross profit. We also had the added impact of Easter shifting out of Q1 last year and into Q2 this year. And so now, we're getting the benefit of that in Q2, just a higher growth in checkouts relative to gross bookings. We're forecasting the same phenomena for Q3. But I would say underlying that is a similar level of what I would call very modest pressure on underlying take rates. Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry of Goldman Sachs. Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Glenn, wondering if you could just give us a sense of how much of this is related to strategy for you. This quarter is actually the lowest that we've seen in terms of the increase in advertising spend as a percentage of brand in the last year, 1.5 years or so. Was there a decision or is there a point to be made around your preference between sort of margin and gross bookings growth or gross profit growth here? It would appear based on that, that there was a trade-off that was made this quarter relative to the rate that you had been running for the prior four quarters. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Yes, I'm going to let Dan take that. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Let me start off and then Glenn can talk about our approach to advertising. But fundamentally, what you're seeing there, Heath, is that deceleration in the top line. So we're getting the benefit of checkouts in Q2 from Easter and just from strong growth in gross bookings in prior quarters. And we had some deceleration in the room night growth, and so there's less advertising spend coming through to drive those bookings. But the fundamental ROI pressure there underlying, that is similar to what we saw in the quarters before. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: And in the overall strategy, I would say there's been no change in strategy. We're always looking for a balance between growth and profit, and you've seen how we've done this for many, many years. I've been here now 17.5 years, and I think we've been fairly consistent and we'll continue to be consistent. And in terms of the amount of money we're going to put to marketing, that's a function of that. And it depends on ROIs and what kind of returns we're going to be able to get is going to help determine how much money we're going to spend, and even more so where we're going to spend it. And as I've mentioned a couple of times now, but I'll repeat it because it's very important, that we're going to spend the money, and no matter what the marketing channel is, that's going to give us the optimal return for the long run. And that's important. Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one is going back to your comments on building direct relationships, just curious, did the business mix shift toward direct in the quarter? And then high level, could you just talk to any of the hurdles you think you need to overcome to really grow your overall direct bookings mix? And then, Glenn, I'd be curious to hear, you've inherited a very strong European business that seems to have pretty big market share. If you step back, what are one or two areas where you really see the potential to improve the overall European growth over the next couple of years? Thanks. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Okay. So the first question about direct, and we don't really talk about what the rate of people who come to us are direct or not. And there's nothing that I'll call out that's different or any of that. It's just what I will say is \u2013 and you've seen this over many, many years and Dan's pointed this out several times, about increasing pressure in certain parts of the marketing channels, ROIs going down, and you can see CPCs going up on certain paid channels. So of course everybody always wants to get as many customers as possible to come to you direct, not have to pay for the marketing, and that's just exasperated (sic) [exacerbated] when the cost of getting a new customer is more expensive. So, nothing really new there, still trying the best. How we are going to do that is the same way we've always been doing it, but even more so. And that's providing all the things that we talk about each time we go on the call, which is making sure we have the greatest breadth of accommodations. That choice, and making sure there's everything available, is very important to the consumer when they come to our site. You have to have the inventory and to make sure that you've got the best price, because if you don't have the best price, they are going to go somewhere else. And once they do that, once they are okay with that, you want to make sure they have the easiest way to go through the process, whether it be on our desktop, or our mobile apps, or whatever form it may be down the road, is the most efficient, easiest, most frictionless way possible. And then, as I've pointed out before, at the end of the day, it's unfortunate but true. Sometimes, things go wrong for people, and many times it's nobody's fault, it's just something that's gone wrong in the person's travels, and we want to be there to be able to provide them with that assistance, which is why we do it 24 hours, seven days a week in so many different languages. We have 43 languages on our Booking.com site. Doing all those things is what helps promote loyalty, and we're going to keep on doing that to get those people. So when they think about they're going to travel, they need an accommodation on Booking.com, or they're thinking of getting a car rental from Rentalcars.com, or they need a reservation at a restaurant, they go to OpenTable. Whatever part of our Group, we want to make sure that the first thing they think is coming to us, and by providing a great service, that's how we're going to be able to do it. And your last question about Europe. While it's true we are probably the biggest player in Europe in accommodations, and it's \u2013 I would not say us to be a small player, I would still say relative to the total amount of accommodations in Europe, it's not a large share. And that's just a tremendous opportunity for us to continue to build that out. And it's not just Europe, but of course throughout the world. And as I said before, there's a lot of road left for us. Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark May of Citi. Your line is open. Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks for taking my questions. Hopefully you can hear me. I believe in your prepared remarks, you commented about shifting some of your brand spend from Q2 to Q3. Can you discuss a little bit about why that occurred, maybe the magnitude? And if there's maybe a bit more flexibility in terms of pushing that out even further? And then just a bigger picture question around meta-search. You've obviously been acquiring some meta-search assets. Does that, in all, reflect your view that it's been a bit difficult to convert some of the meta-search customers into direct repeat customers? Thanks. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: In terms of the advertising phasing, that's determined by our marketing teams and they determined that they weren't going to spend as much in Q2 as they had initially thought, and now they are going to spend it instead in Q3. So nothing specific that I'd call out there, Mark, other than that the marketing team's at the helm in deciding how they want to deploy the advertising. On meta-search, we've seen that it's a channel that's gained traction with travelers over the years, and so we saw momondo as a great acquisition that we could add into the KAYAK fold, and help build the scale of that business. We like having a meta-search business in the Group, and we like having an even bigger meta-search business. We think that's even a better position to be in. It was just a very natural fit between the two brands in various markets across Europe, so KAYAK is strong in some markets, momondo is strong in others. And so, we're really excited about the two businesses working together to maximize the opportunity in our meta-search platform going forward. Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Bieber of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Paul Bieber - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I think it's the first time in maybe several quarters that you haven't beaten the high end of your room night growth guidance. So I was just wondering if something changed intra-quarter or if your approach to guidance changed. And then secondly, I believe you made some comments about the Asian competitive landscape when commenting on Agoda growth. Could you just provide some color on what you're seeing on the competition front in Asia? Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Sure. In regards to your first, the answer is no change in the way we do guidance. Regarding the competitors and what I meant by that, let me give a little more color to that. So while I think many of you recognize that Asia is a great opportunity in the travel industry because a lot of people are becoming first time travelers, GDP per capita goes up and people become wealthy enough to travel, they want to travel right away. So that's great. Lots of growth there and you see it in many different ways and shapes and form (33:46). But, one thing that we have seen and this is over the two decades almost that I've been looking on the Internet is that when you have very strong growth opportunities, you have a lot of players come in. And the players come in with a lot of capital. And it's very much a type of trying to grab \u2013 it's a land grab. People trying to get share as quickly as possible, build up brand awareness, build up their name and try and get customers. And one of the ways they do this is raising capital and giving it away to customers, so, essentially discounting or other practices to try and build that business quickly as they can. That's the competitive scenario. If you look at prices for accommodations in Asia, it is one of the most competitive places in the world. And that makes it more difficult for public companies that have certain desires to hit profitability levels versus a private company perhaps that isn't constrained the same way and goes out and raise capital and then gives it away in the marketplace to the consumer with discount and in fact at a loss type accommodations. That makes it more difficult. That's why I'm so happy with the guys at Agoda, who using all their technology and machine learning and pricing and doing it appropriately to compete effectively, to continue to grow, even though I won't say that they are competing with one hand tied behind their back but I'll say they have a more difficult challenge, and that's what I was referring to. Paul Bieber - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Perry Gold of MoffettNathanson. Your line is open. Perry Gold - MoffettNathanson: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Can you please discuss how the inclusion of flights at Booking.com has fared and whether it's helped to sell other travel products or overall site conversion? Thanks so much. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: So, I will say one of the great things about this company, this Group, and one of the things that's helped make it to this level of success that it has is willingness to experiment. And we experiment in many, many different ways, including bringing in different products on to different company websites and see how they perform. And when they become successful, we will then do more of that and if it's not successful, we'll just give it away. Some of you may have seen some experimentation we're doing at Booking.com regarding some flight things with KAYAK and we'll continue to experiment. Beyond that, there's not much to add except the fact that it is very successful, we'll do more of it. If it's not successful, we'll stop. Perry Gold - MoffettNathanson: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. A couple if I can. First, can you guys just give us an update on how booking windows are continuing to change? Are you still seeing kind of more come early in the year and then again kind of late in 3Q from mobile? And do you think that's continuing to shift? And then just second one, you talked I think a little bit more in your prepared remarks about spending more on non-advertising OpEx. Can you elaborate a bit on if there's anything specific you're investing in and what kind of magnitude we should be thinking about perhaps relative to the BookingSuite investments in 2015? Thanks. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Hey, Lloyd. So, as it relates to booking window, we're seeing steady expansion in the booking window. So that trend continues and we are also seeing more bookings coming at last minute because of mobile. So that trend has continued. I wouldn't call it just bookings coming in the early part of the year and then late in summer over mobile. But I'd just say in general, we're seeing that trend. In terms of non-advertising OpEx, in the prepared remarks, I said more than half of the deleverage forecasted for Q3 is attributable to non-advertising OpEx, so that will give you a sense for the sizing. And I said also that it's likely we would have a similar level of deleverage from non-advertising OpEx in Q4 as those investments flow through the pipeline. We still feel good that over the long-term based upon the growth of our business and the past track record where we have been able to deliver leverage in non-advertising OpEx that we can make investments in the business, generally speaking, in the long-term, without having deleverage in that line item. But in the short-term here, we talked about the type of areas where we're investing. We are investing for future growth. Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler of Barclays. Your line is open. Ross Sandler - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Glenn, just following up on the topic of building direct relationship, Expedia stated a year ago that Hotels.com had about two-thirds of its bookings from loyalty members. So just wondering what the merits of cheaper prices and service levels are versus having a garden-variety loyalty program. I know you've experimented with that for business customers in the past. What's your thoughts on just using price versus a traditional loyalty program? Thank you. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: So, it's true. Booking.com has its Genius program, which I believe you're familiar with, and Agoda has a different program to get theirs and OpenTable does loyalty program a different way that all of them. End of the day, though, more than anything in terms of loyalty is providing a great experience and the best price overall. One of the things that we have a mission, it's \u2013 the mission is to help experience the world. And to enable people to help experience the world, that means giving them a great experience. And part of that starts right when you start exploring what you're going to do, where you're going to do it, how much it's going to cost. And we've been perfecting the way people are able to book their travel needs for many, many years. And we think that overall, that's more important than anything. Yes, you have to have the best price. And yes, some people, for example, frequent flyers who are known as Points Junkies, who only fly one airline for example to get their points, yes, there is a niche for that. And we have a small company in the Group called Rocketmiles that does something like that. But for the big picture for us is making sure that we have the absolute best product out there, providing it day in, day out with the best customer service. And I will point to some people, who aren't competitors but companies that I admire and look them as a reference. And one right off the bat would be Amazon. And Amazon, through the things that they have done has produced great loyalty. Why? Because it's an absolute great experience. It's a great way to get products you need at great price. And we have no shame in saying we'd like to do things like they do which is doing things the right way all the time as opposed to trying to buy loyalty by just giving away a product. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: And I'd just add to that, Glenn, the track record for Booking.com over the years has been very good, that we bring customers in, new customers through paid channels and we win them over as loyal customers over time by giving them a great experience. The downside of these loyalty point programs is that you end up paying for your direct customers, a fairly significant amount of money in addition to having to pay to acquire new customers. And so there's a balance there. Even if you do get a higher percentage of direct, it's not direct that you're not paying for. Ross Sandler - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Super helpful. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Peter Stabler of Wells Fargo. Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks very much. Two if I could. First on vacation rentals, you've noted repeatedly over the years that philosophically, you believe traveler fees work against consumer expectations and that harmonizing vacation rentals with hotel inventory from a consumer perspective is an advantage. Just wondering on the supply side, do you think having a higher homeowner commission structure impacts your ability to build additional supply? Does that set up a pricing challenge for owners? Or are they just going to look at the volume that Booking has, and say we're willing to pay a higher price? And then secondly, very quickly, on Asian marketing, just wondering, is that exclusively performance marketing? Or is there a brand element over there? Any color you could provide? Thank you very much. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Sure. And we've been asked that question before in different ways. And the way I look at this is to say that we are continuing to have good success in adding properties around the world in our vacation homes area. And we haven't seen any slowdown in that in terms of people protesting what they're being asked to pay in terms of that commission. So, I think we're okay there. If at some point there was a problem in that area, then we'd have to address it, but I see nothing in the near-term that is going to slow that down. And the fact that we accelerated the growth of vacation rental properties I think is a data point that says it's okay. What was your second question about marketing? Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Just curious about the mix over in Asia? Is it exclusively performance? Or is there brand marketing over there too? Thanks. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Yes, again, we don't want to divide up how we're going to split up the money in different geographies in terms of where's brand, how much paid, et cetera. But I think it's important to repeat again, we look at all of our marketing spend holistically. We're always looking for the best return. And we don't care what form it comes from. We just want to get that best result. So yes, we do in the numbers for you and when Dan prepares everything, you see a line item that has your performance stuff. But the marketing people, they're looking at everything holistically, and they're not told, oh you can only spend this amount on brand and this amount on performance, at all. Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Fitzgerald of Jefferies. Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Glenn, you mentioned machine learning going on around pricing at Agoda and then I think Christa has been out recently talking about using AI to drive OpenTable search results personalization. Are there common back-ends there that you guys are using? Are the data stores common to be leveraged there? And then maybe kind of a follow-on. I know a very broad question. Are your efforts there around machine learning, around AI, are they primarily kind of early innings focused on optimizing marketing? Or do you feel like it's broad-based, we're attacking marketing, we're attacking personalized results, ultimately we're driving conversion? Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Right. So, going to go in a little reverse order here. Everything regarding any form of AI, be it neural networks, machine learning, any form you want, very early innings in that area for everybody. I think 10 years from now, we're going to wonder, gee, it wasn't early innings, it's sort of like we're just warming up in the ballpark. So, that's a great opportunity down the road. Second thing, regarding our companies, we do give everybody a lot of independence, and that includes their data stores and data warehouses, they are not merged in any way, shape or form. But one of the successes of our company has been the sharing of knowledge, and that's allowing these data scientists to be able to get together at times \u2013 and actually all forms of our company in different areas get together from the different companies, and talk about what works, what doesn't work, and in that way we've been able, I think, to accelerate the Group's achievements no single company would possibly have been able to achieve on its own. Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC : Got it. Maybe I could ask one more just around the same question. Do you see \u2013 as the booking process is moving more mobile, would you call out any differentiation between the quality or the volume of data you get from the mobile side versus desktop? Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: I have not seen anything at this time that would be any sort of signaling that is material. With that being said, I have to admit I am not in the trenches with the people looking at what signals are gathering up. So I have to plead a little bit of ignorance in that, but I think we're okay in saying that there's nothing coming out yet that we need to announce a material improvement. Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC : Yes. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Kopelman of Cowen and Co. Your line is open. Kevin Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks a lot. I had a follow-up on your comments on discounting. Could you talk about what you saw in the couponing environment, specifically in Q2, from competitors in emerging markets? Is it fair to assume that it was worse in the second quarter compared to the first quarter, rather than stable? And then when you talk about very modest pressure on underlying take rates, what are the key drivers there of that modest pressure? Thanks a lot. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Well, I don't have any data in front of me that would compare the average discounting Q2 versus Q1 or nail it down there. I would just say that we do see it, and it is a competitive issue that we have to deal with. And take rates, I'll let Dan... Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: So that pressure on pricing and Agoda doing some discounting is one of the things that's driving that modest pressure on take rate. And then besides that, we've called out in the past the level to which change participate in preferred placement programs at Booking.com can also have a modest impact. Those would be the two principal drivers. Kevin Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks very much. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Olson of Piper Jaffray. Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Good afternoon. I have two quick ones. First, looking at competition from Hotel Direct, would you say it's more or less significant than it was six months or 12 months ago? And then second, if you excluded Europe, which market would you say you want to be most aggressive in over the next few years? You just made some kind of mix comments on Asia Pac and the tough competitive environment. So is it there? Or is it the U.S. or elsewhere? Thank you. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Let me go with the second one first, and we have said several times, and we'll still say it that China is by far the most important region for us to continue to develop our business there, because that's where the greatest growth is going to be. And the fact that it is competitive, and as I said at the very beginning, the reason it's competitive is because it's so attractive to everybody. So we're absolutely going to continue to do that there and we're doing it in three different ways. We're always concentrating on our inbound because we have so many customers around the world who are going to China. So we have a little bit of advantage in that one. China outbound because of the number of properties we have around the world, and all the other things we have that go with that, that gives us a good edge there, going on the outbound from China which is growing very, very rapidly. The last part that domestic Chinese business, the people in China who are traveling in China. It's tougher for a non-Chinese company. We're doing a lot of thinking what's the right way to approach it. We're investing, and of course you know that we have an over $2 billion investment in the number one online travel company in China, which is Ctrip, so we've a good partnership there too. So we're approaching in all different ways because we know it is a very, very important market for a very, very long time in the future. Regarding your other question about direct, Dan? Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: No, no real change in that. I think we \u2013 our relations with the big chains is very strong. They are great partners for us. And I think we're a great partner for them. We bring them a lot of demand. We're one of the lower cost distribution channels out there. So we continue to work well with the chains and their business with us continues to grow nicely. Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Great. Thanks. Operator : And I'm showing no further questions in queue. I'd like to turn the call back to Glenn Fogel for closing remarks. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Well, I just want to thank everybody for participating and thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the call. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

And now, I'd like to introduce The Priceline Group's speakers for this afternoon, Glenn Fogel and Daniel Finnegan. Go ahead, gentlemen. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Thank you and welcome to The Priceline Group's third quarter conference call. I am joined this afternoon by our Priceline Group's CFO, Dan Finnegan. The group produced a solid quarter, reporting worldwide accommodation reservations of 178 million room nights, which is up 19% year over year and exceeded the high-end of our guidance range. Consolidated gross bookings were up about 18% year over year in U.S. dollars, or about 16% on a constant-currency basis. Gross profit was up about 22% year over year in U.S. dollars, or about 19% on a constant-currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA increased 18% year over year to $2.2 billion. Our room night growth was healthy, considering a difficult year-over-year comparable. I believe this growth reflects strong execution by our brands in all of our key global markets. During the third quarter, we continued to develop and implement our performance and brand advertising strategies and made other investments in the business. Our results and our outlook for growth and operating margins are reflective of these steps. And going forward, these investments will enable us to further build on our foundation for the future. As you know, Booking.com has been building its investment in brand advertising over the past several years. Our results to-date and developments in the marketplace have encouraged us to continue this investment to further build this channel as a material source of direct traffic and as a way to bolster the effectiveness of our performance-based advertising. We believe these media investments will also help us build awareness in our vacation rental business, where we've been adding scale rapidly. By the end of the year, we expect to be advertising Booking.com on TV in approximately 30 countries compared to 12 countries in 2016. This continued spend as we build campaigns in additional geographies and increased media support in markets where we are already advertising will put pressure on margins. However, we believe this spend represents an important long-term investment in the franchise and is the right thing to do at this time. In performance-based channels, competition for top placement has reduced ROIs over the years and been a source of margin pressure, with an increasing share of the unit economics accruing to the benefit of our advertising partners. This has been a concern to us since some of these partners use our advertising dollars to compete with us in the advertising funnel and represent themselves as places to not only research travel but also book it. We are looking at each channel and managing them to ensure that we are supporting channels which deliver appropriate ROIs, treat our conversion-friendly product displays fairly, and offer a superior consumer experience with the overall goal of building our direct traffic over time. These actions may create modest headwinds for top line growth in future quarters, but we believe are essential to building an effective and sustainable program. This year we have experienced continued pressure on non-advertising operating expenses, and I want to outline some of the areas where we are investing. As our businesses have scaled, we have grown our IT development resources at a faster rate than gross profit growth in order to innovate on the product side. We are working to capture the promise of new technologies and platforms, including investments in machine learning and other areas of artificial intelligence. In addition, we have added resources to support global customer and partner services functions. One of the most promising areas is offering accommodations beyond the traditional hotel. The number of these types of properties Booking.com now supports has grown rapidly over the last 12 months. This type of supply has a lower average number of bookable rooms per property, and the partners often require more services to maintain their listings. In addition, this type of product has a higher level of customer contacts due to its unique nature. As a result, we must add staff in both partner and customer services to support this business as well as add additional IT support. As we further develop this business segment for long-term success, we expect that some of these investments will continue to put pressure on operating margins in coming quarters. And aggressively expanding our vacation rental business is a key part of our growth strategy. As consumers increasingly desire to explore more unique places to stay, including homes and apartments, we want Booking.com to remain to be the leading platform to search and book all types of accommodations. As of September 30, Booking.com had over 816,000 vacation rental properties, which was a 58% year-over-year growth rate. These listings are fully integrated into our marketplace with the same booking path and the same great customer service. The addition of these non-traditional listings produces conversion benefits across our entire marketplace. And we note the investment in our vacation rental business has delivered rapid growth in listings and room night reservations that exceeds our consolidated growth rates. In total, Booking.com had 1.5 million instantly bookable properties on its platform as of September 30, which was a 41% year-over-year growth rate and represented approximately 26.9 million potentially bookable rooms. In closing, I am pleased with our third quarter performance, and we will continue to make the smart investments needed to push the pace of innovation across our brands and maximize the long-term value of our business. I would like to thank our employees around the world for their hard work and dedication, especially during the busy third quarter travel season that recently ended. I will now turn the call over to Dan with a detailed financial review. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Thanks, Glenn. I'll discuss operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the fourth quarter of 2017. All growth rates referenced in my comments are relative to the prior-year comparable period unless otherwise indicated. I highlight that our non-GAAP financial results and forecasts include stock-based compensation and do not reflect a reduction to income tax expense related to available NOLs. The reconciliation between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is detailed in our earnings release. Room nights booked in Q3 grew by 19%. We were pleased to exceed the top end of our guidance range and experience relatively modest sequential deceleration in growth despite a very difficult prior-year comp and taking steps midway through the quarter to improve the efficiency of our performance marketing channels. Rental car day reservations grew by 5% compared to 12% growth in Q2. Average daily rates for accommodations, or ADRs, were down about 1% for Q3 versus prior year on a constant-currency basis for the consolidated group, which was consistent with our forecast. Foreign exchange rates favorably impacted growth rates expressed in U.S. dollars for our Q3 results as compared to prior year. Q3 gross bookings grew by 18%, expressed in U.S. dollars, and grew by about 16% on a constant-currency basis compared to prior year. Gross profit for the quarter for Priceline Group was $4.4 billion and grew by 22% in U.S. dollars and by about 19% on a constant-currency basis compared to prior year. Gross profit includes $33 million from our acquisition of the Momondo Group, which we closed on July 24. Our international operations generated gross profit of approximately $4 billion, which grew by 23% in U.S. dollars and by about 20% on a constant-currency basis compared to prior year. Gross profit for our U.S. operations amounted to $372 million, which grew about 11% compared to the prior year. Advertising and other revenue, which is mainly comprised of non-intercompany revenues for KAYAK and OpenTable, grew by 27% in Q3 compared to the prior year, including revenue from Momondo. GAAP operating income grew by 152% and GAAP operating margins increased by 2,483 bps compared to Q3 last year. Our Q3 2016 GAAP results include a $941 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge. Operating margin performance was better than our forecast due mainly to gross profit growth and performance marketing efficiency that exceeded forecast. We increased our investment in brand advertising by 55% in Q3 to build brand awareness and drive traffic directly to our websites. Adjusted EBITDA for Q3 amounted to $2.19 billion, which exceeded the top end of our guidance range of $2.13 billion and grew by 18% versus prior year. GAAP net income and fully diluted EPS both increased by 240%, with growth impacted by the goodwill impairment charge in Q3 2016. Non-GAAP fully diluted net income per share was $35.22, up 19% versus the prior year, exceeding our guidance for the quarter and FactSet consensus of $34.26. In terms of cash flow, we generated $1.9 billion of cash from operations during third quarter 2017, which is an increase of about 24%. In July, we paid about $556 million of our international cash to close the Momondo acquisition. During the third quarter, we returned $586 million to our stockholders through share buybacks. Since September 30 through Friday, we have spent an additional $166 million to purchase 87,000 shares. Year-to-date free cash flow amounted to almost $3.3 billion, growing by 20% compared to the prior year. About 34% of our gross profit converts to free cash flow, which is a function of attractive profit margins and capital efficiency for our business. Our cash and investments amounted to $18.4 billion at quarter close, with about $2.5 billion of that balance in the U.S. Now for Q4 guidance, our guidance assumes that our growth rates will decelerate mainly due to the size of our business and consistent with long-term trends. Our guidance also reflects an exceptionally difficult prior-year comparable because our 31% room night growth in the fourth quarter last year was the highest we had achieved in several years. Glenn just discussed steps we are taking to optimize the efficiency of our performance advertising spend, which we forecast will have a modestly negative impact on top line growth for the coming quarters. Our Q4 forecast is based upon recent foreign exchange rates, which favorably impact our growth rates expressed in U.S. dollars. We have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our fourth quarter EBITDA net earnings from any further fluctuation in currencies versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter, but the hedges did not protect our gross bookings, gross profit or our operating profit from the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. We are forecasting booked room nights to grow by 8% to 13% and total gross bookings to grow by 9.5% to 14.5% in U.S. dollars and by 5.5% to 10.5% on a constant-currency basis. Our Q4 forecast assumes the constant-currency accommodation ADRs for the consolidated group will be down by about 1% compared to the prior-year period. We forecast Q4 gross profit to grow by 10.5% to 15.5% in U.S. dollars and by 6% to 11% on a constant-currency basis. GAAP operating margins, expressed as operating income as a percentage of gross profit, are expected to be about 340 bps lower than prior year Q4. Q4 adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $870 million and $910 million, which at the midpoint, is up about 2% versus prior year. We forecasted adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of gross profit will be about 350 bps lower than prior year Q4. Our Q4 forecast reflects an assumed improvement in year-over-year performance marketing efficiency. The deleverage assumed in our forecast reflects the investments in brand advertising and non-advertising operating expenses that Glenn just spoke about. The investments in brand advertising and non-advertising operating expenses have a more significant margin impact in Q4 and Q1, which are quarters in which we earn a smaller share of our annual profits due to the normal seasonality of our business. We forecast GAAP EPS between $12.60 to $13.20 per share for Q4, which at the midpoint is down by about 4% versus prior year. Our EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of about 49.7 million shares, which reflects the beneficial impact of common stock repurchases we've made to-date, offset by additional equivalent shares related to our convertible bonds due to the increase in our stock price. Our GAAP EPS guidance assumes a tax rate of 17% compared to the prior-year tax rate of 12%, which was beneficially impacted by non-recurring discrete items. We are forecasting Q4 non-GAAP fully diluted net income per share of approximately $13.40 to $14.00 per share, which at the midpoint is down by about 4% versus prior year. Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated income tax rate of approximately 18%, which is higher than the prior year rate for the same reasons I just discussed for the GAAP tax rate. Our forecast does not assume any significant change in macroeconomic conditions in general or in the travel market in particular. We will now take your questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. And our first question will come from the line of Perry Gold with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed. Perry Gold - MoffettNathanson: Thanks so much for taking the question. Given the lighter results from some of your competitors this quarter and your lighter guide for 4Q, is there any reason to believe there are structural issues with the broader online travel market or that rates of growth will be significantly less attractive over the next three to five years? Thanks so much. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Well, I'll take that, Dan, to start, and please add your own comments. So asking a question about what we think three to five years is a difficult thing to answer. I will say right now I don't see anything in the near horizon that would indicate there's any major structural change to travel or the way we're doing our businesses. Travel is a function of in a broader sense and in terms of global growth, that's the overall business. And then within us, we have the shift from offline to online and all the different ways people are able to travel, whether it be desktop, be it mobile. And now, as people are seeing the whole idea of doing a transaction using social commerce or messenger commerce. So I think in the end, I think this is still such a great opportunity for everybody. We are a single-digit share of this incredibly big and growing business industry. So I don't see anything. Dan, do you see anything? Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: The couple of things I called out in the prepared remarks, Perry, were, in particular, the comp that we had to prior year, where we had really high growth rates and the steps that we're taking in performance marketing to optimize ROIs. So I think that that will be with us for the coming quarters until we lap it. But I wouldn't call it structural. And fundamentally, the travel market feels healthy. You see the results reported by the big hotel chains and our competitors. It feels pretty strong to us. The things that have driven our growth in the past, rapidly adding properties to the platform, that continues. And I'm confident that our teams will continue to execute very effectively in adding properties going forward, continuing to improve the experience for our customers on our platforms, which drives better conversion and loyalty over time, and then also continue to effectively advertise our brands to bring new customers to the franchise going forward. So nothing structural from our perspective. Perry Gold - MoffettNathanson: Thank, Glenn. Thanks, Dan. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one is on the new branded ad campaign and that strategy. Can you just talk about why now is the time to really push so much harder on branded? Are you seeing some limits in your growth potential and your core performance marketing? You're so good at performance. So why push brands so hard right now? And the second one is on Meituan, can you just talk about importance of the Meituan partnership? And how is that different in how you're viewing it versus Ctrip, Agoda and Booking.com and your other Asia verticals? Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Hi, Brian. It's Glenn. So I'll take the branded campaign. So I think you may recall, back in July, at the last earnings call, we talked a bit about why we've increased our direct business for the long run and we set a strategic objective for us. And one way we do this is by increasing brand advertising. That's what we're doing. We continue to look at performance marketing. We judge is that helping or hurting, supporting or hindering the goal of increasing that direct bookings in the long run. So one of the things that we recognize in looking at all the other companies in our space and other industries and such is how important it is to get that one-to-one direct relationship. And that's what brand advertising can really do. So that's why we're pushing there. Regarding, Meituan, China is a large and important market for us. Our Asia-based subsidiary, Agoda, had a commercial relationship with Meituan for some time, and we were asked to participate in the $4 billion financing round. And that was led by Tencent. Tencent is a major backer of Meituan. As you know, it's one of the premier digital companies in the world. And along with Tencent, it was a list of super blue-chip financial investors, some of whom are investors in us in The Priceline Group. So when we were asked to participate in that, we thought that was a good use of our $450 million investment, and it's appropriate use for our shareholders' offshore cash. So we went and did it. I think it's going to be a good investment for our company. Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Mark May with Citi. Please proceed. Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Just wanted to ask you what sort of change relative to your expectations when you first gave Q3 guidance and then maybe a subset of that? I think you referenced that midway through Q3, you made some changes to your performance marketing strategy or mix. Did that end up helping or hurting room night growth and overall bookings in the quarter? Thanks. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Okay, Mark. This is Dan. I'll take that one. So, yeah, we said that as we proceeded through the quarter, we experimented with ways to better optimize our performance marketing spend. And I'd say, relative to our guidance that probably had a modest negative impact on top line growth and had a favorable impact on our performance marketing efficiency and bottom line profitability. That said, we're still pretty pleased with the growth that our teams were able to deliver with the marketing mix that they employed. And so we like the results that we saw in Q3. Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks for taking the question, maybe two, if I can. First, in terms of the rate we're seeing properties be added to your websites, that's always been normally a pretty good leading indicator for where growth is going to go. What's the message to investors about the rate you're seeing properties be added versus some of the decel we're seeing second half of this year? That's number one. And number two, I tried this last quarter but I'll try it again, just because you're talking more about branded. But with the mix to branded versus performance, how do you think longer term about what that might mean for the ROI you get overall on your marketing budget? Is there something where you're pushing in more now because you see the potential for ROI to improve long term? Thanks so much. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: So it's Glenn. One of the things that I made the point in my prepared remarks about \u2013 as we push out more and more of the vacation rental properties, they have a lower number of bookable rooms in each. So as we continue to add more properties, I understand where it can become more difficult to figure out what does that really mean in terms of growth because you don't know how many rooms are being added. I understand that problem. I can't really help you and tell you except you have to recognize that is a trend, and that will probably continue. Regarding the branded versus PPC, I think one of the things very important to recognize is the dynamic nature of how the performance marketing works. So while we can make change in terms of how much money we want to spend and we where we want to spend it, our partners are also making changes all the time, and other people and auctions are making changes. So this is dynamic and interactive, so it's difficult to project long term what's going to happen. Under the current situation, as I mentioned again in my prepared remarks, we're evaluating all the time holistically on what the impact is when we're advertising in performance marketing channels, what is the benefit we're going to get out of it? What's the near term and what do we think we're going to get long term is? Is this a good customer experience that we're getting? Is this something we're getting the appropriate ROI? Do we believe the way our display is being done is the right way, the way it's going to optimize for us for the long run or not? And again, all these factors are always changing. So it's very hard to predict in the future what it's going to be. Dan, do you want to add anything to that? Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: I'd just say that over time, driving customers to come to us directly should have a nice beneficial impact on overall advertising efficiency. We'll reach some point in time where we're in the markets we want to be with brand advertising and we're spending the level of spend we think that's right to get the reach and frequency that we want. And so we should be able to have good leverage in the longer term once we get to that optimal level of spend. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks so much. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC. Please proceed. Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay, thanks. You didn't call out hurricanes at all \u2013 the unusual hurricane season. Does that mean it just was not material to your business? Secondly, in terms of marketing channels, what about social media? How do you consider that? And does that fall under the branded category, any learnings from there? And then, just broadly, when you think about brand advertising campaigns, this is something that I think Priceline as a company has been not just experimenting with, but really has been relying on, it's smaller than performance, but it's been using more and more over the years. Can you just step back and talk about the learnings that you've got from that? And is it that you're seeing something that's giving you the confidence to expand from 12 to 30 markets or whatever those numbers are? So forget about performance. Just focus on brand and what you've seen there that makes you want to spend more in that channel. Thanks a lot. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Hi, Mark. It's Glenn. So hurricanes, I think we really didn't see a material impact on hurricanes that we could determine. Of course, it's very hard to prove the counterfactual. If there had been no storms, what would the numbers have been? I don't know, but we don't see anything that's obvious. Two, regarding the social marketing, that certainly is something that is very, very important for us to get our handle on going forward, because in other parts of the world \u2013 when I say other parts of the world, I mean the non-U.S., particularly Asia, the social marketing is becoming more and more important. And we recognize that it's \u2013 well, nascent. We need to be on top of it, which is why we're making investments so that we can learn and be able to do things there, but it is a relatively small \u2013 very small portion of our advertising right now. But we recognize that in the future, it could become much bigger, particularly, in the Asian markets. And the last thing was about advertising as such, so a couple things on that. One, certainly, we don't want to be giving away the playbook to our competitors on what's going on. But I'll speak generically that, over the last few years, the ability to measure the impact of marketing has increased substantially, particularly as you test things digitally and see is this something that's working or something that's not working, being able to modify quickly and come out with a new spot, is that better or worse. So given that improvement, we are feeling more confident in being able to put money to work in those channels and be more hopeful that we'll be able to know whether or not that money is working quickly or not. It's a very old, old saying, a tribute to Wanamaker about \u2013 I know half my advertising is wasted, but I just don't know which half. Certainly, still, there is no doubt still some truth to that, but we're getting more science than there used to be, so that's hopeful. Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you, Glenn. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed. Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great, thank you, a couple of questions. It seems like both you and Expedia are shifting your ad spend around and maybe room night growth has been below expectations in Q4. Who would you think is getting those incremental room nights in those ad channels? Do you think it's the hotels themselves or any thoughts on that? And the second thing is, clearly you believe the branded spend will drive some bookings or you wouldn't be doing it. When would you expect to start seeing a real positive benefit? Would that be next summer travel season, or could it be earlier in the first half next year? Thank you. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: I can't really comment on Expedia. I'll simply talk about us. And I think Dan mentioned a bunch of the reasons when we look at Q4 versus Q4 last year about what our growth rate is and he gave those factors, and I won't repeat them. In terms of projections beyond this quarter, again, we think that what we're doing is the right thing for the value of the franchise long term, and that's why we're doing it. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed. Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to stick with the marketing and advertising theme. But, Glenn, as you talked about evaluating the holistic impact of performance in both the near and long term, can you just talk about what that means for your own properties, KAYAK and Momondo, and how that may open up opportunities for them? And then secondly, with the push from 12 to 30 markets, clearly you've spent on Booking.com in the U.S. in the past. But just curious if that overall push includes bigger efforts in the U.S. for Booking? Thanks. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: I'll take the second one first because it's an easy one. Again, I don't want to give away to the competitors where we're going to spend and how much we're going to spend, et cetera. So I'm not going to talk about that in any detail. Regarding the first question, repeat it, please. Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Just KAYAK and Momondo strategy there and what perhaps dialing back from some of the other performance channels might mean for how you're doing with KAYAK and Momondo to create opportunities for them? Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: KAYAK and Momondo I think are great franchises right now. Primarily, right now, they're spending a lot of time on the air side. That's where they're really doing a lot more of the focus. They have great technologies that are enabling customers to get great products, a great decision on how to achieve their air tickets going down. And I think that one of the things I think that Steve Hafner runs it, he completely understands the concept of being a partner with the advertiser. It's working with them to do what's best for both sides. So I think that there could be some more opportunities other people aren't wiling to do that. I think that working with your people or paying the money is a great way to help develop a win-win partnership. And I think Steve understands that greatly. Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Two, if I can. First, do you feel like your marketing attribution models regarding brand spend have improved really to a point where you can deploy more brand spend with more measurable return on ad spend than you've been able to historically given both the direct impact and secondary benefit from your search quality scores? Or is it more strategic? And then, I guess, stepping back, sticking with the marketing theme, there was a lot of hope a few years ago that mobile apps would help lower marketing intensity online travel, but it seems like users continue to do a ton of research and visit a lot of websites before booking. And it's very episodic in nature. So do you really feel like TV spend can drive more loyalty and stop users from shopping around? Or is this just kind of the nature of the beast? Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: It's Glenn speaking. So in terms of measurements, we do believe, over the years, measurement capability has increased. We've seen the tools that have been developed, and we've seen the results. And we're not saying any of this is perfect by any measure. And there is debate among how effective are these tools or not, but we think it's better than it used to be, which is one of the things that's giving us more confidence to spend more money in this area, one. Two, we also believe that there is a symbiotic relationship between your spend on brand and your spend on performance. People become more aware of your product. People know who you are. And you do any sort of awareness testing of a brand when people recognize it, they may be more likely to actually book with you even if they clicked on a PPC ad, they'll be more likely to go with us than to go back and check someone else. So we think there is value. And in terms of the mobile, yeah, we \u2013 I'm not one of those who ever thought that because of mobile that there'd be less clicking around, so to speak. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Paul Bieber with Credit Suisse. Please proceed. Paul Bieber - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping you'd provide a quick update on Asia competitive landscape ex-China. I think you spent some time on that on last quarter's call. I was just wondering to what extent that discounting outside China is actually impacting room night growth for Booking.com or Agoda? Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Okay. It's Glenn speaking again. I haven't seen much of a change from the last time we talked about this. There is still discounting. It is still prevalent. It is still a very, very competitive market in Asia, ex-China or in China. It's one of the most competitive markets in the world. And we have to continue to be mindful that if we don't get the best price, we may not get the booking. Paul Bieber - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Deepak Mathivanan with Barclays. Please proceed. Deepak Mathivanan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Two questions for me. So first, can you discuss about the recent trends in the U.S. for Booking.com? Do you think based on some of your analysis of market data, you're seeing accelerated share gains in the U.S. over the last four quarters. And then second one, again, on the brand marketing. Given the difficulty in forecasting near-term trends in how room night gross profit might shape out from the brand marketing campaigns, have you considered contribution from incremental brand spend in the 4Q room night guidance? Thanks. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Deepak, in terms of the U.S. trend over the last several quarters, we're very pleased with the performance of Booking.com in the U.S. We believe booking is growing its share in the U.S., posting very healthy growth rates over the last several quarters. So that's for the U.S. We've seen improving performance for the Priceline.com business, which is a nice plus, too, as that's a U.S.-centric brand. And then, in terms of brand trends, our forecasts are done the way we do it every quarter, which is look at the actual results we've seen thus far in the quarter and trend off of that generally assuming that we'll see some deceleration as we proceed through the remainder of the quarter, given the size of the business and the long-term trends. So we didn't build in anything specific related to the advertising spend that's planned for the quarter. Our experience has been as we've done many years of TV advertising for Priceline and for KAYAK, and we've been active in TV advertising for Booking.com since 2013, it's a slower build \u2013 a slower return on investment typically for that spend. We are doing a better job and improving our capability to measure effectiveness of the advertising, but that doesn't mean it's positive ROI day one. So we think it's going to be the right thing to do for the long term. But in the short term, it's probably going to pressure margins and not deliver the same kind of pop to top line growth the way intent-based advertising would. Deepak Mathivanan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: That's helpful. Thanks a lot. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed. Robert James Coolbrith - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good afternoon. This is Rob on the call for Peter. Just quickly wanted to go back to the performance channel. Just wondering if there were specific recent changes in conversion that you're responding to there in the quarter. Or if this is more of a strategic decision as some of those traffic sources have changed their position in relation to the consumer? And then, finally, is there anything that you could see from those channels that you might make you more constructive on those again in the future? Thank you. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: As Glenn said in the prepared remarks, it's more just \u2013 it's been an ongoing trend for us that we've seen pressure on ROIs, deteriorating margins in our performance marketing spend. And so it was re-evaluating that and looking for ways to start to arrest that trend and even move \u2013 starting in a more positive direction. So I'd say nothing specific. Our conversion continues to generally improve on our websites as our teams experiment to continue to see improve the experience for our users. And so nothing there that really drove it. And I'm sorry, was there a second question? Robert James Coolbrith - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : No, that was it. Thank you. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies. Please proceed. Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC : Glenn, I wanted to know at a high level how you feel about your vacation rental inventory, the breadth and depth there. And then with 1.5 million instant bookable properties, how do you feel about the penetration or how do you think about the penetration of instantly bookable vacation rentals? Thanks. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Hi, Brian. So just to make sure we're on the same page here, you know that 1.5 million, that's our entire inventory. That's everything. It's both our core and our (39:03). So how do I feel about it? I feel that we will continue to invest to make it better and broader. And look, I'm not na\u00efve. I recognize we are not the leader in this space right now. We are the leader overall for accommodations of all types of properties, but there is a competitor who is a little bit bigger and doing a little bit better, I suspect, than we are in this area. And that's why we're going to invest money. Because we believe we have the technology. We believe that we have the people. And we believe that we will be able to create the experience that makes people want to come to our site and be able to get the best accommodation that fits what they need. And I'll give you the perfect example is what I did over the summer, which is I was going to Iceland with my family. I went to our site. I saw that we had some vacation rentals in Iceland, and we had core regular hotel stuff on the same page. It was great for me. But the thing I didn't like is it wasn't enough properties. I wanted more properties \u2013 the vacation rental-type. And I want to have a breadth of different kinds of properties. So that's something that we're spending money on. That's part of the reason that we've got a little bit of pressure on the OpEx. I talked about that and Dan talked about, and that's what we're going to do. Because we think, in the long run, because there's just such an incredible opportunity there that it'd be foolish for us not to put money to work right now to get that advantage. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: And in terms of penetration, Brian, we've made the comment before that we've got a mid-single-digit share of the properties that are available on our website. That's a broad statement of all the properties. But we've been very pleased with our vacation rental business. It's been a fast-growing business for us, growing faster than our consolidated growth rate. So you can assume that the performance there is good and that the penetration opportunity also exists there. Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC : Thanks, guys. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Kevin Kopelman with Cowen. Please proceed. Kevin Kopelman - Cowen and Company, LLC: Hey. Thanks. I think that's me. So I wanted to ask about vocational also. Just given some of the additional costs associated with on-boarding and maintaining vacation rentals, it makes sense to charge a higher commission rate for vacational properties that have fewer bookable rooms. And then, I apologize if it's been asked, but can you give us an update on where vacation rental is approximately as a percentage of room nights and as a percentage of bookable rooms? Thanks. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: So I'll take the first part about that in terms of what should we charge in terms of the service that we're delivering to the hosts or the owners of these properties. And the fact is that that's a market decision. You can go and tell what you want to charge, but if you don't have the right price, you're not going to have a lot of inventory. So that is market-driven. And sometimes, in order to build business, you may even underprice something in order to build a breadth of inventory. This is something that we are going to continue to evaluate as we build out the business. But one of the other things we're investing is technology to be able to make that bringing on properties, holistics, all those elements that are costly, to try and reduce the cost using technology. And then also, as I mentioned about the higher customer contacts that are that type of property, again, technology can help us in that area too. So these are investments we're making now that hopefully down the road will reduce the overall cost per unit and help us get some more of that leveraging versus the deleveraging that we're experiencing right now. And, Dan, regarding the question... Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Regarding the size of the vacation rental business, we haven't disclosed those stats. You can see the growth in the property count. And you can assume that we wouldn't be doing that if that wasn't growing fast for us. We've said that it's growing faster than the consolidated growth rate. So it's an important \u2013 it's a meaningful part of our business, but we aren't going to disclose exactly how big it is today. Kevin Kopelman - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. Thanks, Dan. Thanks, Glenn. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Jed Kelly with Oppenheimer. Please proceed. Jed Kelly - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Great. The year-over-year decrease in merchant commissions seemed to dissipate versus the prior six quarters. Is there anything you can call out that supported the less pronounced decline in merchant commissions? And then, how do you think of as you start to try to bearing more of the single unit, whole-home-type vacation rental inventory and potentially charging a traveler fee? Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Let me take the second one. I'll let Dan talk about the merchant. One of the things I don't want to be doing is talking about what our strategy would be going forward and how we're going to charge and how much of it's going to be charged to the customer, how much is going to be charged to the host, what the different ways to do it is. That's really a competitive thing that we're going to evaluate as we go through our different markets and different types of properties. But without a doubt, it's an important thing to factor in as you try and develop a leading position there. Dan? Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: And when you talk merchant commissions, Jed, I assume that you're just looking merchant gross profit divided by merchant gross booking. Jed Kelly - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Yes. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: That's a function of timing, really. The fundamental take rates are stable, but we've got decelerating top line growth, meaning gross bookings growth have the benefit of checkout still occurring from prior faster-growing quarters, and so that's what you're seeing there. Jed Kelly - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed. Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hey, good afternoon. Maybe a follow-up from an earlier question. I'll ask it a slightly different way, because this is the question we've been getting from investors recently. If OTAs are seeing slower growth and metasearch is seeing slower growth, but as you mentioned, underlying travel trends are solid, where is the booking travel share going? Is it brand-direct bookings like AKA Hotel websites, or is the online travel market growth rate slowing because of more saturation and the transition from offline to online? Thanks. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: It's Glenn. And I'll let Dan fill in his thoughts on this. One thing I think is very important to recognize that while we are a single-digit percentage share of the market, we're a big business now. And as one finds in large numbers, that growth rates naturally slow down or decline. Compared to the overall growth of the travel business, we are still growing a much bigger number than the overall travel growth rates, so we are still growing relatively much faster. So I don't see any picture like where-did-it-go type. That's not even occurring to me. Dan, do you want to take... Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: I agree. There's nothing that was called out in the chain reports for the quarter that would lead me to believe that anything has changed significantly there. And I'm with Glenn, I think the growth that we posted and the growth that we're guiding to is spectacular relative to the fundamental growth of the market. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Yes. Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Justin Patterson with Raymond James. Please proceed. Justin T. Patterson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great, thank you very much. Glenn and Dan, could you help us frame the alternative accommodations investments today versus past supply investments in fragmented categories like B&B? How should we think about the ramp in profitability of that supply base and any exclusivity around that inventory? And then secondarily, on IT investments, how should we think about the benefits of AI and machine learning on your business? I think everyone on this call acknowledges you've done a great job with toughening learning. Is AI/ML more like pumping steroids into that particular muscle, or are there some other benefits in there? Thanks. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: I'll do the IT, and Dan can talk about the alternative accommodation thing. So it's interesting because, in our business, technology really has been the key from the very beginning. And so it's different levels of technology and what new types of IT, what new types of technology are coming into play. So will these new things of artificial intelligence be, A), incredible quantum leap, so to speak, or is it incremental innovation? And it's hard to say right now. But what we do know is that, if you don't try, you won't have it. And if it does become that, let's call it, a quantum leap in the way things are done, then you will completely miss out. And that's the importance of investing it now. And we're seeing some of it. Look, we know some of it \u2013 we're going to get incremental innovation right off the bat. Customer service is one of the first areas where we're applying this right now, because we hope to be able to lower that customer service cost per unit transaction. Right away there's benefit there. And as I think I mentioned, the booking assist product, which is in beta right now, but is enabling a customer to be able to much more efficiently do a self-service-type customer service issue than in the past when you had to use a human being. So I think we're looking for both. At the worst case, we end up with just lower cost per unit. At the top end, we come up with something that is much more effective. And as I point out, we have the scale and the capital and the people to be able to do these type of things, so it may give us a great competitive edge down the road. And, Dan, you want to talk about alternative... Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: The new alternative accommodation business is somewhat less profitable from a partner services perspective. So there are less rooms for property, a lot of properties still to go and gather, and then, typically, requiring a little bit more help in working with our service because they're less sophisticated than the hotel properties that we had initially worked with. From a customer service perspective, too, a little bit more hands-on touch with customers given the unique nature of these properties. That said, the profitability of our vacation rental business is still very impressive, growing fast. We're making investments now, partly in the teams that are facing properties and facing our customers, to make sure we can stay up with the growth. But we're also making significant investments on the IT side. So we're adding teams of people under our booking home umbrella, and they're focused on improving the experience with property owners, including individual property owners that are putting their apartment or home up for rent, to make it a more intuitive experience, easier for them to self-signup and improve efficiency that way. And then, also on the customer service side, improve the experience on the website, there's a number of reasons why people contact our customer service teams asking questions. And as we see what's driving those contacts, looking to improve the amount of information that's available for the customer to serve themselves on the website, answer that question before they ask it. Glenn talked about the use of machine learning. Hopefully, we can bring that to bear also to just automate some of these processes. So I don't know that it will ever be as profitable as our core hotel business from the perspective of partner services or customer service. But I think there is the opportunity to improve the profitability there and to see better trends over time as the business scales. Justin T. Patterson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Got it. Thank you. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: In terms of exclusivity, that's not something we typically strive for. We want to win our partners' loyalty by bringing them demand at a reasonable price rather than some sort of contractual block-out of other demand platforms. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Michael Millman with Millman Research. Please proceed. Michael Millman - Millman Research : Thank you. I want to follow up on a previous question on AI, and that's \u2013 you've talked about in some of your literature where you're able to predict vacations for people based upon their history. To what extent are you actually using that now, employing that? And to what extent do you see that in the future, or maybe sooner than later, offsetting the need for all the marketing that you're doing? And then unrelated, some of the metasearch \u2013 trivago, for example, has talked about the competition that's hurt them. And you've mentioned I think the revenue growth in KAYAK, but can you tell us what you're seeing on the bottom line there? Thank you. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: So, Michael, I'll just talk a little bit about technologies here, not just AI, because I think that it's \u2013 I think it's a better sense to just see technology in general. So using technology, and whether it be AI or any other facet of technology, the idea is to provide a better experience for the customer and for our partners, too, because we're using it both ways. Because, at the end of the day, is to produce a loyal customer who's willing to \u2013 who wants to come back to us because we're giving them the best experience. So using all this technology, if we can come up and provide a search result for them that is more personalized and exactly what they need or, for example, we provide better photos that actually helps them make a decision better, all different facets of the process from the time you first come to our site to the time you're actually at your hotel. We'll do everything possible to make it better. That's what we're driving for. And I'm not going to get into details on which things or what or what we're going to spend the most money on, et cetera. I'll just make the point that scale matters and having some great technologies is something that gives us a competitive advantage. And we feel fairly confident that we'll be able to continue to develop all areas of our business to make it a better experience for the customers and make it easier for people to come to us. And Dan, the... Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Then in metasearch, Michael, we're really pleased with the performance of our KAYAK business. It's growing nicely. It's one of the bigger players out there on meta side. And I'd say, it's \u2013 if you want to talk market share of profits, it's right near the top of the list. So very profitable business, growing. I think run very responsibly by Steve Hafner and his team. And we're excited about the prospects of bringing Momondo and KAYAK together and sharing best practices from brand to brand and having the teams work together to make both brands stronger in the future. Michael Millman - Millman Research : Thank you. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Naved Khan with SunTrust. Please proceed. Naved Khan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yeah, thank you very much. Can you just lay out the landscape for TV advertising outside the U.S.? Is it less crowded, more crowded? How should we perceive it sitting here? And then, I had a quick follow-up on trivago. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: Hi. It's Glenn. Since I'm not telling you which countries we're going to be going to, it's not very helpful to say which countries have more or less competition and how effective they are or not. I will simply say that, as we talked about before, is that we are glad that we have developed tools over the last few years that we think will give us a better measurement. So we'll know whether or not we're making the right decision in terms of how we're investing in those channels. And, Dan, the second part. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc.: You didn't ask the second question about trivago. What's your question? Naved Khan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: So I'm just curious to know what was the impact on your business from the product changes that trivago made? How should we think about that? Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: We don't call out any individual partner advertising platform at all. So I'm not going to speak specifically about trivago. I think what I said earlier is really the way to look at this that we are always looking and evaluating in a holistic way where we're going to spend our marketing money and what's it going to do for us in the near term, what's it going to do for us in the long run. And that's how we make a decision on how much money we're going to spend, what kind of bids we're going to make, where we're going to make bids, where we're not going to make bids. And as I mentioned earlier \u2013 and this is so important. It's a dynamic market, because we have other players in there, other bidders in the space, on top of the advertising platform that's making changes, putting in all different things there. So again, very hard to say the impact of all these different movements. And even more so is trying to predict what the changes will be down the road. Naved Khan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Brad Erickson with Pacific Crest. Please proceed. Brad Erickson - Pacific Crest Securities : Hi, thanks. Just to follow-ups, and a lot of these have been asked already. But I'll try at it one more way. In terms of the pullback in performance marketing spend, just curious if you'd said or meant to imply that this was broadly across most of those channels, or if it was just a pullback on a smaller and more focused group? And then, secondarily, just on that pullback in performance marketing spending from certain channels. Just wanted to get a deeper assessment of what's going on there. You've ruled out overall softer demand that basically leaves kind of use two real possibilities either seems like those channels are driving less productive traffic, so that's the real issue or you're having less \u2013 or you're having issues converting that traffic for whatever reason. I feel like there are suddenly new opportunities to leg up your conversion improvements. Which of those two is kind of the bigger driver of this deliberate pullback that you're talking about in the performance marketing spending? Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: So I'm not going to actually speak specifically again, saying is it broad, is it narrow. Because we don't want to start calling out individual platforms. I think we said earlier about how in the previous earnings call, we made the point how important it is to build our business based on improving the direct relationship. And we believe that it's important to evaluate all of our channels. Is that driving us towards that goal, or is that hurting our goal? And that's the basic where we make those decisions. And that's it. It's nothing more complicated than that. Operator : Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. It is now my pleasure to hand the conference back over to Mr. Glenn Fogel for closing comments or remarks. Sir? Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc.: So I want to thank everyone for participating, and we'll see you for the next call. Bye-bye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference. This does conclude the program, and we may all disconnect. Everybody, have a wonderful day.",

And now I'd like to introduce Booking Holdings' speakers for this afternoon : Glenn Fogel, Daniel Finnegan and David Goulden. Go ahead, gentlemen. Glenn D. Fogel: Thank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings' Fourth Quarter Conference Call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, Dan Finnegan, in what will be his final earnings call before retiring, and David Goulden, our soon-to-start CFO, who I am pleased to welcome today, though his start date is March 1. David has an impressive background in financial and operational management at EMC and more recently as part of the Dell-EMC combined team. I am looking forward to working with David and know he will play an important role in the continued success of our company. David, welcome. David I. Goulden: Thanks, Glenn. I'm very excited to join the Booking Holdings team and I look forward to working with you and Dan and the rest of the leadership team to first dig deep into the business to understand it as well as all of you do, and then to help drive its future success across all of its aspects. Also, I look forward to meeting many of you on the call over the coming weeks and months. Glenn D. Fogel: Thank you, David. I am pleased to report that Booking Holdings performed well in the fourth quarter, with worldwide accommodation reservations of 152 million room nights, which is up 17% year-over-year and exceeded the high end of our guidance range. Consolidated gross bookings were up 19% year-over-year in U.S. dollars or about 14% on a constant-currency basis. Gross profit was up 22% year-over-year in U.S. dollars or about 17% on a constant-currency basis, and adjusted EBITDA increased 23% year-over-year to $1.1 billion. I am particularly pleased with the results of our performance marketing optimization efforts during the quarter. We raised ROIs across our pay channels, improving performance advertising efficiency, whilst still delivering solid growth in bookings. We were also successful in driving growth through our direct channel, which is an important to the long-term health of our business. And I want to specifically send out a thank you to our talented marketing teams, who successfully navigated this difficult-to-predict marketplace, achieving better-than-expected results during the quarter. As we've said in the past, our efforts to drive greater efficiency in this complex and dynamic marketplace will produce strategic and financial benefits, but we still expect to face continuing long-term pressure in this area. Let me now briefly highlight a few points about our 2017 performance. It was a good year for the company. We grew our room nights by 21%, which represents over 116 million incremental room nights booked in the year. Performance in our key regions around the world was strong, and we believe we achieved market share gains in some of our major geographies, such as the United States. Moreover, we combined this top-line growth with EBITDA growth of approximately 18% and non-GAAP EPS growth of 17%, which was strong performance, considering we began to undertake some important investments in the second half of the year. We made good progress on many of our key initiatives for the year. We expanded our marketplace, adding new supply and continued to be one of the world's largest accommodation platforms. Booking.com added over 470,000 properties last year and ended the year with almost 1.6 million properties on its website and mobile app. This supply diversity brings unsurpassed choice and selection for our customers with what we believe to be the best desktop and mobile tools and customer support in the industry. We also made progress growing our alternative accommodation properties to approximately 1.2 million homes, apartments and other unique places to stay on Booking.com's platform, which represents a 53% year-over-year growth rate. Booking.com has changed its property classifications into two categories, the first representing more traditional accommodations, including hotels, motels and resorts; and the second, encompassing alternative accommodations, including homes, apartments and other unique places to stay. We believe this new classification is more consistent with those used by other industry participants and allows for a more direct comparison of our non-hotel supplies. We began to accelerate investments to build an effective payments platform at Booking.com. This initiative, in which we are in the very early stages and expect to continue to invest in throughout 2018, is important as we expand our merchant capabilities and give our property partners and customers more flexibility with respect to payment options. We made investments building a better customer experience across many of our brands. We believe these investments should improve the quality of our customer interaction as we look to support our customers across the entire journey. We plan to continue to develop and use technology, such as AI, to drive efficiencies in this area. While we are still in the early stages, we feel good about the integration of KAYAK and Momondo. The teams are working well together and we are seeing early evidence of the benefits of the combination. We're excited to see what they can achieve in 2018 and beyond. Turning to 2018. I will spend a few minutes commenting on our key strategic priorities for the year, many of which I mentioned on our Q3 earnings call. We expect to continue to aggressively expand our supply of homes, apartments and other unique places to stay. To do this, we are investing in tools to help our supply partners more efficiently onboard their properties and more effectively manage their participation in our marketplace. We know that our customers benefit by seeing the largest breadth of all types of accommodations. And although we believe we are a global leader in the area of homes, apartments and other unique places to stay, we recognize that in some geographies, our abilities in this area are not as well-known as in other geographies, and we are determined to make sure that customers in all geographies are aware of our excellent offers in this area. Providing holistic frictionless travel for our customers remains a long-term goal and we are making investments this year to help us achieve this vision. Providing an integrated ground transportation offering is a part of this holistic travel concept. Rentalcars.com and Booking.com have recently started working together more closely to provide bookings customers with an airport ground transportation offering. We believe this is a first step to bring ground transportation offerings to Booking.com and leverage our scale across our brands to bring great services to our customers. We were experimenting with providing in-destination experiences and currently have tests running in multiple markets. Whether you want to visit a museum or book a tour, Booking.com wants its mobile app to eventually become the center of your entire travel experience. It is extremely early days for us, but we are excited about the long-term potential in this area. Finally, we will look to continue our optimization efforts in our pay channels with the goal of properly balancing ROI discipline and top-line growth. We continuously evaluate each channel and support those that deliver appropriate ROIs, treat our conversion-friendly product displays fairly and offer a superior consumer experience, with the overall goal of building our direct traffic over time. If successful, these optimization efforts should produce benefits over the long run. Also, brand marketing remains an important investment as we seek to not only increase our share of direct traffic, but also enhance our effectiveness in the pay channels. We plan to continue to experiment with the right mix of marketing spend and geographic focus to achieve our long-term goals. In terms of capital return, I am proud of our track record here. We have returned about $6 billion of capital over the last three years, including over $1.8 billion in 2017. We believe this demonstrates our commitment to returning excess capital to our shareholders. Dan will discuss this in more detail, but the recent U.S. tax law change will enable us to access our international cash more efficiently. Our Board of Directors recently approved an incremental $8 billion share repurchase authorization. So we now have a total of $10 billion authorized for share repurchases. We expect to execute repurchases by using a programmic (sic) [programmatic] and opportunistic approach that reflects our increased access to our international cash and future cash flows. Now I want to provide a few quick comments on our recent name change and the rationale for doing so. The Priceline Group has evolved significantly since it was founded in 1997 as priceline.com, with a unique, Name Your Own Price airline ticket service to become today a company with multiple travel brands. Under The Priceline Group name, we became one of the world's leading providers of online travel and related services. Today, our Amsterdam-based Booking.com brand has grown into a business of significant global scale, averaging over 1 million room nights booked per day. Booking.com drives a significant majority of our company's total operating results. We believe this name change better reflects the truly global operation that we have become today, more closely aligns our parent company name with our largest business and connects our collective brands, Booking.com, priceline.com, KAYAK, Agoda, Rentalcars.com and OpenTable under a unified name. Booking Holdings reflects our brand's sheer purpose to book services which further our mission to help people experience the world. Today was the first day that our stock traded under the new ticker symbol, BKNG. Finally, I want to say thank you to our outgoing CFO, Dan Finnegan. It is hard to overstate the role Dan has played in his almost 14-year career here at the company. Since he started with us in 2004, Dan's leadership and guidance had been an important part of the success we have witnessed during his time here. I and everyone associated with Booking Holdings wish him well in his retirement. With that, I will turn it over to you, Dan. Daniel J. Finnegan: Thanks, Glenn. Let me start by welcoming David onboard. I'm happy we have found such a talented person to step into the role and I look forward to us working together to achieve a smooth transition. Now to the quarter. I'll discuss operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the first quarter of 2018. All growth rates referenced in my comments are relative to the prior year comparable period, unless otherwise indicated. Our non-GAAP financial results and forecasts include stock-based compensation and are reconciled to our GAAP results in our earnings release. In early November when we gave guidance for Q4, we talked about a recent change we've made to optimize ROIs in our performance advertising channels. The Booking.com team did a superb job of executing this strategy, delivering performance advertising efficiency and gross bookings growth that exceeded our forecast. The strong gross bookings performance also benefited gross profit for the quarter. The result was top- and bottom-line performance that substantially exceeded our guidance and FactSet analyst expectations. Room nights booked in Q4 grew by 17%, decelerating modestly on a sequential basis, despite a very difficult prior year comp and our ROI optimization strategy. Rental car day reservations grew by 5%, consistent with the Q3 growth rate. Average daily rates for accommodations, or ADRs, were down about 1% for Q4 versus prior year on a constant-currency basis for the consolidated group, which was consistent with our forecast. Foreign exchange rates favorably impacted growth rates expressed in U.S. dollars for our Q4 results as compared to prior year. Q4 gross bookings grew by 19%, expressed in U.S. dollars and grew by about 14% on a constant currency basis. Consolidated gross profit for the fourth quarter was $2.8 billion and grew by 22% in U.S. dollars and by about 17% on a constant currency basis. Gross profit includes $37 million from our acquisition of the Momondo Group, which we closed on July 24, 2017. Our international-based operations generated gross profit of approximately $2.4 billion, which grew by 23% in U.S. dollars and by about 17% on a constant currency basis. Gross profit for our U.S.-based operations amounted to $337 million, which grew about 15% compared to the prior year, including the benefit of a $12 million accrual reversal based upon a favorable hotel occupancy tax litigation ruling. Advertising and other revenue, which is mainly comprised of non-intercompany revenues for KAYAK and OpenTable, grew by 29% in Q4 compared to the prior year, including revenue from Momondo. GAAP operating income grew by 25%, and GAAP operating margins increased by 89 bps compared to Q4 last year. Operating margin performance was substantially better than our forecast due mainly to gross profit growth and performance marketing efficiency that exceeded forecast. Non-advertising OpEx expenses pressured year-over-year margins, but were favorable to forecast due to the phasing of expenses. We increased our investment in brand advertising by 108% or $44 million in Q4 to build brand awareness and drive traffic directly to our websites. Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 amounted to about $1.1 billion, which exceeded the top end of our guidance range of $910 million and grew by 23% versus prior year. GAAP net loss amounted to $555 million or $11.41 per share, including $1.3 billion of provisional net income tax expense related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, comprised of a $1.6 billion deemed repatriation tax on our accumulated international earnings, including state and local taxes and international withholding taxes, partly offset by a $217 million income tax benefit from revaluing our net deferred tax liabilities from 35% to the new statutory rate of 21%. Non-GAAP fully diluted net income per share, which excludes the onetime tax expense impact from the U.S. Tax Act, was $16.86, up 19% versus the prior year, exceeding our guidance for the quarter and FactSet consensus of $14.12. In terms of cash flow, full year 2017 operating cash flow amounted to $4.7 billion and grew by 17%. We returned about $700 million during the fourth quarter and about $1.8 billion for the full year 2017 to our shareholders through share buybacks. Since December 31 through yesterday, we have spent an additional $380 million to purchase about 200,000 shares. We also intend to spend about $700 million in Q1 based upon yesterday's closing stock price to settle the conversion premium on our 1% convertible bonds that mature in March using cash, which beneficially impacts our fully diluted share count going forward. 2017 full year free cash flow amounted to almost $4.4 billion, growing by 18%. About 35% of our full year gross profit converted to free cash flow, which is a function of attractive operating margins and capital efficiency for our business. Our cash and investments amounted to $17.8 billion at year-end. The Tax Act allows us to use this balance and future international cash flows in the U.S. with no additional U.S. federal tax expense due on repatriation beyond the onetime deemed repatriation tax that I just mentioned. This deemed repatriation tax liability that we recorded in Q4, amounting to $1.3 billion, net of about $200 million of U.S. NOLs that we expect to utilize to reduce the tax due, is payable over eight years and does not impact 2017 net cash flow from operations. Before I get to guidance for Q1, I want to discuss a couple of new accounting pronouncements that will impact our financial statements for the first time in Q1 2018. First, pursuant to the new revenue recognition standard, which took effect on January 1, we will now recognize substantially all our revenue at check-in rather than at checkout, as we had in the past. We estimate that the net impact of the change in accounting standard for the full year will be immaterial. However, the impacts on our quarterly revenue are expected to be more significant. A meaningful amount of travel checks in during December and checks out in January, which means that under the New Accounting Standard, this revenue will be recognized each year in Q4 rather than Q1, as it was under the Previous Accounting Standard. We have provided additional information in our earnings release to help you model the quarterly allocation of our 2018 revenue under the new revenue accounting. Also, to help with the transition, our financial statement footnotes in each quarter of 2018 will show what the revenue in 2018 would have been if it were recognized at checkout, as it was in 2017. Gross bookings and other unit metrics, like room night reservations, are not impacted by the new revenue accounting. Another impact of the New Revenue Accounting Standard is that we will no longer report our Name Your Own Price revenue on a gross basis with a corresponding cost of revenue for the amount paid to the travel providers. These amounts will be reported on a net basis in revenue, which is consistent with how we record our other travel revenue. Another accounting change taking effect in Q1 requires that unrealized gains and losses on publicly traded equity investments, like our investment in Ctrip shares, will be recorded in the income statement rather than equity, starting in Q1 2018. We expect to exclude these unrealized gains and losses from our non-GAAP results, because they are unpredictable and are not indicative of the core operating results of our business. The guidance that I am about to provide is based on the new revenue recognition accounting that I just mentioned, which is also the basis upon which our results for Q1 will be reported. This basis is different than the previous revenue accounting basis which we used for 2017 and upon which analyst forecasts were prepared. Year-over-year growth rates are based upon comparison to our Q1 2017 results as reported last year under the Previous Accounting Standard. Revenue growth and margin performance is based upon comparison to prior year's Q1 gross profit due to the change from gross basis to net basis revenue reported in \u2013 reporting in 2018 that I just mentioned. Our guidance reflects our quarter-to-date actual results and assumes that our growth rates will decelerate over the remainder of the quarter, mainly due to the size of our business and consistent with long-term trends. Our guidance also reflects a difficult prior year comp and the impact of our performance marketing optimization efforts. We also expect that Easter falling on April 1 this year will negatively impact Q1 gross bookings and room night growth slightly as we received cancellations leading up to Easter and people start traveling towards the end of March. We estimate that Easter taking place earlier this year will benefit Q1 revenue, operating profit, EBITDA, net income and profit margins and will negatively impact those metrics in Q2, in both cases compared to the prior year. We estimate that earlier Easter will shift about $90 million of revenue on a check-in basis from Q2 into Q1 this year. Under the Previous Revenue Accounting Standard, we estimate that earlier Easter would shift about $30 million of revenue on a checkout basis from Q2 into Q1 this year. Our Q1 forecast is based upon recent foreign exchange rates, which provide a nice tailwind to our growth rates expressed in U.S. dollars. We're forecasting booked room nights to grow by 8% to 12% and total gross bookings to grow by 14.5% to 18.5% in U.S. dollars and by 6% to 10% on a constant-currency basis. Our Q1 forecast assumes that constant-currency accommodation ADRs for the consolidated group will be down by about 1% compared to the prior year period. We forecast Q1 revenue to grow by 17.5% to 21.5% in U.S. dollars and by 9% to 13% on a constant-currency basis compared to gross profit in 2017. GAAP operating income is expected to grow by 6% to 10% and GAAP operating margin is expected to be about 230 bps lower than prior year Q1. Q1 adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $680 million and $705 million, which, at the midpoint, is up about 9% versus prior year. We forecast that adjusted EBITDA margin will be about 235 bps lower than prior year Q1. Our Q1 forecast assumes that our ROI optimization efforts will yield year-over-year performance marketing efficiency. The deleverage assumed in our forecast reflects the investments in brand advertising and non-advertising operating expenses that Glenn just spoke about. These investments have a more significant margin impact in Q1 and Q2, which are quarters in which we typically earn a smaller share of our annual profits due to the normal seasonality of our business. Although we are not giving detailed guidance beyond Q1, we do expect deleverage in non-advertising OpEx and brand advertising throughout 2018, but diminishing in the second half as we lap investments made last year. We assume that operating margins will benefit from increased performance marketing efficiency until we anniversary the optimization efforts that started in Q3 last year. We forecast GAAP EPS between $9.05 to $9.45 per share for Q1, which at the midpoint is up about 2% versus prior year. Our EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of about 49.2 million shares, reflects the beneficial impact of the common stock repurchases we have made to date and settlement of our maturing convertible bonds in cash on March 15. Our GAAP EPS guidance for Q1 assumes a tax rate of 20% compared to the prior year tax rate of 14%, which included nonrecurring discrete items that lowered the rate by about 2 percentage points. The increase in the 2018 forecasted tax rate reflects our best estimate of our tax expense under the U.S. Tax Act, estimated state and local taxes on our international earnings and an increase in the Innovation Box Tax rate in the Netherlands from 5% to 7%. Due to the relatively short amount of time since enactment of the U.S. Tax Act and the complexity involved in evaluating and applying its provisions, our estimates may change as we proceed through the quarter and the year and additional guidance is issued by the Treasury Department, the IRS, state tax authorities and other authorities. We are forecasting Q1 non-GAAP fully diluted net income per share of approximately $10 to $10.40 per share, which at the midpoint is up about 3% versus prior year. Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated income tax rate of approximately 20%, which is higher than the prior year rate for the same reasons I've just discussed for the GAAP tax rate. Our earnings release also includes detailed non-GAAP guidance for Q1 2018 under the Previous Revenue Accounting Standard, which is how our 2017 results were reported and analyst estimates have been prepared. We estimate that revenue and adjusted EBITDA amounts in the guidance I just gave would be about $65 million to $70 million higher if revenue were recognized at checkout as it was prior to adoption of the New Revenue Accounting Standard. In summary, Q1 guidance under the Previous Revenue Accounting Standard for adjusted EBITDA would be $745 million to $770 million and non-GAAP EPS would be $11 to $11.40 per share, which compares to FactSet consensus of $10.35. We have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our first quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any further fluctuation in currencies versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter, but the hedges do not protect our gross bookings, revenue or operating profit from the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Our forecast does not assume any significant change in macroeconomic conditions in general or in the travel market in particular. We will now take your questions. Operator : Thank you.

And now I'd like to introduce Booking Holdings' speakers for this afternoon : Glenn Fogel and David Goulden. Go ahead, gentlemen. Glenn Fogel : Thank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings' 2018 quarter one conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. Booking Holdings' had a solid quarter with revenue up 24% year-over-year in U.S. dollar or about 16% on constant-currency basis, and adjusted EBITDA increased 26% year-over-year to approximately $800 million. Our worldwide accommodation room nights of $197 million, were up 13% year-over-year and exceeded the high-end of our guidance range.  Consolidated gross bookings were up 21% year-over-year in U.S. dollars, or about 12% on a constant currency basis. An important factor contributing to our EBITDA over performance was another strong quarter of efficiencies in our performance marketing channels, as we were able to leverage our spend by over 380 basis points. As we have discussed in the past, our performance marketing channels are complex and dynamic, our goal is to achieve an appropriate balance between acceptable ROIs and growth. As we set out our ROI hurdles, we take into account not only the short-term impacts from our bidding strategies, but also factors such as; the customer experience on the advertising platform, the incrementality of the traffic we receive, the anticipated peak rate from a particular platform and several other important elements. As we discussed last quarter, increasing direct traffic and customer royalty is a key strategic priority for us. To achieve these goals, we strive to have the widest selection, the best prices and availability, the most informative contact, the easiest user interface and the highest level of customer service. We are pleased to report that we continue to see growth in our direct channel and note that our mobile business is an important factor in the growth of our direct business. As we have discussed in previous quarters, we believe that brand marketing will also be an important part of driving direct traffic to our websites over time. We hope to make further progress executing our brand strategy, implementing new measurement technologies and tools and testing in various geographies. But want to reiterate what we have said in the past, that we will proceed in a prudent manner.  During the quarter we made progress adding new supply to our marketplace, maintaining our position as the leading global accommodations platform offering the most choice in over 220 countries and territories worldwide. As of March 31, booking.com our largest brand, had a total of 28.2 million reported listings, consisting of approximately 23.0 million reported listings in hotels, motels and resorts and approximately 5.2 million reported listings in homes, apartments and other unique places to stay. Year-over-year growth in booking.com reported listings for our alternative accommodations category was 28%, which demonstrates our ongoing focus to build additional supply. Today, all of booking.com alternative accommodation listings are fully integrated in our marketplace and are instantly bookable with no customer fee. Room night bookings in this category are growing nicely and we firmly believe our customers want a one-stop shopping experience to find a great place to stay, whether it is a hotel, resort, home or apartment, they want the ability to search and compare across all property types to find the best fit for their unique needs. We remain focused on bringing more alternative accommodation properties on to our platform. Especially single properties, whose owners may not be as aware as professional multi-unit managers are of the strength of our traveler demand. And we believe that this is an attractive opportunity for us. Building sophisticated capabilities in local attractions and in destination experiences remains a long-term goal for the company. As we look to provide a more holistic travel experience for our customers in order to drive loyalty and build a larger direct brand, we have been gradually increasing our investments and expertise in these areas, including our recent acquisition of FareHarbor and are pleased with our progress to-date, though we want to stress that we are still in an early stage. During the first quarter we utilized $1.5 billion in capital to reduce our fully diluted share count, through both share repurchases and the cash settlement of the conversion premium on our convertible bonds, which matured in March. We will continue to prudently deploy capital through a mix of organic growth investments, M&A and stock repurchases. In summary, Booking Holdings had a good start to the year, bottom-line was also the first quarter were aided by solid revenue growth and efficiencies that we realized in our performance marketing channels. We believe that travel market remains healthy and we continue to orient ourselves to the long run, we have a single-digit market share in the very large global accommodations market and an even lower market share in the total travel market. We continue to evolve the company, so that in the long run we will be able to provide our customers with a more complete and superior travel offering. This will take time, but we believe that if we continue to leverage our unique assets and expertise and all of our brands continue to execute we will be successful. As always, I want to thank our more than 24,000 employees worldwide for their hard work and dedication. We are now getting ready for our busy Northern Hemisphere Summer season. And I know we will all work tirelessly to ensure our customers have a great travel experience. Finally, I want to send out a special thank you to Rob Rosenstein the Co-founder and longtime CEO of Agoda our Asia-based business. Effective June 1, Rob is moving up to be the Chairman of Agoda and taking the role of special advisor to the CEO of Booking Holdings. I've known Rob for almost 15 years now and I look forward to working closely with him, as we continue to develop our long-term Asia strategies. Taking Rob, CEO position at Agoda is the current COO of Agoda, John Brown and Armory Morganstern [ph] the current Chief Product Officer will take the COO role there. Congratulations to all of them. I will now turn the call over to David for the financial review. David Goulden : Thank you, Glenn and good afternoon. I'll discuss operating results and cash flows for the first quarter, and then provide guidance for second quarter of 2018. All growth rates are relative to the prior year comparable period unless otherwise indicated. Before we get into the numbers, as we discussed last quarter starting on January 1, 2018 we began reporting under the new revenue recognition accounting standard, which recognizes revenue at check-in rather than at check out.  As a result all year-over-year growth rates referenced in my remarks and Q2 guidance will compare the current year under the new accounting standard to the prior year under the previous accounting standard. Additionally, revenue growth and profit margin performance for Q1 results and Q2 guidance are based upon comparison to prior year gross profit due to the associated change to net revenue reporting in 2018. Gross bookings and other unit metrics like room night reservations are not impacted by the new accounting standard. Our non-GAAP financial results we forecast include stock-based compensation and are reconciled to our GAAP results in our earnings release. So now onto our results for the quarter. Our strategy to optimize performance margin ROI is impacting our top-line growth. It's also driving significant improvements in our operating margins. The result was a second quarter in a row of expanding adjusted EBITDA margins and our bottom-line performance have substantially exceeded our guidance range and the FactSet analyst expectations.  Room nights booked in Q1 grew by 13%, which exceeded the high end of our guidance range. Average daily rates for accommodations or ADRs were down slightly for Q1 versus prior year on a constant currency basis, which was better than our forecast of down about 1%. Foreign exchange rate favorably impacted growth rates expressed in U.S. dollars for our Q1 results. Q1 gross bookings grew by 21% expressed in U.S. dollars and grew by about 12% on a constant currency basis compared to prior year. Consolidated revenue for the first quarter was $2.9 billion and grew by 25% in U.S. dollars and by about 18% on a constant currency basis. Q1 revenues includes $45 billion from the Momondo Group, an acquisition we closed in July of 2017. We also recognized a $27 million benefit to revenue in Q1 from the reversal of a portion of OpenTable loyalty program liability. This benefit relates to recently introduced changes to OpenTable's loyalty program and is excluded from our non-GAAP results as we believe is not indicative of the core operating results of our business. Our non-GAAP revenue grew 24% in U.S. dollars and by about 16% on a constant currency basis. Total revenues for the first quarter of 2018 under the current revenue standard were approximately 2% lower than the first quarter of 2018 would have been if reported under previous revenue standard, which was consistent with our guidance. This 2% difference in the quarter resulted in a 3 percentage point impact on our growth comparing Q1 with a year ago.  Advertising and other revenue, which is mainly comprised of non-intercompany revenues for KAYAK and OpenTable grew by 50% in Q1 compared to prior year, including the revenue from Momondo and the OpenTable loyalty program benefits. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes OpenTable benefits growth in advertising and other revenue was 36% in Q1. GAAP operating income grew by 31% and GAAP operating margins increased by 115 bps compared to Q1 last year. GAAP net income accounted to $607 million or $12.34 per share, which grew by 35%. Our GAAP net income includes a $54.5 million benefit related to an unrealized gain in our equity investments in Ctrip, which is now recorded in the income statement rather than the balance sheet due to an accounting change that took effect in Q1. We excluded this unrealized gain as well as the OpenTable loyalty program benefit from our non-GAAP results. Our GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 19.4% just slightly better than forecast. Adjusted EBITDA for Q1 amounted to $798 million, which exceeded the top end of our guidance of $75 million and grew by 26%. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes previously mentioned Ctrip gain and OpenTable loyalty program benefit. Our adjusted EBITDA margin of 27.5% was substantially better than our forecast mainly due to higher revenue in the quarter and performance marketing efficiency. As expected non-marketing OpEx expenses pressured year-on-year margins as we continue to invest in new markets and new capabilities. Our non-GAAP EPS was $12, up 21% versus the prior comfortably exceeding the guidance for the quarter and FactSet consensus. Non-GAAP net income reflects a non-GAAP tax rate of 19.4% in Q1, which increased from the prior year due to impacts of the U.S. tax acts under higher Innovation Box Tax rate in the Netherlands as well as last year\u2019s rate benefiting from discrete items. Our cash and investments amounted to $16.3 billion at quarter end. In Q1 we generated $640 million of operating cash flow, which grew by 68% compared to the prior year. Our free cash flow for the quarter was $508 million, which is 64% higher than Q1 2017. Cash flow in the quarter benefited from increased merchant transactions of booking.com, which have a favorable working capital impact. We returned about $732 million during the first quarter to our shareholders through share buybacks. In addition we used another $773 million in the quarter for the cash settlements of a conversion premium on our convertible bonds that matured in March. We currently have approximately $10 billion remaining of our share repurchase authorization. We will continue to be both programmatic and opportunistic with regards to our repurchases. And under stable business and market conditions we expect to complete this authorization within a two to three year time period. Our guidance reflects our quarter-to-date actual results and assumes our growth rates will decelerate over remainder of the quarter mainly due to size of our business and consistent with long-term trends. Our guidance also reflects the continued impact of our performance margin optimization efforts. And our approach to guidance has not changed. Our future guidance is based upon current foreign exchange rates, which provide a tailwind to our growth rates expressed in U.S. dollars.  We are forecasting booked room nights to grow by 7% to 11% and total gross bookings to grow by 10% to 14% in U.S. dollars and by 5% to 9% on a constant currency basis. Our Q2 forecast assumes a constant currency accommodation ADRs for the company will be down by approximately 1% compared to prior period. We forecast future revenue to grow by 11.5% to 15.5% U.S. dollars and by 6% to 10% on a constant currency basis. This forecast includes the impact of revenue shifting from Q2 to Q1 due to the timing of Easter and revenue recognition at check-in. Q2 adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $1.085 billion and $1.125 billion, which at the mid-points is up about 13% versus prior year. We forecast that adjusted EBITDA margin will be about in line with prior year Q2. Our Q2 forecast assumes that our ROI optimization efforts will yield year-over-year performance marketing efficiency. We expect the deleverage from our investments in brand marketing and non-marketing operating expenses will offset this leverage from performance marketing in the quarter. As mentioned last quarter, these investments have a more significant margin impact in Q1 and Q2, which in quarters in which we typically earn a smaller share of our annual profits due to normal seasonality of our business. Although, we're not giving guidance beyond Q2, we do expect deleverage in non-marketing OpEx and brand marketing throughout 2018, but diminishing in the second half as we lap investments made last year. We also assume operating margins will benefit from increased performance marketing efficiency until we anniversary the optimization efforts that started in Q3 of last year. We forecast GAAP EPS between $15.50 and $16.15 for Q2, which at the midpoint is up about 10% versus prior year. Our EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of about 48.6 million shares, which reflects the beneficial impact of the common stock repurchases we have made to-date.  Our GAAP EPS guidance for Q2 assumes a tax rate of 21% compared to prior year rate of 17%. Our current year tax rate is higher than last year due to the impacts from the U.S. Tax Act, as well as the increased rates of the Innovation Box Tax in the Netherlands. We\u2019re forecasting Q2 non-GAAP EPS of approximately $16.35 to $17, which at the midpoint is up about 10% versus prior year. Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated income tax rate of approximately 21%, which is higher than prior rate of 18% due to same reasons I just discuss for the GAAP rate. We have hedge contracting place to substantially shield our second quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any further fluctuation in currencies versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter. But the hedges did not reflect our gross bookings, revenue or operating profit from the impacts of foreign currency fluctuations. Our forecast does not assume any significant change in macroeconomic conditions, in general or in the travel market in particular. With that we'll now take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Eric Sheridan of UBS. You line is open. Eric Sheridan : Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two if I can. Last quarter you called out shortening booking window and the potential for some cancellations volatility around Easter in the way you had forecasted room nights. I wanted to understand how that played out as the quarter progressed against what you initially thought going in? And then second, you're projecting a deceleration in room nights in Q2, against what look like an easier comp, wanted to understand a little bit maybe some color around your forecasting there as well and I need to keep in mind? Thanks. Glenn Fogel : Hi, Eric, its Glenn. I'm going to take that second question and then let David talk a little bit about booking windows. So, our company overtime has been very consistent and talking about deceleration, because of a lot of large numbers. And that has been something that has been trending fairly regularly overtime, but there has certainly been volatility quarter-to-quarter. In some quarters we've had small deceleration, and in some quarters we've had faster deceleration and some quarters we even had acceleration. And there were many factors that have gone into that.  Some of the factors are macro things the economy, some of the factors could be a competitive action by someone, some of the factors can be somebody who's not a competitor, but has influence some sort of reorganization and SEO algorithm for search engine. And some of the factors are things that we do, optimizing our performance marketing, clearly one. You take all of these factors and interact and there are feedback looks, it's very complex. And that makes it very hard to project or predict short-term in this volatility. But long-term we can make some absolute in my sense confident enough making some predictions. And the prediction is that we are going to do very well. I have a lot of comp this in the industry and the company and let me tell you why. I\u2019ll start at the macro level, travel is a function of GDP, world GDP gross up travel grow faster and I\u2019m highly confident that world GDP is going to continue to go up in the long run, that\u2019s one.  The second thing a tailwind that we always been experiencing, is the offline to online, now it sounds arcane using offline to online. Let\u2019s call it digital processes, that trend is going to continue. Yes, in some of our developed markets, there are more people who are already online let\u2019s call it, who are doing, but there are so many areas in the world that are not doing that yet, but we\u2019ll be doing it. That\u2019s another thing for us. Let\u2019s go down number three, micro -- let\u2019s get into our company individually. We are a big company, but we are a small share of the travel industry, a small share of our biggest business the accommodation business, a single-digit market share of -- and we\u2019re measuring just the number of available rooms on our platform talking about the inventory we haven\u2019t gotten yet. So that\u2019s a lot of opportunities for us there. And if you think about us this year, the total travel industry and all things air, things like attractions other parcel of the industry that were much smaller we\u2019ve a very small share. When you think about -- well I mentioned that inventory we can go out we can get more inventory, that\u2019s another thing that we are working very hard, we have talked about in the past, that us going out and getting more inventory and you see the numbers that we talked about. We talked about the amount of money we can put into investing in developing our non-hotel accommodations that\u2019s the area of growth for us. We talked about our experimentation with different things, maybe you\u2019ve seen it on the booking.com and we have flight on that. Maybe you\u2019ve seen some of the things we\u2019ve ground transportation, maybe you\u2019ve seen some of the things we are now doing with attractions. Experimentations was costs where we are now it\u2019s going to continue to give us in the future. And a separate part of that is coming up with innovation. There is a new thing out for priceline.com, it is the package product that we have about, it\u2019s new, it\u2019s exciting, things like that are always going to help drive us forward growth wise.  Many companies say what about conversion is that dead, no, we have always talked in the past that we do all of it, and we have a giant experimental platform. And that we\u2019re always trying to come up with a better conversion rate. Now some quarters we do better, some quarters we do worse, but in the long run we\u2019re always going to be building that conversion rate just going to continue to go up. And in fact our mobile in the past continues to be an absolute growth area for us, and I actually just keep going on and just 24,000 very talented people, we have a lot of capital we have technology, I think we are in great position. So when we say you are comparing this what\u2019s happening you are comparing this an easier comp. Last year was a 21% growth rate at which point we hadn\u2019t started our optimization yet. I would say actually where our position is actually very good, it\u2019s a good balance between growth and profit and I like where we are. And now David, you want to take number two there. David Goulden : Yes, let me pick up on a couple of your opening question, maybe I have a point about Q2 as well. So, on the booking window, we did continue to see a modest decline in the booking window, we noted that, we saw it over last few quarters to see a most decline. We think it\u2019s likely impacted by some of the things we are doing around our optimization efforts in the performance marketing channels. Now without going into all the details, we are targeting a less lower converting and less upper funnel outplacements that\u2019s having an impact on the booking window and also I\u2019d point out that mobile continues to perform well and mobile has a shorter booking window than desktop. So those factors are going into the booking window, as we said we see it continuing to modestly decline. In terms of the Easter impact on room night booked. Very much in line with what Dan commented on the last earnings call. It did have a small impact to the room nights booked, very much in line with our comments. It had a much big impact on revenue and if we get a question on that later on, on the call, I\u2019ll explain how Easter impacted revenue.  And then specifically relative to Q2, as Glenn mentioned, we are comparing against the period in which we are spending very heavily into pay channels. But if you think about the actual guidance itself it\u2019s relatively stable guidance, vis-\u00e0-vis what we just reported for Q1. Our approach to guidance hasn\u2019t changed. Also we are now sitting here with more time between now and quarter end than when we guided for the last quarter. So there is natural increased level of potential variability, but I would point out that as in every quarter there is always something going in and in this quarter we are looking at some new factors, in Q2 for example given the timing of the World Cup and group play ending right at the end of the quarter is something in prior years has impacted growth rates. So all of those factored in. Eric Sheridan : Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Lloyd Walmsley of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Lloyd Walmsley : Thanks for taking the question two if I can. It looks like I think Glenn you mentioned mobile as an important factor in driving the direct business. Wondering if you can just give us a sense of if anything in particular has changed there. I think just two quarters ago you had kind of down played I think mobile as a source of direct strength. So is there a synergy with the TV spend you're doing or maybe if something changed in mobile app usage versus mobile web. Any color you could share there. And then just looking at non-advertising OpEx, it actually look like it was ultimately fairly well contained despite some of the investments you're making. So is that really just a function of the size of the P&L being able to absorb that or any changes in kind of magnitude of the investment you have to make in some of these new areas. Any color you could share there would be great. Glenn Fogel : Sure Lloyd, if I said something that was interpret that I did not believe mobile is important for direct or sort of that nature. It was misunderstood or I misspoke one of the other. Because certainly mobile helps direct significantly. And we believe it's a very important part of the strategy going forward. Now why are we noting and why is it important. How much time you spent in -- let's take Asia for example. People are not doing desktop, the mobile is the way you do everything. And then it is so important for us to continue to be developing the right interfaces, the right connectivity for the different systems in all parts of the world where mobile really works efficiently. And I just think that that is something that for us because of the size of our company because of the number of technologist that we have on our staff, we have an advantage, we can do these new experiments in all different areas of the business end up with a better result, a better use for our customers, which in the long run is how we went. Regarding the non-ad OpEx, we talked about this a couple of quarters ago, about how we are taking these non-ad OpEx investments. And it was people and then all the things are associated with people expenses goes with them and we talked about a bunch of things that reasons we wanted to do that why we thought that was important for our strategy long-term. And we ramped up those numbers significantly at the time. Now those people they came onboard throughout the year and they\u2019re now full, we don't need to hire at this higher rate we need these people now to be more efficient more effective and such. So we believe as Dave was pointing out over the year and I certainly see going into 2019 we will get the benefit of those people who are doing all the great work that they're doing, but we should not -- you should not expect us to continue to hire the way we did last year at that kind of rate. Lloyd Walmsley : Got it, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Brian Nowak : Great, thanks for taking my questions. The first one just kind of going back to your comment around direct traffic. I was hoping it kind of growing. I guess the question is direct traffic growing in your mix at this point? And if not, how are you thinking about that throughout the course of the year? And then just sort of going back to the deceleration implied in the guidance. And I appreciate the color about the industry, but maybe just talk about potential for acceleration. What are the factors you are most focused on internally, whether it's regions or buckets of room nights that you think over the course of the next year could lead to faster room night growth even through lot of large numbers. Thanks so much. Glenn Fogel : Well, could you just explain a little more about, you said direct within the mix, I didn't quite understand that question. Brian Nowak : So I guess you mentioned your direct traffic is growing year-on-year. The question is, is it increasing as a percentage of your total room night service paid still growing with the mix. Glenn Fogel : Direct is growing. Direct is growing and we are very pleased with that growth rate and it is something that is part of the overall strategy to continue to increase that. In terms of -- I could come up with a whole bunch of hypothetical so what could increase the growth rate and become an accelerating number versus a decelerating number. And a lot of them would be just making up being speculative. I will say one thing though that is, we\u2019ve seen overtime and that is when we come up with something that\u2019s innovative something that we -- obviously we haven\u2019t thought of it yet, it\u2019s a new things that we\u2019ve done and come out and that has absolutely been helpful in terms of driving more business. So a good example of something like that might be and well we are grow so fast at the time you wouldn\u2019t have seen it in the growth rate, but the fact is when mobile came out, I\u2019ve hear long enough 18 years, I was here when there was no such thing as mobile. But when people started booking on mobile by being out in front and coming up with great ways to use that technology to make it easier for people to book who wanted to use their phones that was an advantage for us. So to be something like that that I believe could come out in the future and we\u2019ll be able to get advantage of it for something I talked about earlier already, about the idea because we do have scale in our technology area, because we\u2019ve scale in all areas of our business actually and that will help us achieve a better result than competitors who may not have the same scale. Brian Nowak : Okay, thanks. Glenn Fogel : Let me give David, I think you\u2019re a technologist at heart so maybe give us something that I talked about. Especially why we would accelerate? David Goulden : I\u2019d just add a couple of points, Glen just on the first point just want to reinforce that not only is the direct increasing as a percentage of a mix it is our largest channel for bookings Brian, so just clear that point. And then I\u2019ll just add one more point, certainly it will start to play into in fact in the second half of the year right now we are from a growth rate comparing periods in which we have -- we are optimizing our ROIs against periods where we weren\u2019t optimizing them quite, so rest of these during the second half of the year the compares with start to get a little bit easier for that factor as well. But as Glen said long-term there are many other factors including all the things you mentioned in terms of headroom available for us to grow this industry with -- this business with single-digit market shares in our core markets and new ways to attract customers, et cetera. So those will be the bigger factors for driving long-term growth rates. Brian Nowak : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mark May of Citi. Your line is open. Mark May : Thank you. Actually one of my questions is a bit of a follow-up to the last comment. Is it possible for you to help quantify to some degree the impact that optimizing some of your direct response marketing has had on the growth? And maybe just help frame that a bit? And then secondly, can you talk a little bit about the relative rate of growth in your North America market and kind of how that\u2019s been trending in recent quarters? Thank you. Glenn Fogel : Hey, Mark. So we\u2019re not going to put a pin on a number in terms of the optimization, but as David pointed out optimization is definitely a hurt on the growth rate and we know that if we want to get more growth we could pay up for it so to speak, but that\u2019s not what our strategy. Our strategy is to achieve a balance and we\u2019re at where we believe is the appropriate balance between profit and growth and that\u2019s really we\u2019re going to play out. In terms of North America we don\u2019t generally start pulling out different regions differently. And so I'm not going to go there I will say that the world economy is good, travel is good in most areas of the world. David I think mentioned we have a couple of small areas that are of interest and is not North America at all.  Argentina and Brazil with some currency and Russia also some currency effects happening there, which make outbound business decline or you recapture some of that in domestic business, but it\u2019s still a negative impact on us generally. So that\u2019s a little bit in terms of a regional area or country area, but generally that\u2019s about as far I go in terms of anything I could call out is an issue. Mark May : Thank you. Operator : Thanks our next question is from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Mark Mahaney : Hey. I just got two European related questions, one just this is a small near-term stuff about the World Cup, just talk about the impact that had in years passed, that is a pretty sizable event and your people over there getting excited by that, they don't travel. So just how do you actually try to handicap that kind of impact that could have on your business? I know that's a near-term issue, but I wanted to ask that. And secondly, also European, I want to ask about GDPR and how do you think about the extent to which that will complicate your business, either in terms of your building to reach out to your current or potential future customers? And just overall, does that impinge on the effectiveness of online marketing channels as -- how much of a challenge for you is GDPR in terms of running the business? Thanks a lot. Glenn Fogel : Hi, Mark. I'll take the second one GDPR and David being English and they actually have a team in World Cup this year I\u2019ll let him handle that one. So GDPR, first before answer that your question, let me just point out how we definitely believe that privacy is a very important thing and we've been thinking about how to maintain privacy for our customers, our partners everyone long before GDPR was even a thought in Brussels. We do not believe, when we talked about this we do not think it's going to be have any real impact on our business in terms of our marketing or getting customers, really we look up and down trying to figure out is there some sort of impact and we really do not see a material impact in it from GDPR. That being said, preparing for it and continuing as we come up to the deadline obviously cause us costs and diversion of resources. Relatively minor compared to the size of our business, but they were actual movement of people who would have been preferring to work on the business making either more combinations or working some of our new innovative things rather than we working on GDPR. But that being said it\u2019s something that we need to do and again we're happy to do it. And I\u2019ll let David talk about World Cup and what his thoughts and maybe give a prediction on he think is going to win. David Goulden : Mark, I would not go as far as that in public. Mark it's interesting because it's difficult to predict because the number of factors come into this. It depends which team is doing well. What we've seen in prior years is that when teams get through to the later round, their countrymen are not booking very heavily while it\u2019s in the World Cup, but once they get knocked out they start booking quit quickly. So, it's a function of who gets through to the later rounds. And as I mentioned, with everything happening starting in middle of June going into early July, I think that it\u2019s the group play rounds that end right at the end of the quarter. So, it's going to be a function which teams are going forward beyond that. So it's very difficult to predict so can't be more specific. But it\u2019s certainly a factor that we are looking out when we're modeling our growth rates and looking at sequential bookings growth and things like that during the quarter. We\u2019ll have to tell you based upon what happens and who winds up again through to the later rounds. Mark Mahaney : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Justin Post of Bank of America. Your line is open. Justin Post : Great, thank you. So just you definitely have tightened your ROI thresholds and I just wondering if you\u2019ve thought about to competitive impact on that? I mean, you've said it affected your growth rate, where do you think those rooms might be going is it going direct or do you think some competitors might be getting it? And then overtime I follow this company for many years, you've always sound great opportunities in new marketing channels that have helped propel your growth and you've actually out competed people overtime. So, I'm just thinking about do you still see those opportunities? Is it going to take new emerging companies that you could take advantage of or changes in Google, but overtime do you still think you can have an advantage in marketing channels? Thank you. Glenn Fogel : So, Justine I agree with your point that, we have done a good job in terms of marketing overtime. And we do believe that we will continue to do well and find new ways to be able to bring in more customers from new types of marketing. Certainly something that we've talked about in the past as our brand market effort as that sort of accounted to raising ROIs on a performance and countering with brand spent to bring people direct. And that\u2019s an area that we're going to continue to work on, work very hard on to try and develop the right formulas, coming up with the right creators, the right measurement tools, putting in the right geographies. So that we can bringing more of those people direct to us. It\u2019s so important to our strategy in the long run that we don't depend as heavily as we have in the past on third-party sources of customers. We believe the right thing for the company in the long run is to create a service that is so good that people when they think about travel, they think about us immediately and come to us directly. Justin Post : Got it. And then the first question, I mean you have currently given up a few rooms, do you think those are going to direct channels, or where do think that those people are going? Any thoughts that on? Glenn Fogel : Thoughts on that. I have some thoughts on it, and what I'm really hoping because I think David may have mentioned this so he can talk a little bit on this too after I'm done. Is the idea that when we are optimizing, and saying which keywords are we thinking aren't good for us in the long run. And thinking well, maybe those people will come to us later in another way, shape or form or maybe they will be booking somewhere, but before they actually show up or cancel there and come back to us and check our prices and our availability and see maybe they will book with us in the end. Anything beyond that would really be just speculation, I don't know David you have anything there, I don\u2019t think there is much else we could say on it. Justin Post : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Kevin Kopelman of Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Kevin Kopelman : Hi, thanks a lot. Could you give us an update on underlying take rate trends that you're seeing. It seem like those might have been a little bit stronger in the quarter even after making all the adjustments. And then on that, can you tell us where you did end up for the estimated Easter impact on revenue both under the new and old accounting standard for Q1? Thanks. Glenn Fogel :  I\u2019ll let David do you want to\u2026 David Goulden : I'll take Easter first Kevin that's those kind of slightly longer answer and then I'll come back to the take rate. So as I mentioned in one of the answers to an earlier questions, from a bookings point of view, Easter timing was a modest headwind in Q1 in line with our expectation. The revenue impact is much greater, but also in line with our expectations. So let me kind of explain what was going on there. So in 2017 of course Easter fell in Q2 and revenue rec was based upon checkouts. So those Easter stays helped Q2 revenue. In 2018, Easter fell on the 1st of April, but very importantly the revenue rec moved to a check-in. So most of those Easter stays mainly helps Q1 revenue. So the impact to that was about 3% year-on-year benefit to Q1 growth and about a 2% hit to year-on-year growth in Q2. And if you think about those 5 points of difference in growth, those account almost the entire difference in our constant currency revenue guide from Q1 to Q2, which really all explained by Easter and defined our 6 points. So that's what's happening with Easter and it's in line with our expectations and what we\u2019ve told you on the last call. In terms of take rates, they have actually been quite stable. And we're pleased with that. So we also mentioned that ADRs were down only very modestly in the quarter and we had it in our guidance predicted them being down 1% again talking constant currency ADR. So that's what's going on there. Kevin Kopelman : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Heath Terry of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Heath Terry : Great, thanks. I was wondering if you could give us a bit of a sense about how I don't know you\u2019ve talked about this in couple of different ways, but just how you're thinking about the trade-off between growth and profitability? To the extent you're optimizing away from lower performing channels are these channels that are actually losing money or simply not getting the ROI target that you have for them? And then second question, as we move further away from the changes in pricing current regulations in Europe. Wondering if you can give us a sense of what you're seeing in terms of hotel behavior is discriminating hence for the meta-search channels and whether or not I guess one, what you're seeing to the extent that you're whether it's having any impact? Glenn Fogel : Hey, it's Glenn. So we talked about this in the past and how we value performance platform for this marketing platform. And how we decide what we're going bid, how much we're going to bid. And we\u2019ve talked about what's the customer experience on that platform, what's the incrementality of the traffic. What's the anticipated repeat rate going to be that channel. And we'll also think about are we supplying funds to someone who may then use those funds to compete with later down the road. These are all factors that come in. So it\u2019s more than just is it a positive ROI, a negative ROI. There is a lot more that goes into how we decide how we are going to bid, where we are going to bid, what level we\u2019re going to go at. We are definitely leaning in and we will continue to lean in with those platforms that we believe are helping us build our business for our long-term strategy and I\u2019ve said this before many, many times. And we lean out against those platforms that are not doing that, those that we believe in the long run are actually going to be detrimental to achieving our long-term strategies. So that\u2019s answer to that question. Regarding parity, I have not seen much impact at all regarding any of the changes in the landscape in that area it really has not to my knowledge from of what I have seen yet had a material impact. We still believe that we are the people who have the best price, the best availability, the best service, the best user interface and people come to us.  Sometimes some -- I know this from looking it, best price doesn\u2019t always -- it\u2019s not always just best price by the way and part of our winning strategy has been doing all those other things too. So there is a lot more to it than just showing up with the best price as a matter to be successful in this business. Heath Terry : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Douglas Anmuth of JP Morgan. Your lines is open. Douglas Anmuth : Thanks for taking the question. Glenn, you talked about wanting to be the place to go for travel and you\u2019ve certainly been talking more about a broader holistic travel approach and more full service. I was hoping you could help us understand how much of your business kind of non-hotel, non-accommodations could be overtime, how you think about that? And what kind of investments are require to get there if you think over the next three to five years? Thanks. Glenn Fogel : Yes, I definitely talked about this a great deal and I do believe it is the proper way for our scope for the long run. And one of the critical things about this is not just making sure that we have an appropriate return on the investments on the -- let\u2019s take for example say, you wanted to do -- we\u2019re doing attractions right now, we believe that\u2019s very beneficial helping our customers, before they show-off, and while they show-off to get those attractions or experiences more of than just the money we would make from those, it\u2019s providing a much easier way for that customer to achieve a great trip. So we could overtime take a lot less money on that he individual action, but because it builds great loyalty be very beneficial and of course it\u2019s going to show-up, David doing his accounting, he's here, he is going to tell me hey this is great, look at what we are doing on our accommodations and we\u2019ll have to then figure out how much we attribute to some of these other services and make sure that we are properly realizing once it\u2019s a good investment or not. So that\u2019s the first part of that answer. I do not have in front of me a five year plan with the absolute numbers and dollars for each of these items. As you know we are an experimental company, we build products out, we see how they work, if they work we do more and we develop it further, if it doesn\u2019t seem to be work we pull back. The right thing though is maintaining the balance and we\u2019ve talked about this and this is how do we use our capital, we use our capital organic growth, and organic growth investments is things like building out these services, there\u2019s also M&A. As I mentioned we went out we bought FareHarbor to help there a new one build a lock and building out this large holistic system. And those are the different way we\u2019re going to do it. I can\u2019t give you some numbers, what I can say I do believe that it is -- it will be when we have done this, a very strong competitive advantage over companies that do not have that. Douglas Anmuth : Okay, thanks Glenn. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Deepak Mathivanan with Barclays Capital. Your line is open. Deepak Mathivanan : Great, thanks for taking the question. Two questions for me. First growth in brand marketing dollar was slower than last couple of quarters, does obviously seasonal aspect of it, but can you talk about your current thinking on brand marketing effectiveness compared to prior expectations? And then the second question one of your competitors is ramping supply acquisition and marketing investments in Europe, do you think that\u2019s driving competitive pressure of maybe preferably on the customer acquisition side in Europe? Thanks a lot. Glenn Fogel : A brand, so we started talking last year about the importance of brand and that we plan to make investments in brand. And we talked about the need for technological measurements to make sure we\u2019re doing it right and we\u2019re going to do it. And one of the things I said several times, I said we do it carefully I use word careful, I use word prudent, I said that we weren\u2019t going to just go out and spend a huge amount of money that we would test our way in and experiment and we\u2019re continuing to do that. And when we find the right formula, when we find out exactly where we think it is doing very well that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to open up to speak it more and spend more. But what we\u2019re not going to do is spend a huge amount of money before we have a higher certainty that what we\u2019re doing is doing well. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to play that way. Your other question about people have been competing with us for a very long time, getting supply this is nothing at all and I do not expect this to change in the long run, people will continue to go out and try and get more supply to all of our competitors will and we\u2019ve been doing pretty well generally against that. We\u2019re always making sure that we\u2019re having good relationship with our property partners, we\u2019re making sure we\u2019re getting great prices and availability, we\u2019re making sure we\u2019re giving value to these partners. I feel pretty good about our position in Europe right now and I don\u2019t really in the checks partners that we\u2019ve had the numbers that we\u2019ve looked at in all things I have not seen anything yet from any competitor in terms of European getting in-roads in there because of any reason. Deepak Mathivanan : Great thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Fitzgerald of Jeffries. Your line is open. Brian Fitzgerald : Thanks, guys. I wanted to ask around non-traditional inventory, how you feel about the depth and breadth of supply there going forward? That\u2019s it, thanks. Glenn Fogel : Well, I was very happy Brian when we did our announcement a few weeks ago about 5 million listings that was something that the team was happy about and we were all happy about it\u2019s $5.2 million now. I also made the note here and I\u2019ve talked about this in the past about that while we do like hiring a lot of listings we do recognize that if we don\u2019t have all the right type of listings and I spoke specifically in my prepared remarks about wanting to get more single home inventory. And I talked in the past about we don\u2019t have it all in the right geography some places we have great breadth and depth, some areas not so much. So there\u2019s a tremendous amount of opportunity in front of us to go out and get more of that. But just getting inventory isn\u2019t enough and we\u2019ve said this I'm just talking about somebody else getting more inventory and how it\u2019s going to affect them well it\u2019s the same thing with us. I talked in the past the importance of not only getting that availability and that connectivity in those properties onto our platform, but just making sure that the customer when they\u2019re thinking about where they\u2019re going is thinking about us for that type of accommodation. The awareness of our non-hotel accommodations in the U.S. is not nearly as high as we would like it to be, we recognize that and I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve seen some of our recent advertisements by booking.com they have one going right now, running right now that is specifically oriented to that type of property, but one thing as we recognized to be successful to be very successful and to be a leader throughout the world is this we need to have the right inventory everywhere. Brian Fitzgerald : Great. Thanks, Glenn. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jason Patterson of Raymond James. Your line is open. Jason Patterson : Great, thank you very much. Shifting back to the high level investment themes and technology changes, AI has been one of your investment areas, it sounds like we had some good success with natural language processing. Could you talk about how that\u2019s being used in the business today? What benefits you\u2019re seeing from that? And how you think that changes the business over the long-term? Thanks. Glenn Fogel : Sure. One of the areas that I guess I'm not sure if you read our shareholder letter that I wrote for the proxy, but we talked a little bit about how we\u2019re using customer service the Chatbot and how we\u2019re very pleased with the result how that\u2019s doing right now. It really is a great thing because customers are happy, because it\u2019s easier, quicker, faster to get their problem solved. We like it because it helps in terms of our expenses obviously all good there. And that\u2019s one example and there are going to be a lot more examples there down the road. But I'm sorry what was your other -- do you have another question? Jason Patterson : No just kind of long-term, where do you see the AI benefit so that piece you just described is cost side, how do you think about that playing into bookings and other areas of the business? Glenn Fogel : Well, obviously personalization is so important and that\u2019s part of that whole holistic system that I\u2019ve talked about probably getting some of you are bred with me talking about it. But it's important so I'm just going to keep repeating it. And then there is the idea a customer with the incredible amount of choice and all the different things that they could do as such. It's helpful to give them guidance. And I always give the analogy of it all time human travel agent who knew everything about you because they knew the things you've done of the past, our new year income, they knew what you liked, what kind of trip you should have, what kind of restaurants you should go to, what kind of attraction you should go, what the experience you should have, how you're going to get from your home to the airport, how you are going to go from the airport to the hotel or the non-hotel depending on what it was and all those great things. That's what AI needs to recreate so that when people come to us we are able to provide them with really is the perfect trip and make their lives easier. I am certain you have done leisure travel and you've been frustrated. And it's frustrating for me too. I still have these issues, but I know that with technology we can cure this stuff and the people who cure those problems first who get rid of that friction who make it easier for everybody those are the number of the people who people are going to come to direct are going to be the winners. And we want to be that person. Jason Patterson : Thanks, Glenn. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Tom While of D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Tom While : Great, thanks for taking my question. Maybe just a follow up on kind of the deceleration that we\u2019ve seen in the growth of the business over the past few quarters and sort of vis-\u00e0-vis your alternative accommodation product. I guess, I'm just trying to understand if there is potential do you think for this product to kind of be large enough overtime to reaccelerate your overall growth rate in any meaningful way maybe through adding pockets of supply like you mentioned in some geographies or more home inventory or maybe just growing consumer awareness of the category. Just trying to understand if this is a big enough product to may be kind a reverse the decel that we've seen recently. Glenn Fogel : Well, could is an interesting world I mean. Yes, it could and it might. One of the interesting issues in that right now. And I'm going to use your question just to refine it a little bit. So clearly we think it's very important right now. And we know our customers want it, we're going on getting that inventory. But we're also making sure that we obey the rules. Not all municipalities want to just let this go will nearly they have all sorts of ideas and how they should be regulated.  And we are fully in favor of working with local municipalities, local organizations to make sure this is done appropriately. Because of its mind if we just let everybody just doing nothing really, you can end up with potential the tragedy the comments issue where it caused the problem for the entire city. And we\u2019ve seen certain cities where people are objecting to that type of tourism because it's making life for the people who live there very, very difficult. On top of that there are some municipalities that believe that this type of activity is doing -- having effects on rental places for the people who live here. And if you saw the recent thing on that all sorts of issue like that. So one of the things we are very much in favor of much of this, but we want to do it legally and recognize very, very happy to see a couple of weeks ago, when the Mayer of Paris came out and was talking about how we are a role model for doing this the right way, so that's good. Second thing interesting, I'm not sure if you saw or heard about or seen about one of the major chain hotels that is out there and is now testing doing home sharing, it's small test, but they're out there doing it too. So it will be interesting overtime we are the blending where you people don't make much of a distinction that is just I need a place to stay and I look. And they come to booking.com and we have all the stuff there. And they see which property is right for that particular trip. So I don't want to think about at the end of the day is it going to be bigger or smaller than traditional or not. I just want everything to get bigger for us. Tom While : Okay, thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn to Mr. Fogel for closing remarks. Glenn Fogel : Thank you. I want to end by saying that I'm very pleased with our first quarter results. We balance attractive growth with profit margin expansion and we will pursue the strategy we've just talked about to give us the highest probability of capitalizing on this very large opportunity that we have in front of us. I look forward to speaking with you all next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude your program. Thank you for your participation in today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

And now I'd like to introduce Booking Holdings speakers for this morning, Glenn Fogel and David Goulden. Go ahead, gentlemen. Glenn Fogel : Good morning, and thank you for joining this morning's call. I want to start by apologizing for rescheduling the call from last evening to this morning. We needed the additional time to complete our checks on room nights and gross bookings.  Now turning to our results for the quarter. I am pleased to report Booking Holdings performed well during the second quarter. Our revenue increased 20% year-over-year in U.S. dollars or about 16% on a constant currency basis. And adjusted EBITDA grew 35% year-over-year to approximately $1.3 billion. Our worldwide 191 million booked room nights was an increase of 12% year-over-year, exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Consolidated gross bookings were up 15% year-over-year in U.S. dollars or about 11% on a constant currency basis. While we are pleased with our financial results, we saw slower-than-expected room night growth towards the end of the quarter, which we believe is due in part to a greater-than-expected impact from the World Cup, in combination with some unusual weather in some of our core European markets which extended into the third quarter. David will provide further details on this in his remarks. Our performance marketing ROI optimization has continued to impact year-over-year growth rates, as has slower growth in some performance marketing channels. We have talked about this in the past about our desire to decrease our historical dependency on performance marketing channels and increase our direct business. At this time, we are pleased with the trends we are seeing in our traffic mix. Our direct channel, which represents approximately 50% of our total booked room nights, is not only one of our fastest-growing channels but also represents a significant source of new users to our platform. These are important metrics we use to evaluate the long-term health of our business, which you can see in our strong bottom line results. A year ago, I talked about the importance of measuring the effectiveness of our paid channels, and we will continually evaluate the efficiency of our performance marketing spend in paid channels. We said we would deploy capital in the channels that offer us attractive ROIs and provide the best user experience for our customers. Our strategy has not changed since then, and we remain open to leaning into channels that make themselves more attractive to us as an advertiser, work with us to improve the customer experience and help us build our brand.  Regarding brand marketing. We have not been able to ramp the spend as quickly as we had hoped in the first half of the year. But we believe we are exercising appropriate prudence regarding new brand campaigns and channels. And we remain confident that over time, we will build a strong brand marketing effort, which, in the long term, will produce a beneficial impact and increase our direct business. Overall, we are executing on our long-term strategies that we outlined at the end of last year, which is to provide a more holistic travel experience for our customers in order to further drive loyalty and build a larger direct brand.  Providing the most accommodation choice with the best customer value and experience is a key piece of this strategy, and I am pleased with our progress in building a leading alternative accommodations platform. As of June 30, Booking.com had a total of approximately 28.8 million reported listings, consisting of approximately 23.3 million reported listings in hotels, motels and resorts; and approximately 5.5 million reported listings in homes, apartments and other unique places to stay. Reported listings for our alternative accommodation category was up 23% year-over-year. And booked alternative accommodation room nights continues to grow faster than our consolidated growth rate, which shows that our focus on providing maximum choice for our customers is delivering results. Providing local experiences, in-stay services and ground transportation are also important components of our holistic travel vision. And we are in the early stages of building a robust local experience product through both organic investment in acquisitions such as FareHarbor, which we announced last quarter. While the volume of attractions and other travel-related services is still very small compared to the size of our accommodation business, we are happy to report that the foundational blocks are being laid. And we believe that in the long term, providing a frictionless booking and payment experience in this area will be a competitive advantage. As we have said in prior calls, the APAC region remains an important growth market for us, and we continue to make investments in this region. Agoda is growing faster than our consolidated growth rate. China remains a focus of ours, and we are building there organically as well as through strategic partnerships. The recently announced DiDi investment and strategic relationship is an example of this strategy. We are pleased about this partnership and potential to help both DiDi's and our customers travel in a more seamless way. Also during the quarter, we announced the acquisition of HotelsCombined, a leading hotel metasearch brand with a strong presence in several APAC markets. HotelsCombined will report into KAYAK and will further help us become the global market meta leader through increased scale, greater geographic breadth in the world's fastest-growing region and expanded hotel and affiliate services. We hope to close this transaction later this year.  In summary, we produced a solid quarter with industry-leading cash flow and margins. We continue to invest in the business for the long term and remain focused on driving quality growth that we believe will make us a stronger and more competitive player in this enormous global travel market opportunity. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden, for the detailed financial review. David Goulden : Thank you, Glenn, and good morning. I'll discuss our operating results and cash flows for the second quarter, and then provide guidance for the third quarter of 2018. All growth rates are relative to the prior year comparable period, unless otherwise indicated. As we discussed last quarter, all year-over-year growth rates referenced in my remarks and Q3 guidance will compare the current year income statement under the new revenue accounting standard to the prior year under the previous accounting standard. Gross bookings and other metrics, like room night reservations, are not impacted by the new revenue accounting standard. Our non-GAAP financial results and forecast includes stock-based compensation and are reconciled to our GAAP results in our earnings release.  Now on to our results for the quarter. In the second quarter, our strategy to optimize performance marketing ROIs drove significant improvement in our operating margins. The result was a third quarter in a row of expanding adjusted EBITDA margins and bottom line performance that substantially exceeded our guidance range and FactSet analyst estimates. Room nights booked in Q2 grew 12%, which beat the high end of our guidance range. Stayed room nights in Q2 grew faster than booked room nights. As I mentioned on the last call, we have factored some impact from the World Cup into our room night guidance for June. I also commented that the actual impact was difficult to predict. We observed that the impact during the World Cup period in late June, but also running into early July, was larger than we had estimated, in part due to many of our larger booking country's national teams making it deep into the tournament. We also believe that unusually warm and dry weather in Northern Europe during the World Cup period had a compounding impact on bookings. Post-World Cup, we've seen a pickup in bookings in Europe, although the unusual warm and dry weather in Northern Europe continues.  Average daily rates for accommodations, or ADRs, were relatively flat for Q2 versus prior year on a constant currency basis, which was better than our forecast of down about 1%. Foreign exchange rates favorably impacted Q2 growth rates in U.S. dollars by about 400 basis points. However, given the strengthening of the U.S. dollar since our last guidance, exchange rates for the quarter were unfavorable by about 100 basis points from that time. Q2 gross bookings grew by 15%, expressed in U.S. dollars, and grew by about 11% on a constant currency basis, coming in about 2 percentage points above the high end of our guidance range. Consolidated revenue for the second quarter was $3.5 billion and grew by 20% in U.S. dollars and by about 16% on a constant currency basis. Future revenue include $40 million from the Momondo Group, an acquisition we closed in July 2017. Revenue for the second quarter of 2018 under the current revenue standard was about the same as it would have been reported under the previous revenue standard. Advertising and other revenue, which is mainly comprised of non-intercompany revenues from KAYAK and OpenTable, grew 34% in Q2 compared to the prior year, including revenue from Momondo.  GAAP operating income grew by 37%, and GAAP operating margins increased by 432 basis points compared to Q2 of last year. GAAP net income amounted to $977 million or $20.13 per share, which grew by 40%. Our GAAP net income includes a $21.8 million benefit related to an unrealized gain on our equity investment in Ctrip, which is now recorded in the income statement rather than the balance sheet due to an accounting change that took effect in Q1. We excluded this unrealized gain from our non-GAAP results. Our GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 19.2%, which was a little better than forecasted. Adjusted EBITDA for Q2 amounted to $1.313 billion and grew by 35%. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes the previously mentioned Ctrip gain. Our adjusted EBITDA margin of 37% was substantially better than our forecast, due mainly to performance marketing efficiency, higher revenue in the quarter and lower-than-expected spending on brand marketing due to the factors that Glenn discussed, plus some timing, primarily in digital channels. As expected, non-marketing OpEx pressured year-over-year margins as we continue to invest in new markets and new capabilities, as Glenn described in his remarks. Our non-GAAP EPS was $20.67, up 36% versus the prior year. Non-GAAP net income reflects a non-GAAP tax charge of 19 point -- tax rate of 19.3% in Q2, which increased from the prior year due to the impacts of the U.S. Tax Act and the higher Innovation Box tax rates in the Netherlands. Our cash and investments amounted to $16.8 billion at quarter-end.  In Q2, we generated $1.6 billion of operating cash flow, which grew by 35% compared to the prior year. Our free cash flow for the quarter was $1.5 billion, which is 35% higher than Q2 of '17. We returned about $1.2 billion during the second quarter to our shareholders through share buybacks. Since the start of the year, we reduced our fully diluted share count by approximately 2%. As of June 30, we had approximately $8.6 billion remaining of our share purchase reauthorization. We continue to be both programmatic and opportunistic with regard to our repurchases and, under stable business and market conditions, expect to complete this authorization within the remainder of the 2 to 3 year time period we talked about last quarter.  Turning to Q3. Our guidance reflects our quarter-to-date actual results and assumes that our growth rates will decelerate over the remainder of the quarter, mainly due to the size of our business and consistent with long-term trends. Our approach to guidance has not changed. Foreign exchange rates are expected to be an approximately 200 basis point headwind to year-over-year growth rates in Q3, which represents an approximately 300 basis points unfavorable change from where FX rates were at the end of April and approximately 200 basis points from the date of our last earnings call. We used a dollar to euro exchange rate of 1.17 when setting our Q3 guidance. We are forecasting booked room nights to grow by 69% and total gross bookings to grow by 3% to 6% in U.S. dollars and by 5% to 8% on a constant currency basis. Our Q3 forecast assumes that constant currency accommodation ADRs for the company will be about flat compared to prior year. We forecast Q3 revenue to grow by 6% to 9% in U.S. dollars and by 8% to 11% on a constant currency basis. Q3 adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $2.3 billion and $2.36 billion, which represents 5% to 8% growth versus prior year. We forecast that adjusted EBITDA margin will be slightly lower than Q3 last year. Our Q3 forecast assumes that our ROI optimization efforts will continue to yield year-on-year performance marketing efficiency. However, we expect the year-over-year improvements to moderate as we begin to lap these optimization efforts, which started in the middle of Q3 last year. We expect the deleverage from our investments in brand marketing and non-marketing OpEx expenses will more than offset the leverage from performance marketing in the quarter. On the last call, we commented that deleverage from non-marketing OpEx and brand marketing will diminish in the second half as we lap investments we made last year. We expect this to continue to be the case for non-marketing OpEx. But due to the phasing of our brand spending, we expect deleverage in the second half of the year.  We forecast GAAP EPS to be between $35.85 and $36.85 for Q3, which represents 4% to 7% growth versus prior year. Our EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of about 48 million shares, which reflects a beneficial impact of our -- the common stock repurchases we made to date. Our GAAP EPS guidance for Q3 assumes a tax rate of approximately 21% compared to the prior tax rate of 17%. Our current year tax rate is higher than last year due to impacts of the U.S. Tax Act as well as the increased rate of Innovation Box Tax in the Netherlands. We're forecasting Q3 non-GAAP EPS of approximately $36.70 to $37.70, which represents 4% to 7% growth versus prior year. Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated income tax rate of approximately 21%, which is higher than the prior year rate of 17%, due to the same reasons I just discussed for the GAAP rates. We have hedged contracts in place to substantially shield our third quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any further fluctuation in currencies versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter, but the hedges do not protect our gross bookings, revenue or operating profit from the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Our forecast does not assume any significant change in macroeconomic conditions in general or in the travel market in particular. With that, we'll now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak : I have two. The first one, on the performance marketing optimization. Just curious, as we think into the back half and into 2019, philosophically, are you still looking for further areas for ROI and performance optimization of business more efficient that we should expect to go into the back half and into next year? And then secondly, on Europe. Just kind of looking for any further color on the growth of your largest business in Europe as you're guiding to a single-digit overall room night growth. How should we think about the potential for European growth rate over the next, call it, 2 years or so, given how large the business is at this point? Glenn Fogel : Brian, it's Glenn. I'll give my comments on this first, then I'm going to give David a chance to give his opinion on all of this. So regarding optimization, and we've talked about this in the past, about our reasoning why we decided to optimize and what we're trying to do in terms of building out a much more powerful and, we think, very important to us brand and direct marketing approach. It's very hard to predict in these very dynamic pay-for-performance markets what's going to happen because there are so many influences that are coming in and particularly what your competitor is going to do. But what I want to point out is what I said in my prepared remarks, and it really comes down to what we said when we first started this almost a year ago. I think almost exactly a year ago, I said this. For those advertising platforms that are willing to work cooperatively with us so that together, we can build better business for both of us to create something that is a great customer experience, something that helps build our brand, something that again is not something that is sort of competitive but is cooperative, we're always willing to lean in and work with them. And we've been doing it with a number of them. Some are more cooperative than others. So in terms of the answer to that, it really depends also on how others are going to act. In regards to Europe, yes, we have a big business in Europe. But -- and it is our biggest geographical area. But I still want to point out, it's still a relatively small part of the overall travel business in Europe. And we have a lot of ramp left both in our core business, which I would consider to be our hotels in urban areas, but then there's even more opportunity in all the other areas, as we talked about building out NHA, which is a very fast site, non-hotel accommodation. It is a very fast-growing area. And then we've talked a bit about the holistic travel service that we want to provide. So I think there's still a lot of opportunity there. We are at different stages of development in all of it. But I do not believe that this is something where we are running out of ramp at all. And I'll turn it over to David. David Goulden : Thanks, Glenn. No, I think I would just reinforce that as we've been looking into the market opportunity, even in our strongest markets, there's a lot of what I'll call white space. And it's an opportunity for us to grow, not only in the new areas, but also in the core hotel areas where we have obviously very strong shares in certain particular types of travel and less strong share in other travel. So we think there's a lot of growth opportunity over and above what the market growth rates are sitting in Europe. And going back to performance marketing optimization, I think Glenn again summarized it very well. These are dynamic marketplaces. Obviously, you saw we had very good results in the Q2 and much beyond what we guided to in terms of optimization, driving a number of the -- a large piece of our overachieve in Q2. I think we recognize that these are important channels. We continue to look for ways to optimize, but they're also growth channels for us as well. So there's always a balance. But as Glenn said, we -- it is a dynamic marketplace. It's a little bit difficult to predict. I think we are in a fairly good position in terms of our optimization right now in terms of the balance between growth and profitability. But there are always areas where we're experimenting constantly in these channels is probably the best way to summarize it. Operator : And our next question comes from Mark May from Citi. Mark May : I know it's probably nitpicking, but just obvious question would be, if it's possible in any way to quantify the incremental impact that you think you had from World Cup that you weren't anticipating as well as some of the poor weather. Also, I think in the past, you said that weather tends to not be a focus as consumers tend to be pretty flexible. But why is that not necessarily the case this time around? And just on a follow-up, what, if any, impact are you seeing with Google's news and changes in the hotel search arena in terms of your share of overall travel traffic from that channel? David Goulden : So Mark, let me take the first one and hand to Glenn for the second one. So pretty helpful to start by explaining what impact we have built into our Q2 guidance for World Cup. And as I mentioned on the last call, the main factors here, including what teams did, so I'll start off by saying we had a little less than 0.5 point built in to our guidance. What we saw was a combinatorial factor. We saw a lot of the teams are big booking countries, many of those are sitting in Northern Europe. Having an unusual weather period during the World Cup, in fact, I was in Holland a lot during that period of time, and you could just see the activity. And we believe the combination of those 2 things had a bigger factor than we expected. Hard to quantify because it's hypothetical, but certainly enough to mention and point out. We did notice that, again, as I said in my remarks, that at the end of the World Cup, because the World Cup obviously impacted the last two weeks in June, impacted the first 2 weeks in July, bear in mind that several larger booker countries made it all the way to the semifinals.  And historically, we have found that when teams are doing well in the World Cup, there is an impact on bookings. You can see it during the game. You can also see it over a period of time as well. So it did roll into July. So we want to comment on that as well. And what we've commented after the end of World Cup, we saw a bounce back in bookings in Europe, but the weather is sufficiently noticeable to comment about it. We're going through a very unusual weather pattern in Europe right now. In the Northern countries, temperatures are in the 30s in terms of Celsius; and in Southern Europe, they're in the 40s, making it less pleasant than usual to want to go sit on a beach when it's 110 degrees. So I think others have commented upon that. We wanted to point it out. The World Cup had a factor in our Q3 guide. The ongoing weather has a bit of a factor as well. And we do see it in -- when we look at the numbers of people traveling from Northern Europe to Southern Europe, we see an impact. So we just wanted to call it out and explain this kind of built in to the way we're thinking about the business this quarter. Glenn Fogel : And regarding Google, I'd want to emphasize a couple of things. One, we have been working with Google for a very, very long time. Symbiotic relationship helps build both of our businesses in the travel vertical, and we're continuing to do that. And we are pleased with where our share is in Google in all their different products right now. And they continue to develop new products, new ways to reach out to their customers to provide their customers with a good experience. And we work with them and provide that travel service to our customers. And it's really worked well for us over the last more than a decade, and I think it's going to continue to work that way. Clearly, in certain parts of the world where travel growth is faster, Google has less of an ability to get customers. I, of course, speak to China right away. I mean, that's an area where, as of today, Google would not be a supplier of customers to us of any great state. So we are going to continue to work with them well. And I have confidence that we're going to have a good relation going forward, and we're always looking forward to the new things they're working on because that can help our business. Operator : And our next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche Bank. Lloyd Walmsley : I have two, if I can. First, just asking a question in another way. Given your view that there's a lot of room left in the core markets and in your newer NHA markets, are you guys happy with the outlook for single-digit room night growth? Or is your base case that you can grow faster than that looking out over the next few years, given the runway left? And then second one, just kind of strategically, as you guys shift the focus beyond hotels, it seems like the different products are still a bit siloed. So I'm just wondering what the strategy is for integrating your experience. Is that effort being led by the Booking.com team? And what kind of product investments do you need to make here? Whether that's building out individual products, building an underlying platform and like, do you see risk at core hotel conversion as you develop this strategy of kind of a more holistic travel product? Just curious if you can share some thoughts there. Glenn Fogel : Sure. So it's Glenn speaking. Referring back to the growth area, you said, are we happy? I will just make the statement that I am never happy no matter how fast we're growing, I always want to do it faster. So let's just lay that down. I'm a competitive person, our teams are competitive, everybody in this organization is competitive, and we always want to win and do more no matter what level we're at. Now your question about, are we kind of in single digit, are we going to be in single digit? Part of our belief is that, and this is one David mentioned a little bit about, is optimization in choosing profit versus growth. And we want to do things in a smart way. And one can always buy more growth, and it depends on what cost. And is that long-term benefit to the franchise or not? Right now, we're at a stage where we're happy where we are and the way we're investing and the way we're getting the bottom line where we are. Clearly, we believe that building out this holistic travel system should provide a much better solution for customers around the world who want to travel. And we expect that competitive benefit to accrue to us. Now you'd make a point, though, on this holistic thing and having these siloed different companies in our organization, are we going to make changes there? Well, I would point out we're already doing that. And we made the thing earlier in the year of noting that our rental cars company, which wasn't more of an independent company, has now been put under the Booking.com umbrella to make sure that the customers are getting the most frictionless, seamless way to use ground transportation services. And it's more than just rental cars, it's all elements of ground transportation that we're building. So that's an example of what we're doing. And we're doing it in other areas, too, and I don't want to get into too much of the details, but we have Agoda and Priceline doing a lot of back-end work together. There's a lot of things happening under the hood to help build out this system. Now you're right to mention the point about what sort of risks does that bring on, and does that -- first, does that do anything that's going to put a risk to the hotel, the core hotel business? We're aware of that potential, and that's why we always want to guard against it and make sure we're doing things in the right way to do it with the right checks so that we don't end up doing anything that could influence the core business in a negative way. So I think we have it under control. I think we're doing it the right way. And I'm pleased where we're and the position of where we're going. Operator : And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets. Mark Mahaney : I'll just ask about the advertising strategy, the kind of the toggle away from performance marketing towards brand advertising. And I think you'd said that you'd -- it sounds like you weren't able to spend as quickly as you wanted in brand advertising, so if you could explain that a little bit more. Is it that the pricing wasn't -- you couldn't find the right channels? The brand pricing, the ROI on that spend wasn't as favorable as you would have liked so you didn't spend that? Just explain a little bit more why the toggle over the brand advertising didn't occur as rapidly as you wanted. And maybe also bigger picture, when you think about this, the goal seems very clear, build up customer loyalty and that it should show up in better margins. But on the -- how are you going to judge yourself how successful this strategy is? Is there a room night goal -- growth goal you're looking for or bookings growth goal? I know you're trying to do both of those, margins and growth, but what's the growth objective you want to get out of switching the advertising over more towards brand advertising? Glenn Fogel : Mark, yes, the brand, and I wanted to call out that we did not spend as fast as we would have liked. And that's a function of something that we said at the very beginning when we talked about going towards a strategy that would be more direct, which would include building out a bigger brand effort. And I made it very clear at the beginning that we would do this in a prudent way. I used the word prudent. I think I've used the word prudent every time since then because that's how we're doing this. Our DNA is one of experimentation, test, see what the data shows us, and then if things are working, do more of it; if things aren't working, change around, figure out well, what should we adjust to and work on that. It's an iterative process. And there are many things that go in. It's what kind of creative do you have, what are the signals you're getting from that, what channels are you using in it? And of these new channels, relatively new, where it's not just brand on TV, it's all sorts of video, and how are your responses on that going? So over all these things, as we go through it, not that different than when we built out our pay-for-performance thing, is experimentation, results, rinse and repeat. And where we are right now, that's what we thought was the appropriate thing. And it makes no sense in my mind to spend excess money if you think you're not going to get a result out of it. So that's that one. In terms of what's the goal, though, I think the best way we can measure this really is at direct. When you see more and more direct business coming, that's showing your brand effort is working. And that's why I wanted to point out that approximately 50% of our bookings are coming direct, and it's growing. And we're getting new users in that channel. So that's what -- that's sort of like what I'm using as a thermometer, see, is the brand working or not. Operator : And our next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Justin Post : A couple of things. First, on the market share, you haven't gained as much this year as in prior years. Has anything really changed in June or July? If we see the industry data that you're looking at, do you think you've held up your market share in the last couple of months? Any big changes there? And then, David, on your guidance, did you guide deceleration off of a slow start in July? Or was that off of kind of the more recent improved trends? And then maybe one housekeeping. Your take rates are much higher this quarter, and I'm assuming that's just because the booking growth slowed a bit in your marketing strategy. Was there any change to the underlying take rates in the hotel business? David Goulden : Justin, thanks. I'll kind of take those in the order which you gave them. So market share, when we look at our share of the total rooms available in our portfolio, which is kind of what we can measure and manage, we see us continuing to gain share on a quarter-by-quarter or on a month-by-month basis, so we're kind of pleased with that number. Some people call that our sell-through rate. But when we look at that, we continue to gain share in what is an expanding portfolio. So we are pleased with that. In terms of the guidance arrangement -- and I want to stress our approach to guidance has not changed. And so that's an important point to take into account. When we gave the guidance, we looked at a number of factors. We did look at what we saw coming out of June and into July, which was obviously impacted by some of the comments I talked about on my earlier remarks. And I also pointed out that the guidance does continue to reflect a deceleration during the rest of the quarter, so potentially some opportunity there. So those are the factors that kind of went into that guidance number. Take rates, nothing particularly -- other than probably the impact of the book-to-stay ratio, you're probably seeing that slightly shortening windows, as we mentioned for the last couple of quarters, just as well as the timing of things in the Q2 quarter. But basically, it's the book-to-stay window, which would probably have the biggest impact upon what you're seeing in take rates. Operator : And our next question comes from Kevin Kopelman from Cowen and Company. Kevin Kopelman : Just a couple of questions. First, so just to clarify on previous comments, so you've seen some negative impact from weather. Can you quantify the impact from the Northern Europe heatwave? Or give us any sort of ballpark to what extent you think that's hurt growth? And then to be totally clear there, you've taken -- because that's kind of ongoing, you've taken that rate and slowed it down from there, so you're not assuming a pick-up on better weather. And then I have one more question. David Goulden : Kevin, so let me pick the -- so yes, to be clear, hard to predict what's going to happen to the weather. I think if anybody knew that, we wouldn't be sitting here. We'd be doing something else. But yes, we've obviously had some impact that we did see in end of July. And we saw impacts of the weather pattern, and we saw impacts of the weather pattern in combination with the second half of the World Cup, and that was factored into our July actuals. So we have, as we normally do, taken an appropriate approach and guided some level of deceleration from that in our Q3 guide. So that's exactly kind of what's -- reiterating what I said in my prepared remarks. And what was your second part of the question? Kevin Kopelman : Okay. Okay, understood on that part. And then just a question on the direct business. You said it accounts for about 50% of nights. And can you give us more information on how you're defining that? So specifically, are you adjusting out direct nights where users have been influenced by clicking on your online advertising in the prior 30-day period? And in addition, are you including SEO? Are you including brand SCM on branded keywords? And are you including mobile app traffic that may have been driven by advertising? Just so we can understand that metric that you disclosed a little bit better. David Goulden : Sure. So the direct is basically, users come through non-paid channels, were not paid. So it will include SEO. It would not include brand searches or a brand PBC search. So to be very clear, we're taking a very narrow but I think appropriate definition of direct. I know others have maybe expanded and gone through a slightly broader view, but we're taking a pure view. Obviously, people have come -- from our advertising, that's all well and good. And a lot of that direct traffic, of course, is coming through a mobile with the app. It is an important piece of it, but specifically, where we've not paid for that user when they make a booking. Operator : And our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth from JPMorgan. Douglas Anmuth : I definitely appreciate the color on the World Cup and European weather. But just given the fact that the comp is certainly notably easier into 3Q, is there anything else that's impacting room nights and the FX-neutral bookings growth in the third quarter? So that's for David. And then, Glenn, just on China, can you talk a little bit more about the investments in DiDi and Meituan and your strategy here and how they tie operationally to your efforts in China? Should we view the value there more in the equity investments, in the stakes or in how they can help actually drive bookings business? David Goulden : Yes, Doug, let me take the first part. I'll clarify -- I think by comp, you're talking about the performance marketing optimization comp. So let me just kind of clarify what's going on there. So as we've said, I'll kind of just walk you through the kind of logic here, so performance marketing optimization has obviously benefited our profitability, but over time, it's cost us some amount of growth. But I think we've also pointed out, we do not believe we lost much share across the performance marketing channels in aggregate. Obviously, our spending reduction reduced in -- resulted in reducing growth in those channels is absolute, but we do not believe we lost much share across them in total. And also, last quarter was only a partial quarter of optimization. So we've not really got a full overlap this time. So we don't expect to see significant uptick in growth in Q3 from lapping any change in share in those channels, a, because it wasn't a big change in share; and b, because it's only a partial compare. Glenn Fogel : And I'll take the -- I'll talk a little bit about the Chinese -- China strategy we have right now. And when we've talked about China, really, it's the locomotive of the growth in worldwide travel industry. In any side you'd look at, you see this huge growth opportunity there. I think I saw a stat that said less than 10% of Chinese citizens have a passport or traveling out of China. So that's a lot of growth potential, and we want to get a good share of that. Now on the flip side of that, though, China is a more difficult place to work for nonlocal players. That's absolutely a truism. So our strategy is to maximize our opportunity, is to both develop our own brand there, develop our own abilities within China and, at the same time, establish partnerships with companies that have great customer bases with people who are using the Internet to do things. So we mentioned DiDi, and you mentioned Meituan. You didn't mention Ctrip, which is also a big partner of ours. And just to spell this out, we have over $2 billion invested in Ctrip. We made an investment in Meituan in the $400 million, $450 million. We made a $500 million investment in DiDi. Now I'll repeat what I said when we made the announcement about DiDi, just to scope that one out a little bit. Really, 3 pillars there. The first thing, and we've talked about, is holistic travel system. And critical to that is ground transportation. And ground transportation in China is even more critical because people who are not Chinese do not rent cars and drive in China. So you got to come up with a way that people, our customers, when they get to China, how are they going to get around? That's an important thing. Doing this deal with DiDi is going to create this seamless, frictionless way that our customers go to one of our apps, the Booking.com app or to the Agoda app, and are able to get that ground transportation that's powered by DiDi. So that's going to be a thing of great advantage for our customers when we get that one up and running. The second part of that, and this is very important too, is help build our brand among the DiDi customer base. And DiDi, as part of this agreement, is going to help us do that through different types of marketing and different types of programs. And the third thing, as you pointed out, is yes, we want to get a good return on our investment, of course. And that's why we're doing it with each of them. Now with Meituan and Ctrip, they both have very, very powerful travel services within their companies. And we share inventory, and we provide them with outbound inventory so they can have their customers get outbound hotels. And we are working with them with inbound. When we have sent people in, they have Chinese hotels that perhaps we don't have or perhaps they would better price. That's the way we're cooperating in all these areas. And we believe that this is the smart way to try and take advantage of what is a great opportunity for us. And I'd say it's not easy, and some of the things are very early. We obviously don't have that DiDi-powered app up and running yet, but it's exciting to see what we can build and what's going to be the future. Operator : And our next question comes from Naved Khan from SunTrust. Naved Khan : Just a couple. So Glenn, can you just maybe give us some more color on this direct traffic? And I think you mentioned that it's becoming the fastest-growing channel for new customer acquisition. Is there any positive impact on this direct traffic from the brand advertising purse that you have been doing for the last, at least, a year? And then I have a follow-up. Glenn Fogel : Well, it's difficult to suss out what the reason is if somebody comes to us direct. We hope that part of it is to spend on brand. Certainly, some of this is because of our great service. People have -- maybe they came first time through a paid click, used the service and loved it, and now they're coming to us direct. The point is that, by developing systems that are much better, it builds loyalty. And we can look at some of the people who are not in the travel business, and you can see some of the benefit they're getting. And I'll point immediately to, say, Amazon. People are not going to search engines to buy stuff off Amazon. They're going directly to Amazon because that service is a better service. So we believe that yes, we have to have brand marketing so people are aware of us, come to us. End of the day, though, you win in the long run by having all those best things, which is we always talk about best price, best availability, greatest selection, easiest of use, best customer service side and go on the litany of reasons you become the winner in the space. Those are the areas we're working out. And then you go on to the next things, the things that we're working on, things why we hired more people, why we have these data scientists, why we're doing all this stuff in machine learning, personalizing the service, making sure it's seamless and frictionless, coming up with a payment way that people -- the same way people in the U.S. are going to use Uber. What a convenient service. We want the travel experience to be like that, easy, frictionless, so it all fades into the background, and people are able to just to accomplish what our mission is, which is to help people experience the world. And your follow-up? Naved Khan : Yes, yes, on just the cloud efforts. Are you doing anything on the cloud? And anything on the AI machine learning front? Glenn Fogel : Well, of course, we're doing a lot of things on AI. We've hired a lot of people. We brought in companies. We bought a company called Evature out of Israel. It's very highly specialized in some natural language processing stuff. And we've done a lot of things to try and make sure that all technologies are being brought in as quickly as possible and utilized. Now I'm not going to get into specifics about cloud. Of course, we do some things at cloud. Some things are on our own data center stuff. And I'll leave it up to our extremely qualified and capable IT people to determine what's the best way to do it, what's the most efficient way to do it, what gives most flexibility and all of those things, but we're not going to call out anything in particular. And David, who actually comes from a technological background, I'm going to let him add to that. David Goulden : Yes, I would characterize our cloud strategy as very much a hybrid cloud, which is a recognition of its value in both private clouds and public clouds and certain applications based upon volumes, capacity, performance, decent troughs, et cetera, are better sitting inside a private cloud and some are in a public cloud. And we're basically looking at that spectrum across a whole range of attribution capability, including things like natural language, machine learning, et cetera. So hybrid is the approach that we're taking, and I think that's the appropriate approach. Operator : And our next question comes from Brian Fitzgerald from Jefferies. Brian Fitzgerald : A couple of quick ones. Maybe as a follow-up to Mark's questions about the brand spending. We appreciate the iterative testing that you're doing, that you seek to deploy this brand spend. Any impacts from GDPR you're seeing there? Post-GDPR, maybe not direct cost to you guys, but kind of an overall malaise or some slowness as the EU digital advertising ecosystem grappled with implementation there? And then, Glenn, how do you feel about your NHA inventory, the breadth and depth there, it sounds like it's growing nicely, and the penetration of -- and certainly bookability there? Glenn Fogel : Brian, so GDPR, and I didn't want to call this out because I don't think it's -- it's a short-term thing. Some of our brand spend was somewhat delayed a little bit, so don't put too much into this. But some of our platforms did have to halt in some of the work they were doing so they could develop more resources to making sure that they were ready for GDPR. So some of the things we were doing to gather, particularly in the testing and experimental things, had to be pushed off. But again, that's a short-term timing issue. And we're talking -- we play for the long run. So I'm not going to worry about, so it took a month or 2 months, whatever it was, that's not a big point. In terms of the NHA, 5.5 million listings. And am I happy? And I think I'll just stay consistent and say, I'm never happy. I always want more. We want more. But in specifics, and we talked about this before, we need to continue to develop certain categories in the NHA, where I really feel -- I'm even less happy in those areas. And we talked about the single-property owners. The people have, let's just, for example, say a house on the Outer Banks or they have a condo at Vale, and then expand that worldwide, and that's the area where I feel that we really need to make more effort in getting that, a. But then on top of that, it's a two-sided marketplace. We not only have to have the supply, we also have to make sure that customers around the world are aware that we have this great service. We think we do have a great service, and I've talked about this. The fact that when our customers come, they can see both the NHA stuff and they can see the core hotel stuff, and it's easier to compare and contrast them. We've talked about how the ease that people can pay because for us, you're not putting -- the customer doesn't have to pay a customer fee. For us, it's simple. It's never the customer fee at the end when you see, oh, here's a big charge at the end from the customer fee. And we talk about all the different things we can do to make this holistic, so it's not just the accommodation. That's what we're driving to. But specifically about NHA, there's a lot of inventory that we need to go out and get in. And then we need to -- particularly in the U.S. because when I talk to U.S. people, I know they're not as aware that we have this great product. If you go to Europe, it'd be a different story where people are aware of it. And this is what we're working on. Operator : Our next question comes from Heath Terry from Goldman Sachs. Heath Terry : Just had a few I wanted to get a sense on. Glenn, I know we've spent a lot of time talking about brand marketing. But if we look at the first half, brand is still only about 1/10 of what you're spending on, on customer acquisition. Where do you see that settling out? With this emphasis, does that become half? Does it become the majority over time? What's the goal that you and your teams have for that? And then competitively, I'm kind of curious how you think about the benefit to your competitors as you pull back on marketing spend like this. I think it's notable that Expedia was able to maintain their growth rate and expand margins for the first time in several quarters as you and others in the space were pulling back on marketing. How do you think about what that does to sort of the long-term competitive balance in the space? And then, David, you mentioned that your approach to guidance hasn't changed. In the past, you guys have averaged about 300 basis points, above the high end of your guidance on bookings. Was that line specifically to suggest that what we've seen these last few quarters relative to your guidance is less of an indicator of how we should think about Q3? Glenn Fogel : On the brand question, clearly, it's a very difficult thing to try and come up with a long-term target. But it's not just because -- as we always say, it's very difficult to make predictions, especially about the future. Beyond that, much more important is the whole area of brand is changing so rapidly with new channels coming in, new ways to measure. So let's take, for example, let's take something like YouTube, for example, where, a few years ago, advertising at YouTube was not effective at all, and it was a smaller number, and now it's growing very rapidly. When I say growing, I'm not speaking for the travel business, I'm saying YouTube advertising in general. It's not -- anyway, one can measure the effectiveness. And then take that all different types of things, particularly in the social area. The fact is that it's hard to say it because the world is changing so rapidly, particularly in how one does brand advertising. I will just repeat what we've always said is, look, we're going to do it the way we do everything. We experiment, we test, and if it ends up being more and more effective, we're going to do a lot more of it. And I do believe in the long run that we are going to be able to use brand advertising to build out a larger direct business. But I'm not going to pin myself to -- and this is what the percent of our spend is going to be in year four. And what was your second one, by the way? David Goulden : The competitive point, how -- Expedia and others. Glenn Fogel : Oh, yes. So what's interesting, of course, when the advertisers go to optimize, and there's less revenue now going to a particular or several advertising platforms, they then have less money to go out and try and get customers. So their growth then slows. So if their growth slows, even though all the advertisers may be in the same share and doing the same amount of share, they may not have the growth rate they had before because the core platform is not growing as rapidly as it used to do. So I think when we look back and we see the amount of spend being done by some of the advertising platforms in the past of very, very heavy weeks, that probably brought forward some people who may not have been as familiar with how to get travel online. And now perhaps those people who came on and now because they're slowing in terms of the amount of spend in that type of brand to bring customers to these advertising platforms, maybe that is an influence on the overall flow or amount of growth in that area. That would be the way I'd say it. David Goulden : And then, Heath, to pick up your third point, I was going to say I'll avoid getting into the specific quantification. But what I'll just say is that the way the company has approached guidance over the last several years and quarters, I think is one that's been beneficial and appropriate. And we haven't changed that as I've come in and worked with the team, and we continue to factor in the same issues when we look at our guidance. And obviously, we leave ourselves some potential to do better. Operator : Our next question comes from Deepak Mathivanan from Barclays. Deepak Mathivanan : Two questions. First, with the HotelsCombined acquisition and then Momondo previously, should we view these acquisitions as a strategy to sort of build out a portfolio of diverse smaller metasearch channels? Are there opportunities to continue this strategy? And then more broadly on performance, you know that you're willing to reinvest on certain performance channels, depending on the levels of branding that you get on them. Is it kind of safe to say that prices and ROIs on these channels are something that you're comfortable now at these levels? Glenn Fogel : I'll take one, and I'll let David take two on that. So we are pleased with the HotelsCombined deal. It hasn't closed yet. We expect it to close before the end of the year. And we did do Momondo, and that is -- and so you are correct, we have built out -- brought in some smaller players. And we believe the strategy is, one, scale matters in these areas. We bring in these meta companies that have a customer base, and perhaps they're doing certain things that we don't do as well or whatever. And we can then optimize in terms of the amount of people we need to run the entire organization. There's some synergies to be gotten. And so if we see more and they are at the right price because we're always conscious that you've got to get value for it, what can you achieve with it, we would always be interested in doing it. But I think we are reaching a level now where we are certainly bigger than we were before we got Momondo and when we bring in HotelsCombined, hopefully. And by the way, this strategy started a long time ago before we bought KAYAK, when KAYAK went out and got sidestepped. And that, I think, was the initial thing. Steve Hafner, our CEO there, is still with us, and he did that deal back then. I think his vision hasn't changed. David Goulden : Yes. And then on the -- our performance channels. First of all, they're very important channels for us and also our customers. So we view them as a strategic part of the business. And as Glenn commented, our strategy in those channels hasn't changed. And we'll actually lean into the channels that make themselves more attractive to us as an advertiser. It will help us to build our customer experience and build our brand. And that's been a great relationship, and we expect it to continue. In terms of where we are versus a year ago, I'd say we are pleased with what we're now seeing in terms of ROIs on those channels. And as I mentioned, a decent balance between growth and profitability in terms of what we're getting from those channels. As Glenn said, we're never pleased, we're never satisfied. There's always opportunity to continue to improve. And I think we're at a place where we're now looking for incremental improvements and certainly looking at ROI and growth in those channels, those 2 things we're looking at very closely. So I'm pleased but not satisfied will summarize where we are today. Operator : And our final question comes from Brad Erickson from Pacific Crest. Brad Erickson : Just a couple of follow-ups. Can you talk about hotel inventory, just geographically where you're really focused on adding supply this year, if anywhere? And does that give you incremental opportunities to maybe spend on performance marketing later in the year as you get bigger in certain markets? And then second, just what does your direct booking retention rate look like today versus, say, I don't know, 2, 3 years ago? Glenn Fogel : So in terms of inventory, we don't spell out where we are trying to get more inventory. It was very nice some of our competitors in the past have done that, which have been great for us in terms of the road map where should we be looking at things. And I don't want to do the same thing for -- going the other way on this. I will say that our -- people are always out there trying to get more inventory because we do believe that's a great way to help build the business, and they are out there doing it. And we did point out the importance -- already, we've talked a little bit about how important it is to try and get certain parts of the non-hotel accommodation built up because we do think that is an area where we do need to continue to improve in that area. And I'll let David talk about the second one there. David Goulden : Yes. I think in terms of retention rates, we're not going to give you a specific data point, but I'd say that we're certainly pleased with our Genius customer group in terms of how well that has developed and the level of retention in repeat booking we get out of those customers, which has continued to be a focus on the business. So we've seen not only is direct increasing and becoming now very close to half the business, but we do see, obviously, a much stronger retention rate, particularly in those customers who are part of our different closed-use programs. So that is a good trend for us, not only in terms of the growth as the mix of the business shifts towards more direct, but also, as Glenn said, building out this loyalty factor where we want people to be coming back to us as their preferred travel partner with a whole broad range of capabilities and travel experiences. Glenn Fogel : Okay. So I want to thank everybody again. I want to just reemphasize a couple of points. One is that we believe we're on the right track. We believe we are building the business the way we want to. We believe we have the right mix in terms of profit and growth right now. And we are pleased with our level and where we are at this stage of progress. I also want to thank all our employees around the world who have worked so hard. This is a very, very busy season for them right now, and I just want to reach out to them, and we appreciate greatly the amount of effort they are putting in there. And of course, we always want to thank our supplier partners and our customers who, without them, there'd be no reason for us to be here. So thank you, and see you in three months. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

And now I'd like to introduce Booking Holdings speakers for this afternoon, Glenn Fogel and David Goulden. Please go ahead, gentlemen. Glenn Fogel : Thank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings' third quarter conference call. I am joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. We had solid execution in our busiest quarter of the year and passed a new milestone of 200 million room nights booked in a single quarter, reporting 201 million worldwide room nights booked. This is up 13% year-over-year and exceeded the high end of our guidance range. Consolidated gross bookings were up 12% year-over-year in U.S. dollars or about 14% on a constant currency basis. Our revenue increased 11% year-over-year in U.S. dollars or about 13% on a constant currency basis, and adjusted EBITDA grew 8% in U.S. dollars with a similar currency impact on the year-over-year growth rate. Our strong room night growth rate was helped by our later-than-normal summer booking system. In addition, we have higher growth coming from our performance marketing channels, which benefited in part from our lapping the start of last year's optimization efforts. Our guidance for Q4 room night growth of 12% reflects our expectation that we will have more stability in our top line growth rate and reflects the continuation of our marketing spend. And we note that we continue to grow significantly faster than the overall global accommodations market. I am pleased with this strategic approach we have taken with our paid channels this year. Going forward, we expect these markets will remain very dynamic, which is why we'll continue to employ our data-driven approach to achieve the right balance of growth and acceptable ROIs. We will look to spend in the paid channels when we see opportunities to acquire high-quality traffic at attractive ROIs. And as I said before and want to emphasize, we work closely with those advertising partners that help us build our brand and maintain our competitive strengths while working in a manner that is best for our customers. Conversely, we will reduce our participation with those who do not work in a way that we believe best serves our customers. As you can see in our results, we're beginning to ramp up our brand advertising. As we've discussed in the past, we expect to increase our brand advertising efforts to further our goal of bringing more customers directly to our platforms and to increase product awareness, particularly in our home segment. We are increasing our spend in digital channels as they provide efficient reach and allow us to better measure the effectiveness of our spend. This is part of our long-term strategy. And though we expect to increase our investment in this area, we are mindful to spend as efficiently as possible, letting results and data help direct the pace of the investment. We have progressed in many of the investment areas that we have discussed over the current year. In particular, we've expanded our product breadth and customer experience in the areas of alternative accommodations and experiences. We continue to build supply in alternative accommodations. And as of September 30, Booking.com had over 5.7 million reported listings in homes, apartments and other unique places to stay, which is an increase of 21% year-over-year. Booking.com's total reported listings were about 29 million of September 30. Our room night growth in alternative accommodation remains robust and is higher than our consolidated growth rate. We're also pleased to see that the number of customers whose first-ever booking with us through our home product is growing nicely. We have developed new services specifically for our booking home host. These services include streamlined property onboarding, enhanced guest management tools and property profiling capabilities, which allows host to highlight their property's unique aspects. We believe we are building a leading platform to search and discover truly unique accommodations in the same frictionless path that our customers have come to expect from us. And we continue to believe that the best customer benefit comes from offering both hotel and home accommodations on one unified platform. We recognize that building a great home platform is only part of the challenge to building a great home business. And customer awareness of our capabilities, particularly in certain geographies like the United States, is low and will require a higher marketing investment in the coming quarters. However, we believe we are on the right path and, in the long run, will achieve a leading global home business. In the area of experiences, we are building out our product capabilities, creating a seamless integrated way to offer more choices for our accommodations customers. This quarter, Booking.com made progress integrating FareHarbor's products, giving Booking.com access to new local attractions in the U.S. and the ability to leverage FareHarbor's technology to help even more tours and attractions around the world come online. Booking.com's experiences product is scaling well, and we now offer experiences in approximately 70 cities worldwide. In addition, we are making progress with experience in other areas such as offering at-hotel services and restaurant booking options that we note these are nascent efforts. As mobile becomes an increasingly integral part of the travel ecosystem, we continue to invest in our mobile platform, so we can offer all of our products, accommodations, ground transport and experiences, whenever and wherever our customers may be. We are happy with our progress in this area as today, over 50% of our accommodation booking transactions come from mobile devices. We continue to seek ways to promote cross-brand initiatives that allow us to share best practices throughout our company and get further benefits from our multi-brand platform. Priceline and Agoda are now working more closely together in certain overlap market such as the U.S., and we are seeing some efficiencies there. With greater technical and managerial cooperation between KAYAK and OpenTable, we're excited about the pace of innovation happening at both companies. OpenTable has been growing nicely, and we are confident about its large opportunity. We believe through tighter interaction with our other brands in the future, OpenTable will provide benefits to all of our customers and create additional value to our entire enterprise. The number of restaurants on the OpenTable platform has grown by 55% since its acquisition in 2014. And over the prior 12 months, OpenTable has seated over 330 million diners via its online reservation system, which is 69% higher than during 2014. OpenTable is now increasing its development velocity, and we look forward to some exciting improvements in the platform in the quarters to come. Finally, I would like to note our $200 million investment in Grab, the leading on-demand transportation and mobile services platform in Southeast Asia, that we announced last week. This investment and strategic partnership is consistent with our long- term strategy : to create the optimal worldwide travel platform, which will make all aspects of travel easier for our customers by having an integrated seamless way to experience the world at the lowest friction possible. I have mentioned this long-term strategy before and will always be a work in progress as technology changes and advances. But I am pleased to see the initial foundations being laid out. In sum, I am very pleased with our execution in the third quarter. The pace of innovation remains robust, and I am confident in the long-term growth prospects of the company. I want to thank our approximately 24,000 employees for their hard work and dedication during this busy quarter, providing unparalleled service to both our customers and property partners around the world. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden, for the detailed financial review. David Goulden : Thank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I'll discuss our operating results and cash flows for the third quarter and then provide guidance for the fourth quarter of 2018. All growth rates are relative to the prior year comparable period, unless otherwise indicated. As we discussed last quarter, all year-over-year growth rates referenced in my remarks in Q4 guidance will compare the current year income statement under the new revenue accounting standard to the prior year under the previous accounting standard. Gross bookings and other metrics like room night reservations are not impacted by the new revenue accounting standard. Our non-GAAP financial results and forecast include stock-based compensation and are reconciled to our GAAP results in our earnings release. Now on to our results for the quarter. We are pleased with our booked room night growth of 13% in Q3, which is well ahead of the high end of our guidance range and accelerated from Q2. When we provided our guidance for the third quarter in early August, we were in a period of relatively high uncertainty given the impact that the World Cup and an unusual weather pattern in Europe we're having on the summer travel season. Following our earnings call, we saw an acceleration in our room night growth rate that continued through the end of the quarter driven by the late summer travel peak and improved results from some of our performance marketing channels. We continue to show progress in growing bookings through our direct channel, which remains our largest single source of new customers. The direct channel continues to represent about half of our booked room nights and continued to grow faster than the overall growth rate. Average daily rates for accommodations, or ADRs, were up over 1% in Q3 versus the prior year on a constant currency basis, which is better than our forecast of flat. Strong ADRs in some of our core travel markets more than offset the negative impact from mix. Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced Q3 growth rates in U.S. dollars by approximately 3 percentage points versus last year and by about 1 percentage point versus guidance. We estimate that changes in FX rates impacted gross bookings, revenue and EBITDA growth rates by a similar amount. Q3 gross bookings grew by 12% expressed in U.S. dollars and grew by 14% on a constant currency basis, coming in about 6 percentage points above the high end of our guidance range. Consolidated revenue for the third quarter was $4.8 billion and grew by 11% in U.S. dollars and by about 13% in constant currency. Revenue for the third quarter of 2018 under our current revenue standard was approximately 1% lower than it would have been if reported under the previous revenue standard. Advertising and other revenue, which is mainly comprised of non-intercompany revenue from KAYAK and OpenTable, grew by 14% in Q3 compared to prior year, including revenue from Momondo, an acquisition we closed in July 2017. In the third quarter, we started lapping our strategy to optimize performance marketing ROIs, which began in mid-Q3 2017. As a result, we continue to see leverage from performance marketing in the quarter, however, at a lower rate than the first half of the year. The leverage from performance marketing in the quarter was more than offset by the deleverage in sales and other expense, which continues to be driven by the growth of our merchant business in Booking.com. We will see pressure on the sales and other expense line as we continue to ramp our merchant business. However, a significant portion of these expenses are offset in revenue. As part of our effort to drive more direct traffic to our websites, we increased our spending on brand marketing in the quarter by 27% versus Q3 last year, which contributed about 40 bps of deleverage. As expected, the year-on-year margin pressure from nonmarketing OpEx, which includes sales and other, diminished in Q3 relative to the first half of 2018. GAAP operating income grew by 7%, and GAAP operating margin decreased by about 170 bps compared to Q3 last year. GAAP operating income in Q3 is negatively impacted by $23 million pretax related to -- sorry, by $27 million -- $23 million pretax related to a net travel transaction tax charge from prior periods that is recorded in our G&A expense line. GAAP net income amounted to $1.8 billion or $37.02 per share, which grew by 8%. Our GAAP net income includes a $31 million pretax net benefit related to unrealized gains and losses on our equity investments in Meituan and Ctrip. GAAP net income was also negatively impacted by the net travel transaction charge I just mentioned. We excluded the unrealized gain and the net travel transaction charge from our non-GAAP results. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 21%, which was in line with our forecast. Adjusted EBITDA for Q3 amounted to $2.36 billion, which met the high end of our guidance range and was up 8% year-on-year. As I previously mentioned, we saw a negative impact on our growth rates from the changes in FX since providing our guidance. Our adjusted EBITDA margin of 49% was slightly below our forecast. This reflects higher spending in marketing, which helped our room night growth. Our non-GAAP EPS was $37.78, up 7% versus the prior year. Non-GAAP net income reflects a non-GAAP tax rate of 21.1% in Q3, which increased from the prior year due to the impacts of the U.S. Tax Acts and the high Innovation Box Tax rate in the Netherlands. Our 4% lower share count in Q3 versus last year offset the negative impact on EPS growth from the higher tax rates. Our cash and investments amounted to $16.2 billion at quarter end. In Q3, we generated $2 billion of operating cash flow, which grew by 4% for the quarter and by 22% on a year-to-date basis compared to prior year. Our free cash flow for Q3 was $1.8 billion, which grew by 2% for the quarter and by 19% on a year-to-date basis compared to prior year. We returned about $2.2 billion during the third quarter to our shareholders through share buybacks. Since the start of the year, we reduced our fully diluted share count by approximately 4%. And on September 30, we had approximately $6.4 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. We will continue to be both programmatic and opportunistic with regard to our repurchases. And under stable business and market conditions, we expect to complete this authorization within the remainder of the 2- to 3-year time period we talked about in May. Turning to Q4. Our guidance reflects our quarter-to-date results and assumes our growth rates will decelerate over the remainder of the quarter mainly due to the size of our business and consistent with long-term trends. Our approach to guidance has not changed. Foreign exchange rates are expected to be an approximately 4 percentage point headwind to year-over-year growth rates in Q4, which we estimate will impact gross bookings revenue and EBITDA growth rates by similar amounts. We used a dollar-to-euro exchange rate of 1.145 when setting our Q4 guidance. We are forecasting booked room nights to grow by 9% to 12% and gross bookings to grow by 6% to 9% in U.S. dollars and by 10% to 13% on a constant currency basis. Our Q4 forecast assumes that constant currency ADRs for the company will be up by about 2% compared to prior year. We forecast Q4 revenue to grow by 13% to 16% in U.S. dollars and by 17% to 20% on a constant currency basis. We estimate that our Q4 revenue as reported on the new revenue accounting standard will be slightly less than -- 5% higher than it would have been under previous standard. Note that our EBITDA margins and growth rates versus prior year will also benefit from the impact of the change in the revenue accounting standard. Q4 adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $1.19 billion and $1.22 billion, which represents 11% to 14% growth versus prior year. We forecast that adjusted EBITDA margin will be down modestly versus Q4 last year. After adjusting for the impact of the revenue accounting change, forecast EBITDA will be approximately flat versus Q4 of last year, at the midpoint of our guidance range. Note that this growth rate was negatively impacted by unfavorable year-over-year FX change I mentioned earlier. To help you understand the underlying drivers, leverage and deleverage in the business in Q4, I will talk about these on a like-for-like revenue basis to eliminate the impact of the Q4 benefit from revenue accounting change. We are forecasting deleverage from the performance marketing expense line in Q4. Our Q4 forecast reflects the full impact of lapping our ROI optimization efforts we started in the middle of Q3 last year. We also expect to continue to lean into certain performance channels where we see high-quality traffic. We expect to grow our brand marketing expense in the quarter at a faster rate than we did in Q3, which will contribute additional deleverage to the P&L. We believe prudent investment in brand marketing is important to drive more direct traffic to our websites and build better profit awareness. Sales and other expenses continue -- is expected to continue to pressure margins primarily due to the ramp-up of our merchant business. We continue to push the expansion on our merchant platform to help build a home business and for other beneficial transaction effects. Finally, we expect continued deleverage in personnel from the investments we made in the second half of 2017 and earlier this year. We forecast GAAP EPS between $18.05 and $18.55 for Q4. Our EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of about 46.8 million shares, reflecting the beneficial impacts of the common stock repurchase we've made to date, which will reduce our share count by 6% versus Q4 last year. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance for Q4 assumes tax rate of approximately 20%. Note that our GAAP tax rate in Q4 last year was negatively impacted by a onetime expense item related to the U.S. Tax Act and is, therefore, not comparable. We are forecasting Q4 non-GAAP EPS of approximately $18.90 to $19.40, which represents 12% to 15% growth versus prior year. Our non-GAAP EPS forecast assumes an estimated income tax rate of approximately 20%, which is higher than the prior rate of 17% due to the impacts from the U.S. tax act as well as the increased rate of the Innovation Box Tax in the Netherlands. The negative impact from the higher tax rate is more than offset by a lower share count versus Q4 last year. We have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our fourth quarter EBITDA and net income from any further fluctuation in currencies versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter, but the hedges do not protect our gross bookings, revenue or operating profit from the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Our forecast does not assume any significant change in macroeconomic conditions in general or in travel market in particular. With that, we'll now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC. Mark Mahaney : Okay. I want to ask about the marketing strategy a little bit. I know you've gone through this kind of over a year of this kind of toggle, I think, away from performance and more towards brand advertising. Sounds like some of the upside, the acceleration you saw this quarter, it happened at -- came through the lapping of performance marketing. But maybe just address a little bit broader this overall shift towards brand advertising. Do you feel like you're at an optimal mix now? There's going to be constant experimentation. I assume the answer to that is yes. But any more color on whether after this year of experimentation you feel like you've gotten a better, more sustainable growth profile setup because of this toggle in marketing shift. Glenn Fogel : Mark, it's Glenn speaking. So I know you'd like me to be able to tell you it's all fine, stable, and it's going to be the same going forward. But the fact of the matter, these markets, as you all know, are extremely dynamic. So when we find good opportunities, we find high-quality traffic at the ROIs that we like, we step in, and we're going to buy. Similarly, when we think that there's something that we don't like, we're going to step away, whether that's because the platform's acting the way that we don't believe is in the best interest of our customers or for some other reason, we're going to vary how we're going to spend in those pay-for-performance channels. But what I said a year ago and I continue to say it now, is the importance of increasing our brand spend. And we're going to continue to do that, and you saw some of the increase already, and we here said we're going to spend more. And the reason is we believe, in the long run, we want to try and drive as much traffic as we can directly, and part of that is creating a brand awareness. And we talked about this in the past several times. So I can't give you any sort of specifics about how much it is we're going to do in performance, is it up or down. I can say there's probably going to be dynamic. There's going to be movements up and down going forward. But I absolutely believe, in the long run, the right thing is we'll try to increase that brand advertising to get the people to come direct. David, if you want to add any color, go ahead. David Goulden : Oh, Glenn, thank you. I think just consistent with Glenn's comments, we did reinforce in my remarks that we're very focused upon the growth and the balance of that direct business, again, which remains our largest single source of new customers and represents about half of our booked room nights. So it's a very strategic part, not the only part. But the spending on brand obviously supports that and also supports our longer-term strategy to expand our portfolios to provide more value to our customers. Operator : And our next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche Bank. Lloyd Walmsley : I had a couple, if I can. I wanted to first, I guess, follow up on the marketing questions. Can you give us any sense for how we should think about the return timing on the brand spend? And are you planning you're able to scale that up with more confidence around measuring a specific payback? Or is that more of a strategic decision still to spend on brand? And then, I guess, the second one, you mentioned a number of customers making their first booking is growing nicely. So any specific growth kind of rate or relative growth rate to your room nights? Is it faster or slower than overall room nights? Or maybe you can give us an update on that customer count metric given it's been a couple of years since you've updated that. Anything further you can share there? Glenn Fogel : Lloyd, so talking about marketing and the brand, what we're trying to do here? I can't give you any sort of specifics of when we think the ROI is going to be. I will say that it's still very early. If you recall last year, we talked a little bit about how we increased the number of people in terms of our brand marketing, how we're increasing the ability to develop technology tools to be able to measure, and we're continuing to do that. And we do like what we're seeing, and we are increasing the spend. This is a difficult thing as we continue to go forward in terms of understanding the attribution and how much of a factor you're getting for your brand that's going over to where your pay-for-performance is now performing better than it would have in the past and many different ways to understand what's the true ROI. It's going to be something we're going to continue to experiment, but I do believe we are going to continue to ramp up that spend, as I said in the last question, and it is something that we do believe is very important. Regarding the second thing, I want to make sure you heard what I said perfectly. What I was talking about is we are having people who are coming to our first time-ever, we call it, book time with Booking, and the first thing they're using is the home product. That's something we really like to see growing because that's showing that there's awareness of our booking home product beginning to grow. In terms of specifics, I'm not -- we're not going to give out any numbers on that area. Operator : And our next question comes from Mark May with Citi. Mark May : Sorry, again, on the marketing side, but up until the last year or so, the company's marketing spend as a percent of revenue is, I think, pretty consistently growing a couple hundred basis points a year. I guess, now it looks as though you're kind of leaned back into marketing. Is that kind of the pace that we should be thinking about? I'm just trying to understand a little bit how much of the past year or so has been a bit of an anomaly. And would you -- should we be thinking about kind of pre-2017 to think more about the marketing leverage in the business? David Goulden : Yes. Mark, this is David. Let me just start off with that. I understand where the question is going. Let me just -- first of all, I think you do have to look at the year in 2 halves. As you mentioned, the first half, broadly speaking, we have the benefit from our ROI authorization activities comparing optimized -- less optimized a year ago, and in the second half, we start to lap it. So you start seeing the two halves start to play out in a slight different way. I think one way to look at it, if you just look at the full year, and I know this is a projection based upon the top end of our guidance range, Q4, but if you look at the full year and you add everything together, you see 13% room night growth, 17% revenue growth, 17% EBITDA growth, 16% EPS growth. So I think it represents a fairly healthy year. Obviously, there's been significant stories during that year. And I know it's been a little bit of challenge sometimes for us to walk everybody through the moving parts. So one -- and one way to look at it is just kind of step back and look at the bigger picture for the year. The other part of your question is kind of what will things look like going forward. And I'm not going to give you a specific amount of leverage or deleverage, but I mean, our longer-term view of the business hasn't changed. And as we put our -- there's always going to be a bit of an ROI reset going on with -- being certain of our performance channels over the course of the last 18 months, but our longer-term view hasn't changed. And as we think about our 2019 plan, we think about our longer-term plan, what we plan to do is to invest in the business, to grow at above-market growth rates, expect to have and tolerate some modest deleverage in our EBITDA margin rates to achieve that build-out of the platform and that above-market position but have a close eye on the EBITDA dollar growth. So that gives you a little bit direction. But I don't want to get into the specifics yet as to how much, and we're still obviously working through that. We'll give you more as we finish our 2019 plan. Operator : And our next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Justin Post : One big-picture question and one housekeeping. On big picture, I think you spent about $100 million more than we thought on marketing, just our estimates, and generated about 6 million more room nights than we were thinking. Did something shift interquarter where you found pockets of better ROI? Or something changed in the market that made you more aggressive on the marketing spend? That's the first question versus your original outlook. And then secondly, just the strength in merchant bookings growth versus agency. Can you just remind us of the dynamics of that? Glenn Fogel : Sure. I'll take the first one, Justin. I'll let Dave take the second one. So as I remarked earlier, when we see good opportunities, we're going to spend. When we see areas that we don't think is appropriate, we're going to lean back in terms of marketing spend. The markets are extremely dynamic. And as David mentioned, there were some interesting things happening towards the end of Q2, running into Q3 that made things a little bit harder to try and foresee the future. So in each one of those things where we did spend more at certain times, and we did end up with more room nights. That's clearly in the math there, and we're pleased about it. And we hope going forward that we'll continue to find these type of opportunities that are going to help us build the franchise. David Goulden : Yes. Thanks, Glenn. And then on the -- on housekeeping, actually, it's a fairly important point. You can really see the transition occurring -- starting to occur in Q4 '17 when the growth in our merchant bookings started to significantly exceed the growth in our agency bookings as we are building out and deploying a global payments platform at Booking.com. That does a number of great things for us, for our customers and our partners. For our customers, it gives them many more choices to how they may want to pay for their transactions either in advance or closer to their stay. It gives them more opportunities to pay with the payment product of their choice. It may not necessarily be a credit card. It could be something like an Alipay, for example. For us, it lets us basically provide our customers with a more consistent service because we're in charge of exactly how our payment flow works. And then for our partners, again, we offer them more ability to accept different payment forms from different customers in different parts of the world because we can basically pay them, the partner, in the form of whatever they like to take even though we may have taken the payment in on the front end. There are different payment mechanisms. So it is the build-out of that global payments platform principally rolling through Booking.com having the impacts. And you see that mixed shift occurring. It's been occurring for quite some time as we see merchant revenues -- merchant bookings, rather, outstripping the growth of the agency bookings. Justin Post : Okay. And one follow-up, is Agoda simply like growing faster than your other platforms? Can you tell us about that? Glenn Fogel : We don't usually talk about individual brands, which is growing faster, which ones are not. But I will say that Asia is a fast-growing area. It's also a very competitive area. It's been that way for some time, and I suspect it's going to continue to be that way for some time in the future. Operator : And our next question comes from Kevin Kopelman with Cowen and Company. Kevin Kopelman : Just a follow-up on the marketing questions. Can you give us an update on your relationship with Google? And given your comments in the prepared remarks, whether you feel they're helping you best serve your customers. Glenn Fogel : So as you know, we don't generally talk about any individual advertising platform. And we also talked about over many, many years, we've had a wonderful relationship with people at Google, basically helping build out our business together with them, a very symbiotic relationship, helping improve each other's capabilities. And we're very pleased with that. And we hope that continues for a very long time. I can't say much beyond that, that would be helpful to you, I don't think. Kevin Kopelman : Okay, understood. And then just another question on brand marketing. You talked about wanting to grow that. Right now, you're about $500 million annually. How are you thinking about what the right amount is to spend on brand to make sure you're getting out there around the world today? Glenn Fogel : So as you know, one of the things that we're very proud about is our history of doing experimentation and not trying to make guesses or just projections without data. So what we're going to is continue what we've always done, and that is spend, test; test, spend, see how it goes. It's complicated. It's going to take a long time. And over that -- over this long period of time, we will find out what the optimal amount to spend is. But I can't give you a number now given that it's going to take significant amount of experimentation for a very long time before we are able to come up with what we think the optimal is. And the interesting thing about that is because this world is so dynamic, things change so rapidly, I don't expect we're ever going to come up with a set numbers. It's always going to be moving. One thing, though, I will add that I am happy to see is more and more of the brand marketing is going to digital video. And one of the good things about that is the measurement of that spend is better than it used to be when you're doing over-the-air TV. So at least we're getting better data, the measure against. Kevin Kopelman : Glenn, and lastly, can I just -- can you give us quarter-to-date share repurchase? Glenn Fogel : I believe that's David to say no. David Goulden : That -- Kevin, we'll just update you every quarter on how we've done. Yes, I think I saw a new policy. I think it's the right way to go. Operator : And our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak : I have two. The first one, just trying to a little bit better understand the 3Q and the 4Q guidance. The room night acceleration and the guidance deceleration, can you just talk to any specific regions or products that were the biggest contributors to the overall acceleration and growth? Then the second one, just to kind of, again, better understand the quarter. As you said, direct traffic, it sounds like, grew faster than the overall rate, so I think direct grew in the mix, yet performance probably drove more upside than expected. How did that happen? We're you able to use data to sort of test and deliver more volume at lower ROIs? Or were ROIs more stable than what you thought? Just how did performance come in better than expected? Was it that lower ROI or not? David Goulden : Brian, let me start, and then I'm sure maybe pass it over to Glenn for a couple of comments. So yes, you asked a number of things there. So yes, just to confirm, direct did increase mix in the quarter and also our performance growth in the performance channels, again, they did in the early part of the year, specifically in the Q2, to just kind of confirm that. And why did we see some more opportunities there? Well, we always test the amount of kind of elasticity and what the potential is to increase growth rates to return for investment. We're testing constantly in those channels, as I mentioned, a very dynamic and real-time testing kind of what we see as opportunity. And we saw a little bit more opportunity to drive growth without dropping ROI very much, if that makes sense. The prior elasticity test we had during the year would say that if you were wanting to drive a lot of growth, you have a high reduction in ROI. We saw some opportunities in some of our key channels to drive some more growth with less of a drop in ROI. We thought that was a smart thing to actually do. So that accounts for a number of things we've already talked about. It accounts for kind of why our performance in marketing spend was perhaps a little bit higher than many people have estimated. But as we commented upon the performance in room night, that was part of the reason why we're able to do better, and we know that's not the only reason why we're able to do better in the room nights. And that's why we lent into those channels a little bit more in Q3 than we expected to when we gave our guidance. There were some other factors, of course, that we're very much at the top of our mind when we gave that guidance at the start of the quarter. I mentioned there are other unusual patterns we were seeing in July. In August, those started to get better. Particularly, the whole weather situation in Europe got better, both in terms of the heat wave breaking in the north and the scorch wave breaking in the south. So those are all contributing factors but specifically related to the channels, I think, that gives you some color. Glenn Fogel : I would just probably just add that -- and I understand where people are coming for all these questions and looking at the numbers for sort of guidance was. But what I continue to try and do is have our investors and people that are looking at our company is focus on the long term, what we're trying to grow, what we're trying to build, what's going to be great for customers and partners. So in the long run, we're able to achieve the mission, which really is to help people experience the world no -- to experience the world with less friction and more profits for us. That's what we're trying to do here. And some quarters are going to be better than expected. Some quarters are perhaps not going to be as good. And there's so much -- and again, I'll use the word dynamic. We got a lot of players in a market that are also bidding against us. Bidding their own strategies, brand advertising. We are trying to figure out what works, what doesn't work, lots of factors happening. But as long as we continue to build our products, make things better for the customers, create what I talked on the past about this holistic system that really makes it easier for people to travel. As long as we focus on that and continue to do that, I believe, in the long run, we will continue to grow this company at a reasonable rate. And as we said so many times, we're still a single digit in accommodations in the whole industry. So that's a lot of ramp left. Operator : And our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Douglas Anmuth : Maybe a good segue into something that's not marketing-related. But Glenn, just hoping you can talk a little bit more about nonhotel accommodations just pass through the busiest part of the season. How do you sum up where you are here in terms of supply, the value proposition to consumers and also awareness in how that ties into your key priorities as you look into '19? Glenn Fogel : Yes. Look, it's incredibly important. We believe it's a great opportunity. We reported listing is up 21% year-over-year. You got to have the actual supply to actually book anything. If you don't have that, then you're not going to be able to move business, so that's a good start. But we've also talked in the past about the need to spend money to improve all the different things that need to be done to make a host, the person who's -- owns that property, be willing to rent it out to somebody. And we need to get the awareness to the demand side to get them to know, hey, we got this great product, come and get it. That's a lot of effort. And we were starting from behind from some of our competitors, no doubt about that. That being said, we talked about things that we built, and I talked a little bit about it in my prepared remarks, about some of the stuff that we've been building. And it's really a long-term project. This is not going to be done in a quarter or 2 quarters, even a year. But it's something that is a long-term thing that we absolutely believe in, and we believe that we're going to be able to continue to do it in the way that we think is the best way, and that's having both hotels and home properties on the same site. So the customer sees both products right there, sees the reviews right there. And we believe that you don't hit somebody with a traveler's fee at the end. And we believe incredibly important is the ability to do it on an instant-booking basis, so that when a customer is ready to purchase, it's done. It's not going back and forth, back and forth. And one of the things in that, though, is that there's an issue of trust. And that some of the tools we talked about for the host to be able to build some of the tools to make those hosts feel comfortable in an instant-booking area. So lots of things to be done, but it's an important part of what we're trying to build here. And I've seen -- as I mentioned earlier, seen people the first time they ever booked with us is booking a home product, loving that. Operator : And our next question comes from Naved Khan with SunTrust. Naved Khan : It's Naved Khan from SunTrust. Maybe two questions. So can you just maybe talk a little bit about the China outbound demand and maybe plans for HotelsCombined now that you've gotten approval from Europe for acquiring that business? And then I had a follow-up on metasearch. Glenn Fogel : So question -- first question, HotelsCombined, and I may have missed it. I'm not -- I don't believe we actually got the final approval yet. So we're going to pass on that question. So your question about meta in general? Naved Khan : Yes. And then just, along with HotelsCombined now, so wanted to know if you're willing to provide some color on China outbound demand, what are the -- any kind of trends you might be willing to share. Glenn Fogel : China outbound. Yes, look, incredibly important. I love saying it, so I'll say it again. I love China see how the locomotive, the travel train. I just saw some interesting statistics that I thought were indicative of how important this can be. So 2014, there were 55 million Chinese passports they could use to go outbound. 2017, it's 120 million passports. That shows kind of the growth. People don't get a passport unless you intend to actually go out of the country. China is also making things, making it easier for a Chinese tourist to go out. So in 2015, there were 46 countries that were visa-free. Now there are 74 countries, makes it a lot easier to go. As the -- and this is anywhere in the world. When the economy is doing well, as people get more money, they want to travel more. And in China, when the person is able to afford to travel outside China, they want to go. If you look at some of the social stuff going on, social media, people putting out their pictures of visiting London, in Paris and Rome and all that. But it's more than that. It's all over the world, and I've talked about the times being in Alaska seeing Chinese tourists, being in Iceland seeing Chinese tourists. It is so important for us to be able to get a good share of that product, and that's why we're doing a lot of effort. We have over 1,000 people in China working for us there. I think we have either a dozen or 14 offices in China. We have made -- as you know, we've made some significant investments to have good partners in China. We invested in Ctrip some time ago. We invested in Meituan, and we recently made an investment in DiDi. By making these investments, we are getting different ways to reach the Chinese tourists, so that we can show them all the great things that we offer to them. So when they want to travel, we've got what they need. And we're excited about it. We're pleased about it. And we think it's going to have a long-term benefit to our company. David Goulden : And Glenn, if I can just pick up the point on meta because that was in the first question. For obvious reason, we're not in the so-called HotelsCombined because we have not got the final approvals yet. So we've been working down that path nicely. But what I would say is that we think the meta segment is very important. And it is a segment because I think are a group of people who will always want to go a meta first before choosing their travel, and there are other people who are prepared to build their longest-term relationships with the OTA platforms. And we think that winning model is a global multi-platform model, which we are building in the meta space. So we think it's a very important part of our strategy, and people shouldn't get confused. We don't think it's necessarily competitive with our parts of the business. It's complementary because it addresses a segment of the marketplace that just prefers to go there first, and we want to have a great solution for those customers as well. Naved Khan : That's helpful. And just on the -- your commentary on meta. So now that you are sort of lapping the changes you made last year, the ROI changes, do you see more room for improving ROI there? Or do you think that they're at their appropriate level for now? David Goulden : Well, in terms of meta as a channel now for our businesses, I think we are now will be fully lapping in the Q4. The areas where there was the biggest share shift in terms of the changes that we made when we started our ROI authorization effort was, in fact, in meta, so we should get benefits in their Q4 over Q4. But we like our ROI approach. We think that what we've done is -- got things to a level that works nicely for us and for our business. So now we're lapping those, and we're looking incrementally opportunities just like I mentioned we did with other channels in the Q3. Operator : And our next question comes from Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray. Mike Olson : One follow-up on homes. Have you been able to decipher whether or not vacation homes are mostly additive or cannibalistic to traditional bookings? And then separately, on experiences. Should we think about this as being a significant area of investment in the near future? Or is it fairly minor relative to your spend in other categories? Just wondering how that stacks up on the priority list. Glenn Fogel : I'm sorry, could you read that second one again, Mike? Mike Olson : Experiences, just wondering where it stacks up on the priority list and how much the near-term investments need to be there. Glenn Fogel : All right. So in terms of cannibalistic in terms of homes, I don't usually think of it that way, really. I think about providing the choices. On what the consumer decide, it's fine by us. It's not our decision to try and direct them one way or the other. We do recognize, though, if we don't have the home, we may lose somebody who wanted a home, even though they may come to us and want to check out the hotels and we don't have the home. That may be a negative. We've always said that it's important for us to try and get every single type of accommodation on that platform. It's homes, apartments, it's -- we say a unique place to stay. We really mean unique. We're talking about yurts. We're talking igloos in the winter. We're talking everything there. That way, by providing that incredible breadth, really makes it more appealing to the consumer that when they want to travel or thinking on what they're going to do, they come to us. They know they're going to be able to get what they want on our side. Now in terms of experiences, in the long run, it is important. It's not something that we're going to just go 1 million miles an hour right now and crash the income statement by just throwing money at it to build out the thing, but it's something that is very, very important. And the reason is not only the money that it will bring to the bottom line, the incremental EBITDA, but we also believe, in the long run, it goes to that thing that I've talked about so many times, is providing that system that makes it easier and better for the person to travel. And I've experienced it myself as a consumer. I use it. And in cities where we have these things like experiences, it's just been a wonderful thing to be able just to show that QR code off the Booking.com app, skip the line to go on to the [indiscernible] or go up to the castle at the top of the mountain and celebrate. I did that. And I said, this is great. And that's the type of thing we do, so to build loyalty, it'll make it easier. So there's a lot of compound besides just getting the incremental amount of money out of that one transaction. Operator : And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente with Evercore. Anthony DiClemente : I have two. Glenn, the hotel suppliers themselves have been out there talking about the success of their own direct-to-consumer initiatives. They're competing to grow direct relationships with their guests as you are. So I guess, the question is, how is that going? How much of your spend on brand is really to actually compete with what amounts of your suppliers were trying to build those same direct relationships in the channel? And then, second question would be for, I guess, either David or Glenn. What's the right capital structure for Booking Holdings is? Is the business overcapitalized relative to what really is steady cash flows over time? So maybe just talking about the puts and takes of stock buybacks versus a strategic M&A versus the releases of your capital would be really helpful. Glenn Fogel : So our business is based on creating a great relationship both with people who want to stay in accommodation and people who are supplying the accommodation. And whether it be a large multinational, international chain or a single little hotel owner in the middle of some small village in France, it's always trying to provide value to them, as we provide value to the demand side. And sure, I've seen the edge for some of the large international chains, and nothing wrong with that. They want to attract people to come to them directly. They think it may be cheaper for them to do that. There's nothing wrong with that. We have a great relationship. I'd point out that the international large chain is actually a small portion of our business. We've talked about in the past, about 15% of our business. But we want to do everything that we can to be helpful and help make their business better. That's how we win in the long run. And we do provide a lot of value. We have the largest demand platform in the world for accommodations. So anybody who has a hotel and wants to fill a bed with a body and make some money, we're the people to come to. And some of the stuff that we do doing over 40 languages, over 40 languages, and doing customer service in these languages, we paid for that. That was [indiscernible] That's our cost. Doing all of the marketing that we do, those things are done more efficiently than almost any hotel could do on their own. And they'll find that efficiency, we're providing that value to these hotels. I want to -- I read about this and I hear about people saying the fight between the people like us and the hotels, and I really wish people would stop thinking this is a sporting event, a boxing thing or something like that. This is a thing where, sure, people want to attract people to their own site to say, look, why don't you come to us direct, too? I don't wanted to pay money for marketing. But in the end, I really want to change the -- just the tone of everything, so that we see that we're really helping each other. And this is really a symbiotic relationship. And I'll let David talk about capital structure. David Goulden : Yes. Anthony, obviously, capital structure could be a very long topic, and we've only got a couple of minutes for it. So I'll try and give you the kind of a higher view. First of all, I think you have to step back and look at we try to do with the business. There is a huge travel market opportunity out there, and we only have -- we have a single-digit share of the combination segment where we are the strongest. Therefore, we have a lower single-digit share of the broader travel marketplace. And our mission is to build out the best online global travel marketplace on the planet, offering choice, value, service and seamlessness for our customers. And that price is a huge price. And that is a price, I think, everybody wants us to go forward and try to develop. So that is our primary mission in life, and we are fortunate to have financial resources to be able to do that and, of course, be able to return significant amounts of money to our shareholders. Now that ability to return to shareholders as aggressively as we can right now has been aided by the Tax Act that is relatively new. I think that the commitment to return $10 billion over the next 2 to 3 years is a very important step forward. But I do want to put it in the context that broader opportunity to invest both organically and inorganically in building out this incredibly large opportunity we have in front of us where I think we have the ability to generate something, which is of significant value for our customers, our shareholders, for our partners, which is kind of our primary mission in life. So if that helps, that's how we think about it. Operator : And our next question comes from James Hardiman with Wedbush. James Hardiman : You've touched on this a little bit but maybe clarify a little bit. You had a strong finish to the third quarter and then better-than-expected guidance for the fourth quarter. I'm trying to figure out how much of that is momentum versus coincidence. Obviously, you don't give us a fourth quarter guide until now. But you spoke to a delayed summer travel booking scenario. I wouldn't think that, that would affect the fourth quarter very much. But I guess, at the end of the day, I'm trying to get at, are you more optimistic about the fourth quarter today than you were 3 months ago? And then maybe as somewhat of a side, maybe talk a little bit geographically. Europe was called out as maybe a headwind to overall growth last time we talked. Obviously, the mix of Europe changes in the fourth quarter. But I'm just trying to figure out if that's sort of resolved itself and whether or not Europe is a headwind or a tailwind as we look into the fourth quarter and beyond. David Goulden : Yes, James, let me start with that. So to answer the direct question, are we more optimistic about Q4 now than we were when we did our guidance last time? Yes. I think we're pretty clear last time when we were guiding, we were sitting looking at June and the July period, which were impacted by some macro facets that were out of our control, Europe being biggest in the marketplace was going through the most ridiculous weather pattern we've ever seen where the south was -- sorry, where the north was kind of warm and dry, and people didn't want to go anywhere vacation; and the south was basically in the 40s and raining, and people didn't want to go there. So that really affected our business. We couldn't predict when that was going to change, and that was also compounded by the World Cup going on, which, again, had big impacts on Europe, with big countries doing well in the tournament. So we were seeing that looking at a high degree of uncertainty. As I mentioned, as we developed through the quarter, things got better. Things got better than we expected in most of our geographies. And Europe was certainly the biggest one, and things did improve in Europe. And obviously, we ended the quarter at a higher growth rate than the average for the quarter because we commented that we expect a deceleration back on our August call. So we are looking at Q4 from a stronger lens than we expected to be, if things hadn't improved. And as I mentioned, our guidance for Q4 would reflect some deceleration from what we saw from a growth rate in October. So those are the factors, which we are looking at. And hopefully, that clarifies the puts and takes. But the short answer to the question is, yes, we are in a stronger position about our view of Q4 now than we would have been, if things have not improved in Q3, which is what we've built into our Q3 guidance. James Hardiman : Got it. And the geographic question, it sounds like Europe, the concerns there have largely been alleviated. Is Europe now a tailwind to growth going forward? David Goulden : I'm not going to get into the relative growth rate of different segments. But obviously, a lot of the things that were out of our control, we talked how it impacted our view of the world in early Q3 were happening in Europe. And yes, we talked about some level of acceleration from Q2 into Q3, and we saw that across most of our major geographies. Operator : And our last question comes from Deepak Mathivanan with Barclays. Deepak Mathivanan : Just a question on the 50% transaction mix from mobile. As mobile ramped over the last several quarters, has there been a meaningful change on repeat behavior cost of customer acquisition that could potentially be an incremental positive to unit economics going forward as -- given that we have now crossed our significant treasure hold in terms of 50%? And is the mix between paid and organic significantly the front on mobile devices? Glenn Fogel : So we don't -- we're not going to get into talking about the relative costs for mobile or desktop. I would, of course, caution the obvious thing, but some people seem to sometimes forget this that mobile does not mean app and does not mean free. So I just want to make sure everybody is on the same page on that one because it's not. We are very pleased now because we believe, as people continue to move towards the mobile device and doing all of their -- doing their travel with a mobile, it gives us a great opportunity to continue to work with the customer throughout the trip, providing them with more services, more things and making them better experience, make their travel better, so that they are then more loyal to come back to us again because we're offering always great things on the mobile. That's the good part about mobile. That's where it's really at. And I wouldn't get too much to wrap around whether or not the cost is higher or lower. Again, these are competitive markets. And over time, I imagine they're probably going to end up in an area where the equilibrium is not that different in desktop, who knows. That's my point about mobile. Dave, if you want to add anything to that. David Goulden : No, Glenn. I think that's the key point. The key point is that when we talk about the trip and be able to interact with the customer during their trip, their mobile device is always with them. It's always on. The desktop, they can go back to it occasionally, but they tend not to take the desktop with them. So if they open their laptops at night, maybe they [indiscernible] may want to try today. But the mobile device is there the entire time. So it's a very strategic shift in the business and particularly as we build out all the aspects of the trip. We like our customers interacting with us much more often on mobile than they can on a desktop device. Glenn Fogel : So thank you for joining us for the call today. Very pleased with our quarterly results, and we remain very excited about the future prospects of the company. I look forward to updating you after our fourth quarter call. Thank you very much, and good night. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

And now I'd like to introduce Booking Holdings speakers for this afternoon, Glenn Fogel and David Goulden. Go ahead, gentlemen. Glenn Fogel : Thank you, and welcome to a Booking Holdings fourth quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. We had a strong quarter with 171 million worldwide room nights booked, which is up 13% year-over-year and exceeded the high end of our guidance range. Our revenue increased 16% year-over-year in U.S. dollars or about 21% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA grew 17% U.S. dollars and the FX impact was a couple of points higher than it was on revenue. Our non-GAAP EPS was up 33% year-over-year. When I look back at 2018, I am pleased with the financial performance of the company. Our total booked room nights exceeded three-quarters of a billion room nights, and we produce strong year-over-year growth across our key financial metrics. Revenue was up 17%, adjusted EBITDA was up 18% and non-GAAP EPS was up 20%. We not only draw solid top line growth, increasing our share in the accommodation market but also stabilized our operating margins through our performance marketing optimization strategy, which we began in the third quarter of 2017. In 2018, we invested in three main areas that we believe can drive the long-term growth of the business, and we will continue to develop these in 2019. First, in alternative accommodations, we continue to add to our supply base. And as of December 31st, Booking.com had over 5.7 million reported listings. However, we are not just focused on the total number of alternative accommodation listings, but are also concentrating on the quality and type of properties joining our platform, so we can provide the best choices for our customers and drive search conversion. Booking.com's alternative accommodation business has meaningful size and scale and recorded approximately $2.8 billion in revenue in 2018, representing approximately 20% of our overall revenue for the year. It also reached the important milestone of over $1 billion in revenues in Q3 2018. It is also growing faster than our consolidated growth rate and is nicely profitable. We believe offering real choice with both alternative accommodations and traditional properties on one platform is the best customer proposition. We believe a telling data point underscoring the attractiveness of our model is approximately 40% of Booking.com's active customers booked in alternative accommodation property at some point during the past 12 months. Second, we invested in 2018, and in 2019 we'll step up our investment in the growth of our business through branding and customer acquisition programs in order to take share in the markets with the highest long-term potential returns. We believe these incremental investments will help drive greater loyalty and higher repeat rates to our direct channel over time. Just two days ago, we launched our new U.S. brand campaign, which we expect will drive further awareness in this important growth market. We will also look to improve brand awareness across our primary markets to increase brand campaigns in both offline and online channels. These marketing programs are taking on a greater importance as many of our performance marketing partners are experiencing slower customer growth. Third, we will continue to invest in the rollout of Booking.com's payment platform. This platform provides payment options favored by customers and property partners, particularly non-hotel property partners and provides a platform for merchant product offerings. Merchant offerings provide greater merchandising possibilities for Booking.com. And this year, we plan to step-up our investment in this capability to drive growth. This payment platform will also facilitate our transport in local attractions business, where we envision a frictionless customer experience that we believe will drive enhanced loyalty. For example, we look to build upon the integration of Rentalcars.com and Booking.com to deliver a better ground transport offering for Booking.com's customers this year. The number of car rentals and rides booked on the Booking.com platform grew rapidly this past year, contributing to our belief that an integrated offering is highly valued by our customers. China and the broader APAC regions remains an important geographic focus for us, and we invested significantly against this very large opportunity in 2018. As a result of smart growth investments, Agoda produced very solid growth rates in the region despite a very competitive marketplace. We continue to work with our partners Ctrip and Meituan, and we introduced a new strategic and financial relationships with DiDi and Grab, all of which, we believe, will help both Booking.com and Agoda build better brand awareness and acquire customers more effectively in this region. KAYAK completed a busy year with the integration of Momondo and acquisition of HotelsCombined in December. Both acquisitions bring greater geographic diversity and product strength to the KAYAK platform as it continues to build a global multiproduct, multi-brand travel search platform. We also announced the combined reporting structures of KAYAK and OpenTable during 2018 to further drive experimentation and innovation across both platforms. We're already seeing early signs of this with OpenTable recently announcing that its customers can use OpenTable dining points to book discounted hotel space, and I look forward to seeing further innovation from the combined teams. Priceline.com is increasing its momentum, and we're starting to see the benefits of our investments on this platform. The redesigned packaged product is growing very rapidly, gaining acceptance in the U.S. market. We're excited about the potential of this product for the entire company. Finally, as you can see from our Q1 guidance, we witnessed a slow start of the year, primarily in our core European markets, which we believe is largely due to overall macroeconomic factors. The initiatives outlined above are aimed at driving long-term top-line growth and share gains, and will help support the business if macro conditions soften. We believe these steps strike the right balance between driving growth and operating margins. Furthermore, we believe our financial scale and global diversified platform positions us to perform well to meet macroeconomic challenges. In conclusion, we had a very good year in 2018 and believe we have a great long-term opportunity ahead of us. We'll always manage our business with a long-term view and will continue to invest in growth this year with the goal of increasing our share across our primary markets. With that, I will now turn it over to our CFO, David Goulden, for the financial review. David Goulden : Thank you, Glenn and good afternoon. I'll discuss our operating results for the fourth quarter and for 2018 and then provide reports on the full year 2019 as well as our guidance for the first quarter. All growth rates are relative to prior year comparable of periods unless otherwise indicated. All year-over-year growth rates referenced in my remarks will compare the current year income statements under the new revenue accounting standard to prior under the previous accounting standard. Gross bookings and other metrics like room night reservations are not impacted by the revenue accounting standard. Our non-GAAP financial results and forecast include stock-based compensation and information regarding reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Now, on to our results for the quarter. Our booked room night growth of 13% for the quarter exceeded the high end of our guidance range. In the quarter, we observed a modest stepdown in growth rates from October levels. Average daily rates for accommodations, or ADRs, were up about 1% in Q4 relative to the prior year on a constant currency basis versus our forecast for about 2% ADR growth in the quarter. Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced Q4 growth rates in U.S. dollars by approximately four percentage points versus last year. We estimate the changes in FX rates impacted Q4 gross bookings and revenue growth rates by a similar amounts and the Q4 EBITDA growth rate by a couple of points more. Q4 gross bookings grew by 4% -- sorry, by 9% expressed in U.S. dollars and grew by about 13% on a constant currency basis, coming in at the high end of our guidance range. Consolidated revenue for the fourth quarter was $3.2 billion and grew by 16% in U.S. dollars and by about 21% on a constant currency basis, coming in above the high end of our guidance range. Advertising and other revenue, which is mainly comprised of non-intercompany revenues for KAYAK and OpenTable grew by 14% in Q4 compared to the prior year. Total revenue for the fourth quarter 2018 under the current revenue standard was approximately 5% higher than it would have been if reported under the previous revenue standard. As a result, our revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and net income growth rate versus the prior year were positively impacted in the quarter. In addition, expenses as a percentage of revenue, as well as margins were impacted from the higher revenue when comparing to the prior year Q4. So, to help you understand the underlying drivers of leverage and deleverage in the business in Q4, I'll talk about these on a like-for-like revenue basis to eliminate the impact of a Q4 benefit from the revenue accounting change. Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 was $1.26 billion, which exceeded the high end of our guidance range and was up 17% year-over-year on a reported basis and up about 4% on a like-for-like basis. As I mentioned previously, our growth rates were negatively impacted from year-on-year changes in FX rates. Our Q4 adjusted EBITDA margin of 36% under the previous revenue accounting standard was above our forecast, largely due to some leverage in performance marketing. We fully lapped our strategy to optimize performance marketing ROIs, which we began in mid-Q3 2017. We remain disciplined in our spending, and we were encouraged to see a modest leverage of 20 basis points from our proposed marketing in the quarter, which was better than the deleverage we anticipated. We continue to see these channels as an effective way to acquire customers, and we'll continue to invest rationally to optimize growth. As part of our continued effort to drive more traffic to our websites, we increased our spending and brand marketing in the quarter by 27% versus Q4 last year, which contributed about 50 basis points of deleverage. Sales and other expense continue to grow faster in revenue, primarily due to the growth of our payments platform of Booking.com. Finally, personal expense came in lower than our forecast, and contributed a small amount of leverage in the quarter. Our non-GAAP EPS was $22.49, up 33% versus the prior year. Non-GAAP net income reflects a non-GAAP tax rate of 11.3% in Q4, which decreased from the prior year, primarily due to a tax benefit resulting from the application of regulatory guidance issued in November that clarifies a provision of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Our full year non-GAAP tax rate was 18.3%. Our 6% lower share count in Q4 versus last year further benefited EPS growth in the quarter. On a GAAP basis, operating income grew by 16%, and GAAP operating margin decreased by 13 basis points compared to Q4 last year. GAAP operating income is negatively impacted by $21 million pre-tax related to travel transaction tax charges from prior periods that are recorded in the G&A expense line. Q4 GAAP net income amounted to $646 million or $13.86 per share, up significantly from the $11.41 loss in Q4 2017, which was negatively impacted by last year's $1.3 billion provisional net income tax expense related to the Tax Act. Our Q4 GAAP net income includes a $474 million pre-tax loss related to unrealized losses on equity investments in Meituan and Ctrip. Q4 GAAP net income was also negatively impacted by the travel transaction charges that I just mentioned. We excluded the unrealized loss and the travel transaction charges from our non-GAAP results. We had a GAAP tax rate of negative 2% for the quarter, which was primarily driven by the reversal of the tax charges related to a provision of the Tax Act that I mentioned previously, as well as the separate $48 million tax benefit related to the finalization of the one-time expense incurred in Q4 2017 due to the Tax Act. Our cash and investments amounted to $14.7 billion at quarter end. For the full year 2018, we generated $5.3 billion of operating cash flow, which increased by 15% compared to prior year. Our free cash flow for the year was $4.9 billion, which increased by 12%, compared to the prior year. We returned about $1.8 billion during the fourth quarter to our shareholders through share buybacks. Since the start of 2018, we reduced our fully diluted share count by approximately 6%, through our $6 billion in repurchases for the full year. As of December 31, we had approximately $4.5 billion remaining of our share repurchase authorization. We will continue to be both programmatic and opportunistic with regard to our repurchases and now we expect to complete this authorization before the end of 2019. Looking back at 2018, we're pleased with our strong performance during the year as we delivered room night growth of 13%, revenue growth of 17%, adjusted EBITDA growth of 18% and non-GAAP EPS growth of 20%. We exited the year in a stronger position and achieved many of our objectives. We grew our direct channels, which now represents over 50% of our booked to room nights. Our mobile platform a strong with over half of our room nights booked on a mobile device. And finally, as Glenn noted, in 2018, approximately 20% of our revenue and a higher percentage of our room nights were generated by our alternative accommodations business. Each of directs, mobile and alternative is growing faster than our overall growth rate. Now turning to 2019. I want to start by talking about some factors that will impact the year and then come back to our guidance for Q1. There are four main factors that we believe will impact the shape of 2019. The first is our growth investments; the second is a continued role out and adoption of our new payments platform of Booking.com; the third is from mechanical timing and comparison factors; and the fourth is the macroeconomic environment. Now let's look at each of these in turn. Starting with our growth investments. As Glenn talked about, in 2019 we're investing for growth, customer acquisition and loyalty in a number of key areas. These growth investments are step up in spend from normal levels. You will see them impact our financials in brand, in revenue the merchandising as well as customer acquisition and incentive programs and you'll also see them in personnel to support these initiatives. We expect there will be some in-year revenue return, but after taking this into account, these growth investments will reduce our EBITDA a growth rate by a few percentage points in 2019. These investment starts at the beginning of this year. We expect to returns to be higher in the second half of the year so there'll be a greater negative impact on EBITDA growth during the first half. This means that our consolidated EBITDA growth will be higher in the second half. Now moving to payments for Booking.com. In 2018, approximately 10% of the gross bookings of Booking.com was processed via our payments platform and we expect this to continue to increase. In 2018, payments put pressure on EBITDA in the form of higher sales and other expenses that were not fully offset by associated revenue. This reduced our consolidated EBITDA growth rate in 2018 by a little over 1%. Going forward, we do not expect any additional reduction in EBITDA growth from payments and will continue to see increases in revenue. This will pressure margin rates modestly. We also see the opportunity for payments to drive EBITDA growth in the future. Of course, payment provides advantages in many areas, including merchandising flexibility, a better customer experience, reduced customer service expenses and the ability to coordinate on most integrated trips. The third set of factors are more mechanical, but important as you think about the year. FX is expected to be quite significant this year. Using current FX rates, assumed in our guidance, gross booking growth and the revenue growth through the non-GAAP EPS growth will be reduced by approximately 250 basis points for the full year and 500 basis points for the first half of the year. Additionally, the timing of Easter will impact revenue growth in Q1 and Q2. Last year, Easter was in April 1 and therefore majority of Easter revenue was recorded in the first quarter. This year, with Easter on April 21, Easter travel revenue will be recorded in Q2. Compared with Easter falling on the same day as last year we estimate that about $65 million of revenue will move into Q2. We estimate this shift in timing will reduce Q1 2019 revenue growth rate by approximately 200 basis points and increase Q2 2019 revenue growth rates by approximately 200 basis points. The fourth is the external -- the fourth factor is the external macro environments. We continue to expect travel to grow faster than GDP on a global as well as on a region-by-region basis. Of course, this means that the growth of travel on a regional basis will be impacted by regional, GDP and sentiments. Consistent with recent economic indicators, we saw slow start to the year in Europe and this is impacting our room nights, growth guidance for Q1. To provide a little bit more insight, January room nights growth in Europe was a step-down from December and February is looking stronger than January but still below December. We expect to continue to gain share in accommodations in Europe, especially with our investments. Room night growth rates in other parts of the world are more in line with what we saw in December. We think that working through these factors will be helpful as we describe and you build your models for the year. We also think that sharing some expectations for the full year, taking these factors into account, will be helpful as well. For 2019, we expect to gain share in accommodations in each major geographic region, and we are confident that the strength of our business, reinforced by the growth investments we're making this year will enable us to achieve this. We'll manage the balance between growth and profitability with an expectation that non-GAAP EPS on a constant currency basis will grow in the low-double-digits, in 2019, after factoring in the impact from the growth investments I previously mentioned. If economic conditions were to further soften, we still -- we'll still preference growth over realizing short-term margin because we believe this is the best for our business in the long-term. So with that, as a framework, let's turn our attention to Q1. Our Q1 guidance reflects our quarter-to-date actual results forecast for the remainder of the quarter. Foreign exchange rates are expected to be an approximately 6 percentage points to 7 percentage points headwind to year-over-year growth rates in Q1, which we estimate will impact gross bookings, revenue, EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS growth rates by similar amounts. We used a dollar-to-euro exchange rate of 1.13 when setting up our Q1 guidance. We are forecasting booked room nights to grow by 6% to 8% and total gross bookings to be approximately flat at the midpoint of our guidance in U.S. dollars and to grow by 5% to 7% on a constant currency basis. This reflects what we've seen so far this quarter and also limited impact from our growth investments. Our Q1 forecast assumes a constant currency ADRs for the company will be down about 1% compared to the prior period. We forecast Q1 non-GAAP revenue to be approximately flat at the midpoint of our guidance in U.S. dollars and grow by 5% to 7% on a constant currency basis. Normalizing for both Easter and constant currency, we estimate that Q1 non-GAAP revenue to grow by 7% to 9%. We forecasted Q1 GAAP revenue will be down 2% to approximately flat when compared to Q1 last year. Q1 adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $680 million and $700 million. The resulting growth rate is also negatively impacted by unfavorable year-on-year FX change and by Easter timing. Normalizing for both Easter and constant currency, we estimate that Q1 EBITDA will grow by 2% to 4%. As I mentioned earlier, this is negatively impacted by our growth investments, especially in our seasonally slowest revenue quarter. We are forecasting leverage from performance marketing expense line in Q1, reflecting low volumes in the pay channels and our continued focus on acquiring high quality traffic. We expect to accelerate our brand marketing spend in the quarter, which will contribute to deleverage to the P&L and more than offset leverage we're expecting from performance marketing. Brand marketing is a key area where we're making growth investments to drive more direct traffic to our website and build better awareness. Finally, sales and other expense growth is expected to decelerate relative to Q4, but will continue to grow faster than revenue, primarily due to ramp up of our payment platform at Booking.com. We are forecasting Q1 non-GAAP EPS of approximately $10.90 to $11.20. Normalizing for both Easter and constant currency, we estimate Q1 non-GAAP EPS growth to grow in the low-double-digits. Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated income tax rate of approximately 18%, which is lower than Q1 last year, primarily due to the clarification around the provision of the tax act previously mentioned and a lower than our full year non-GAAP tax rate due to certain discrete tax benefits typically realized in the first quarter. We expect our full year non-GAAP tax rate to be 19% to 19.5%. Our Q1 non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of about 45.6 million shares, which is 7% below Q1 last year. We forecast GAAP EPS between $9.90 and $10.20 for Q1. Our GAAP EPS guidance for Q1 assumes a tax rate of approximately 18%. We have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our first quarter EBITDA and net income from any further fluctuation currencies versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter, but the hedges do not protect our gross bookings, revenue or operating profit from the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Our forecast does not assume any significant change in macroeconomic conditions in general, or in the travel market, in particular. With that, we'll now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Justin Post : Great. Thank you. I'll just start of with just a high-level question. When you look at your bookings growth rate in Q1 and you think about how you're performing versus other companies, it seems like it's a bit of a difference, your guidance versus other people in the travel industry. So how do you kind of reconcile that? And then, maybe if you could tell us how much better February was versus January, and if you think there was just something really abnormal for the first two months of the year. Thank you. Glenn Fogel : Hi, Justin, it's Glenn. So, as you know, we are very European-centric in our business. We're a global company for sure, but our biggest business is, by far, in Europe. And Europe has definitely seen and is experiencing a slowdown, if you look at any of the macro indicators out there, any of the published information, whether it come from the EU's data people, it comes out from any of the investment banks that put out predictions for how European economics are going to go. And you see, and even, I think it was yesterday, our Chairman of the Federal Reserve who actually said seeing headwinds in Europe. So I think that is the one element that would show a difference. On the other hand, I think if you look at the pure European payers, if you look at some of the tour operators, the two who are biggest in there, and I would suggest to take a look at their numbers and what they said, I think I should see significant consistency with what we're saying right here, right now. And there are a lot of uncertainties there. And uncertainty is something that absolutely makes people a little hesitant to both. And I can go through -- besides just general macro, we can talk about Brexit, which is obviously creating a tremendous amount of uncertainty, and people -- I spend a lot of money right now or not? I don't know what's going to happen. I know they\u2019re going to be troubles traveling into Europe, are there going to be troubles with FX changes or if you go into political issues. In France, weekly political issues with the yellow vest protest, which makes you do I want to go to Paris with that happening on Saturday and Sunday? Go to Germany where the cars who drives the German economy, which has slowed down is a secondary impact from trade, particularly China and U.S., is having secondary impact on Germany. Go to Italy, where the government there seems to be a little bit influx with whatever. I can go on and on. The fact is, we are more impacted by things that happen in Europe than, say, a U.S. based company. So I would say that on that one. In terms of actually in February in how that was, I think David said it about as much color. What we're to say is that February was a nice uptick from January, but it was still below December in Europe, and I think that's about all. David you want to comment? A \u2013 David Goulden : I just want maybe to recap the other comment which I made. I think, Glenn, you just talked exactly what I said about Europe. But I also just want to recap, Justin, that you heard that we said this really is an issue that is focused upon Europe and that room night growth in other parts of the world were in line with what we saw in December. Q \u2013 Justin Post : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Q \u2013 Mark Mahaney : Okay. Appreciate I think the relatively new disclosure on alternative accommodations. I didn't quite get expect it to be that high as a percentage of revenue. So maybe talk a little bit more about that. I think you said that it was nicely profitable. So is it as profitable as the non-alternative asset core business? Maybe how much faster it's growing than the overall business? And then any color -- the particular regions, is there any more color about where that growth is coming from in alternative accommodations? Any more color there would be helpful. Thank you. A \u2013 Glenn Fogel : Hi Mark. So it is a new disclosure, and we were very proud of that. What I mentioned about Q3 and breaking that $1 billion milestone, I think we were all pretty darn pleased about that. In terms of profitability, I would say it was nicely profitable. I'm not going to get into the details of it. One thing we have talked about in the past though about how sometimes the cost involved there can be more than the cost with the traditional hotel product, and it's easier to see that when we start talking about scale. If you want to deal with a hotel that has hundreds of rooms, you can distribute that cost much more easily than when you're going property by property by property. And that's not as much color I'll give in terms of profitability. Well, say in terms of geographic growth, et cetera, we have made a point in the past, so I'm going to continue this, is that we know that we are -- and I just mentioned how we're European-centric Company. And we do very well in the capital cities in the alternative accommodations. We've got great properties there. We are able to produce a very good offering there. In other parts of the world, in the U.S., in particular, we need to increase our properties, particularly a certain type and that is a single home that is in the beach locations, some of the ski locations. And just to give others point an example to show this. I was looking talking about getting a Hampton's house for the family, and I looked at that on our site and I looked at some of our competitor's site, and I'm saying we've got to get some more of that stuff. And that is something that we are doing as part of the things we invest in, and I look at is a glass half-full type. And this is a great opportunity for us to increase and really drive the accelerated down a little bit in that area and grow our business. Mark Mahaney : Okay. Thank you, Glenn Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Lloyd Walmsley : Thanks. I guess, first, it looks like performance marketing spend is up about 12% in the quarter, call it 16x, 17x effects and almost 20 when you include brand spend and yet room nights booked was up only about 13. Can you give us a sense for what's going on with marketing ROIs? And maybe some more color on how that's trending in kind of acquired channels, growth that's trending in acquired versus direct. And then, I guess, in some of the prepared remarks, you talked a lot about growth investments. It sounds like most of those are going to be on the brand side. Are you also going to be leaning in on the performance side for growth? And any color you can provide there would be great. David Goulden : Yes, Lloyd, this is Dave. Let me start that. So let me just kind of clarify the difference between what we expect and what we saw in the Q4. You have to look at Q4. You have to exclude the impact of the extra revenue when kind of doing your leverage and deleverage calculations. So on a like-with-like basis, we actually expected to get some deleverage in the performance marketing line. We actually wind up with a little bit leverage, which is part of the reason why we came over on our EBITDA guidance for the quarter. And based on what drove that compared to expectations was a little bit less volume than we're expecting in those channels and actually with ROIs that are in line with our guidance, where we spoke to you about the quarter, the beginning of it. And actually, if you look at my comments about Q1, you see a similar trend as well. We're expecting some leverage in the performance marketing channel again in Q1 because volumes are a little lower, but we're still getting solid ROIs against those volumes. So you'll see our mix towards direct continuing to increase as a result of that leverage we're getting in those channels. And then in terms of growth, I think we kind of gave you the growth investments, so we gave you a feel that they're going to impact our EBITDA growth this year by a few basis points. In terms of income statement, I kind of basically told you where you'll see them. Some of them will appear in the branding line, some of them will appear in the revenue line in terms of merchandising, customer acquisition, customer incentive programs. You'll see some increases in the personnel aligned to support those investments directly. In some of the countries where we talked about investing for long-term returns, there are some increases in performance marketing associated with those countries, but it's not a major part of the investment program. Lloyd Walmsley : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Kevin Kopelman from Cowen and Company. Your line is now open. Kevin Kopelman : Hi. Thanks a lot. Could you give us -- so just to go into the room nights growth a little bit more for the first quarter. The guidance is about 400 basis points lower compared to your guidance for the fourth quarter. So, is that fully just from the European kind of macro comments that you were mentioning? Are there any other key factors there for the Q1 night guide? And then I have another one. Thanks. David Goulden : Kevin, I'll take that. I mean, that really is the major factor. Just kind of stitched together the couple of points that we made to make sure that you kind of gotten. So, we said that -- as we said we guided for Q4, we expected some deceleration in room nights in the fourth quarter. From what we've seen we, obviously, came quite strongly out of the Q3 in September. We mentioned that we were seeing pretty good room night growth in October. And as we expected, we saw a step -- a little step down in the fourth quarter. And in fact, November and December room nights were quite comparable to each other, but a little bit less than October, and therefore, a little bit less than the average where we came out for the quarter. And then you jump off that point, and I think the rest of it kind of being true. We saw a step down, a bit of bounce back in Europe. And we really do believe that's tied to the macro and we looked at very carefully. And then we saw relatively similar performance in the first couple of months this quarter as we saw to the last few months of last quarter outside of Europe. Kevin Kopelman : Okay. Thanks for that. And then just to follow-up on your -- on the investment in customer acquisition programs, particularly the incentive programs. Can you give us more color on what you're doing there? And are you focusing on an incentive-based loyalty program? Or is it more on special one-off offers for new customers or old customers? Thanks. Glenn Fogel : Well, actually, Kevin, it's actually that and many more. There are lots of different ways to put that money to work and achieve what we want to do in terms of ROI that we think is acceptable over the long run. And certainly, the two you mentioned are there, and there are a lot of other ones as to which geography you're in to. If you go to -- similar things happening in the Asian marketplace where there is a significant more price competition with discounting by wholesalers that's being put into retail, all sorts of things. We need to be able to compete with that straight out. If we don't have -- provide a value to our customers, we're not going to get those customers. We've got to do that. Certainly, there are things like potential loyalty programs. There are different things for just bringing in new customers. And even things, I'll give you an example, it's a small thing. But I got a postcard yesterday from Booking.com that offered up -- a snail mail that offered me a discount if I went to the site and went in. So, lots of different things to do. And on top of those pure ones, it's important to getting the packages with different types of our inventories, different types of our products to create a better value, that we may end up doing some subsidy for us, but we may also be working partially with suppliers. So, for example, we have new deals with DiDi and Grab, those are ground transportation companies primarily. We're working with them. We remain together, worked to be able to get more customers to those companies in areas that they need, where they help us get us customers in areas that we need and doing different types of cooperative types of marketing programs that will help us get more customers. Lots of different ways to do that and we're not going to always be measuring which ones are given us the best ROI. Kevin Kopelman : Thanks. And just a housekeeping on the EPS guide. Does that assume the future buybacks now that you expect to use that program in 2019? David Goulden : Yeah. Basically, yes. The EPS guidance, from a housekeeping point of view, we said that we expect to use our remaining authorization. So, we gave you a specific share count number for Q1, but in our guide for the full year, it assumes we extinguished our remaining authorization. Kevin Kopelman : Thanks, David. David Goulden : That\u2019s, Kevin. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Doug Anmuth : Thanks for taking the question. Glenn, I was hoping you could drill down more on the key benefits of the payment platform. And if you could talk a little bit about when you start seeing those benefits more and how long it takes to fully roll out. And then David, just on the 1Q guide, is it safe to assume here that you're assuming further decel as you usually have done in previous quarters in the past? Thanks. Glenn Fogel : Doug, you're right. This payment platform is a very important paying for Booking.com as we go forward and developing its merchant capability, so we can provide this greater merchandising and a couple of things I just mentioned. You need a payment platform to be able to do some of the things I just talked -- answering Kevin's question. So that's the basics there. But there's even more. Just simple, yeah, I mentioned how important it is for our alternative accommodations business, that we want to continue to grow that out. Well, that's also a very important thing to have, because as you go after those single-home property owners, we're not that sophisticated. The old agency method that we used primarily at Booking.com is not really the thing that they want to use. They're not planning to be there and take a credit card and then get a bill from us to send us our commission. They want to have a merchant product there. So that's important thing, too. It's one of those things we're always going to be working on because our payments platform is not just the simple thing in America where we're using credit cards. There are new payment systems throughout the world that are coming up all the time, and we need to be able to provide that to both sides of our marketplace. There are people on the supply side that we connect to Alipay. I want to be part of WeChat Pay. That's how I want to get my money and you've got to do that. Same thing on the customer who wants to pay. They say hey, I want to use Paytm or I want to do M-Pesa. I can go through an endless list of these things. So when we talk about payment platform, we're talking about something's global and able to use throughout and helping to reduce that friction in the entire transaction. David Goulden : And Doug, let me just pick up on that and also clarify your question. Of course, payment's is very important but let's make sure it's not going to the entire business. We do believe that pay at the property, which has been a big piece of our business, continues to be a big piece of our business is also very important part of our portfolio, and a lot of our customers and a lot of our partners also like that as well. So it's bringing an additional capability to complement what we do so well at Booking.com. And then to comment upon your question on the Q1 guide. No, our Q1 guide does not assume a deceleration. That's why I did not say that. In fact, specifically, we said that January was, in fact, again, with the rest of the world being relatively consistent with December, I said that, in Europe, January was a step-down and February was a step-up. So it reflects what we've seen so far and our expectations the rest of the core, but it does not reflect the deceleration. Doug Anmuth : Thank you, both. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Deepak Mathivanan from Barclays. Your line is now open. Deepak Mathivanan : Hey, guys, thanks for taking the questions. Somewhat related question on the payment side, what is currently the go-to-market strategy for the payments platform? And whether that's incentivizing hoteliers to choose your payment solution versus their existing one? And in over time, do you think there's additional opportunity to generate economics from the payments efforts? Right now, it sounds like you are probably using some incentives for adoption. So, just wanted to get some color there. Glenn Fogel : I'll take that and I'm going to reverse, because it is exciting, the second part of your question, about being able to use the payment platform, not necessarily something that's increasing cost, or it's something actually over time, will actually enable us to make more money. And given the volumes that we put through and are going putting through in the future, I believe that is a great opportunity but that is down the road. Right now, in terms of incentivization and why -- listen, as David just mentioned, our agency a product is still a -- it\u2019s a nice part of the progress. It's the way people, major hotels are still going buy one or two for some time. But again, I go back to the thing about merchandising, putting in packages. One of the things we always try and emphasize how we try and work with our supplier partners cooperatively in a way that adds value to both of us. And having that merchant payment product available so that we can combine a hotel with another service in a way that helps bring that customer to that hotel in a way that is frictionless, easy, makes that payment so much easier for the customer, well, I think hotels are going want to want to do that if it gets them more business. And I think that's really the incentive for that. Over time, it could also be a volume issue where we can make or do a payment product that is significantly less expensive for smaller hotels in other parts of the world where their costs are higher. Deepak Mathivanan : Okay. It\u2019s helpful. Thanks, Glenn. Operator : Our next question is from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Stephen Ju : Hi, Glenn. So building on your highest potential market commentary earlier, it seems like there's more dialogue around your local efforts in China both in terms of earnings calls like this as well as interviews with your local management teams and talking about the opportunity for outbound. So you've always had partnerships there, but why is now the right time for what looks like what's probably more of a direct effort to advertising establish to Booking.com brand in the country? And is perhaps a greater conversion rate from the payment product, is that what's making I guess the ROIs there possible now? Thanks. A \u2013 Glenn Fogel : I would look at it a little differently, actually. We first started our business in China many, many, many years ago. We now have approximately 1,000 employees there, and we have different call centers there. We have always been pushing out our own brand. It's not just Booking.com, Agoda has been operating in China for very long time. So I think the way we look at is we're always trying to use to all the different ways to get more customers through our platform and be able to provide more value to customers and hoteliers. So yes, we absolutely are doing deals with lots of different players in China because we think that's a way to help build up our business. But I don't think it's anything different. In terms of the payment product, there is some difference in some thing that do help in terms of doing business in China, having that product there is good. I'd like to point out Agoda has always been a merchant player, and they've done very well there. Booking in the past was primarily agency business, they've done very well there. But I do think having that flexibility, particularly with Alipay, and with WeChat Pay and some of the other things coming in here, our agreement with DiDi, Meituan, I think these things are helpful to have that platform there. Stephen Ju : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Naved Khan from SunTrust. Your line is now open. Naved Khan : Yeah, thanks a lot. I'd like 2 clarifications. On this sort of recent trend in sort of macro-related slowdown in Europe, are you seeing sort of customer eventually booked but not really booking in advance, kind of waiting more to the last minute? Is that kind of a behavior you're seeing? Or are you seeing kind of demand weaken all together? And then, another question I have is about just the growth in different sort of channels. I think I heard you mentioned mobile growing faster and alternative growing faster. I did not here about direct growing faster. Was that still the case the direct bookings are faster growing? Glenn Fogel : All right. So, I'll take that first and I'll let David talk about growth and speed. I think that it'll be interesting -- we need more time to see if this uncertainty factor that I met, this propensity, perhaps, to wait to book. We'll need a little more time to see if it's going to be drastic change and that is what is happening right now. I would say that it was interesting in the third quarter where we did have a lot of people who, obviously, waited to book because of either World Cup, or the heat or whatever, and we did see that delayed pick up and bookings in third quarter. Things a little early to say exactly and I'm going think also what's going to happen in the macro environment. David Goulden : Yes. And then -- sorry, I obviously, covered a lot of things in my earlier comments, but I did talk about direct. And just to confirm and recap, the direct channel did grow faster. We used to say it was approximately 50 -- approximately half the business, now we're seeing it's over half the business and growing faster down the average. So, we have the direct channel of over half and growing faster than the average. We've got mobile over half and going faster than the average. And we've got the alternative business at about 20% of our revenues, a high percentage of our room nights and also growing faster. So, each three those are doing well and growing faster than the average. Naved Khan : Okay. Thank you, Glenn. Thank you, David. Glenn Fogel : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Anthony DiClemente from Evercore. Your line is now open. Anthony DiClemente : Thanks very much for taking my questions. In terms of your investments in the alternative accommodation space, it would be great to understand within that investment bucket, how much of it is investing in new supply? Glenn, in your example, you mentioned like beach house listings versus marketing of that supply versus investments in the consumer tools to integrate that supply, whether it be like technology or AI that improves the user interface for the customer. And then related to that, just wondering if you're seeing any consumer behavior that suggests maybe an incremental shift to home versus hotel. Is that inflecting in any way that is notable? Or is it more kind of a steady, linear trend that's going on out there? Thanks a lot. Glenn Fogel : So, one of the thing -- it may be a little confusing, is the difference between what our steady growing listings, growing the business, and sort of our steady state, that's what we do all the time versus what we try and call out a little bit here is that we're doing a step-up in investments. The listings is not a step-up added investments that's going continue to grow our business and I want to do something of the important, but we don't see that as a different thing that we're doing right now. So, that would not be as part of what we're talking about the step up investments. In terms of what we need to do to make that business continue to accelerate, do well is all the elements that we've done -- all of our business forever, and that is -- I think one of the key things is really is just getting that knowledge out among certain groups of customers around the world who may not have as much knowledge that we have this great product. And yes, I mentioned I called out where I think we a little bit of shortfall in some parts of it, but the fact is, in the U.S. we've got a great product. And we do need though to make more customers aware of it, and that's part of the coming out with that new branding campaign that we launched two days ago. You won't see it and the stuff you're seeing the right these couple of days that's coming out in terms of, as part of it, to make sure that people are aware that we have a non-hotel accommodation product that is out there, that is good. And we talked about the reason why we think it's a great thing, about the fact that instant confirmation. We talked about that you can see that on the same search results as your traditional so you can do a comparison. We talked about how you don't need hit at the end with a fee at the end. All these reasons that we think we have a great product, but definitely getting that branding out and that scenario we talked about, increasing our spend. In terms of actually looking at numbers and inflection points, I think that there's nothing that I would see that we saw a crack, oh my God, this is a difference. We're going to have a huge inflection point. This is a little bit of blocking and tackling do all the right things and continue to do it day-in and day-out, and we'll get there. David Goulden : Yeah. And then, Anthony, just to clarify, to build up on Glenn's point, just to make sure everyone is clear, when we talked about these incremental investments that we make in 2019, incremental above investments that we normally make with the regular size and growth of the business, these are all focused upon driving growth. They're focused upon branding. They're focused upon customer acquisition. They're focused upon merchandising, incentive programs. They're all focused on driving incremental customers to our platform, driving incremental transactions and driving loyalty. So top-line focus. Anthony DiClemente : Awesome. Thank you very much. David Goulden : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Michael J. Olson from Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Michael J. Olson: Hey. Good afternoon. I just had one. You mentioned several areas of near-term investment. I don't believe experience is one of those areas. Just curious where that falls in the list of priorities at this point with all the other initiatives going on in alternative accommodations, direct channel growth, payment platform, China, et cetera? Thanks. Glenn Fogel : So it is important. And as David just said, we're trying to just show a little difference into one of the incremental things that we're doing to drive growth. It's a very important part of our business. We bought FareHarbor, put that in. I can tell you now, we have over 100 cities now, and I think almost 120 that have these attractions and things people can do when they show up. And we talked about in the long run, how important it is to offer that holistic solution for our customer. And that goes back to why we're having this payment problem. You've got to have that to put together all the elements of the trip, and reduce the friction for that customer. So the fact that we didn't throw it out, and we didn't talked about it, we're half an hour into our prepared remarks and stuff. I'm glad you ask the question, so I could make a point that this is still extremely important part, and we're very pleased with some of the progress we're seeing there. David Goulden : And it size together what the work we're doing, booking also to bring in the cars and rides, and put together these great trips. So it's a very important part of our building out the connected trip experience for our customers. Michael J. Olson: Got it. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Heath Terry from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Daniel Powell : Thanks. This is Daniel Powell on for Heath. Just a couple of questions for us. Just want to dig in a little bit more on some the comments you made around what you saw in your various marketing channels in the fourth quarter. It sounded like the ROIs were stable, but the volumes you are seeing were pretty consistent. Just curious if there was a decision around, because of what you're seeing in the macro environment, not to look to lean into other channels. Or if there was a lack of ROI that you saw outside of the traditional channels that you weren't getting the volume that you would have expected to. And then just another one after that, on the delta between room nights growth and bookings growth in the first quarter that you're guiding too. I realize it's not very big, but just curious if there's anything about the growth that you're seeing in alternative accommodations that we should think about over the course of 2019 that could be impacting the delta between those two. Thanks, guys. David Goulden : Let me take the second one. As you've got to look at everything on a constant currency, Easter adjusted basis. Sorry you have to do that, but unfortunately it's the only way to kind of look at things on a like-for-like basis. So you look at the basis into the first quarter, room night growth is 6 to 8, and gross booking growth is 5 to 7, so pretty consistent. There's an ADR difference. We do expect ADR and we're seeing a little bit of pressure on ADRs tied to the macro, we're seeing it tied to two things. One, we are seeing a little bit less international traveler into certain cities. And those international travel transaction since we have higher ADR. And also we are seeing some local pricing pressure as well impacting the ADR. So that's the story between room night growth and gross bookings on a like-for-like basis during the first quarter. And then, just to recap again, what we said on the fourth quarter, we're expecting to get some deleverage from the performance marketing channels. We've got a little bit of leverage. That's because there was just lest volume there than we expected, but we're pleased with ROIs and we're pleased with the share that we maintained in those performance marketing channels. So it's a function of volume we saw in the channel as opposed to anything else. Daniel Powell : Got you. And there weren't other channels that you thought you could have spent into when you weren't getting that volume? Or is there an issue around timing there? Glenn Fogel : We always are -- always look at every way we can spend money to bring in growth and we're always looking at what's the ROI for it, what do we think the long-term benefit is going to be, what's it do for the brand. All things we've we talked about in the past about that we're pleased with the way things were at that point? David Goulden : Really, just to kind of put those two points back together again, if you think about it, we did better than we expected in the Q4 on room nights growth. And as we just said, we got a little bit less volume from the performance marketing channels. So the fact that we were able to beat our room night growth guidance for the quarter and an important channel for us had a little less volume than we expected I think that's a good thing. Therefore, we were able to still lean in elsewhere and do better than we had thought we might do. Daniel Powell : Thanks. Appreciate the detail. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Brent Thill from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Brent Thill : Thanks. Just back to the growth initiatives for 2019. I'm just curious if you could help us prioritize if you had to wait each of the initiatives, where the biggest rate goes and the biggest investments in descending orders. If you could just give us a high-level view, that would be very helpful. Glenn Fogel : Yes. I don't think we're going to able to give you more color. Those are -- the ones we listed out are the important ones. And one thing I'll make a point of is that we set up a budget, we think of what it's going to be for the year and we put it out and then we start actually executing. And as you go throughout the year, you may notice some things are performing better than other things. We want to put more money into things or things are not working as well and you pull that back. So even if I were to give color say, okay this is as of this moment here's what we're going to spend -- it's still not going to be that helpful because these things I know will change as the environment changes. David Goulden : Yeah. Brent, just to kind of give you a little bit of color and tell which is the smallest of the three areas. We told you there's going to be some impact you'll see on the branding line, some impact you'll see on the revenue line, some impact you'll see on the personnel line. Well the personnel line is by far the smallest of those three. The other two are the major spend areas and the personnel increase, so really those we're adding to support those growth initiatives. Brent Thill : And Glenn, just a quick follow-up. If Europe continues to lag a little bit longer than you would like, can you just give us a sense of how you think about the alternative opportunities to counter that, what's happening, how you think through that for the back half of the year? Thank you very much. Glenn Fogel : Yes. So we believe that areas of slowdown can be great opportunities to gain share, develop loyalty, increase your value to your supplier partners. When things start getting a little bit slower, our hotel partners are looking for getting demand wherever they can. They look at the incremental. And they want to be able to say can you supply somebody in this bed? And as you know, hotels have high fixed costs. They need to get that person to help hit their bottom-line or get us close as they can to make a breakeven environment. I've had the fortunate of going through some of these in the past. I've been the company now -- it's not more than 19 years. So we've been through this before. We've been able to add value in the past. And I suspect if things do slow down a bit, that we can position ourselves in a way that, as we come out, we'll be even stronger. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Justin Patterson from Raymond James. Your line is now open. Justin Patterson : Great, thank you very much. I appreciate the commentary around the payment platform earlier and a providing more frictionless experience. My question is if you layer in more of these services, how do you think about really making consumers aware of all the features in the app? And in turn, how does that change kind of your view of LTV over the long-term? Thanks. Glenn Fogel : Yeah. That is a good point, because as we pointed out, just having great service in your product, that's not very helpful if people don't know about it. One of the great things, as people become more mobile savvy and as they're using their mobile devices more and more, and you're able to push opportunities to be able to communicate more with them, you're able to demonstrate what the value can by going to our systems. And we see this developing around the world, this concept of the super app type thing. And this is everything from all the way, from the WeChat, which is completely know so many different things you can do off that. To things that are a little bit not quite but are -- our partner now with Grab is doing a lot of different stuff. We need to make sure that our customers are aware of these great things. I'm not as concerned though about being able to communicate what the value is. And I think we're not going to be there when we set these things up, as we continue to set them up. I think it's going to be fine. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Tom White from D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open. Tom White : Great thanks for taking my question. Just wondering you talked about profitability of your alternative accommodation room nights, I think you said solidly profitable, but when you kind of called out some of the higher cost for that relative to the traditional hotel business. I also remember that, in the past, you talked about the potential for technologies like AI and better automation to reduce your OpEx per room night. Is that something that should help drive kind of the EBITDA per room night for alternative to be more in line with traditional hotel over time? Or will that always kind of be structurally lower? Glenn Fogel : So first, I just want make sure we're on the same page, I said nicely profitable. That was the word I used, not solidly. But, I believe all new types of technology that we're developing are going to reduce that cost over time for both non-hotel accommodations and hotel accommodations. And it's interesting which ones will help the most, fastest I don't know the answer to that. I do know though that some of the things that we see, even right now in terms of lowering our customer service cost. And because we do have more customer service contacts with our non-hotel accommodations area. This is an area where we probably will get a benefit more there than we would in hotels, but there can be other examples that could go on the other way. The fact is though one of the benefits for a company, having the size and scale that we have, the ability to go out and hire lots of really smart AI-type people, help developed technologies that we can then put into our platform, distribute throughout the world for all of our supplier partners, we're providing a value that they can't do on their own. That adds to the reason why they connect with us, that's the reason why they give us the information, that's the reason why they want to work with us. That something that we do that they can't do as well, particularly somebody who is not a multi-billion dollar global chain. If you're not one of those, you're definitely not going to be able to play that game. We bring that to them. Tom White : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jed Kelly from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Jed Kelly : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just -- where is the company strategy around some of the -- or by owner managed inventory that's sort of, I guess, more frictional? And what's the overall strategy? And then you signed an agreement with FareHarbor, a couple of months ago. Have you seen an uplift in that agreement since you started that partnership? Glenn Fogel : I'll answer the second one. I haven't kept up with the details of that, so I'm just going to pass on that. I think that if it was significant, right now, though I'd know. So that's one.  Let's go with the second thing. Any type of non-hotel accommodation whether it be a single home that is operated by a mom-and-pop that do it once a year for one-week all the way up to very sophisticated players who have multiple units and are working with multiple distribution channels, we want to be able to get all these people onto the platform. The thing that we want to do though is in the right order, at the right times and the right amount of money and obviously go for the more profitable ones first. So that -- for the ones you're mentioning I think those are sometimes more costly. We got significant number of sophisticated owners and to deal with to get them onto the platform, but we'll get to them all eventually. Glenn Fogel : So, I want to thank everybody for the call. In summary, I am very pleased with our performance in 2018 as we met many important financial and strategic goals. And I'm truly excited about our upcoming key investments for 2019 as we position the company for long-term growth. And finally I want to thank everyone who made 2018 such a successful year, including our supplier, our marketing partners and now more than 24,000 employees distributed across more than 300 offices around the world and most of all our traveler customers who are out there being what we call our new advertising campaign, the bookers, the doers, the people out there exploring the world. By doing this they're making the world a better place. Good night. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect.",

And now, I\u2019d like to introduce Booking Holdings\u2019 speakers for this afternoon, Glenn Fogel and David Goulden. Go ahead, gentlemen. Glenn Fogel : Thank you, and welcome to a Booking Holdings\u2019 first quarter conference call. I\u2019m joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. We produced a solid quarter with 217 million worldwide room nights booked, which is up 10% year-over-year and exceeded the high end of our guidance range. As we discussed on our last call, the timing of Easter and foreign exchange rate movements meaningfully impacted our U.S. dollar financial results this quarter. Our year-over-year non-GAAP revenue growth was down slightly in U.S. dollars but up 6% on a constant currency basis and up about 8% when further adjusting for Easter. Adjusted EBITDA declined year-over-year by 10%, but increased about 6% when adjusting for FX and Easter, which was above the high end of our guidance range for the quarter. We are pleased with our results for the quarter, and we continue to see encouraging metrics in our business. Our direct channel is growing faster than our paid channels. Our mobile share is increasing, and our alternative accommodation business is growing faster than our overall business. As we continue to execute against a very large market opportunity, we will look to drive shareholder returns through the combination of organic growth investment, share repurchases, and opportunistic M&A. As we discussed on our last earnings call, we are investing to support the growth in our core accommodation business, primarily through brand marketing, merchandising, and customer acquisition programs. These investments are aimed at driving long-term top-line growth and share gains. We are on target with the launch of our new brand campaigns. And while it's early, we have confidence that they will increase our brand awareness over time. We're also pleased with the early results of some of our merchandising and customer acquisition programs and look to expand these as we move into our busy travel season. Our branding goals include driving greater awareness of our alternative accommodation to listings, as we continue to expand and improve our offering here. We were pleased to announce during the quarter that Booking.com passed the milestone of three quarters of 1 billion guest stays in its alternative accommodations since 2007. And as of March 31, Booking.com had approximately 5.8 million reported listings in alternative accommodations, which grew approximately 13% year-over-year. More importantly, our individually owned properties represent the fastest category of supply and booked room night growth. This is a key area of our focus for us as we look to provide the broadest possible selection of unique places to stay, which helps drive conversion benefits across our platform. We will continue to utilize M&A and strategic investments to accelerate key growth opportunities. For example, FareHarbor has enabled us to accelerate our growth in the attractions market and has given us key capabilities to build a truly connected trip, where we envision a frictionless customer experience that we believe will enhance loyalty in our accommodations offering. Our strategic investments in China and broader Asia, accompanied with local marketing partnerships, will continue to help us expand in these key underpenetrated markets, where we believe we can have long-term growth. Finally, in terms of share repurchases, we completed the remaining portion of our $10 billion share repurchase program, buying approximately $4.5 billion to date in 2019. Consistent with our historical approach to share repurchases, we took advantage of the opportunity to invest in our owned stock during the quarter. This year alone, we have purchased 5% of our fully diluted shares. Additionally, our Board of Directors approved a new $15 billion repurchase authorization that we will look to execute over the next two to three years, assuming stable business and market conditions. David will provide some more color in his prepared remarks. But this new authorization reflects our strong financial position, our high cash flow generation, and demonstrate our confidence in the future of the business. In conclusion, we had a solid quarter as our team remains in full execution mode. We'll continue to drive long-term shareholder returns through a combination of organic investment, share repurchases and opportunistic M&A. As you can see, we are actively pulling on all three of these levers. We remain absolutely focused on the large global opportunity that lies ahead of us, and we\u2019ll manage our business with a long-term view to capture it. I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden for the financial review. David Goulden : Thank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I'll discuss our operating results for the first quarter, provide an update on our capital structure, and then discuss our guidance for the second quarter as well as our thoughts on the full-year. All growth rates are relative to the prior year comparable period, unless otherwise indicated. Information regarding reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Now on to our results for the quarter. Our booked room night growth of 10% for the quarter exceeded the high end of our guidance range. We were pleased with our performance, considering the slow start in Europe and the growth challenges in our primary performance marketing channels. Despite a sluggish environment in Europe, room night growth rates in the region exceeded our expectations. Our room night growth rates for the rest of the world were slightly ahead of our expectations and grew faster than Europe. Average daily rates for accommodations or ADRs were down about 2% in Q1 on a constant currency basis, which was more than our guidance of down about 1%. Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced Q1 growth rates in U.S. dollars by approximately 6 percentage points versus last year. We estimate the changes in FX rates impacted Q1 gross bookings, revenue and EBITDA growth rates by similar amounts, and EPS growth rate by about 1 percentage point more. Q1 gross bookings grew by 2% expressed in U.S. dollars and grew by 8% on a constant currency basis, coming in above the high end of our guidance range. Consolidated non-GAAP revenue for the first quarter was $2.9 billion and declined by 0.4% in U.S. dollars and grew by about 6% on a constant currency basis. As expected, the shift in timing of Easter holiday had an approximately 2-percentage-point negative impact on our growth rates -- on our Q1 revenue growth rates. As a reminder, last year, Easter was on April 1st, and therefore, the majority of Easter-related travel revenue was recorded in the first quarter. This year, with Easter on April 21st, Easter travel revenue will be recorded in Q2. Our Q1 non-GAAP revenue growth rate on a constant currency basis and adjusted for Easter timing was about 8%. Advertising and other non-GAAP revenue, which is mainly comprised of non-intercompany revenues for KAYAK and OpenTable, grew by 9% in Q1. Adjusted EBITDA for Q1 was $718 million, which exceeded the high end of our guidance range and was down 10% year-over-year on a reported basis and up about 6% on a constant currency and Easter adjusted basis. Our Q1 adjusted EBITDA margin of 27% after adjusting for Easter was also ahead of our forecast. We remained disciplined with our spending on performance marketing, which helped drive better than expected leverage of 250 basis points in the quarter. While we have seen slowing growth across our performance marketing channels, we continue to see these channels as an effective way to acquire customers, and we will continue to spend rationally to optimize growth. As part of our 2019 growth investments as well as our continued efforts to drive more direct traffic to our websites, we increase our spend on brand marketing in the quarter by 61% versus Q1 last year, contributing to about 250 basis points of deleverage. Sales and other expense line grew with merchant [ph] gross bookings growth and contributed 172 basis points of deleverage, primarily due to the growth of our payment platform on Booking.com. Finally, personnel expense came in lower than our forecast and contributed a small amount of deleverage in the quarter. Our non-GAAP EPS was $11.17, down 7% versus the prior year, adjusting for currency and Easter timing, non-GAAP EPS grew 11% in the quarter. Non-GAAP net income reflected a non-GAAP tax rate of 18.9%, which decreased slightly from the prior year and was higher than our estimate for guidance due to discrete items. Our 8% lower share count in Q1 benefited EPS growth in the quarter. On a GAAP basis, operating income declined by 24% and GAAP operating margin decreased by 532 basis points, compared to Q1 of last year. Q1 GAAP net income amounted to $756 million (sic) [$765 million] or $16.85 per share, up significantly from Q1 2018. Our Q1 GAAP net income included $451 million of pre-tax unrealized gains on equity investments in Ctrip and Meituan. We excluded these unrealized gains from our non-GAAP results. We had a GAAP tax rate of 21% in the quarter, which increased from the prior year, primarily due to discrete tax provisions related to the Ctrip and Meituan gains. Our operating cash flow and free cash flow in the quarter were negatively impacted by a payment for $403 million to the French tax authorities in order to preserve our right to contest an assessment in court, as well as an increase of $48 million of income tax prepayments in the Netherlands. We entered 2019 with approximately $4.5 billion remaining on -- from our $10 billion share repurchase program, which we announced in May of 2018. In the first quarter, we repurchased another $2.7 billion of our stock under the program. And since the end of Q1, we completed remaining $1.8 billion share purchase reauthorization, reflecting both the buying opportunity and our confidence in the business. We ended a quarter with $12.8 billion in cash and investments and $8.7 billion of outstanding debt. With this authorization complete, we wanted to update you on how we're thinking about our capital structure and next steps for capital allocation. We believe that our strong balance sheet is a strategic asset as we look to capitalize on the growth opportunities ahead in our core online travel businesses, and also as we execute our strategy to deliver the full connected trip. Our top priorities are investing in the growth of our business, both organically and inorganically, and having a financial resource to enhance our competitive position, even in the events of a macro downturn. In April, our Board authorized a new $15 billion share repurchase authorization which we expect complete in the next 2 to 3 years, assuming stable business and market conditions. We intend to fund this authorization as well as M&A via cash on hand, cash flow from operations and additional borrowing capacity consistent with maintaining strong investment grade credit ratings. On a related note, as we have deployed more of our cash, we have decided to move $3.6 billion of cash we were holding in euros into our U.S. cash pool. This means, starting in Q2, our 3.75 billion of euro your debt will no longer be fully hedged from currency fluctuations for GAAP purposes. And going forward, you'll these non-cash gains or losses in our foreign currency transactions and other line in our GAAP income statements. The euro-denominated liabilities remain economically hedged by our ongoing capacity generation from euro-denominated operations. And at maturity, we intend to refinance the debt in euros or repay it with euro-denominated cash flow. As such, we intend to exclude these non-cash gains or losses from our non-GAAP financial presentation. Turning to guidance. I want to briefly walk you through some of the factors we discussed on our last call that will impact the outlook for the year, and then I\u2019ll come back to our guidance for Q2. Starting with our growth investments in 2019. As we discussed in detail last quarter, we\u2019re investing for growth, customer acquisition and loyalty. While it\u2019s early days, we\u2019re on target with the launch of our brand campaigns; we\u2019re also encouraged with initial results from some of our merchandising and customer acquisition programs. We continue to expect these growth investments will reduce our EBITDA growth rate by a few percentage points in 2019, and there\u2019ll be a greater negative impact on EBITDA growth during the first half. Moving to payments of Booking.com. Last quarter, we noted that we do not expect any additional reduction in EBITDA and growth from payments this year. We now expect the payments will have a modestly negative impact on EBITDA growth for this year due to change in the timing of revenue recognition on a component of merchant revenue. However, we do not expect any additional negative impact on EBITDA growth from payments for 2020. As a reminder, we believe payments provides important advantages in many areas, including merchandising flexibility, a better customer and partner experience, reduced customer service expenses and the ability to coordinate and merge integrated trips. Now, let\u2019s look at the factors impacting our outlook. Using current FX rates assumed in our guidance, gross bookings growth and revenue growth through to non-GAAP EPS growth will be reduced by approximately 3 percentage points for the full year, which is greater impact than anticipated on our previous guidance due to the reduction in the euro-dollar exchange rate since we last announced. Additionally, the shift of timing of Easter will impact Q1 and Q2 revenue growth rates. Finally, our outlook does not anticipate any change in the macro environment, which as I previously mentioned, remains sluggish in Europe. With that context, it remains our expectation that non-GAAP EPS on a constant currency basis will grow in the low-double-digits in 2019. We continue to expect to gain share in accommodations in each major geographic region, and we\u2019re confident that the strength of our business reinforced by the growth investments we\u2019re making this year, will enable us to achieve this. Let\u2019s now turn our attention to Q2. Foreign exchange rates are expected to be approximately 5-percentage-point headwind year-over-year growth rate in Q2, which we estimate will impact gross bookings, revenue, EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS growth rates by similar amounts. We use a dollar to euro exchange rate of $1.12 when studying our Q2 guidance. The shift of timing of Easter discussed earlier on the call, will positive impact revenue growth in Q2. We estimate this timing shift will increase Q2 2019 revenue growth rates by approximately 2 percentage points. Based on where we are in the quarter and looking at all other factors, and consistent with our usual approach to guidance, we\u2019re forecasting booked room nights to grow by 6% to 8% and gross bookings to be approximately flat in U.S. dollars and grow by 4% to 6% on a constant currency basis. Our Q2 forecast assumes a constant currency ADR for the company will be down about 2%. We forecast Q2 revenue to be up 5% to 7% in U.S. dollars and grow by 10% to 12% on a constant currency basis. Normalizing for both Easter and constant currency, we estimate Q2 revenue to grow by 8% to 10%. Q2 adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $1.295 billion to $1.325 billion, which represents approximately flat year-over-year growth. Normalizing for both Easter and constant currency, we estimate Q2 EBITDA growth also to be approximately flat. We are forecasting modest leverage from the performance marketing expense line in Q2, reflecting lower volumes in the paid channels and our continued focus on acquiring high-quality traffic. We expect to continue to meaningfully grow our brand marketing spend in the quarter, which will contribute to deleverage to the P&L and more than offset leverage we're expecting from performance marketing. Of course, the benefit from brand marketing will be realized over multiple quarters. Finally, sales and other expense growth is expected to remain elevated and continue to grow faster than revenue, primarily due to ramp-up of our payment platform at Booking.com. We are forecasting Q2 non-GAAP EPS of approximately $22.15 to $26.60. Normalizing for both Easter and constant currency, we estimate Q2 non-GAAP EPS to grow approximately 7% to 9%. Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated income tax rate of approximately 19%, which is in line with Q2 last year. We continue to expect our full-year non-GAAP tax rate to be 19% to 19.5%. Our Q2 non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of about 43.6 million shares, which is 10% below Q2 last year. We forecast GAAP EPS between $21.10 and $21.55 for Q2. Our GAAP EPS guidance for Q2 assumes a tax rate of approximately 19%.  We have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our second quarter EBITDA and net income from any further fluctuation in currencies versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter, but the hedges do not protect our gross bookings, revenue or operating profit from the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Our forecast does not assume any significant change in macroeconomic conditions in general or in the travel market in particular. We'll now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Lloyd Walmsley : Thanks, I have two questions if I can. First, just on the performance spend, it looks like it declined again on a year-over-year basis. Can you talk about how much of that was a function of changing ROI targets versus just not seeing the traffic from some of the paid channels or maybe how much was counter revenue from the new acquisition programs? And then, second one, as you look to 2Q, are things fairly stable, anything strange to call out on a bookings and room nights outlook? Wondering if Easter is a bit of a headwind to bookings in 2Q? And then, does your guidance assume deceleration for the remainder of the quarter or any anything you can share that would be helpful? David Goulden : Okay, Lloyd, let me take it in reverse order, so we can remember your first question last. So, relative to Q2 guidance and what we are expecting from a room night point of view. We are -- our April room night growth was actually in line with the high end of our guidance range, to answer your question on deceleration. But that was impacted by a little bit of negative impact from the timing of Easter holiday, so, in line with the high end but with some pressure from the timing of these with that shift. In terms of what have we factored in to our Q2 guidance, our approach hasn't changed. We've obviously looked at the macro; there is some uncertainty out there; Europe continues to be a little sluggish. But, we've taken all those factors into account, and consistent with our private practice that really supports the way we came out with guidance. And then, on your first question on the performance marketing spend, we\u2019re pleased with our share in those channels. Our ROIs were fairly consistent with what we expected them to be. And that kind of drives the leverage that we're seeing in the performance marketing channel. Lloyd Walmsley : And anything just to add in terms of how much -- how material the counter [ph] revenue is from new acquisition programs and merchandising? Maybe you can help us think there. David Goulden : Obviously, as we go through the year, that's going to increase. Q1, nothing specifically material to talk about. We talked about the fact that those investments will ramp during the year. So, Q1 will be the smallest impact as we go through the year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, guys. This is Ben on for Mark. Thanks for taking my questions. Firstly, just on the alternative accommodations. Last quarter, you talked about specifically building out inventory and non-urban and single home vacations destinations in the U.S. Any, like kind of update on the progress there, or any relative performance of U.S. versus Europe performance in the market? And just secondly, are there any kind of preliminary results you can report from the brand marketing campaign, any significant upticks in direct traffic to call out? Thank you. Glenn Fogel : So, we did call out previously about how important we think it is to have the breadth of all types of alternative accommodations. And we marked that in our portfolio, we felt an area we need to grow more was the single property owners. And I'm pleased to say, we continue to make progress there, we continue to grow that very fast, but it\u2019s still a smaller portion of the overall portfolio of alternative accommodations. So, there's room to grow there. In regard to brand, we are pleased with the early, early part of our rolling out the campaigns. And I think in any type of new campaign you need to have some time before you declare victory or not. So, we will say just that it's early, and so far, so good. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks, Glenn. And any comments on kind of how your AA performance has been in Europe versus the U.S. overall, like in general? Glenn Fogel : I don't think we break that out like that. But we've always said how Europe is a bigger portion of our overall business than any other part of the world. And we have pointed out in the past in terms of awareness, that if you went to somebody on the street and said, where can I get a home in the U.S., they probably would not go to Booking.com, but if you're walking in the capital city in Europe, a much higher likelihood that they would say Booking.com. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth from JP Morgan. Your line is open. Douglas Anmuth : I have two. First one for David. If your April was 8% in terms of room nights booked, I was hoping you could give a little bit more color in terms of the guide, 6% to 8%. Is there something that you're expecting over the next couple months or is this just kind of your natural expectation for decel that you've kind of had in previous quarters? And then, Glenn, I couldn\u2019t help but notice that you mentioned opportunistic M&A, I think three times in your script. I'm curious what kinds of things you guys are kind of considering and looking at, any kind of color that would be helpful? Thanks. David Goulden : Sure. Let me go first on the guidance goal, on the guidance comments. Not to repeat what I said, maybe to put a bit more flavor on it. April was in line with the high end of our guidance range. I mentioned we had a little bit of pressure in April from the timing of Easter. When we look at our guidance for the quarter, we haven't changed our guidance approach. We are looking at a number of things that are happening out in the marketplace, and the macro, there's always some uncertainty out there, but not really kind of lays into our guidance, but again our approach to guidance hasn't changed. So, don\u2019t read anything more into than that. Glenn Fogel : And in terms of opportunistic M&A, as you know, we wouldn't talk about any specific targets or anything of that nature. But, we\u2019ve built this company over time by bringing in great teams, great products. And that's what we're going to continue to do. I think the best way to look at this is over the past couple of years of where we've been spending our money, bringing in things that we didn't really have. And I'll just point to our most recent acquisition, which we just closed a couple of days ago, Venga, small acquisition, but it brings in a CRM platform for our OpenTable operation with restaurants. It makes the idea of how we can provide a personalized experience for a consumer, a diner. It makes it much more powerful in terms of the overall restaurant operating system. Now, that is part of our overall strategy of the connected trip. And we talked about this in the past about providing a service, a value to a traveler, there's much more than just going on to a site and booking a hotel. That's what we're trying to do is create all these different things together in a way that provide significantly more value than any single service could do on its own. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Kopelman from Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Kevin Kopelman : Thanks a lot. First, just kind of a follow-up on your last comment there. Can you give us more detail on your rollout of the attractions product? It\u2019s an area where you had kind of a pilot in place for a long time, but we haven't seen that broader product. So, what can we expect in attractions? Glenn Fogel : Sure, Glenn speaking here. So, as you know, we've been building out the attraction business now for a while. We went out and we bought a company called FareHarbor, which provides a backend solution to enable smaller and medium sized attraction suppliers to go digital and get on board. And we talked in the past about more than 100 cities where you can now get attractions. And the whole idea is to create this frictionless, seamless way for a consumer who is using, say, the Booking.com app, to be able to see all the different things you can do in a city because you don't go to a city just to sit in the hotel room or in the home; you do it to do things. And providing this very easy to you frictionless thing where you're provided with a QR code that enables you just to go up to some type of attraction and go through it either it's quicker, because we're offering up something like a skip the line benefit or it's cheaper, and these are things we can do because of our overall huge demand. We can negotiate with these suppliers and get these kind of benefits for our customers that others may not be able to get. That's the whole idea. Now, in terms of rolling it out, we continue to add more cities and more attractions all the time. And I think, you will be able to go to more cities as we roll it out in the near future. Kevin Kopelman : And then, just one other question if I may on -- revenue in the first quarter was a little lower than expected, despite the strong nights? Can you give us some color on the puts and takes there, and to what extent was that impacted by the new merchandising programs? Thanks. David Goulden : Kevin, this is David. Let me take that. I think, that's really more due to the timing on room nights, if you think about it, we were speaking to you last at the end of February. And therefore, the [indiscernible] room nights, it was clearly in the month of March. And those room nights came in later during the quarter. Therefore, they have less of an impact in Q1 and a more of an impact in future quarters. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Justin Post from Bank from America. Your line is open. Justin Post : I guess, as you look at last quarter's bookings and this quarter's guidance of 4 to 6 ex-FX, so more deceleration there. I'm just trying to think about the long-term growth rate. So, could you talk about if there's some unusual factors that you're seeing in 2Q? Obviously the 2% ADR declines. Other things you're seeing? And do you feel, like your growth rate can improve from the 4% to 6% level in 2Q over time from here? Thank you. Glenn Fogel : So, why don't I start Justin, then I'm sure David can add some more comment too. But, so I think, we mentioned a little bit about sluggishness in Europe continues. As we mentioned before, we're bigger player in Europe than we are in other areas of the world. In terms of your point, which is can it improve, certainly, it's not just a macro thing. And I'm going to use that question as an opportunity to, again, lay out what our long-term strategy is. And we believe that providing this better service, stitching together all these different things, really providing something that no one else really can do. And then, layering on that all of the money we\u2019re spending on machine learning experts, using our huge amount of data, our big data analysis to really provide a better thing for the consumer, we believe -- and that's why we're doing this, is that we can come up with something that actually hits inflection point at some point. It really is significantly better to come to Booking.com to do your travel. And that's what we're aiming for. So, you asked me, do I think that's possible? I absolutely believe it's possible, and that's why we're building this stuff. And David, do you have any more? David Goulden : Yes. And Justin, just to kind of drill a little bit more into numbers this year. You've got a couple of things going on. Bear in mind, we didn't guide to the top-line for the year, we did you give some guidance on the bottom-line. But, we do expect to get some additional benefits from our investments as we move throughout the year. That's one of the factors to think about this year, in addition to the longer term factors that Glenn spoke about. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Mark May from Citi. Your line is open. Mark May : I have two if I could. Just kind of curious how much of the slowdown in bookings and also the ADR pressure might be, not so much a macro factor, as it is sort of hotel pricing competition? We've picked up on bookings efforts around early payment benefits and some other efforts that seem more response to sort of pricing competition. Just wondering how much that in fact is to -- accounts for some of the slowdown in bookings and pressure on ADRs? And then, my second question is around the non-GAAP EPS growth in low-double-digits this year. I believe that you talked about share account declines of about 10%. So, is that kind of the way we should be thinking about the non-GAAP EPS growth for this year, ex the buyback, so it\u2019s kind of in the very low-single-digits? Thanks. Glenn Fogel : So, let me talk about the beginning, and you started off by saying -- talking about hotels. I think, we\u2019re going to have to expand that question into price competition in general. And in previous quarters, we've talked about certain areas of the world, particularly Asia, where price competition can be very strong. And one of the things that we talk about is building out that merchandise payment platform for Booking.com, so we could have an ability to compete on price when appropriately, but even more so the whole idea of merchandising. And that's not necessarily just discounting a hotel, which anybody could do, and that may not be the thing to do. What you can do instead is package something. So, for example, we made an investment into DiDi, we made an investment into Grab in Southeast Asia. And the idea is that a customer comes to us and we can offer them up ground transportation, along with the hotel. And on that merchandise platform, we can do different things with the overall price, the overall cost to the consumer in a way that makes it much more advantageous to that consumer to come to us. So, that's the way we'll have an advantage in competing in these areas of high competition. And I'm looking forward to that as we continue to roll that out. And David, I don\u2019t know, is there anything you want to add there? David Goulden : Yes. Well, I think there are a couple things. So, Mark, you asked about the ADRs. I\u2019ll give you bit more color on that. They were down a little bit more than we expected for the quarter. It wasn't really a full form [ph] because that was a fairly important rounding factor. So, it was down less than 1% more than we thought, but there were down for the quarter year-on-year by 2%. And there are two factors that are really almost equal weighting. One was to do with rate and pricing. I wouldn't necessarily say that was rate and pricing pressure that we were creating, just kind of rate and pricing pressure in the marketplace. And the other was geo mix impacts as the some of the higher growth countries or some of the country with the lower ADRs. And then, moving to your question about non-GAAP EPS, constant currency on low-double-digit basis. We clearly are going to get benefit from share account reduction this year. I talked to you about a 10% reduction. That was a Q2 share count reduction. Obviously, we bought very heavily in the first month and that will impact Q2 share count. So, something a little bit less than that for the full year. But bear in mind that we're also making significant investments this year as well. We talked about the fact that investors we\u2019re driving are costing us a few basis points of EBITDA growth rates. So, there are a few different things going on in the income statement this year. But, you need to kind of look at the investments as well as the share account reduction because they both have an upon that growth rate. So, I would say, the good news is here that even though we're making some very significant investments, we're still looking to return low-double-digits and non-GAAP EPS growth constant currency basis in a year when we\u2019re making that that level of spend. Mark May : Helpful. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Brian Nowak : I just wanted to ask a couple about alternative accommodations. Could you just sort of talk about any learnings you've had from commission rate adjustments or take rate adjustments on alternative accommodations? And how should we think about your strategy on take rate, in the alternative accommodation space? And then, for any other areas of investment, I guess, talk to us about how you think about integrating more OpenTable into the platform, maybe driving more attach on non-hotels to the travelers experience? Thanks. Glenn Fogel : Hi, Brian, it's Glenn. So, we\u2019ve talked about the alternative accommodations, the take rates are not dissimilar from hotels. We have commented though that the cost to us for those type of accommodations can be higher than a hotel. And we talked the reason is, one, you can't spread your costs, account costs or other things in terms of getting people on board, as well as you can\u2019t have hotel, because you only have really one property so to speak, to get somebody in the room. Even more so, we've mentioned that the contacts for the customer in the accommodations area is higher usually than for the hotels night and it\u2019s costlier [ph] too. So, the strategy is always, look, you're in a market, you've got a match up the market. And the more demand you have, the more ability you'll have to get the take rates you want. As you get bigger and bigger, and you learn more about how to do the business, hopefully you can lower -- you can leverage and lower your costs across the accommodations area. Along with more technology, it will also help us, like mentioned in the past, as we continue to develop more technology, particularly in the area of using our natural language processing to provide automated responses to the customers, the Booking.com chatbot works so well right now in English. As we can here develop that will reduce that cost portion of the business. In terms of integrating for OpenTable, you've probably heard me talk about this. And it\u2019s something that I'm very encouraged by. And I'm often frustrated that we haven't tried it yet. But I do see it coming out in future, because I always talk about somebody travels, 100% of them are not going to at home. We need to be able to provide a combined package product, something that we're using all the data we have on our customers to provide them with a better, more effective way to give them value. And it\u2019s not just for the customer who's traveling, we\u2019ve got the customer the restaurant side using our OpenTable platform, it's a marketing platform for those restaurant tours. And be able to do that, because we know who the people are, where they're going. We know their habits. Doing that all together I believe is going to provide a significant benefit for our customers. Another reason to make them more loyal to us, make them to come back, more repeat. How fast is that going to happen? I hope faster than it has in the past and we continue to work with the team. So I think we'll see some stuff coming down the road in not so distant future that is encouraging. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan from UBS. Your line is open. Eric Sheridan : Maybe following up on a couple of points made during the call so far. How far along are you to where you want to be on realigning your marketing against your longer term goals? What comes from performance versus direct channels, lining up against direct traffic and sort of loyalty and reward type behavior from your core users and growing acquisition, but also growing retention of spend across users on the platform. Just want to understand how far through that process we are, and what some of the big friction points you're still trying to solve for that you think line up against your broader goals of how to stand and what kind of ROI you'll get from the broader marketing budget? Thanks, guys. Glenn Fogel : Well, in terms of where we are in the process, we think that it\u2019s every day we think where we want to be in terms of the balance between the different ways we're going to spend in marketing, always looking at what's the ROI, what's the long-term benefit that we're getting, what's the return, the loyalty we're going to get out of these people, looking at the data? Historically, we've always been a company that deals with data and what are we getting out of it? Now, it's harder with the brand marketing, and it\u2019s much harder with a new campaign that comes out and you don't have a lot of response yet. So, we're -- as I mentioned earlier, we're early in that. But, we are -- we absolutely believe that it\u2019s important to continue on the path of building out that brand spend and develop that brand awareness, particularly in the U.S. where we believe we under index, so, that people are more aware of the very good service, very good products that we provide to customers and develop the same type of market share that we've been able to achieve in other areas. That being said, competitors are always making their moves. And it\u2019s -- how I use a word I use all the time, dynamic, these markets are dynamic where there\u2019d paid stuff, where there\u2019d be areas and brand, they're always moving and changing. And you're always looking at what everybody is doing and matching against that. I think we're good where we are right now. I'm pleased with the ROIs. And I think we're going to be fairly steady in the near future. Eric Sheridan : Maybe if I could just ask one follow-up. As you\u2019ve seen some of the performance channels evolve, how are you thinking about what they donate to you in terms of traffic and conversion measured against what kind of ROI you're getting? There is sort of a neutral, the declining ROI environment, which you can't sort of abandon them from a volume standpoint, how are you thinking about the puts and takes of some of your performance channels and what they deliver 2Q? Glenn Fogel : I\u2019d say, we look at all factors. When we\u2019re doing -- we're spending on any part of our marketing channel, we're always looking at all the data we get back in every way shape or form. And it\u2019s certainly whether or not this is a good spend, not actually, should we spend more, should we spend less, and also what\u2019s the elasticity at that time, but I'm not going to get into the details of any individual thing. David Goulden : Erick, I\u2019d just add that these channels are all important to us. So, it's not one versus the other. It\u2019s always both. And we acquire new customers through lease channels. And people sometimes move from channels to channels, so there's little dynamic. So just one point, it\u2019s really always a question of and, it\u2019s not a question of or, how we kind of look at these channels? Operator : The next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan from Barclays. Deepak Mathivanan : Great, thanks, guys. Two questions. So, first, somewhat related to the prior one, but on the brand marketing side. Which inning are we currently with respect to the size of the program? Obviously, unlike performance, there is some constraints in how big the program can reach in every market. So ,I mean, you guys are expecting it to grow in 2Q as well. And when do you think we\u2019ll be at a run rate where there's -- these programs are in sufficient scale in your key markets? And then second on -- David, you noted margin pressure from payments is higher than prior expectations for you. Is that driven by incremental adoption of payment offerings on higher volumes or can you talk about some of the primary drivers of that? Thank you. Glenn Fogel : So, I'm going to take the first one. And I\u2019m going to say we don't use words like innings. We're a global company. And baseball is not actually played in much of the world. So, when we talk about it the way you did, I'm going to use football term and we hit the ball. So I\u2019d say, look, it\u2019s still first quarter, first half, depending on which one you're playing, in high school game or you're playing out in a world game. So, definitely first half and maybe the early part of that. There's a lot of things still to be done. And as I said, this is early in terms of getting response. But, I want to commit again that this is an important area we're going to continue to spend. We may have to change things down the road but we're going to go continue to spend. David Goulden : And Glenn, let me just follow up and answer the question on payments. So, let me just recap again what's going on with payments. So, last call, we went through a long explanation on payments in February. And we said we didn't expect any additional reduction in EBITDA growth from payments in 2019. We now expect that this year payments will have a negative impact on EBITDA growth for the year. So what's changed? Nothing's changed in terms of the adoption of payments and the cash flow economics of payments. What\u2019s changed is due to a change in the revenue recognition timing of a component of merchant revenue will not recognize this year. And we expect to start recording some of this revenue again in 2020. So, it's a timing issue of revenue recognition, it doesn't change underlying cash flow economics, it doesn't change the long-term economics. It will impact us in 2019. And that's what's going on. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Naved Khan from SunTrust. Your line is open. Naved Khan : Glenn, maybe you can give us some additional commentary around the macro. Back in Feb when you were on the call, it seemed like Europe was kind of not that great. And now, two months out, is your view incrementally better or how do you view the European macro? And then, I have a follow-up. Glenn Fogel : I'm just going to have to stick to -- it\u2019s sluggish, compared to the last call. Things we've called out in the past seem to be continuing somewhat, Germany and France, the confidence fell. Germany reduced the full-year growth outlook, Brexit. Even though we got off the cliff, it still is something in people's mind. And I think it also hurts confidence in the UK about making decisions. So, I can't say more than we believe it\u2019s sluggish and it's not dissimilar. Naved Khan : And then, follow-up question I had was just on this ADR being down -- percent versus your expectation of I guess being down 1%. Is there some kind of dynamic about trade down in terms of what consumers are booking, are they selecting hotels or places to stay that might not be in the same ADR rate versus previous levels? David Goulden : Not specifically. In terms of the mix impact, which is part of the ADR component, it\u2019s really more a mix impact, it\u2019s impacted by different geographies and where some of the higher growth markets are. Some of the higher ADRs are in the U.S. and Western Europe where -- some of the lower relative growth markets; some of the higher growth markets, places like Asia and country Vietnam have lower ADR. So, that mix impact is a bigger factor than trading up or trading down within a particular local marketplace. Operator : Our next question comes from the line is Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Stephen Ju : So, Glenn, in the emerging markets and Asia where you may be plugging into these super apps to source demand, how much easier or more difficult do you think it will be for you to get users to come directly to Booking or Agoda, so you do not have to pay for those transactions every single time? And second, would you also talk about what's going on behind the scenes between Agoda, alternative accommodations versus hotels, and your push to run your own payments, and how these factors may be influencing your agency versus merchant booking growth? Thanks. Glenn Fogel : So, regarding the super apps, like Grab, for example, I don't know because we haven't rolled out the product yet. And we come up with hypotheses, but we don't have data yet to say how we easy is it to get people to come direct or not. So, I can\u2019t answer that until we start getting some data and then we'll have a much better sense. We just have hypothesis. Regarding Agoda -- and I think you mentioned their home business, the alternative accommodations for Agoda, is that correct? Stephen Ju : I think Agoda versus everything else and the consumer behavior, choosing alternative accommodations versus hotels and you're pushing payments and how that's influencing the merchant bookings growth rate, maybe at the expense of the agency. Glenn Fogel : Yes. So, let me -- so, I\u2019ll talk just about the Agoda payment and I\u2019ll let David talk about payments. So, one thing people may not be aware is that Agoda has an alternate accommodation product too. And unlike Booking where every single property on Booking is instantly bookable, on Agoda in Asia where some of their properties, they're not absolutely instantly bookable. And that is because they're localized in certain areas of Asia where it's important to have some of the product that is not instantly bookable. So, little difference there between the Booking one and the Agoda one. But it's growing nicely, it's much smaller than the Booking.com product, but it is important part, as you probably have seen out in Asia, the growth in the alternative accommodation market is very, very fast. And I\u2019ll let David talk about\u2026 David Goulden : Yes. In terms of payments, the mixed shift that\u2019s going on is driving, and if you just kind of look at year-on-year growth in agency versus merchant booking, that growth has been driven by a mixed shift towards more payments at Booking.com. Both Agoda and Priceline had payment platforms for many years and the mix of payments within their total business isn't dramatically changing. But, as I mentioned, last year, we went from a relatively small percentage a year before to 10% of the TTV, [ph] Booking.com on payments and we expect it to continue to rise this year. We expect it to move meaningfully higher over the next few years as well. But we also continue to believe that our property -- our agency products at Booking.com also remains a very important part of our portfolio. But, the mix shift that you\u2019re seeing and the impact that payments is having as you\u2019re ripping through our income statement is really due to what's happening at Booking.com. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Heath Terry from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Heath Terry : Great, thanks. I realize there's been a little bit of discussion around marketing efficiency already. But, I wanted to dig a little bit deeper into that if we could. For the last -- we went through this sort of six-quarter period or so where you saw significant leverage on your marketing spend. And for the last couple of quarters we started to see deleverage again, just in terms of looking at this in terms of total advertising standard as a percentage of revenue. In the past, when you\u2019ve had that kind of deleverage, it's driven acceleration in bookings growth or in revenue or gross profit growth back when you reported that. Is there a level that you feel like is appropriate or that you're targeting from a growth perspective in terms of what you're willing to accept on that advertising return? Just really trying to get a sense of now that you've gone through this efficiency effort, kind of where your strategy is now or where your thoughts are in terms of optimizing around that growth and advertising return trade? David Goulden : This is David. Let me take that. So, you're right. We basically had a period of time from late 2017, up through Q3 of \u201818, where we had a strategy to explicitly optimize the performance marketing spend or improve ROIs. And you saw some fairly dramatic amounts of leverage as we went through that period of time, for example, Q2 2018 was a great example with over 600 basis points leverage in the performance marketing spend. We essentially lapped the execution of that strategy in Q4 of \u201818. So, from Q4 of \u201818 onwards, it's really been a function of against our now more optimized spend that we feel is the appropriate balance between growth and profitability. What opportunity do we see, how much traffic is being presented to us, where can we find attractive traffic or god ROIs? Our ROI targets from that point of view haven't really changed, the actual ROI themselves, a function what happens in the dynamic marketplaces, the amount of traffic that gets presented to us and where the opportunities are. We always look to try and lean in and find growth in those channels. So we're always pushing for incremental growth those subject to our ROI targets and our ROI returns that we are quite pleased. So, we kind of post the big change in optimization, we\u2019re now into driving more opportunistic efficiency for most channels. And like everybody else, we operate in those channels, where function of how much volume they represent to us and also what the competitive dynamic is in those channels at any point in time. Heath Terry : But it sounds like from what you're saying, the focus is still on efficiencies versus growth, even though you\u2019ve stabilized where -- stabilizing at this level of growth versus the 20% or so that you had before you started this effort, is that fair to say? David Goulden : Well, I'd say this -- our approach to certain channels has been very different from other channels, right? So, for example -- and then, you can see how those channels themselves are in fact responding. Our core search channels are still growing. But we've also experienced declining growth rates with some of those courses of channels as we noted prior. Some of the other channels, some of the major channels and you can look at external results are no longer growing, in fact, quite the opposite way. So, a lot of it is resulting in the dynamic of those channels and the growth opportunities presented to us. Once we lapse our optimization, once we kind of got through our new ROI targets, we really are pushing against growth at those targets. So, we're pushing to -- we are pushing to kind of drive the ROI targets up, if you happen to wind up with our higher ROI during a quarter, it's because the dynamics, what happened within the market. So at this point in time, we are looking to push growth consistent with our ROI target that we feel good about. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente from Evercore. Your line is open. Anthony DiClemente : Thank you. Maybe first for David. One of your competitors reported a deceleration in its alternative accommodation segment\u2019s bookings in the Q1 specifically. And so, I know you don't explicitly break out alternative in your reporting. But, did you see stable growth in alternative accommodations bookings in the Q1, or did you likewise see a deceleration there as compared to the 4Q? And then, secondly, maybe for Glenn, you've talked on this call and in the past about investments in your customers, customer acquisition and loyalty programs. Just can you give me a couple of specific examples of loyalty or customer retention features that are working for you? And just maybe more broadly, what are the things you can do to deliver more value to drive incremental loyalty from customers Booking Holdings? Thank you. David Goulden : Do you want to take\u2026 Glenn Fogel : This one is easy, because we said this several times. Our alternative accommodation business continues to grow faster than our core business. So, that's been going on for a very long time and continues to grow on and we're very pleased with the way we're building out that product. Anthony DiClemente : But relative to itself last quarter, was it -- is it keeping stable growth, is it accelerating or is it decelerating in the year-over-year growth rates versus prior periods? Glenn Fogel : Right, but we don't break out that in that detail to that granularity. Anthony DiClemente : Okay. Glenn Fogel : So, we'll go to the second one, loyalty. Well, you\u2019ve certainly seen some of the loyalty stuff. And whether it\u2019d be a genius customer at Booking.com where you're getting significantly reduced prices for hotel, it\u2019s one way to do it, or you're over at OpenTable and you're getting your dining points and you're seeing that. So, both those we love. I'm going to pick one out, it's small and just starting, we\u2019re just experiment it but I like it is the fact that you cannot use those dining points, and you can instead of using just to get a cheaper restaurant meal, you can use those to get a cheaper hotel room. That's what we are referring. And maybe you've actually seen some of the TV ads going out there, there is actually KAYAK is the one doing it with OpenTable. And that's an example where you can do that. Now, we've been experimenting with some other things, different services that we have in these deals, primarily with the ground transportation. We have a company called Rentalcars.com, which is more than just rental cars. Its ground transportation has a lot of good relationships with different types of ground transportation, black cars, ride sharing, et cetera. And we\u2019re experimenting with different ways to package these services and give that better value to the customer. And I don\u2019t want give too much detail obviously, we're rolling this out now in testing et cetera. And I've also -- you see it in the attractions part. I've actually used that where I've actually -- I booked with hotel Booking.com with my app, and then I got my QR code and I got a discount, all sorts of things to do in a particular city. Those are all different ways. And there are lots more that we're doing. And things are standard, like just the point, which is standard royalty. I think it\u2019s much more creative regarding putting together different types of services into one bundle, and all different things like that. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call over back to your speakers. Glenn Fogel : Thank you. So I just want to say how pleased we were with our solid Q1 results and remain excited about our future as we continue to execute on our long-term growth plans. Thank you very much. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

And now, I\u2019d like to introduce Booking Holdings\u2019 speakers for this afternoon, Glenn Fogel and David Goulden. Go ahead, gentlemen. Glenn Fogel : Thank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings' second quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. We are pleased to report that we produced a solid quarter, with 213 million worldwide room nights booked, which is up 12% year-over-year and exceeded the high end of our guidance range. Our year-over-year non-GAAP revenue grew by 7% in U.S. dollars, but was up about 12% on a constant-currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 5% in U.S. dollars and about 10% when adjusted for FX, which was above the high end of our guidance range for the quarter. We are seeing encouraging signs in our business as we extended our global leadership position and accommodations and continued to execute against our long-term strategic vision of building a connected trip for our customers to become the global leader in travel and experiences. Today, we operate the largest online marketplace for accommodations, with the greatest global reach and scale. In the first half of the year, we produced over $50 billion in gross bookings and over 430 million booked room nights. We're investing against a large opportunity in the global accommodations market and are developing capabilities like payments, merchandising and loyalty, and expanding our focus in important customer and geographic segments. Our objective for payments is to provide all relevant payment options to customers and partners to power a frictionless global marketplace. This will benefit us by supporting key market growth, enable the connected trip, facilitate merchandising, and attract unique supply. To share, Booking.com's merchant transaction continues to steadily climb as customers can now pay Booking.com in over 45 countries, which represents about 80% of its focus markets. Enabled by the rollout of our payments platform, we have been pleased with the early results of our investments and merchandising capabilities. We view merchandising as an important part of our customer value proposition, which we believe will result in increased loyalty to our brand. Focusing on increased customer acquisition, frequency and loyalty, remains a significant growth opportunity for our core accommodations business. In these areas, we are continuing to focus on our mobile experience, expand the reach of our Genius program and offer incentives to bring customers to our site directly. We feel good about our progress here with both mobile and direct bookings going faster than our consolidated rate. These capabilities become more important as we continue to witness slowing pay channels. We are driving a deeper focus on specific accommodations segments that will strengthen the business and we believe will drive greater growth. Booking.com has built one of the largest alternative accommodations platforms, with approximately 6 million listings as of June 30. We are making good progress building greater supply choice in this segment, where we believe we have the best customer experience with all of our properties being instantly bookable with no consumer fees. We are also developing new capabilities to capture growth in other accommodation segments such as business travelers and destination-specific choices, such as ski and beach accommodations. We remain focused on select geographic opportunities such as the U.S., where we are continuing to promote our brand to drive awareness in this important market. We believe it is still too early to fully assess the current brand campaign, but we note that while we see solid direct new business or traffic growth, we would like to see faster progress in this region. In the longer term, we will meet our customer needs by building distinctive capabilities around the connected trip, removing friction along the entire travel journey. An early step was to integrate Rentalcars.com with Booking.com. Not only is Rentalcars.com operating a leading online rental car marketplace, but it is also building capabilities to book all forms of ground transportation. Today, we provide pre-booked car service in approximately 800 cities globally. Another step was to begin building out an attractions offering at Booking.com, which was accelerated with the acquisition of FareHarbor. FareHarbor is bringing more attractions online and now has over 100,000 bookable activities globally. Booking.com is utilizing this platform and to date, offers attraction in over 280 destinations. Booking is also providing the ability to have someone book experience even if they do not have an accommodation reservation. And while the number of destinations where someone can do this is small, as we're just starting out, we expect to grow the number of these markets over time. Attractions are an important part of the connected trip, and we're pleased with the very early data that shows, on average, customers have used our attractions product increase their frequency of combination bookings. Again, these are initial findings, but we like what we see to date. As a group, we have tremendous assets that we can utilize to help build the connected trip, and all of our brands will play a critical role in achieving this vision for the company. Priceline has extensive capabilities in the flight product and has recently developed a world-class packaging product that can be leveraged across our brand companies. Agoda brings extensive knowledge of the APAC region and years of data science and machine learning on merchandising. KAYAK's knowledge at operating a multiproduct global meta business helps us to better understand how to better serve our customers. OpenTable's leading online restaurant discovery and booking platform will be an important piece of our connected trip vision. As I commented earlier, we continue to focus on driving growth in accommodations through key initiatives in merchandising, payment, demand channels and inventory. That is job one. We also remain excited about the connected trip to drive loyalty and engagement across many dimensions of our business, which will help support and grow the accommodation business. As we move through our busy summer season, all of our employees are intensely focused on delivering an exceptional customer experience. I would like to thank our over 26,000 employees around the world for their hard work and dedication, especially during this peak travel season. And now I'd like to thank all of our supplier partners, who we are so proud to be associated with. And finally, we send a great thank you to our millions of customers throughout the world, who are out there experiencing the world. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden, for the financial review. David Goulden : Thank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I'll review our operating results for the second quarter, and then discuss our guidance for the third quarter as well as our focus on the full year. All growth rates are relative to the prior year comparable period, unless otherwise indicated. Information regarding reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Now on to our results for the quarter. Our booked room night growth of 12% for the quarter exceeded the high end of our guidance range. The Q2 room night outperformance was driven by strong growth in June as we saw a greater-than-expected benefit from lapping the low growth rate in June of last year, which was the results of the 2018 World Cup and unfavorable weather in Europe. While the macro environment in Europe remains cautious, our room night growth in the region continued to exceed our expectations this quarter. Room night growth rates for the rest of the world were largely in line with our expectations and continue to grow faster than Europe in Q2. Average daily rates for accommodation, or ADRs, were down about 1.5% in Q2 on a constant-currency basis, which was better than our guidance that's down about 2%. Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced Q2 growth rates in U.S. dollars by approximately 5% versus last year. We estimate the change in FX rates impacted Q2 gross bookings, revenue and EBITDA growth by a similar amounts and EPS growth rate by about 1% point more. Q2 gross bookings grew by 5% expressed in U.S. dollars and grew by about 10% on a constant-currency basis, coming in above the high end of our guidance range. Consolidated non-GAAP revenue for the second quarter was $3.8 billion and grew 7% in U.S. dollars and by about 12% on a constant-currency basis. The shift in timing of the Easter holiday had a little less than a 3 percentage point positive impact on our Q2 revenue growth rate, a slightly greater impact than previously expected. Our Q2 non-GAAP revenue growth rate on a constant-currency basis and adjusted for Easter was about 9%. Advertising and other non-GAAP revenue, which is comprised mainly of KAYAK and OpenTable, grew by 9% in Q2. Adjusted EBITDA for Q2 was $1.4 billion, which exceeded the high end of our guidance range, and was up 5% year-on-year on a reported basis and up about 10% on a constant-currency basis. Our Q2 adjusted EBITDA growth rate on a constant-currency basis and adjusted for Easter timing was about 3%. We remain disciplined with our spending on performance marketing, which helped drive better than expected leverage of about 90 basis points in the quarter. Leverage in the quarter was driven by an increased mix in room nights from the direct channel, which continues to grow faster than our paid channels. While we keep working to grow our direct channel over time, we continue to see performance marketing channels as an effective way to acquire customers, and we'll spend rationally in these channels to optimize growth. As part of our effort to drive more direct traffic to our websites, we increased our spend on brand marketing in the quarter by 41% versus Q2 last year, which contributed about 110 basis points of deleverage. Sales and other expense grew 22% versus Q2 last year and contributed about 80 basis points of deleverage, primarily due to the growth of our payment platform of Booking.com. Sales in other grew slower than merchant gross bookings in the quarter due to lower growth in certain payment-related expenses. Finally, personnel expense came in slightly lower than our forecast and contributed a small amount of leverage in the quarter. Our non-GAAP EPS was $23.59, up 14% versus the prior year. Adjusted for currency and Easter timing, non-GAAP EPS grew 12% in the quarter. Non-GAAP net income reflects a non-GAAP tax rate of 19.4% in Q2, which is about in line with the prior year and our estimated guidance. Our 10% lower share count in Q2 benefited EPS growth in the quarter. On a GAAP basis, operating income grew -- increased by 2%, and GAAP operating margin decreased by 215 basis points compared to Q2 last year. GAAP operating income was also impacted by a $53 million favorable adjustment to revenue and a $66 million unfavorable adjustment to personnel expenses. Q2 GAAP net income amounted to $979 million or $22.44 per share, up 11% from Q2 2018. Our Q2 GAAP net income includes $17 million of pretax unrealized gains from our equity investments in Ctrip and Meituan, and $19 million of FX remeasurement losses on our eurobonds as well as the 2 adjustments impacting operating income. We exclude these unrealized gains, remeasurement losses and adjustments from our non-GAAP results. We had a GAAP tax rate of 18.9% for the quarter, which decreased slightly from the prior year. In Q2, we generated $1.8 billion of operating cash flow, which increased 8% compared to Q2 of last year. Our free cash flow for the quarter was $1.7 million, which increased by 10% compared to prior year. We repurchased $2.6 billion of our stock in Q2, which completed our previous $10 billion repurchase authorization in early May and reduced the amount outstanding under our new $15 billion repurchase authorization to about $14.2 billion at the end of the quarter. We expect to complete this authorization in the next 2 to 3 years assuming stable business and market conditions. We ended the quarter with $11.4 billion of cash and investments and $8.7 billion of outstanding debt. Turning to our guidance. I want to briefly walk through some of the facts, as we discussed on the last call that will impact our outlook for the full year, then I'll come back to our guidance for Q3. Starting with our growth investments in 2019. As we discussed over the last 2 quarters, we're investing for growth, customer acquisition, and loyalty. Our new brand campaigns -- our new brand marketing campaigns were launched earlier this year. And while we're encouraged by the continued growth and mixed shift towards our direct channel and by some of the early new visited direct traffic trends we're seeing from our brand campaigns, the short-term return on our brand spending is running below our expectations. As a result, we plan on refining our spending levels on brand marketing in the second half of the year. We remain committed to building our brand. Turning to our merchandising programs. We continue to see positive results and plan to continue these investments. We are pleased with these merchandising results, but they'll take time to scale. Finally, with regard to our customer acquisition incentive programs, we're seeing some positive results and we'll continue to spend on the programs with better ROIs. As we told you earlier in the year, as we look at these growth investments, we'll evaluate and scale the ones that are working, and we'll not hesitate to pull back on the ones that are not. So we're intelligently refining our investments as we move through the year and are confident that these investments will benefit us in the long term. Overall, we continue to expect these growth investments will collectively reduce our EBITDA growth rate by a few percentage points in 2019. We now expect the return on these investments to be similar in the second half versus the first half, but the spending will be less in the second half, which results in a smaller negative impact on EBITDA growth in the second half. This change in our expectations does not have a material impact on our room night growth for the year. Now turning to the mechanical facts that's impacting our outlook. Our guidance for Q3 and the full year is impacted by the French digital services tax, which we expect will reduce Q3 and full year EBITDA by about $25 million and $32 million, respectively. This will reduce our Q3 and full year EBITDA margins by about 50 basis points and 20 basis points, respectively. This expense will be recorded in our G&A line. Using current FX rates assumed in our guidance, gross bookings and revenue growth through to non-GAAP EPS growth will be reduced by approximately 3 percentage points for the full year, which is in line with our outlook last quarter. Finally, our outlook does not anticipate any change in the macro environment. With that context, it remains our expectation that non-GAAP EPS on a constant-currency basis will grow in the low double digits in 2019. We continue to expect to gain share in global accommodations this year. Let's now turn our attention to Q3, which is our largest quarter of the year. Foreign exchange rates are expected to negatively impact year-on-year growth rates or gross bookings and revenue by approximately 2 percentage points, and for EBITDA our non-GAAP EPS by approximately 3 percentage points. We use a dollar-to-euro exchange rate of $1.12 when setting our Q3 guidance. Based on where we are in the quarter, and looking at all other factors, we're forecasting booked room nights to grow by 6% to 8% in Q3. As a reminder, Q3 last year benefited from the unusually late summer bookings season, which resulted in a slightly higher compare in Q3 this year. We forecast total gross bookings to grow 1.5% to 3.5% in U.S. dollars, and to grow by 3% to 5% on a constant-currency basis. Our Q3 forecast assumes that constant-currency ADRs for the company will be down about 2.5%, which is a greater decline than we saw in Q2 due to lapping of the over 1% increase in ADR we experienced in Q3 of last year. We forecast Q3 revenue to be up 2% to 4% in U.S. dollars and grow by 4% to 6% on a constant currency basis. Q3 adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $2.4 billion and $2.45 billion, which represents 2% to 4% year-over-year growth in U.S. dollars or 4% to 6% growth on a constant currency basis. We are forecasting continued leverage from the performance marketing expense line in Q3, reflecting lower volumes in the paid channels and our continued focus on acquiring high-quality traffic. As we refine our brand marketing spend that begins to comp against a higher spending Q3 last year, we expect to see a small amount of leverage from brand marketing in the quarter. Finally, sales and other expense is expected to grow faster than revenue, primarily due to the ramp-up of our payment platform at Booking.com. We are forecasting Q3 non-GAAP EPS of approximately $43.60 to $44.60. Normalizing for currency, we expect Q3 non-GAAP EPS to grow approximately 18% to 21%. Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated tax rate of approximately 19%, which is lower than Q3 of last year due to a provision of the tax act that was clarified in Q4 of last year. We continue to expect our full year non-GAAP tax rate to be 19% to 19.5% compared with 18.3% last year. Our Q3 non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of about 42.8 million shares, which is 10% below Q3 last year. We forecast GAAP EPS between $42.60 and $43.60 for Q3. Our GAAP EPS guidance for Q3 assumes a tax rate of approximately 19%. We have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our third quarter EBITDA and an income from any further fluctuation currencies versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter, but the hedges do not protect our gross bookings revenue or operating profit from the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. With that, we'll now take your questions. Operator, can we open the line for questions, please? Operator : Yes. Your lines are now open for question. Your first question comes from the line of Kevin Kopelman from Cowen and Company. Kevin Kopelman : Hi. Thanks so much. Can you give us an update on what you're seeing in the environment to start the third quarter, both in terms of room nights growth trends and also advertising ROIs? And help us walk -- help walk us through that comp as you have initially the easier comps on heatwave and then the tough comp later in the quarter. Thanks. David Goulden : Okay. Kevin, let me take that. So I think there's a couple of important things to understand relative to the Q3 guidance. You talked about some of them. Obviously, if you go back to June, we still have the strong guide, strong result in Q2 against relative easy compare. As I mentioned, what happened last year, that delayed summer booking season pushed more bookings into Q3, making a harder compare coming up. I think there's an important ways to step back and kind of look at what's going on across Q1 and Q2 and our Q3 guide because there's been a few normalizing factors. Obviously, Easter had impacts to the positive on Q1 from a room night point of view, and obviously, just the negative in Q2, and then the World Cup and weather has the opposite impact. It helps us to the positive in Q3 and to the negative -- as we said, it's positive in Q2 and then negative in Q3. If you kind of normalize for all those factors, essentially, the normalized room night growth of Q1, Q2, and Q3 projected are all in a similar band. And that's the way to kind of think about what's going on. Obviously, as we move through Q3, the compare gets a little harder because as we said, last year, we saw the majority of the growth in September, but we try and stay away from the kind of enter within the quarter monthly compares and give you a flavor of how the quarter's going to look and just remind you that our approach to guidance hasn't changed. Kevin Kopelman : Okay. Great. That's very helpful. And then if I can ask one other question. Can you just give us an outlook for the digital tax across Europe as you see kind of legislation in other countries, and how you're expecting that to play out? Glenn Fogel : Sure, Kevin. So you saw that France passed the tax, and there are a number of other countries that are also lining up to potentially put a similar tax into effect. We are, of course, very disappointed to have seen this. We believe companies should pay their fair share of taxes, but we want those taxes to be done equitably and fairly applied to all companies. So what has been applied does not do that. It's very hard to guess what's going to happen. You may have seen some of the remarks that have come out of the U.S. administration that we're very against the French tax, that believe it is focused primarily against American companies, and there have even been some remarks by the American administration about tariffs against France as a counter. So who knows how this is going to play out? End of the story is we can't write the laws. We can only lobby and express that we do not believe this DST is the right way to go forward to ensure that people are paying their fair taxes. Kevin Kopelman : Thanks, Glenn. Thanks, David. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Mark Mahaney : I am sorry. I apologies for that. Its on mute. Two things. One, could you just talk about -- the brand advertising, it seems like you're not getting the kind of the results you'd like out of that. And when do you -- is there a time in which you kind of -- is it 2 years? Is it 1 year? You've been experimenting with brand advertising for well over a year. It's possible that the industry itself just doesn't lend itself well to brand advertising, that performance advertising really is the optimal marketing channel. When do you reach that point of go, no go, or maybe it's never that point? But just talk about what's the backstop in case display or brand advertising continues to underperform for you? And then, secondly, if I could ask, just talk about the synergies between accommodations and activities. Glenn, you mentioned it a little bit, but just briefly, are you seeing cases where you're getting customers that are coming in just for activities and you're able to cross-sell them on combinations? Or is it almost entirely go the other way? Just help us think about how much of an opportunity you could face in the next couple of years from the activities segment. Thank you. Glenn Fogel : Sure, Mark. So in terms of the brand advertising, let's say it's a mixed situation right now, but I think we laid it out really when David talked about it. We always want things to do better, but we've always been very clear in saying that we are a company that believes in experiment, test, see results and adjust if things aren't what we want them to be. So we're going to continue to do that. Though, as David said, we are going to be refining going for the second half of the year, in terms of what the spend will be. I do believe that brand advertising has an important part in the overall way to bring customers to us. Particularly, it brings us direct. And we've talked about this in the past how important it is for us to continue to build our direct business. That is one of our key strategies going forward. And I think if you look at some other people in the travel space, you will see that some who have achieved certain positive results by doing brand advertising. And we talked in the past how we believe that as things become more and more digitally based, brand advertising has the potential for being much more effective in terms of understanding what the ROIs will be. So in terms of when do you say, \"Oh, it's not working. Let's stop doing.\" I don't think that's ever going to happen. I think print advertising is always going to be important for anybody who's in the retail business. I do believe that we need to continue to work on this and improve upon it, and I'm looking forward to us doing that. In terms of your second question about the attractions business, we believe that attractions is a very important part of our connected trip. Nobody goes to a city to sit that he hotel. They want to do things. So we believe that providing something that is seamless, frictionless, easy to use and giving people all the information they need to do things, helps provide a better experience in terms of how they are going to get these attractions. We believe that, and we've seen it very slightly right now, and I said they are very early, but we're seeing benefit from people who have bought an attraction from us, achieved a very seamless, frictionless, easy-to-do thing, and for whatever reason, believe that this is the way we should book travel. And they are coming back more frequently. I don't know how big it will be yet, but I do know that we are pleased with the results so far, and we're going to continue to build on it. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're also slowly beginning to roll out the ability to buy attractions separate from having first bought an accommodation. I don't have any data to come back to you in terms of how much that's going to make people in the future come and sort of cross-sell these accommodation to them, but I do believe that by bringing people all the things they need when they travel, make it a one-stop place to shop, and giving them all the things they need, plus all the customer service that you can bring them in case something goes wrong and being able to fix everything at once, because when things go wrong, they cascade throughout the trip, I believe that provides a better result for the customers and one of the reasons that we will be able build greater loyalty. Mark Mahaney : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Naved Khan from SunTrust. Your line is open. Naved Khan : So I just wanted to dig a little bit into the -- into your commentary, Glenn, about brand spending not being as efficient as you had expected. Is that -- are you referencing the spend you have made in the last 1 or 2 quarters? Or is it the spending that you have been making over the last few quarters, and you realized that it's not where you though it would come out to be? And how do I reconcile that with the fact that your direct traffic is still growing faster? Glenn Fogel : Well, I am speaking specifically about the new campaign that we launched at the end of February. And how I reconcile that, the fact that we're still doing well, I guess would be that I'd like us to be doing better. I don't know how else to say that except I'd like to see do better. And again, I'm not saying it's not doing okay. I'm just saying I'd like it to do better. There are certain parts when you look at our brand health metrics that are good, and you look at some that you would like them to be better. As we said, we're always going to test and learn, and this is just another way that we're going to do it. Naved Khan : Understood. And then a follow-up, if I may. On your outlook for the third quarter, what are you baking in, in terms of the macro environment and another Brexit deadlines sort of looming in October? Glenn Fogel : Well, we take all factors when we're putting together our guidance, and we do it the same every quarter. We look at everything we can and put everything into the calculations, and this is what we come up with. I will say that we all recognize that there are some interesting things happening right now that may have some negative impacts on travel down the road. And everything from what you've recently seen, certain of those central banks have indicated that the macro environment may be weakening to certain other parts in terms of unrest between certain countries. U.S., China being a big one, and then, certain local things whether it be in Europe or others. So we've put everything together, and this is the number that we came up with. Naved Khan : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Lloyd Walmsley : Thanks. Two questions, if I can. First, Glenn, you guys have, obviously, strong assets across hotel booking, flight meta search, car rental, restaurants. So when you think about the long-term vision, to what extent are you guys just trying to kind of make the best of the assets you have versus looking at where the product should get to with a clean sheet of paper and kind of building to that vision? And how do you kind of see these things all working together versus maybe building some new things? And what is it going to take in terms of like a tech stack rebuild or otherwise to get there? And then, I guess, just a second one, Glenn, any big changes we should expect at Booking.com as you kind of take the reins as the CEO operating that asset moving forward? Thanks. Glenn Fogel : Yes. So Lloyd, in all things tech, you always would love to start everything with a green field, a clean sheet -- clean piece of paper and do everything with all the newest technology, but nobody ever has a chance to do that. You've already built old things that you now have to retro, refactor, bring things together. The vision is clear that we want to provide our customers with a seamless holistic system that gives and does everything for travel and makes their lives easier and gives more value to them. In certain areas, that's going to be put together fairly easily, and you're seeing it happen already. For example, a simple one, I've talked about it in the past. OpenTable. Now if you use the dining points that you get from OpenTable, you can use those and get a hotel, simple example. We mentioned that Priceline has a great new package product, and we're going to be leveraging that across all of our brand companies. Not that hard to do. Other things are going to require a little more effort, and I can't give you any sort of dollar amounts for investments. I can't give you a time line, but I can say that we have the best possibility, I believe, of anyone to put this together. Scale matters in these things, and we can afford to put the investments and then create this, one. Two, one of the key things to make these systems successful in the end, it's not just the technology, it's all the data you get from all the different parts of the travel ecosystem and put it together, along with the money you've invested and all your machine learning, your AI specialist, who create the personalization that really gives greater value to the customers. So I believe in the end, we have -- I believe we have an advantage over almost anybody. And what was your second question? Lloyd Walmsley : The second question was just, how should we expect things to change at Booking.com now that you're kind of taking the reins as the CEO of that asset in addition to Group CEO? Glenn Fogel : Well, it kind of ties to that first question, actually. One of the benefits that I've had is being part of bringing all the different companies into the group. So I know what they do well. I know where our strengths are, and I know how they can work together. And one of the key things is understanding all the senior management and all the different companies and helping us all work together to create this greater system. So that's one of the biggest reasons. The second reason is I want to bring the execution rate faster. I want to make things happen quicker. I believe that urgency is important in this business, and I want to come and bring this new holistic system to our customers faster. Lloyd Walmsley : All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Justin Post : Great. Thank you. Maybe one short term and one longer term. David, could you remind us your exposure to Brexit? I think that was one of the factors that maybe that were pushed out of 1Q bookings. Just exposure to the U.K. and how you see a no-deal Brexit? And then longer term, maybe, Glenn, this is for you. You beat bookings by $1 billion the quarter, better room nights. Are any of the longer-term initiatives -- I know you said branding maybe not as well, but merchandising is working, really making a difference at this point and give you encouragement on a longer-term basis? Thank you. David Goulden : Okay. Sure. Justin, sure. So let me go to Brexit first. We've not disclosed how much the U.K. is. I think a couple of years ago, we went back in 2016 and said it was less than 10% of our business. And broadly, that's not too bad a data point to think about. What we see happening simply in these situations is around an event people might slow down, and they get nervous. But after the event, they kind of recover. So we saw that in the early part of the year that went. It looked like there was a Brexit going to happen in the early part of the year into the U.K. We saw a bit of a slowdown, then we saw a nice rebound in the market when it looked like that was being pushed off. So I think we do see some short-term sentiment changing around the actual event itself. Obviously, there's 2 factors today. There's what level of uncertainty is great. And then if there's any impact to the currency, does that devalue the pound? Does that make it more expensive for British travelers to go overseas? But generally, our experiences have been short term in nature and they rebound quickly. So it's hard to give a precise number. But as Glenn said, we kind of looked at all those things. Right now, of course, that's looking like a Q4 thing rather than a Q3 thing, but it's something that we're watching quite carefully. Glenn Fogel : And in terms of what our investments to date and what we think that's done in terms of our result, for us, I think we have so much upside still ahead of us. We really haven't started to get the great benefits I believe we're going to get at what we're trying to create and all the things that we're spending money on. And I can give you some examples of things that I see down the road, and they all come together. And we've talked a little bit about attractions already. I believe that is a big win. Not a lot of people are using it yet. Yes, we have over 100,000 different things people can do. Yes, we have more cities, but that 200 and something locations, that's relatively small compared to the world, but even more so the awareness of it. So we're going to be pushing that out. The thing I mentioned about that ground transportation, I believe when you can provide a much more efficient, seamless way to get that ride from your home to the airport, to the hotel, and then to do things, I believe that's going to help increase things. When I look at things like we've talked about our investments in Grab and DiDi, we have not yet rolled out those apps that will enable the people to be able to get around very efficiently using the Booking.com or the Agoda apps. So there's so many things down the road that we have not yet begun to actually see the results in the top and bottom lines. And I am just very encouraged about the future. David Goulden : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Glenn, just to go back to sort of the connected trip and sort of your comments about frequency. You mentioned it a little bit, in the previous question, but we've seen OpenTable partner with Caviar and GrubHub and UberEats. Just talk to us about how you think about potentially using food delivery a high-frequency purchase potentially helping the overall booking business grow faster in the U.S. Is that potentially a way to grow it even better than branded advertising? And the second one, a couple of quarters ago, you gave us an update on the size of the alternative accommodations business. We think it's growing pretty quickly. Any help at all on how fast that business is growing? Or how large that piece is becoming in the overall room nights? Thanks. Glenn Fogel : So let me just do the second part first because that's relatively easy. We haven't given any more disclosure about that. I should say they're still growing faster than our other -- our main hotel business. So that's about the only color I can give you to date on that. In regards to OpenTable, there are really 2 things to think about here. There's the thing I've always talked around the past. The reason we bought OpenTable, and we always joke about it and I say it all the time, that 100% of our customers, when they're traveling, don't eat at home. So this is a great service to provide to them. But the other thing which you mentioned, which is something a little different, and it actually is an important thing, and that is the awareness factor. And if you look at one of the companies that we've made an investment in, in China, Meituan, which really started out with the delivery business, and then moved into the travel business, and using high frequency of food delivery to develop a customer base that was then pushing out of travel, that is a way to help increase the awareness of your travel business. So that is a positive. Now whether better or worse than brand advertising, I don't have ROIs in front of me because we're just rolling it out right now, but I do see that as a way to help increase the awareness of our travel business. And again, also to merchandising opportunities that come to mind in terms of when you have more than one service, you can do all different types of value plays. It helps make people want to continue to come and use your service more often. Brian Nowak : Thanks, Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan from Barclays Capital. Your line is open. Deepak Mathivanan : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. So first one, I wanted to ask about the customer acquisition programs like loyalty and referrals? David, you've noted that they are performing better. Are the ROIs on these programs currently comparable with some of the other performance standards? Or when do you think we can reach that? And then how big are these programs currently in terms of driving transactions? And then the second piece of it, also for David, the 12% room night that you reported was very strong, right about your forecast. Clearly, 3Q, as you pointed, is kind of like a unique quarter. Trends were being strong later last year. So should we think of the 3Q guide in the context of extra conservatism for the uncertainty in the back end that you haven't seen this year? Thank you. David Goulden : Okay. Let me take two those questions, Deepak. So now I commented on the customer acquisition programs. So if you remember, they were one of the 3 areas that we were investing. We talked about the -- a few points of EBITDA growth investments would cost us this year. And there was one of the 3 areas, with obviously, merchandising and brand being the other 2. As I mentioned, we see positive results on some of those programs, not all of them, but we're always moving our spend towards the ones that have the higher ROIs. We're not in a position to make a comparison here between the different brands, but positive ROI compared to our expectations. And then also, for obvious reasons, we're not going to sit here and tell you exactly which ones are working or not either, and you wouldn't want us to either think either as members of our environments. But we're pleased about the ones that -- we rolled out a number of them. We've obviously pulled some back. We've focused upon some. The ones that we are now focused upon are doubling down on we think our ROIs and our driving growth. As I mentioned, the early stages, in totality, these investment programs, they're not making a huge difference to our room night growth this year. I talked about the fact we now expect the returns are going to be more similar across the first half and the second half. So now that's the color I can give you on the customer acquisition programs. Back to Q3 room night guide, I'm not going to repeat what I said on the first -- on the answer to the first question. I've covered a number of points on that, but I think that what you should assume is that our approach to guidance hasn't changed. We cannot look at everything in front of us, and I think we are consistent in terms of how will we call our guidance and what our expectation is vis-\u00e0-vis guidance. I'd say, obviously, these year-on-year compares when you are looking at comparing unusual events make our process just a little bit harder. And obviously, we were pleased to the positive in June, and we know we have a strong compare coming up against us in September. But as we said, we cannot factor all into account, plus the macro things that Glenn talked about, and give us -- and give you our best view of guidance taking those things into account and try to be consistent in terms of how we do that vis-\u00e0-vis our expectations. Deepak Mathivanan : Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Dae Lee : Hi. This is Dae Lee on for Doug. Just a question on reducing friction. You talked about it a lot. And you talked about the ways you could do that across kind of a trip. But looking more specifically on the accommodations side, are there consumer pain points that you think you could help improve going forward? I assume payments help there, but are there other areas where you see opportunity? And then, turning to accommodation. In the past, you talked about wanting to onboard more single unit supply. Could you give us an update on how you're doing there? Glenn Fogel : So in terms of reducing that friction, and you mentioned payments there is a very important area, people want to pay in different ways, but not every accommodation has the ability or even once have the ability to accept payment that way. As you know, Booking.com grew up on an agency platform where the customer paid at the desk, at the hotel, at the end of the stay. That doesn't work so well. If somebody wants to use M-Pesa or Paytm, and I can go through an incredibly large number of different payment methods. We removed that friction. Somebody can come to us and use the payment method they want, and we're then able to pay to accommodation an easy way. So right away, that's removing a part of the friction that goes much beyond that. And so, for example, in the attractions, when somebody has already booked a hotel with us in Booking.com and then goes to get an attraction, I've used the service, and I'm looking at something to do, I just one click, my payment method is already in the Booking.com system. I don't have to do anything else. So when I'm going, I'm just showing a QR code at the place of attraction, and I'm through the line. Much easier. Really removes that issue. And even more so, you can do all friction merchandising we talked about, suppliers that want more demand can offer up to us lower prices that we can then push out to our customers and bring more demand to those suppliers. Lots of ways to play with that. So I think there are all different ways, and I think that's one of things down the road that again will give people a reason to be using our service throughout their travel trip. Regarding single properties, we haven't given any more data about that. But it's doing well. Look, we know how important it is. We know it's critical, to continue to have an incredible breadth of different types of alternative accommodations, and I'm pleased with what's being done around the world on that, but I don't have a specific number to give you on that. Dae Lee : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan from UBS. Your line is open. Eric Sheridan : Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe building on some of the questions from earlier in the call. Glenn, if you look out past 2019 and probably more qualitatively than quantitatively, when you look at the different buckets of investments you're trying to make and you're thinking about some of the yield and the momentum around those investments, what's sort of the medium to longer-term thinking about the investments where, while it might be early to think multiyear, you'd rather lean in and you're seeing better than expected returns. And investors should think of those as areas that are going to continue to be a neutral-to-rising area of focus for incremental investments, and how you think about balancing sort of margins versus the revenue yield that comes from those investments on a multiyear view? Thanks so much. Glenn Fogel : Yes. We always try and maintain a good balance. In any investment we make, we're always looking at what's the return? How fast? And is it something that we should spend more or less on and continue to modify as we go throughout? As you get further out trying to make what you think you're going to end up spending in terms of things, it's very hard to know now, but I do want to give confidence to our investors that our historical record of always being careful with our funds and using it appropriately is something that should give them comfort. That being said, we know that there is a bit of a race for this connected trip. We know that our competitors are trying to build something very similar. We know that people who are very large suppliers talk about being able to bring other services with them, too, and you look at people who may not be considered to be classic competitors of ours, but are very, very big in the travel space, are also talking about putting these things together. Given that, if we see the opportunity to increase spend, if we're getting the return that we like, we may accelerate, but these are things we'll see down the road. Eric Sheridan : Thanks so much Glenn. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Heath Terry from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Heath Terry : Great. Thanks. Just looking at the guidance for Q3, there's about a 300 basis point delta between your guidance for gross bookings and your guidance for room night growth. And we've seen that sort of widening over the last few quarters. Just curious if you can give us a sense of sort of what's behind that? Is it a question of mix? Is it a question of access to specific types of inventory within hotels? Any sort of insight that you could share with us on what's driving that? David Goulden : Sure. So this is David. Let me give you the answer to that. So the main driver in that difference in Q3 is ADRs, which, as I mentioned -- which we're down 150 basis points in Q2 and we're forecasting to be down 250 basis points in Q3. The underlying trends are actually quite similar, but in Q3, you've got this additional compare of a year ago when we actually had a rather unusual increase in ADRs. They're up over 1% year-on-year. So then the real question is kind of what's driving those ADRs in Q2 that are kind of more consistently running into Q3 and excluding that kind of lapping effects. And there's basically three factors that are driving those ADRs. One, is some local rate and pricing pressure, some geo mix factors, where some of the lower ADR countries are growing faster than some of the higher ADR countries around the world. And then, we're also seeing some kind of rate pressure, particularly for people coming into the U.S., where the dollar has been strengthening against the euro in some important destinations like New York and Miami, where European travelers are still going on sort of vacations to those locations, but they may be trading down in the size of the hotel or the star ratings of the hotel that they're moving into because, obviously, the euro has been growing less far in the U.S. So those are the facts that are kind of really driving the 1.5% we saw in Q2. Then you've got this additional lapping factor in Q3 that gives you the difference, which we talked about. Heath Terry : And sorry, I mean if we look at the industry data, ADRs have generally been increasing. And so is this something that you feel like is unique to bookings customer base and just the mix of customers that you have given your heavy European exposure? Or is there something else that's sort of different between the third-party industry numbers that we all see and what you're seeing in your business? David Goulden : Yes. I think it's -- we certainly have some geo mix factors that we have -- obviously, a large percentage of our booking base coming into -- or coming from Europe because we are very global, but we still have a big European presence. And obviously, as the euro has weakened, that has affected some of these factors that we talked about, particularly for people traveling from Europe into U.S. or into other parts of the world like Asia, where currency is kind of pegged more to the U.S. or have done stronger by themselves. So that's what we see happening. I think that the rate that we saw in Q2 is kind of more indicative of the underlying trend that we're seeing. And obviously, to the extent that some of those currency changes start to move the other way, we could see things pick up. But that's what we're seeing. Heath Terry : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Jed Kelly from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Jed Kelly : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Just on the earlier comments on one grow faster in the U.S. region, is that more of a supply issue or trying to penetrate more relationships with property managers? Just how do you view the strategy? And then, on digital advertising, I realize it's harder to extract rental growth in Google, but how do you view your social strategy, particularly with Instagram giving some of the location advertising it's offering? And how do you view your social strategy? Glenn Fogel : All right. So in terms of the U.S., and I wanted -- look, we want to -- the U.S. is a great opportunity for us because we're underindexed. And that's something that we recognize, a need to do better and to try and get more than our fair share is what we always want. And that's many things we want to do. It's not just a supply in the alternative accommodation, that's one small part of the business. It's all areas. It's the merchandising we talk about. It's being able to provide a payment product in the U.S. for U.S. customers that is effective and efficient. There are many different areas, so I see that as all upside for us, and it's something that excites me. The second thing about the social is interesting because in many parts -- well, in some parts of the world, our usual way of getting demand is not effective. There is no Google in China, for example. So you need to have another strategy, and that many things are social. And we do see more and more people using social as a way to make decisions for travel. And we meet with all the key players in different parts of social, whether the people at Instagram, Facebook, Snap, even Twitter, always looking. What is the best way to try and bring customers to our site? What's the most efficient way with a good ROI? And we're working all the time with them. I will be open and say that is not -- the ROIs are not as effective, and it's not as easy to scale yet as some of our other long-term use channels like Google, for example. That being said, we are going to continue work on it. We're going to continue to work with all these different companies because we do believe that this will be an important leg down the road to bring in demand. Jed Kelly : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Lee from Mizuho Securities. Your line is open. James Lee : Thanks for taking my questions. On the room night growth outperformance in 2Q, can you guys be maybe a little bit more specific as to which regions that you guys are seeing strength and why? And also, Glenn, you can comment about this, China outbound travel, what kind of trends are you seeing, especially given the tension between U.S. and China at this point? Thanks. David Goulden : James, this is David. Let me take the first one. I think we're relatively clear where we saw the outperformance versus our expectations in Q2. It was very much in Europe, where we saw most of the impacts from the unusual combination of the unfavorable weather patterns in the World Cup happening in Europe last year. I say that we didn't see all those impacts just in Europe because some -- certain other countries who did well and are very football-centric also had a strong June as well. But the major impact was, again, doesn't compare. The major impact was -- Europe was, in June. And as I mentioned, what's happened now is that we've had lower expectations, lower expectations in both Q1 and Q2 for Europe, but Europe is outperforming in both quarters vis-\u00e0-vis our expectations. But we do recognize that the macro environment in Europe remains cautious. And we all read the same headlines and economic outlooks, et cetera, coming out of Europe and out of the region. But we'd be pleased with our results in Europe at both Q1 and Q2 vis-\u00e0-vis our expectation. I think we were relatively clear as to where that was happening. So hopefully that answers the first part, and I'll ask -- hand over to Glenn to talk about China outbound. Glenn Fogel : Yes. China outbound, interesting situation. I assume you're aware that 2018, for example, was the first time that China to U.S. was an actual decline, not an increase in terms of total number of Chinese travelers coming to the U.S. Our business definitely is impacted by these type of events, such as U.S.-China trade disputes, and then you see things happening on TV in Hong Kong. You read about things happening in terms of people going from China to Taiwan, from mainland to Taiwan, and there are certain restrictions being put in place there. So all sorts of different things that are impacting the outbound business. Our point, though, is China is a great opportunity for the long run. There's, in the long run, going to be a lot more Chinese travelers outbound, so it's important that one doesn't just pull back because of any sort of short-term blip. We have approximately 1,000 people in China working to make sure we're providing great service to the Chinese travelers. And we'll continue to do what is appropriate to build our Chinese business because we do believe that this will be a long-term benefit to our company. James Lee : James Lee : Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Dan Wasiolek from Morningstar. Your line is open. Dan Wasiolek : Thanks for taking the question. Just going back to the connected trip. I can appreciate not giving any specific date, but building this out, is this a few years? Several years? Somewhere in between? And then I think you mentioned earlier in the call that there might be a period where you might choose to maybe accelerate spend or performance spend. So is it reasonable that there might be a period where that happens? Thank you. Glenn Fogel : Well, I think I'll just cover the second part where the way you said it is correct. We may, and it will depend entirely on what we're seeing in terms of performance ROIs and how fast things are being developed. In terms of your first question, I'm not sure if you'll appreciate the answer, but it is the truth, and that this is a little bit like bridge painting. You're never done. You're never done. You're always going to come with new things to do things better. And that's actually the nature of all type of technological services. And you look at anything that has been created, it's never completely done. You're always trying to improve, and that's what the connected trip will always be. That being said, I do believe in the not-so-distant future, we'll start seeing some real benefit from what we're doing. And that will be something that we'll be able to bring to you with some more concrete data. Dan Wasiolek : Thank you. Glenn Fogel : Okay. I want to thank everyone. Once again, I'm going to tell you how pleased we are about our solid Q2 results. And we remain excited about our future as we execute our long-term growth plans. So thank you very much for joining. And with that, I'm going to turn it back to the operator. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

And now, I'd like to introduce Booking Holdings' speakers for this afternoon, Glenn Fogel and David Goulden. Go ahead, gentlemen. Glenn Fogel : Thank you. And welcome to Booking Holdings third quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. We executed well in our busiest quarter of the year as we booked $223 million or almost a quarter of a billion room rights, which is up 11% year-over-year and exceeded the high end of our guidance range. We're pleased that room night growth has been reasonably consistent this year. We produced over $5 billion in revenue and approximately $2.5 billion in EBITDA, which are year-over-year increases of approximately 7% and 8% respectively on a constant currency basis. While we believe these financial results show that we have meaningful size and scale, we note that, against a very large global travel market opportunity, we are still a small share of the marketplace, which means we have substantial opportunity in front of us. I am pleased that our performances this quarter delivered better-than-expected room night growth, driven by solid growth in our direct channel, though I note that we continue to witness slower growth in our paid channels. And while we look to find ways to drive growth through the paid channels, we will remain disciplined and will invest only if we like the quality of traffic and the associated return on investment. We remain firmly in execution mode as we work to deliver against our goal of extending our lead in core accommodations market through key initiatives in customer acquisition, merchandising, our payments platform and improving the selection of properties on our websites. We expect these initiatives to improve customer conversion and drive incremental growth from our existing demand channels. We continued to execute against our long-term strategy of building the connected trip with Booking.com recently launching a flight offering in certain European countries. The launch is still in its very early days and we will continue to make product enhancements and improve the customer experience to create what we believe will be a better offering over time. We remain excited as our long-term vision of the connected trip is being translated into new Booking.com services. We believe the connected trip has tremendous potential to create a more robust travel ecosystem that will result in greater loyalty and engagement for Booking.com's very large active customer base. And it is an opportunity for our large supplier base to merchandise their offerings. In conjunction with Priceline.com, Agoda has also launched a flight product that is initially focused on select countries in the APAC markets, which we believe will complement its existing accommodations offering. I am proud of our inter-brand cooperation development of this product, which demonstrates how we are able to leverage our deep travel expertise across our company to build new services. We look forward to introducing other areas of collaboration across the brands in the future. We are also excited to announce our partnership with Grab is now showing tangible benefits to our customers. One of the goals of the partnership is to give Booking.com app users access to the largest fleet of drivers across eight countries in Southeast Asia, providing our customers traveling in these countries a frictionless experience, removing language and currency barriers. Right now, Booking.com app users can access Grab services in Singapore, and we will be expanding this service to Indonesia and Thailand by the end of the year and to the remaining markets by early 2020. Another point to note about the partnership is Grab previously introduced a connection to hotel bookings through its own Grab app using both Agoda and Booking.com. In our alternative accommodations business, Booking.com continues to build richer content for both its customers and supply partners. Booking.com recently announced a series of new tools and product enhancements specifically designed to help professional short-term rental partners more effectively market and simplify the day-to-day management of their properties on Booking.com's platform. In terms of our listings count, Booking.com's total alternative accommodation listings now stand at over 6.2 million as of September 30. A key goal continues to be improving both the quality and variety of our listings in this area. We are encouraged with the progress in alternative accommodations business and continue to witness growth outpacing our overall business, while maintaining solid profitability. In regards to the overall global travel market, we believe it is generally healthy, but see some mixed results in geographies throughout the world. Europe remains stable, but is still impacted by somewhat sluggish GDP growth, which is consistent with what we have seen throughout most of the year. Southeast Asia continues to grow nicely. However, markets like China, and particularly Hong Kong, are placing pressure on our overall growth rate due to certain macro events.  International travel to the United States has been negatively impacted by a strong dollar.  Like this year has shown, though, our global scale has helped us navigate a tricky macro environment and we remain confident that we will continue to do so in the future. In conclusion, I am very pleased with our performance in the third quarter and we remain confident that the efforts we are making now will support the long-term growth prospects of the company. I want to thank our over 26,000 employees for their hard work and dedication during the busy third quarter, providing unparalleled service to both our customers and supplier partners around the world. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden, for the detailed financial review. David Goulden : Thank you, Glenn. And good afternoon. I'll review our operating results for the third quarter and then discuss our guidance for the fourth quarter. All growth rates are relative to the prior-year comparable period unless otherwise indicated. Information regarding reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Now for our results for the quarter. Our booked room night growth of 11% for the quarter exceeded the high-end of our guidance range. Our room night growth in Europe continued to exceed our expectations this quarter despite a macro environment that remains cautious. Room night growth rates for the rest of the world also exceeded our expectations and grew approximately in line with Europe in Q3. Average daily rates for accommodations, or ADRs, were down about 3% year-over-year in Q3 on a constant currency basis, which was a larger decline than our guidance of down about 2.5%. The year-on-year ADR decline was impacted by decreases in rates within several key markets such as the US, Japan and Hong Kong as well as an increased mix to faster growing, lower ADR markets. The increase in pressure on ADRs we're seeing in the second half of the year is influenced by lapping about a 1% growth in ADRs in the second half of last year and by a number of macroeconomic-driven factors, including less travel in key international corridor due to trade and political issues, as well as the strength of the US dollar. Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced Q3 growth rates in US dollars by approximately 3 percentage points versus last year. We estimate the changes in FX rates impacted gross bookings, revenue, EBITDA and EPS growth in Q3 by a similar amount.  Q3 gross bookings grew by 4% expressed in US dollars and grew by about 7% on a constant currency basis, coming in above the high-end of our guidance range.  Consolidated revenue for the third quarter was $5 billion and grew by 4% in US dollars and about 7% on a constant currency basis. Advertising and other revenue, which is mainly comprised of KAYAK and OpenTable, grew by 12% in Q3. Adjusted EBITDA for Q3 was $2.5 billion, which exceeded the high-end of our guidance range and was up 5% year-over-year on a reported basis and about 8% on a constant currency basis. Performance marketing expense declined 2% year-over-year, which helped drive leverage of about 150 basis points in the quarter. This leverage was driven by an increased mix in room nights from the direct channel, which continued to grow faster than our paid channels. While we'll keep working to grow our direct channel over time, we continue to see performance marketing channels as an efficient way to acquire customers and we'll maintain our approach to spend rationally in these channels. We spent $124 million on brand marketing in the quarter, which represented a decline of 22% versus Q3 last year, contributing about 80 basis points of leverage. As we mentioned on our Q2 earnings call in August, we are refining and focusing our brand spend in the second half of this year. Sales and other expense grew 13% versus Q3 of last year and contributed about 50 basis points of deleverage, primarily due to the growth of our payment platform at Booking.com. Sales and other grew slower than merchant gross bookings at 36% in the quarter due to lower growth in certain payment-related expenses. Personnel expense came in slightly lower than our forecast and contributed a small amount of deleverage in the quarter. Finally, G&A expenses increased 41% year-over-year on a non-GAAP basis. Note that non-GAAP G&A expenses in Q3 last year excluded a $23 million travel transaction tax charge, which negatively impacted GAAP results in the prior year. Non-GAAP G&A expenses contributed about 120 basis points of deleverage in the quarter, driven by a $29 million year-to-date impact from the French digital services tax, as well as an additional $10 million related to travel transaction taxes from prior periods. Our non-GAAP EPS was $45.36, up 20% versus the prior year. Adjusted for currency, non-GAAP EPS grew about 24% in the quarter. Non-GAAP net income reflects a non-GAAP tax rate of 18.8% in Q3, which is lower than the prior year due to a provision of a tax act which was clarified in Q4 of last year. Our 10% lower share count in Q3 benefited EPS in the quarter. On a GAAP basis, operating income increased by 5% and GAAP operating margin increased by 70 basis points compared to Q3 last year. Q3 GAAP net income amounted to $1.95 billion or $45.54 per share, up 23% from Q3 2018. Our Q3 GAAP net income includes $49 million. Our pre-tax unrealized losses on our equity investments in Ctrip and Meituan and $72 million of FX remeasurement gains on our eurobonds. We excluded these unrealized losses and remeasurement gains from our non-GAAP results. We had a GAAP tax rate of 17.5% for the quarter, which decreased from 21.1% in the prior year due to beneficial adjustments made in Q3 2019 related to the tax act that were excluded from our non-GAAP results and from the factors I mentioned that impacted non-GAAP tax rates. In Q3, we generated $1.9 billion of operating cash flow, which decreased 6% compared to Q3 last year. Our free cash flow for the quarter was $1.8 billion, which decreased by 4% compared to the prior year, mainly due to seasonal effects from a higher mix of merchant revenues and the impact this has in the third quarter due to a high concentration of check-ins. During the course of the year, we expect the growth of our merchant business will be a modest positive driver of cash flow. We purchased $1.3 billion of our stock in Q3, bringing the amount remaining under our $15 billion repurchase authorization to about $12.9 billion at the end of the quarter. We continue to expect to complete this authorization in the next two to three years, assuming stable business and market conditions. We ended the quarter with $11.8 billion in cash and investments and $8.6 billion of outstanding debt. Before turning to our guidance, we note that the returns from our growth investments for the year are tracking in line with what we said last quarter and we still expect these investments to impact EBITDA growth for the full year by a few percentage points. Let's now turn our attention to Q4 guidance. Foreign exchange rates are expected to negatively impact year-over-year growth rates for gross bookings, revenue, EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS by approximately 1.5 percentage points. We use a dollar to euro exchange rate of $1.11 when setting our Q4 guidance. Our Q4 outlook does not anticipate any change in the macro environments. Based on where we are in the quarter and looking at all other factors, we are forecasting booked room nights to grow by 6% to 8% in Q4. We forecast gross bookings to grow 2% to 4% on a constant currency basis and about 150 basis points less in US dollars. Our Q4 forecast assumes constant currency ADRs for the company will be down about 4%, driven by the same factors that impacted Q3 ADRs. A number of these factors are occurring in Asia and Asia is a seasonally larger quarter in Q3. We forecast Q4 revenue to be up 1% to 3% on a constant currency basis and by about 150 basis points less in US dollars. Q4 adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $1.21 billion and $1.235 billion, which is approximately flat year-on-year on a constant currency basis. We are forecasting continued leverage from the performance marketing expense line in Q4, reflecting lower volumes in paid channels and our continued focus on acquiring high quality traffic. We expect to see continued leverage of brand spend in Q4. Although we've reduced our brand spending in the second half of the year, we still expect to grow our brand spend for the full year. We expect growth in personnel expenses to reduce EBITDA growth by several percentage points in the quarter due to unexpected lower year-end reversal of bonus accruals than we experienced last Q4. Sales and other expense is expected to grow slower than merchant bookings growth, but faster than overall revenue growth. We are forecasting Q4 non-GAAP EPS of approximately $21.50 to $22 even. Normalizing for constant currency, we estimate Q4 non-GAAP EPS to decrease year-over-year by approximately 1% to 3%. This range for Q4 implies a full-year constant currency non-GAAP EPS growth rate of about 13%, which is in line with our full-year expectation for low double-digit growth. Our non-GAAP EPS forecast for Q4 includes an estimated income tax rate of approximately 19%, which is significantly higher than Q4 last year due to one-time adjustment of approximately $72 million in Q4 2018 related to a provision of the tax act that was clarified by regulatory guidance issued in Q4 of 2018. If we exclude the one-time benefit from Q4 last year, our EPS growth in the quarter will be about 7% higher. We expect our full-year non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 19% compared with 18.3% last year. Our Q4 non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of approximately 42.2 million shares, which is 9% below Q4 of last year. We forecast GAAP EPS between $20.40 and $20.90 for Q4. Our GAAP EPS guidance for Q4 assumes a tax rate of approximately 19%. We have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our fourth quarter EBITDA and net income from any further fluctuations in currencies versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter, but the hedges do not protect our gross bookings revenue or operating profit from the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. We'll now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Mark Mahaney : Great, thanks. Two questions please. Could you talk about whether you're seeing any pressures in SEO channels, whether that's become less viable for you as a source of traffic? And then, Glenn, you talked about paid marketing channels and trying to diversify amongst them. Could you talk about how you do that? I know this is something that the company has looked to do for many years. Just how many options are there in order to do that? Thanks a lot. Glenn Fogel : Hi, Mark. Well, regarding SEO, we saw some headwinds in the SEO channel that did create some modest pressure, but it's a small channel for us. Your second question, I wasn't quite following. I don't recall saying something. So, could you say that again? Mark Mahaney : I think, early on, you talked about paid leads were coming in a little more slowly than maybe you would want it or less ideal. I think this is something that, for a while, you've been looking for faster channels of paid \u2013 high-quality paid leads. Can you just talk about your ability to find those? How do you find faster growth paid leads? Glenn Fogel : Yeah. Okay, I see where you're coming from. Actually, what we said \u2013 I know. I figured out what you're saying. We've talked about this for some time that there has been a deceleration of the paid channels that's been going on for a long time. Now, we'd like to obviously find \u2013 we'd like to find more customers from those channels. My point being more importantly that no matter what we're doing, we're going to try and maintain our discipline and only do it when we see the right ROIs. There's, obviously, lots of things that I want to always work to improve their paid channels, particularly in terms of trying to increase conversion is the primary thing you can do. And there are also things and looking out in different ways where we want to shift the money among the different paid channels. These are dynamic markets, as you know. And what we do will influence what other people do. So, it's always a bit of a strategy game going on. But you've seen our results so far and we're pleased with where we are right now with the paid channels. Mark Mahaney : Okay. Thanks, Glenn. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan of Barclays Capital. Your line is open. Deepak Mathivanan : Great. Thanks for taking the question. So, first, what is driving the outperformance in the Europe room night growth versus your expectations? The macro data points, at least if you look at the industry third-party sources, appear to be sluggish. And also, the commentary from suppliers kind of seem to be the same. Is there a counter cyclicality aspect that's benefiting your room night growth or would you just attribute it to better execution during the quarter? And then, the second question, sounds like the partnership with Grab is off to a good start and is doing really well. How are you planning to replicate similar strategies in some of the developed markets? Are there more partnership-based opportunities that you would look at that? Thank you very much. Glenn Fogel : Sure. So, I don't think we're in the area of counter cyclicality yet. We mentioned at the beginning that we see the travel industry in general around the world \u2013 I use the word generally healthy. So, we're not in an area of recession that would then stimulate some type of counter-cyclicality. So, I think your other point of good execution, I'd like to ascribe a lot of that just to good execution and give a shout-out to our 26,000 employees who are executing very, very well. In regards to the Grab partnership, I agree, I'm pleased with what we're doing there. I like what's happening there. It's, obviously, very small still, but it's growing and going the right way. And as you know, at about the same time we made a deal with Didi. And I mentioned, we're going to bring that one out similarly in the sense of being able to provide a seamless, frictionless ground transportation solution for our customers in China and other places where Didi operates over time. And also, the other way, the same with Grab is being able to expose our offerings of hotel accommodations, home accommodation, all the other things that we're going to offer to the very, very large customer base that Didi has. And, of course, what one wants to do is go out and replicate that in other parts of the world with other players and that's what our affiliate or strategic partnership teams are going out and doing and I'm pleased with the progress they're making in that area. Deepak Mathivanan : Okay. Thanks, Glenn. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Kopelman of Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Kevin Kopelman : Great. Thanks a lot. So, it seems like you've \u2013 last few quarters, you've been settling into a nice kind of stable growth rate recently on nights and top line. So, with that as a backdrop, can you tell us how you're thinking about investments in non-ad operating expenses as you move forward into 2020? Thanks. Glenn Fogel : We've talked in the past about the importance to grow our business, having a balance between the amount of money that we're going to invest to help grow out the future, at the same time maintaining discipline to provide an appropriate bottom line return for our shareholders. We're just going to continue to do that, and that's the way we do it. And we've talked many times about some of the things that we want to build. We've talked a lot about the connected trip and how, we see in the long run, that's the winner for us, the differentiator, the thing that will make customers come back because they will see a better experience, improve the loyalty, lower the amount of money that we have to spend on the advertising spend. These are all things that we are continuing to work on and we're going to continue to maintain that balance. Kevin Kopelman : Okay. Thanks, Glenn. And then, just a quick follow-up on Mark's question about SEO. You mentioned it's a small channel for you. Can you help us put a finer point on that? Is it safe to assume that SEO is a single-digit percentage of your overall revenue? Thanks. Glenn Fogel : I think I'm going to stick with my qualitative term. Small. Kevin Kopelman : All right. Thanks, Glenn. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Lloyd Walmsley : Great, thanks. Two if I can. First, Glenn, you all have made couple of investments in rideshare companies over in Asia. You've got a good history of leveraging M&A. Any interest in making more investments in the rideshare space? There is some public assets on sale. Would it make sense to use some of your capital to do more in the rideshare space? And then, secondly, on the payment side, I think you all have said it's kind of shifted from a drag to neutral and then eventually it will be a tailwind to EBITDA next year. Can you kind of talk about how that will flow through the P&L? Is that just basically higher effective revenue as you start to charge for payments more broadly, offsetting the cost? And then, what kind of profit center do you see payments becoming as the merchant business scales over the next few years and get your rhythm on the payment side? Glenn Fogel : Well, in regards to the first question, I think we're all familiar that we don't discuss potential M&A transactions publicly. So, I'll have to pass on that one. And I'm going to pass over to Dave in turn to talk about how the funds flows work and why the numbers will be what they'll be. David Goulden : Yeah. Lloyd, on the payment side, as you know, there are many moving parts. There are multiple different aspects of revenue in the payment stream and there are multiple aspects of costs. And essentially, as we've discussed, we've been using this both to help the business and as a marketing tool, but also building all the mechanics then to be able to optimize both sides of that equation, revenue and cost as the payment platform builds. So, next year, we do expect payments compared to this year to be a contributor to EBITDA growth. And it will come from both sides, both the higher revenue recovery and also through better cost efficiency as we roll the platform out, as we generate more scale, as we continue to refine the underlying structure of the product. As we said, long term, we certainly view that it can be not only a contributor to EBITDA growth, but also a profit center, but we don't want to quantify that right now. And as we go into next year, we'll probably give you a little bit more color as to how the payments business has progressed as a percentage of our mix, but it's continuing to increase nicely from the approximately 10% of Booking.com we talked about in 2018. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of the Naved Khan of SunTrust. Your line is open. Naved Khan : Yeah. Thanks a lot. Just a couple. So, I think, Glenn, in passing, you had mentioned that maybe the Hong Kong unrest and maybe some travel restrictions in parts of Asia were a drag on the growth. I would think that having a global business like yours, people basically switch destinations if they want to travel. So, on the whole, are you seeing that as still a drag? How does that play out? And then, on the connected experience side, I guess you're testing this on the air bookings in Europe with one or two partners. How do these partners kind of different from KAYAK in terms of how they go to market with you? Glenn Fogel : So, the first one, you're absolutely correct in terms of a global company like ours, we do get some benefit when one particular area becomes a place that people don't want to travel to, there will be a certain portion that will shift to another place and we will get that business. That being said, another percentage of that business will unfortunately not travel. They had a specific reason to travel to that region or they just decided that they just didn't want to travel. That's what they wanted to do and now they're not going to do it. So, there is a drag even though we are global. And I'll point out that some of the areas which we mentioned in the last Q are still going on. The China outbound to the US is still down from where it was a couple of years ago. That is a drag. We had good business there. Certainly, we've all seen on TV what's going on in Hong Kong and that also is a drag on the economy. And there are other places like that. So, while we enjoy the benefits of a global business, there is no doubt that we would do better without these types of problems. In regards to your other question about air in Europe, we have been experimenting with lots of different ways. KAYAK is one of the ways in the past. We had a click out to part of a company called Etraveli that was \u2013 their offering was called Gotogate. And we now have a more accomplished, more fulsome relationship with Etraveli and doing a much more true integrated seamless type air product. The difference between doing a matter [ph] with KAYAK and having it actually integrated as a true OTA offering enable us the connected trip. You see it was all that data that we get from the actual conversion, all the booking data, all the things the person is doing to be able to offer them some seamless and \u2013 we like to talk about \u2013 holistic offering. So, one of the benefits with something like this is you can offer connected trip car rental or other types of ground transportation much more efficiently. And I would point out, just as a separate, and this is not related to the air product because that is relatively recent, but one of the things I'd like to see \u2013 I like that we've seen recently is what's going on in our rental cars business. And if you look at the statistical summary at the end of our release, you'll see that this recent quarter, we've had a nice uptick in that car rental, and that is partially due to the connected trip. Well, we are now offering that car rental much more connected with our Booking.com accommodations customers. So, that's another one of those instances where I see the connected trip beginning to come to fruition and see what we really can do. Naved Khan : That's great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my questions. Hey, Glenn. I have two. So, the first one, sort of a bigger picture question to you. You sort of talked about how you're witnessing slower growth in paid channels for a little while now. You guys look at so much data, you have such good visibility into the market, why do you think that's happening? Is it because you're seeing a deceleration in people coming online and why is that happening? Are you seeing fewer clicks to bid for? What do you think is driving this? And what do you think could cause a reacceleration in paid channels over time? And then, the second one on the alternative accommodation business. Any update or help on sort of how big that business is now and how to think about its contribution to growth from a room night perspective? Thanks. Glenn Fogel : So, talking about the paid channels, certainly, as people went online years ago, there is a much larger number of people I think who were \u2013 particularly in the area that we really have some of our sweet spot, Europe and other developed areas, people jumped online and they went to these paid channels. A lot of those people are already there. Now, you start going to other areas of the world where people are going online, but they may not perhaps go to some of our traditional paid channel areas. I'll give you a perfect example. We talk a lot about China is a great opportunity for us for the long run. Google does not operate in China. So, all those new people coming online to buy travel, we've got to find another way to get them. So, that would be an example. And there are other places like that. So, I think that's probably the primary reason for it. Whether or not this will reaccelerate, let me know if Google is going to start having a full service in China, in other areas. That's one of the things that we know it's \u2013 in the end, what's most important for us to get customers to come to us directly. We've talked about this a lot in the past. It's one of the things that I think is very important. For us to have our own future is to create a service that is so wonderful, so good that people just naturally will come back to us directly. And we will not be dependent on other \u2013 we will not be as dependent on other sources of traffic. What was your second question? Brian Nowak : Alternative accommodation. Sort of how to think about \u2013 any help on its sizing from a room night perspective or contribution to growth in the quarter? Glenn Fogel : Well, we continue to talk about how it grows faster than our core hotel business and we're pleased about that. In terms of actual sizing, we gave you some data a couple of quarters ago. We're not updating that right now. And in terms of the overall industry, there is a lot of data around the world. And I'll say the swing from the people who give the lowest estimates to the people with the highest estimates is a pretty wide range. So, I wouldn't even attempt to try and come up with which one or where is the exact true number. We know it's a big business and we know it's an area that's important for us for the future and that's why we continue to devote time, resources and money to it. Brian Nowak : Great. Thanks, Glenn. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Stephen Ju : Thank you. So, Glenn, I'm wondering if you can elaborate a little bit about how the operating environment in Southeast Asia may be changing, especially as it regards to Agoda? You've been there for some time now. And it seems like around you, online connectivity, adoption of e-commerce and payment frictions are all coming down in the region, which conceivably should serve as tailwinds. Are there any structural constraints that you can see that may slow the rate of adoption of online travel in the region? And secondarily, just wondering how the consumers there behave. Is there a greater propensity to buy packaged products versus hotels and air ticket separately, which may be informing your decision to, I guess, invest in what is more of an intermodal product? Thanks. Glenn Fogel : So, I would say that Asia in general is one of the opportunities for us for a very, very long time to continue to build out our business and have good growth. And one of the ways one can look at that is Boeing and Airbus both put together some very detailed \u2013 10-year projections, I believe, they are. And even further perhaps. And you just look at the number of planes that they are going to expect to be delivered there. Another way you could do it is look at the number of airports being built in the region. And those things all show that travel is going to continue to be a growth industry in that part of the world, one. Two, the different ways that people buy in Asia \u2013 and Asia, obviously, is somewhat of a generic term. It's different in different countries. What happens in Japan is very different than, let's say, what's happening in Vietnam. But there are some similarities that I would say that we look at. And one is that price is very, very important. It is a very competitive world out there in terms of price. Also interesting, and I think we're all familiar with this is that many people who are just coming online are skipping desktop entirely. Everything is lived on the phone and that's very, very important. The next thing is the super apps that are prevalent there are very important in terms of how you're going to try and get busy. If you're not part of one, you're at a disadvantage. I would also say that it's not just the super apps, but you see people who go to many different apps to compare price because price \u2013 actually download numerous different travel apps and then go through each one. Not the most effective or efficient way to find out what the lowest price is, but people do do that. These things are really important. And I would say that it's something we're going to continue to do. David, anything else you \u2013 David, do you want to add anything? David Goulden : Yeah. The only thing I'd add is that, whilst alternative payment methods are certainly something that's a function that's happening, you see it happening around the world, you see more of them in Asia. And the ability to transaction in multiple currencies, pay-in, pay-out in different currencies, particularly pay-in for the travel point of view in alternative payment methods is a factor that is more prevalent in Asia than elsewhere. Glenn Fogel : Absolutely correct. People in the developed areas of the world use credit cards, people in developing worlds are using all different payment products and it's very important that we be able to use every single one because our customers are used to using those. They want to use those. And if we don't have them, they'll go somewhere else. Stephen Ju : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post of Bank of America. Your line is open. Justin Post : Thank you. A couple of questions. It looks like pretty good ad leverage in the quarter. Just how do you feel about the advertising situation as you look forward as far as your ability to drive direct traffic and need to spend and maybe ramp up the brand campaign again? And then, second on ADRs, obviously, a headwind in Q4. Are there any events or areas that really showed an inflection in ADR growth and something that would tell you this is very temporary and could rebound? Just wondering how to think about that for 2020. Thank you. Glenn Fogel : So, I'll talk about the advertising. Dave, you can talk about ADRs. So, in terms of brand advertising, and I've talked about this in the last quarter, I would like us to be doing better. We are not spending as much at the beginning of the year I may have thought we would have. But as I've always said, we're going to be careful with our shareholders' money. We're not going to spend blindly. We're going to always test and learn. And if I don't see the results the way we want them, we're not going to spend until we get it right. So, I'm a little disappointed where we are. That being said, it's okay. It's not terrible. It's just not as great as I would like it to be. I am very pleased that we have a new CMO at Booking.com. He has been there for just a few months. And I am looking forward to working with him very closely to come up with better creative and better campaigns in a way that we will achieve greater results for our brand marketing. And that brand marketing is not only TV brand marketing. It's video. It's all of the different things that one does in terms of producing a good brand campaign and I'm looking forward to doing this going forward. David Goulden : Yeah, Justin. Thanks for the question. I'll give you a little bit more color on what's going on with ADRs because there are a number of factors. I mentioned a couple in my prepared remarks, but let me give you a little bit more flavor. So, in the third quarter, constant currency, we saw about a 3% decline; in the fourth quarter, expecting about 4%. When we look at that, about half of that decline is due to lower rates in key countries. And the ones I call out would be US, Japan and Hong Kong being the largest contributor to that piece of it. And about half of the decline is due to a mix shift towards lower ADR countries away from higher ADR countries. Now, some of that is affected by macroeconomic factors and those are impacting both rate and mix, and I'll describe what they are and I'll give you a flavor as to how we think they're actually playing out relative to just underlying trends. So, for example, less China into the US is impacting ADRs in the US with less inbound international travel. So is less and less expensive travel from Europe into the US due to the strong dollar. So, factors driving US ADRs on the right level. Less travel from South Korea into Japan is impacting ADRs in Japan. And, of course, travel into Hong Kong generally is down considerably that impacts both occupancies and ADRs there. But these economic factors are also impacting mix as well. They don't only impact rate. They impact mix, with less travel into high ADR markets \u2013 I mentioned US and Hong Kong \u2013 and more travel to some of the lower ADR markets, for example, other markets in Southeast Asia. So, you kind of put it all together and there are many factors that are impacting these global ADRs. It's difficult to be exactly precise, but we estimate about half of what we're seeing in the second half of this year is driven by external macro factors and about half of it is due just to underlying changes in our business. And remember also, we're comparing against two quarters where we saw unusual ADR increases last year. So, you kind of put all that together and you say, adjusted for that compare, our constant currency ADRs are down about 2% in Q3, about 3% in Q4, and about half of that we can attribute to macro external factors that should normalize over time. Justin Post : Great. Thank you, David. Thank you, Glenn. Operator : Another question from the line of Douglas Anmuth of J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Douglas Anmuth : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Glenn, I just wanted to ask if anything has changed just in terms of your role as you're Booking.com CEO as opposed to the CEO of the overall group, if anything has changed or just how you're thinking about the business? And then, any early learnings around the flight offerings in some of the newer geographies that you're in? Thanks. Glenn Fogel : So, I'll answer the second one first. The flight thing is so early. It's literally just a couple of \u2013 there is nothing to be said about that yet, but I hope to be able to talk more about it in the future. In regards to the new role being both the CEO of Booking Holdings and Booking.com, we talked about that in the last call. And one of the things I pointed out was, because of my experience in bringing all of the companies that are part of this organization in to be part of what was originally just priceline.com and knowing all the management teams and knowing what's good and what needs some help and where the strengths and weaknesses are and personalities of the management teams, I felt that I would have a better opportunity to try and bring together the company closer and help us work more efficiently with all of our assets. And I'm pleased to say that I love the way things are beginning to come out the way it's good for our customers and our suppliers and our shareholders too. And I pointed out, in my prepared remarks, that Agoda and Priceline working together created that flight offering for Agoda right now. And I mentioned a little bit of the nice thing that we're seeing in our car rental business where by integrating rental cars into the Booking.com operation, beginning to see some upticks there. I can go on and on. And I mentioned how we're going to have more of this cooperation come up with new services because the connected trip requires us to be able to use all of our assets together.  I've always talked about the reason why OpenTable was not because we just wanted to have a reservation system, a restaurant reservation system, but because we know every single customer traveling needs to find a place to eat because they're not eating at home. And by putting these things together, all the data we have from the travel part, all the things we know about what they like in terms of where they like to eat at home from OpenTable and creating merchandise offerings to these customers in a holistic seamless way is just a much, much better experience than going from site to site to site. We have a center in Tel Aviv that has a whole bunch of machine learning experts, AI geniuses who are coming up with different ways to put together the different offerings. And we're going to continue to push that forward and that will create \u2013 and I said it earlier tonight about the differentiated service that will be able to bring people back with more loyalty, to enjoy a better experience than is being experienced before. That's what I'm so excited about. And seeing it to start come to fruition is just thrilling. Douglas Anmuth : Great. Thank you. Operator : Another question from the line of Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line is open. Eric Sheridan : Thanks so much. Maybe a few follow-ups on some of the topics you've talked about on the call tonight. In terms of avenues of investment on the marketing side, how are you differentiating between driving desktop traffic versus mobile traffic? And within mobile, web versus app? And where you're seeing the highest ROI as you think about some of those channels across investing versus driving conversion? And then, going one layer below to conversion, what are sort of the big differentiators you're seeing that drive higher conversion when you do see traffic to your properties? Is it the payments mechanism? Is it depth of inventory, especially shared accommodations? Or is it some of what you talked about on the experiences in the local side that might be areas where you want to invest additional layers to drive more conversion as we look out not only end of this year, but out over the next couple of years? Thanks so much guys. Glenn Fogel : Well, we're not going to disclose much in terms of where we're putting the marketing money and which ones are giving us the best ROIs. I think you'll understand our reticence to do that. In terms of conversion, I haven't actually done \u2013 looked at the data, but I'm going to make a bet that the thing that gives the highest conversion is having a great price. That's probably the number one thing that you can improve conversion is to offer a better price. I'm not sure how much more detail I can really go into here. I'll defer if there's anything you want to add, David? David Goulden : No. Conversion is a multi-faceted fact. Obviously, people look for choice. They look for companies. They look for support. They look for quality reviews. They look for just the quality and the trust of the site and the products and there's a lot of good data science that goes on behind testing all those and they all have a factor. Good news is that there are many levers that we can pull to continue to improve conversion. And as Glenn said, price and value are key ones of all. Glenn Fogel : And I'll just add to what David said. And one of the things again that you'll \u2013 that we do do and I think it is one of the advantages of being a very large player who can afford lots of data scientists and there's been a lot of money in trying to figure out what is the best personalization for a traveler and whether this person has come before or even not, but we know something about cohort. To be able to really offer them something that is what they want to buy and that's something that's very important because if you just throw up a search result that has no relevance to what they really want, you're not going to get much of a conversion. But because of the data we have, and we have more data probably than most any other travel player around, we use that in a way to make sure that we're offering up to our customer what they want and that's how you can help create that higher conversion. They're happier. It was an easy way for them to get what they wanted that builds the loyalty, they come back, we get more data. And again, circling back to the connected trip, the more we learn about our customer, the more we're able to then present to them all the things they wanted to know. If it's a leisure trip, what other things do they need. If it's a business trip, what things do they need. And that is just such an advantage of a smaller player and it's an advantage over any individual supplier in the travel ecosystem because they only see a small portion in their data of what the person was. So, even the largest hotel chain doesn't know anything about their customer in terms of what sort of ground transportation they want or what sort of restaurant reservations they like to make or what kind of air they generally want to do and what kind of attractions they want. That's the advantage that a full OTA like us has. Eric Sheridan : Great. Thank you. Operator : Another question from the line of Heath Terry of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Heath Terry : Great. Glenn, I guess at some level this is a little bit more of a philosophical question, but it relates to the answer that you gave on the brand ad spend question. But you grew revenues 4% this quarter. It wasn't that long ago that the company was growing 25%. Given the margins you're generating and what you're spending on buybacks, it's clearly not a question of resources. Are the incremental returns on investment that bad? Are you okay with long-term growth at these levels? Or is there a path back to 20% growth that you could see the company getting to? Glenn Fogel : Well, I don't want to go to any specific number, but I do believe that it's important we create services that people want to come back enough that we can accelerate. I'd like to do that. That's part of the reason we're making these investments. And I think in the long run, the thing is creating that great service that gets us loyalty from the people who currently come and keep coming and then creating that brand marketing of us, if you'll know about this better system and come to us and then use it. It's one of those things that, in these network economies, that when you create something that really is differential and better, the uptick can be very, very rapid. So, hopefully, and I believe we will be able to do this, creating these better services, creating this better experience, being able to provide an opportunity for all of our suppliers, this incredible breadth of suppliers in all different parts of the travel ecosystem, offering them an opportunity to reach out to our customers in this merchandising ways, different packages, different types of prices, different types of value and being able to present it to, on the other hand, our demand side which is so huge make it so much better that then creates that flywheel effect and have it start cranking up again. That's what I'd like to see. Heath Terry : Okay. And is there \u2013 anything you can add just sort of on what you are seeing in terms of the incremental returns in the areas of investment, particularly on brand advertising? As a percentage of sales, this is the lowest you've spent in, I think, nearly three years. Given how important you've called out driving direct traffic is, I guess, I'm just surprised that you haven't tried to push that a little bit further? Glenn Fogel : Well, I guess \u2013 and you asked for philosophically and I'll go back to that then. Philosophically, I'm against wasting money. And I want to make sure that we're getting the return for the money we spend. And again, our brand campaigns are fine. They're just not as good as I'd like them to be. So, when I say I'm disappointed, I'm not saying [indiscernible]. I'm just saying they're not as good as they could be. Some of the brand health metrics that we've seen have been good. Some have not been as good. I am very excited though about our new CMO. He had nothing to do with the old campaigns. These are new things that we're working on now and I'm looking forward to seeing some good results in the future with him. Heath Terry : Okay, great. Thanks, Glenn. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Brian Fitzgerald of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Brian Fitzgerald : Thanks, guys. You talked to these questions, but maybe I just want to parse out a little differently. David, you highlighted direct traffic is growing faster than paid. And, Glenn, you talked to the importance of \u2013 a number of times on the call, the importance and the continued focus on direct traffic. How would you assess the magnitude and/or the quality of your direct traffic and the initiatives that you're exercising there? How much runway or leverage do you feel you have to execute against getting more direct traffic into you? Thank you. David Goulden : Brian, in terms of just quantification, just to recap, I think everybody knows us, but we've been clear that, for a while, direct traffic has continued \u2013 has been over 50% of our bookings and continues to increase from that data point. So, that's where it is from a sizing point of view and continues to move nicely each quarter. I don't think we have \u2013 for the capital and where we think that can go, there will always be a mix. We think that's \u2013 as we said, the performance channels, albeit growing more slowly, are a very efficient way for us to capture new customers and we like what we see there. When we see growth opportunities, we lean into them and we think it's a combination of both. And then, of course, as Glenn said, the more we build, the better flywheel, the better the conversion will be from those performance-led customers into direct customers and repeat customers. So, that's the way the business now operates, but there's not really a lot of new data to give you other than reiterate the points that we've already made. Brian Fitzgerald : Great. Thank you, David. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Jed Kelly of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Jed Kelly : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just on one. In the US, how do you view the opportunity of sort of getting more for by owner or that inventory that's a little \u2013 has a little more friction and bringing that over to your side or would that help your brand campaign in the US? And then, any commentary on Ctrip investing in TripAdvisor? Thank you. Glenn Fogel : So, we've talked in the past about how we think we are under indexed in terms of the single property owner in the US. We know that's an area where we need to add inventory to have a fully competitive source of inventory against people who want that type of a place to stay. And we came to work on that. Obviously, we have a lot of different ways that we try and bring people on to the site and get \u2013 make it less burdensome to have people come on. That's something we're going to continue to do. It's blocking and tackling. And we're slowly building it out. So, that's the best I can say there. It continues to grow as we continue to add that type of inventory into the website and the inventory. In regards to the Ctrip deal that we saw announced, we continue to create partnerships ourselves. And we have a good partnership with Ctrip and they sell our hotels and we make money and we're happy about that. We also, though, said an agreement with Meituan, which is Ctrip's big competitor and we have good business and we have a good relationship with them too and we have a relationship with Didi, which is another Chinese player. And we have \u2013 as you know, we invested in Grab, as I talked about earlier, and we've put an investment into another APAC player, Serko, down in New Zealand. So, we continue to make those kind of investments and partnerships. It is not surprising that our competitors or other people in the space would also be thinking about doing those type of deals, et cetera. And I don't begrudge anybody who wants to improve their own position. That is the obligation of any corporation, to try and improve their business for their shareholders. And I suppose that's what they've done, but I have no details exactly about what the deal is. So, I really can't comment on the specifics. Jed Kelly : Thank you. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of James Lee of Mizuho Securities. Your line is open. James Lee : Glenn, is there any way you can give us an update on your current transition to the merchant business model here and what is the coverage now relative to total market at this point? And maybe help us understand which regions you're seeing success? And do you also expect US hotel partners to adopt this model soon? And just curious, given the slowdown in the market, is this business model giving you the price control to help you to be more resilient during the current environment? Thanks. Glenn Fogel : Well, let me talk about the resilience in the travel business in general. In the past, when there have been slowdowns, the distributors have achieved greater success because of the need for the suppliers to get more customers. So, that is something that we believe will happen again when and if there is a true slowdown. As I pointed out, the industry is still, I believe, generally healthy around the world with pockets that we've described earlier. I do believe that, in the long run, the growth in the industry will continue to exceed GDP by a few points and that is the way we always plan it out. So, there's going to be always some ups and downs in the long run. But, yes, we may gain a little more when there is a recession. And when occupancy rates are very, very high, there obviously is less need for a distributor like us. But in the long run, we'll continue to provide greater services and greater benefits to both sides of this two-sided marketplace that will allow us to achieve the success that we think we should. And, David, anything about the merchant stuff? David Goulden : Yeah. James, on merchant \u2013 and, obviously, just to clarify, the shift we're talking is the kind of rollout of the merchant platform of Booking.com at Agoda and Priceline and we do a lot of business on the merchant model already today. Booking.com, we continue to make progress. We gave you a data point a couple of quarters ago as to how many countries we're live in. We're continuing to add to that. We're continuing to add merchant capabilities in the US and make those available to a wider range of our property partners here as well. So, continuing to grow, as I mentioned earlier Mix increasing from 2018, but we're not going to give you a new data point on that just yet. At some point in time, we'll give you an update. So, we're pleased with how that is progressing and we're pleased with how it is giving us some additional flexibility in the business. And, of course, it's very important to underpin a lot of what Glenn talks about with the connected trip because if you want to really have a connected trip, you want to also be able to connect and aggregate the way that you pay for that and also be able to do things around packaging, pricing, payments, et cetera, through \u2013 and the merchant platform provides a mechanism for that as well. So, we are pleased with it. It's making progress today and it will be a bigger driver for us in the future. James Lee : All right. If I may ask a follow up question, Glenn, maybe help \u2013 give us an update on your view on China. I know you've been bullish for a long time. Now, given the fact that looks like global payments happening in China that allow you to work with Didi as a way to provide additional service to Chinese consumers domestically. And maybe help us understand what other steps that you're taking to improve your service. Is it more the customer segment type of strategy where you feel you have an edge in certain segment or consumer within China or is it more of the blanket strategy to go after big TAM in China specifically? Thanks. Glenn Fogel : And we've said this many times, how important China is in the long run. And, yes, there are some economic headwinds in China right now that have impacted travel in general there. And, certainly, we've talked a little bit earlier about some of the outbound impacts. We have a multi-leg approach and we do everything from building out our own brands there to partnerships with OTAs, like Ctrip or Trip.com as it's now known or Meituan or ground transportation like Didi or many other B2B players where there is places where we can get customers. We have almost 1,000 employees in China. We are doing all different types of brand marketing and other ways to try and to get people to see our services and get people to come to us directly. Or as I just said, we also get customers through the B2B method too. I will emphasize, though, China is a very competitive marketplace. And we have to always be trying to create the best services with good prices to be successful there. But we're going to continue to develop and work there because we do know that, for the long run, we need to create something that will be \u2013 something that the customers in China will want to use. And I'm pleased with where we sit right now. And I hope we continue to grow in the future. Glenn Fogel : So, thank you, everybody very much. I'd like to say that we're pleased with the quarter. We're excited about the future. And we look forward to talking to you again in the New Year. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

And now, I'd like to introduce Booking Holdings' speakers for this afternoon, Glenn Fogel and David Goulden. Go ahead, gentlemen. Glenn Fogel : Thank you. And welcome to Booking Holdings fourth quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. We had a strong fourth quarter as we booked 191 million room nights, which is up 12% year-over-year and exceeded the high end of our guidance range. We produced over a $3.3 billion in revenue and approximately $1.3 billion in EBITDA which are year-over-year increases of approximately 5% and 3% on a constant currency basis respectively. I will talk first about our full year performance in 2019. Then about our objectives for 2020 and then I will address the current situation regarding the coronavirus. 2019 was a good year for our company. We booked 845 million room nights for the year, which is 11% more than in 2018. Just to put that in context, that means we booked on average more than 2.3 million room nights each day. We produced strong year-over-year growth across our key financial metrics. Non-GAAP revenue and adjusted EBITDA were up 8% and 6% on a constant currency basis respectively. Our non-GAAP EPS was up 15% on a constant currency basis exceeding our guidance for the year. Our EPS growth rate benefited from over $8 billion of share repurchases during 2019, which demonstrates our disciplined approach to returning capital to shareholders and our confidence in our business. I am pleased with these results considering the macro environment we faced in certain geographies throughout the year. Moreover, we accomplished this top line growth rate, while also producing solid leverage in our performance marketing spend. Our ability to execute consistently in this environment speaks to our scale and global diversity, as well as to the dedicated and talented teams we have at our company. We made solid progress against our key strategic goals for the year, expanding the Booking.com payment platform, improving our alternative accommodations business and further building our connected trip strategy. As we move into 2020, we will continue to focus on becoming an even more customer-centric company that drives loyalty and increased repeat behavior. We plan to accomplish this goal through smart customer acquisition, while providing the best experience in our core accommodations product using our scale to offer the best value to our customers and making further progress in our connected trip strategy. In addition, while we have always been a cost conscious organization. In 2020 we will further emphasize the need to make sure our expenses are appropriate for our revenue and we'll look at ways to streamline and make all aspects of our company more efficient. Investing in products and processes is important for the long term, but so too is eliminating unnecessary expense. And during 2020 we'll be taking a close look at these opportunities. One of our highlights during 2019 was expanding our payment capabilities at Booking.com over 50% of our Booking.com gross bookings now occur on properties that are enabled on its payment platform. The percentage of Booking.com and gross bookings processed on its payment platform grew from approximately 10% in 2018 to over 15% in 2019 and we expect this to reach approximately 25% in 2020. As we have discussed, this platform provides payment options favoured by both our customers and property partners, particularly non-hotel property partners and provide a platform for merchant product offerings. Merchant offerings also provide Booking.com with merchandising capabilities and we expect to continue to increase our investment in this capability to drive growth. This payment platform is foundational for our connected trip strategy in which we envision a frictionless customer experience across multiple products that we believe will drive increased loyalty. Our alternative accommodations business grew solidly in 2019 and has large scale. As of December 31 2019 we had 6.3 million listings in our alternative accommodations business. We remain focused on increasing the quality and variety of properties joining our platform so we can provide the best choices for our customers and drive search conversion. Booking.coms alternative accommodation is recorded approximately $3.1 one billion in revenue in 2019, representing approximately 21% of our overall revenue for the year and a solid growth rate of 14% when expressed in euros. It consistently grew faster than our core accommodation business throughout the year and also maintained a healthy profit margin. We believe presenting both alternative accommodations and traditional properties on one platform is the best customer proposition. Last year we took further steps to create our vision of a connected trip. We are on a journey to build a multi-product offering, including accommodations, flight attractions, ground transport and dining all connected by a seamless payment network and supported by personalized intelligence to provide a frictionless customer experience that we believe will drive enhance loyalty and support growth. We saw early signs of these benefits last year as we leverage the integration of Rentalcars.com and Booking.com to deliver a better ground transport offering for Booking.coms customers. Rentalcars days grew 12% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the increased cross-sell of the product to Booking.com customers. We believe we are in the early stages of seeing the benefit from this cross-sell opportunity. We've also been encouraged by certain incentive programs that provide discounted ground transport options to bookings to bookers with higher value accommodations. These programs have shown an increase in conversion at acceptable ROIs. We look forward to further experimentation with these types of offerings during 2020. We also expanded our flight capabilities across the company in 2019. Booking.com launched an integrated flight product, while Agoda and Priceline began building a global flight platform that is initially focused on the APAC region. Currently Booking.com offers of flight products in 12 countries in Europe, but we plan to expand this throughout 2020. Booking.coms goal for the year is to be able to expose 50% of its total customers to a flight product globally. Developing a robust flight product remains an important investment considering there are more than 4 billion global flight passengers last year. Having the ability to engage with these customers early in their travel journey gives us a better opportunity to cross-sell our accommodation and other products, but even more important it enables us to offer a true connected trip experience. This year we will continue to expand other aspects of a connected trip such as attractions and dining options. For these offerings, we will utilize not only our own assets, but also partner with third party providers so we can offer the best customer experience possible. We continue to see loyalty benefits from a combination customers who also use our attractions product. We will continue to invest in our app platform as it becomes the center of our connected trip experience. Booking.com remains one of the most downloaded travel apps in the IoS and Android stores globally. According to a leading third party research firm, Booking.com was the only Oti to rank in their top 10 travel apps in the world, ex-China in 2019. Coming in at number three. We've been investing in the app platform for some time and it is becoming the preferred platform for travel bookings and we are very pleased with the strong room night growth that occurs on Booking.coms app. As I mentioned earlier, all of these investments are designed to drive greater royalty and increase repeat behavior with our customers. We made progress on this front last year. In each quarter of 2019, our direct channel grew faster than our primary paid channels and our direct channel increased its share for the year. The direct channel represents over 50% of our total booked room nights and when including rooms booked through branded search terms, this number increases to over 60%. We have a large and loyal customer base today, but we believe we can grow this further and increase market share. Booking.com is the best and most loyal customers are part of its Genius program. This group of customers has grown consistently for several years. In 2019 we had over 70 million active Genius customers, an increase of 9% year-over-year. These Genius customers were responsible for a growing proportion of Booking.coms booked room nights in 2019, and we thank them for their loyalty. On top of that, we see that Genius customers book more frequently and more often on a direct basis when compared to non-genius customers. We will continue to focus our efforts on growing this special group of customers and offering them great value as part of their Genius membership. While we are pleased about our long term prospects, we recognize that current travel demand has been impacted by the coronavirus. At the present time, Greater China has been affected the most. The broader APAC region has also been impacted, which is an area in which we\u2019ve been experiencing strong growth over the last several years and we are now starting to see a slowdown in travel globally and are aware of the potential for further demand deceleration around the world. David will provide more details in his remarks. But I would like to point out, this is not the first time our company management team has faced an exogenous impact to travel demand. We know that travel is fundamental to people's lives and we believe travel industry growth will rebound to prior growth rates. While the coronavirus impacts travel, we will continue to manage the company in a measured way that builds value for the long term. However, the steps we are taking today include, one, making sure we take care of our customers and help them with their travel plans, which includes facilitating cancellations and working closely with our supply partners. Two, ensuring the health and safety of our over 26,000 employees around the world. Three, managing our marketing efforts appropriately. We will continue to participate in those paid channels that provide us quality traffic and attractive ROIs, recognizing that we need to incorporate higher cancellation rates in our bidding calculations. In regards to brand marketing, we will be very cognizant of when and where brand marketing money should be spent this year. Four, working with our travel supplier so they are best positioned to achieve success on our platform and five, continuing to invest for the future. The company that provides a better travel service, a holistic, seamless, frictionless connected trip that delivers more value to both a traveler and our supply partners will create a lasting relationship with both travelers and suppliers and we intend to create this service over time. With that, I will now turn the call over to David for the financial review. David Goulden : Thank you, Glenn and good afternoon. I\u2019ll review offering results for the fourth quarter in 2019 and then discuss our thoughts on 2020, our guidance for the first quarter. All growth rates are relative to the prior-year comparable period unless otherwise indicated. Information regarding reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Now onto our results for the quarter. Our booked room night growth of 12% in Q4 exceeded the high end of our guidance range, as growth accelerated through the quarter with a strong finish in December. Our room night growth in Europe continues to exceed our expectations, despite that we continue to exceed our expectations in Q4 despite a macro environment that remain cautious. Room night growth rates for rest of world also exceed our expectations and grew slightly faster in Europe in Q4. Average daily rates for accommodations ADRs were down about 4% year-on-year in Q4 on a constant currency basis which was in-line with our guidance. As indicated on our last earnings call, the year-over-year ADR decline was impacted by decreases in rates within several key markets, such as the U.S., Japan and Hong Kong, as well as an increasing mix to faster growing lower ADR markets and the impact of lapping 1% ADR growth in Q4 of last year. Changes in foreign exchange rate reduced Q4 growth rates in U.S. dollars by approximately 1 percentage point versus last year. We estimate the changes FX rates impact to gross bookings, revenue and EBITDA growth in Q4 by similar amounts and EPS growth by less than 1 percentage points. Q4 gross bookings grew by 6% expressed in U.S. dollars and grew about 7% on a constant currency basis coming in above the high end of our guidance range. Consolidated revenue in the fourth quarter was $3.3 billion and grew by 4% in U.S. dollars and about 5% on a constant currency basis. Advertising and other revenue which is mainly comprised Kayak and OpenTable grew by 3% in Q4 as we lap the benefit of the hotel combined acquisitions in December. Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 was $1.3 billion which exceeded the high end of our guidance range and was up 2% year-over-year on reported basis and about 3% on a constant currency basis. Performance marketing expense increased 2% year-on-year which helped drive leverage about 40 basis points in the quarter. The year-on-year growth was driven by higher than expected volumes in our paid channels. We spent $86 million on brand marketing in the quarter which represented a decline of 31% versus Q4 last year and contributed about 130 basis points of leverage. This decrease is in part driven by a ramp up in spend in the second half of 2018. We remain committed to investing in brand marketing in a disciplined manner going forward. Sales and other expense decreased 1% versus Q4 last year and contributed about 30 basis points of leverage due to reduced chargeback expenses, as well as a reclassification of certain sales and other expense - a certain sales and other expenses incurred during 2019 inter contra [ph] revenue in Q4 both of which offset the increase in expenses related to continue growth of our payments platform of Booking.com. Personnel expense was in line with our forecasts growing 16 % year-on-year and contributing about 175 basis points of deleverage in the quarter, as expected driven in part by lower at year end reversal of bonus accruals than we experienced in Q4 2018. G&A expenses increased 16% year-over-year on a non-GAAP basis which excludes a $21 million travel transaction tax charge in Q4 of 2018. Non-GAAP G&A expenses contributed about 60 basis points deleverage in the quarter, this year-over-year increase in G&A was driven largely by a higher indirect taxes, including the French GST. Finally, information technology expenses increased 42% year-over-year driven by several items supporting the growth of business, including payments to contractors, software license fees, outsource data center and cloud costs. Our non-GAAP EPS was $23.30, up 4% on reported and constant currency basis versus the prior year. Non-GAAP net income reflects a non-GAAP tax rate of 17.7% in Q4 which is significantly higher than Q4 last year due to a onetime adjustment of approximately $72 million in Q4 2018 related to a provision of the Tax Act that was clarified by revenue guidance issued in Q4 2018. Our Q4 tax rate was about 1 percentage point lower than our guidance due to some discrete items. 9% lower share count in Q4 benefited EPS growth in the quarter. On a GAAP basis offering income increased by 3% and GAAP operating margin decreased by about 50 basis points compared to Q4 last year. Q4 GAAP net income amounted to $1.2 billion or $27.35 per share, up 81% from Q4 2018. Our Q4 GAAP net income includes 360 - $326 million of pre-tax unrealized gains, equity investments in Metro and Ctrip and $47 million of ethics FX remeasurement losses or euro bonds. We exclude these unrealized losses and remeasurement gains from non-GAAP results. We had a GAAP tax rate of 17.5% for the quarter which increased significantly from the prior year due to the tax impacts of the items excluded from non-GAAP results, as well as the factors I mentioned impacted non-GAAP tax rate. In Q4, we generated $1.1 billion of operating cash flow which declined 1% compared to Q4 last year. Our free cash flow - cash flow for quarter was about $1 million [ph] which decreased by 1% compared to last year, mainly due to timing of a payments which reduced year growth by 15 percentage points. We repurchased $1.3 billion of our stock in Q4 bringing the total repurchases to the year to over $8 billion. As of the end of the year we had about $11.5 billion remaining under our $15 billion repurchase authorization. We ended the quarter with $11.8 billion in cash and investments an $8.7 billion of outstanding debts. Looking back at 2019, we are quite pleased with our performance during the year, as we produced steady room night growth in the 10% to 12% range. We delivered a very healthy 39% EBITDA margin, while investing in the business and absorbing unplanned DST expenses and we grew non-GAAP EPS by 11% or around 15% on a constant currency basis which exceeded our annual guidance of low double-digit growth. Turning to 2020, our initial outlook reflected a continuation of this operating model, i.e., to gain share and accommodations with some deceleration in room night growth, to invest in payments merchandizing and the connected trip for any modest pressure on operating margins and for EPS growth to benefit from our share repurchases. Duet to few mechanical factors, including the lapping of ADR declines and the phasing of personnel and G&A expenses during the year, we expected our earnings growth to be weighted largely to second half of the year. Now turning to more recent events. The coronavirus has had an impact across our business since it made news headlines on January 21st. The early impacts were increased in China, but we also saw these impacts across Asia and to a lesser extent in other regions outside of Asia as well. To help context, the APAC region represents a little over 20% of our room nights with no single country accounting for more than mid single digit share of total room nights. In APAC we've seen an increase in cancellations, reduction in new bookings and pressure on ADRs. As you will know, it's not possible to predict where and to what degree outbreaks of the coronavirus will disrupt travel patterns, while the incidence of infections has slowed in China, in the last week alone new outbreaks have occurred in South Korea, Iran and Italy. We've been able to measure the impacts on our business so far in Asia and we've seen our recent impacts our room night booking in Europe following the outbreak in Italy. As a result, we're providing only a near term outlook with a wider guidance range to account for the possibility that will be a growing travel disruption in Europe. Based on where we are in the quarter and considering the continued impact of the coronavirus, we're forecasting Q1 booked room nights to be down 5% to 10% versus the prior year. Clearly, we're dealing with a very fluid situation and it's extremely difficult to predict where Q1 will come out. But this is our best estimate based on all the data we have available now. We forecast total gross bookings to decline 8% to 13% on a constant currency basis and about 200 basis points more in U.S. dollars. Our Q1 forecasts assumes that constant currency ADRs of the company will be down about 4%. We forecast Q1 non-GAAP revenue to decline 3% to 7 % on constant currency basis and decline 200 basis points more in U.S. dollars. Q1 adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $560 million and $590 million, which is down 16% to 20% year-over-year on a constant currency basis and about 20 basis points more in U.S. dollars. We're forecasting Q1 non-GAAP EPS of approximately $9.05 to $9.65 which is 14% to 19% below Q1 2019. On a constant currency basis, we estimate Q1 non-GAAP EPS to decrease year-on-year by approximately 12% to 17%. Our non-GAAP EPS forecast for Q1 include an estimated income tax rate of approximately 18.5%. Our Q1 non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count about 41.6 million shares which is 9% below Q1 of last year. We forecast GAAP EPS to be between $7.95 and $8.55 for Q1. Our GAAP EPS guidance for Q1 assumes a tax rate of approximately 18.5%. We use a dollar to euro exchange rate of a $1.10 when setting our Q1 guidance. We have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield of first quarter EBITDA and net income from any further fluctuations in currencies versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter. But the hedges do not protect our gross bookings revenue offering profit from impacts of foreign currency fluctuations. Finally, a housekeeping item. Starting with our Q1 results and going forward. We plan on reporting our performance and brand marketing expenses on a combined basis, as we view our overall marketing spend as an investment in customer acquisition and retention. We\u2019ll now take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Presenters, our first question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Lloyd Walmsley : Thanks. I guess just the first question a bit of a clarification. I think David you said something about you know, sustaining, expecting some share gain with deceleration in room nights. I wasn't sure if I heard that correctly, is that kind of before the impact of the virus or including the impact of the virus? And you can kind of share there and along the same lines ex the virus, are you seeing anything in particular changing with marketing ROIs as some competitors pullback in certain brands, in certain geographies. And then I guess a second question if I can with just the anything particular changing with regard to you know some of the SEO channel impacts from last quarter, are you seeing that spread to either new geographies or change in intensity? Anything you could share that would be great? Thanks. David Goulden : Sure, Lloyd. Thank you. Let me start of answering the first question, so yes to clarify what I said was when we turn to 2020 we talked about our initial outlook which is our outlook for - at the start of the year. Obviously around the times we're putting our plans together for the year. We talked about that reflects a continuation of the same operating model we delivered in 2019. So my comments about gaining share in combinations with some deceleration room nights, some modest pressure on operating margins and for EPS to benefit from our share buybacks was give you a flavor of the shape of our profile for the year coming into the year before the coronavirus. And then on the on the SEO challenges, to pick up your second. I just want to kind of remind people that as we said the SEO channel is a relatively small part of our business and has been for a period of time. You know, the SEO channel continues to be under pressure as the primary provides that channel, focus more upon that that - they're paid search, rather than research. But we continue to do well in that channel. We have teams dedicated to it. We are pleased with our share in that channel. As a channel it is under continued pressure as we said before, really contributes a very minor part of our overall business. Lloyd Walmsley : Okay, and then anything on just marketing ROIs outside of the impact of the virus are fairly competitive dynamics? David Goulden : Yeah, we saw that many things. Again, I'll talk about Q4 because obviously Q4 was a very clean quarter relative to not having a virus and it's only a few weeks behind us. So I think it's a good time to still talk about Q4. We were pleased with our ROIs in the channels in Q4 we didn't see any major shifts. We mentioned we saw continued leverage in our performance margin spend because our performance market channels continue to grow less rapidly than the overall business. So the leverage that we demonstrated was kind of mix driven leverage or mathematical leverage. ROIs didn't really change very much in Q4. Nothing to really note, we're pleased with where we were. And I think was that the genesis of all your question or you're also asking about current quarter as well. Lloyd Walmsley : That's great. I\u2019ll assume that virus is making things pretty messy, but unless you want to add something? David Goulden : No, I just wanted to \u2013 I stop there, I think that's the right place to stop. Lloyd Walmsley : Great. Thank you. Operator : We do have another question from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC. Your line is open. Mark Mahaney : Thanks. I want to ask about two things. This kind of attach rate with the connected trip and how far along you think you are in tapping into that opportunity. I noticed that both Rentalcars days and airline ticket growth - unit growth rates you know nicely accelerated in the December quarter, it looks like that's much easier comp and airline tickets. But you know you called out some kind of greater cross-selling opportunities you're getting with Rentalcars. So just talk about how - where you are in the process of doing that, is it you know a small percentage that you've even attempted this at so we can get a sense of how much better the results could be in Rentalcars? And then Glenn when you were talking about the outlook, you seem to emphasize a little bit more streamlining costs in 2020. I don't think that was related to coronavirus. I think it's - or maybe it was, but I don't think it was, sounded like you want to take - be a little bit more careful about costs or something like that, could you just explain the why behind that, why get a little bit more focused on streamlining costs this year versus last year unless it was all coronavirus, but I didn't get that impression? Thanks, Glen. Glenn Fogel : Hi, Mark. Yeah. Let me take the first one the attach rates et cetera. And I think you called it out correctly. The Rentalcars business has shown some good numbers. If you look in the supplemental statistics at the end of our press release and you can see some nice growth there and part of that growth is coming from that cross-sell part of our connected trip that we're building out. And you're also correct in your statement about the air business, air business so early, we just really are getting that up and running. That's right you're not really seeing any of the increase there from that or not enough to matter right now. It's very, very low attach rates. When I look at those numbers I believe over time we should increase those significantly and it's going to take some time as we continue to optimize what's the best way to present it, where to show it. One of the things I'm very proud about is the center we built in Tel Aviv, that is filled with a bunch of machine learning experts A.I. geniuses who really look at all the different parts of the way we present things and they're trying to come up with what is the best way to present an offer to a traveler at the right time and putting in what is the right merchandising benefit that we should do it, to get the right conversion and the right bottom line. It's something that the more data we get, the better we'll know what the right thing to do. But it's something that's going to take time. So that's - that's the answer to that one. Regarding costs, you're also absolutely correct on that. One of the things when I took the job over in Amsterdam, as CEO of Booking.com and I've been there now a little more than six months, is looking at what are we spending on, where we're spending, what projects are around, which ones are the right ones, which ones should we not be doing right now and then taking that throughout our entire organization. Now I've always believed that you should be a cost effective company and I believe it's also very natural as companies grow very rapidly and achieve great success on the bottom line. Sometimes discipline lightens up a little bit. So certainly before the coronavirus I was already thinking that we need to make sure that we're doing everything we can to spend money correctly. One of the things I've mentioned in the calls over the last couple of quarters is us bringing all of our companies together better. And that's one of the benefits that is to get some efficiencies in our spend, a real cost procurement type project. And in the past we've run all these companies independently and that was the right thing to do at the time. But while doing that you do lose out on some cost efficiencies. Now the state of the company where it's at, now it's time to start bringing that in and that's what we're going be doing. David Goulden : Okay. Thanks, Glenn. Operator : We do have another question from the line of Kevin Kopelman from Cowen. Your line is open. Kevin Kopelman : Great. Thanks a lot. Could you give us more color on the latest trends in Europe travel bookings that you've seen over the last few days following the outbreak of the coronavirus in Italy? Thanks. David Goulden : Yeah, Kevin. This is David. Let me take that. That's just can maybe frame it in the way that the quarter shapes up and our projections do take into account what we've seen in the last few days. So let me kind of give you a lay of the land first of all by region not surprisingly we already mentioned China is the worst impacted, Asia excluding China has also been impacted for some time. The rest of world obviously includes Europe and Europe's a big piece that for us was growing through February but we also expected to be impacted to the negative in March as well. To give you a bit more color and some just how it plays across the quarter on a consolidated basis we saw we first of all remain in January - reignite growth in January even though we saw some tapering off at the end with the virus hitting the news on the 21st. Expect February to be approximately flat from a row - from a growth rate point of view and therefore to get to our guidance for the quarter expect to see declines in March. Kevin Kopelman : Got it. And so that March expectation is based on just the worsening kind of trend over the last few days? Glenn Fogel : Yes. I mean we really - obviously as other mentioned we're dealing with a very fluid situation very difficult to predict what's going on cause we're responding to something that we have no control over. We're giving you our best view of it. So when we built what we expect to happen in March and create the guidance range, we're looking very specifically at what's happened over the last few days after the outbreak in Italy and the response we've seen in Europe in response to that which is not surprising it has been negative. So yes, we are expecting - we're seeing even though we're going to get room night growth through rest of world in February towards the end of February that is already in decline. We expect it to continue to decline into March. Kevin Kopelman : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Justin Post from Bank of America. Your line is open. Justin Post : Great. Thank you. A couple of questions. I guess, it would be helpful if you could give us a view on past behavior when you've had travel disruptions and people cancel their trips or your most loyal customers don't book. How long does it take before they start going on trips again or do you see a timeframe where people cancel and then and then rebook. I know you can't be too specific, but any thoughts on that. And then second it's interesting your main competitor pulling back spending, you're talking about some cost savings. Do you think there's inefficiencies in marketing or other channels in travel and maybe the industry as a whole could benefit as people take a deeper look at their costs? Thank you. Glenn Fogel : Hi, Justin. I think he'd be - it would not be wise to try and use past experience as an analogy for what will happen in the future. The situation now is very different, say I've not been in this business, in fact this week it will be 20 years I've been at this company. My anniversary is Friday in 20 years. And so I've seen a lot of exaggerate factors I mentioned them impact travel some extremely severe and I won't go through all of them because of the entire time for the call. That being said, they all have different effects and different rebound time periods. So it's not going to be helpful for me to tell you what took after 9/11 or after the GFC or after swine flu or after the volcano in Iceland. I mean I could go on and on and on which I'll stop there. So I really can't be that helpful. And you'll just have to make your own best guesses admits which will be as good as anybody else's guesstimates. Regarding spending, we have very high margins compared to anybody else in the industry, but that does not give us a license to waste money. And I want to continue to always be looking. Are we spending correctly every single part of this company, so we can then spend the money in the right place at the right time. In terms of marketing. There probably is a lot of waste in the industry probably and I think we can see that, some people who are probably going to be pulling back in turn their marketing. We like to think that we've been efficient and effective. But I think there's always room everywhere to do better and we're going to continue to do so. That's only the right way to try and have a long term successful company. You know, I am confident though that you know regardless of what we know towards your first question, I am confident the business will be coming back, its something that we've seen over and over and over again. As I said many, many times here. Travel is a basic need for people. They have been doing it for a very, very long time. And as soon as the air clear so to speak, you'll see people will be coming back to travel. Justin Post : Great. Thank you. Operator : We do have another question from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Brian Nowak : Great. Thank you for taking my question. I have two please. David just appreciate the month over month commentary for the first quarter. But maybe just so we can all sort of better understand the underlying durability of growth. How big of a room night and EBITDA headwind have you put into the guide to factor in corona for the first quarter? And then the second one, Glenn, this is sort of talk about you know opportunities and sort of untapped geographies. Talk to us about how you think about the importance and the opportunity to focus more on the U.S. from a branding and a performance marketing perspective this year to perhaps take more share in that area? Thanks. Glenn Fogel : Okay. Thanks, Brian I'll take the first part of it. Now I try to avoid getting into specific growth rates by month. I'll give you a flavor I think you can do some back the envelope master to kind of figure out you know what March has to look like in terms of getting to a minus 5% to minus 10% range. Way we've looked at this is this we have as I mentioned in my answer to Kevin have looked at very much so what's happened to the last few days and anticipating at the lower end the range that the travel environment in Europe may get worse because we would be surprised if there's only one outbreak in Europe over the course of the rest of the quarter. So we've taken into account what we saw happening over the last week which of course is led by a lot of cancellations. So over time it may not be quite as that as we're seeing and in less than the last week because you see obviously to the different growth rate on underlying bookings visiting cancellations, the early reaction to these news patterns is usually you get a spike cancellations and things can more moderate out. But we've taken into account what we've seen happening over the course of the last week. We projected that through the rest of the quarter and recognize the impact to make it worse if there are additional outbreaks in Europe or further slowdowns in the rest of the world. That's how we've tried to intelligently give you some guidance data points from obviously data we're getting it's moving very rapidly is the best data that we have as up until this morning. David Goulden : In regards to our opportunities around the world, the US is without doubt our biggest opportunity, it is an enormous market that we under index significantly. And the reason for it why we have not achieved what we'd like to yet and historical know Booking.com was always a hotel only company and we didn't have an air product there for example, many Americans like to start their travel business using air. So we now we're going to be bringing out an air product over time so that would be one. Second thing is extremely price competitive, price sensitive consumer in the US. Looking back historically an agency player, meaning the price was set by the hotels or by the non-hotel accommodations. We believe that we have to be able to merchandise meaning adjusting what that value to the consumer is going to be, but to do that you've got to have a payment product. It was only last quarter that we got up running the domestic payment product for U.S. consumers. So that's another one. Another big issue packages, many Americans like to use a package product or like to do some toward a combination that will get them more value. Well we're just starting that now one of things I'm very proud about is working between Priceline.com and Booking.com com to come up with a package product for the U.S. consumers that we're just getting that out. The other thing is we have other assets to help bring consumers to our sites and make them aware of the great things we have. For example OpenTable. A lot of people are using OpenTable every month. In the past we have never done anything to really bring together the power the OpenTable platform and the Booking.com platform in a way they'll provide more value than consumers. So a lot of the things that we're working on because I do believe the U.S. is a great opportunity for us to help build out our business. Brian Nowak : Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : We have another question from the line of Justin Patterson from Raymond James. Your line is open. Justin Patterson : Great. Thanks so much. One on connected trip, how should we think about scaling supply through your own assets or third party partners on the attractions and dining side with partners in there? Is there anything you need that control to ensure an optimal customer experience. And then the second questions on marketing, as your direct channel mix grows and your payments business grows. How should we - how do you think about that incremental ROI of using coupons to drive conversion versus say attracting customers via branded performance marketing? Thanks so much. Glenn Fogel : I want to hit the first, I\u2019ll David being our CFO he can talk about how we're going to optimize answers the coupons. You're right in terms that in an ideal world you would like to have all of your supply directly connect to us and you prefer in an ideal world not to be using third party suppliers. That being said, that's a balance against speed to market and making sure you have the supply necessary to create a good offer to the consumers. So in the interest of speed we have gone with third party providers to provide inventory that we don't have. I mentioned OpenTable a little while ago. OpenTable le has a great product in there. They do a lot of business in a lot different cities, but also licensees [ph] around the world that they don't do business and we want to provide that dining opportunity to our consumers in as many cities as we can. So we will partner with others. Attractions the same thing. We had our own contracts with supply but there are a lot of places in the world where people are traveling. So to make sure that we have the supply we're going to third parties. Over time, we believe that in the long run having your own supply helps you in terms of creating that truly seamless connected trip. But speed matters in this market. So we're going to do that too. David Goulden : And Justin, on the all the different marketing channels first of all we're very pleased to build our direct business that is very important for future and the connected trip and the app and all things now drive in that direction. But the phones marketing channels are also really important sources of acquisition of new customers for us and sometimes some existing customers can come back to that net as well. But to answer your question, we look at all of these on a very measured incremental ROI basis. We can re-measure our different activities and compare them on a very comparable basis. So when it comes to things like coupons or other attractions we may only offer through one of our channels, we just look at the ROI on that visit the other channels and decide where we lean in or don't as the case may be. So we have pretty good metrics on all things like that because we are able to measure the short term return on those investments. Again, longer term we're looking to drive people towards the direct channel for tipping towards the app and Glenn mentioned how well downloads that is and how is becoming very much a powerful app in the channel space and as the connected trip becomes a bigger piece of business and the app becomes a way to experience the connected trip in - during the trip, it's even more strategic. Tactically we can look at all these different things including things like couponing on a very measured basis and decide to lean in based on which ones give us the vote the shortest - short term returns and also create the highest level of repeat or return to direct activity after that initial offer. Justin Patterson : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan from Barclays. Your line is open. Deepak Mathivanan : Great. Thanks for taking the question. David last year you talked about achieving double digits earnings growth and then exceeded it pretty nicely, exact facts [ph] understand this situation is a little bit more fluid right now and the color you provided on the operating model was helpful. How should we think about those things kind of translate into earnings growth for this year. And then how are you thinking about using the balance sheet for share repurchases you know in the year when there is like a disruption currently going on. Thank you. David Goulden : Sure, Deepak. Thanks for the question. Let me take the first part of it. So yes, I mean we talked about the operating model expectations pretty coronavirus as a continuation of the model I think was a quite successful force in 2019. And I don't want to get too specific targets for 2020 because there's not a lot of point in putting out a hypothetical forecast a year which we could never measure against and bridge against because obviously a year is going to come out very different from what we expected it only a few a few weeks ago. But you know we were pleased with the way that 2019 came out. If you kind of look back at Q4 look at 2019 understand the underlying health of the business. And we believe that there's no reason why that model can't continue in normal times and then Glenn you won't talk about second port balance sheet. Glenn Fogel : Yeah. So we are very pleased to have a very strong balance sheet, significant amount of free cash. We have a very good credit rating. And the question really is as we've always had is how should we best use our capital. One of things has always been share repurchases. Another thing that we always do is we're always looking at other companies that could potentially help add to our connected trip strategic vision and we're going to continue to look at that. Certainly valuations have changed significantly in the recent past and that may provide an opportunity for us in both areas. But as David says, it's a very fluid situation right now and we're not going to box ourselves into anything right this second I will say though however we do look at this very, very carefully because we do want to be agile. Operator, do we have any more question please. Operator : Yes sir, we have added a question from the line of Eric Sheridan from UBS. Your line is open. Eric Sheridan : Thanks for taking the question. Maybe if I can a few around a cost structure and how you think about investing in the business in sort of a relatively uncertain environment is there a way queued out what are some of the investments you plan on making just because they fit with the strategic vision, they're going to be made for the long term irrespective of how the environment arcs up or down over the next sort of couple of quarters and how much of it is more variable in nature where you might tune up or down investments we could better understand the variable piece they're probably more likely track with how room night to get better or worse from the excellent results in Q4 versus the cautionary results in our guide for Q1? Thanks so much guys. Glenn Fogel : Sure. So I've been talking about our long term strategic vision for some time now since I became CEO of the holding company a little more than three years ago. And how important it is to create and continue to create value for all sides of this marketplace. And we're going to continue to do that. That requires investing in people. In terms of code, making sure we are providing, something that is a differentiator from what is out there right now. And there is no reason to slow that down stop that or hold back on that. The sooner we get out the truly superior travel service the better we will be. And I want to be in that position when we come out of this current environment which is something that is unexpected, but will end. I want to come out of that as soon as possible with the best services that we have. So we're going to continue on that. We are not changing that at all. Now in terms of in terms of investments, in terms of marketing and things like that naturally you always want to make adjustments based on what the environment is. So for us as I mentioned about brand marketing. Well we are not going to be making brand marketing to people who are not listening to that message at all. And if you're not thinking about travelling, you're not listening to a travel ad. It's foolish for us to invest money in a brand marketing campaign. And that's an example of extreme on the other side. And in between there all these different things in between that we're going to be making adjustments as we go throughout the year and we've always been doing that. That's no different, David, anything to add. David Goulden : Eric just maybe for a little bit of a framework around what Glen talked about. So if you think of all of offering expenses and just look at 2019 for second about $9.5 billion a little over half of our OpEx is really variable with volume, obviously our performance marketing change. We're going up and down a brand mark to easily not volume related but obviously Glenn you said no point spending a lot of brand if people not primarily think about travel. A large piece of ourselves and other expenses is also related to volume as well because that ties back to the merchant processing costs on a payment platform. So well over half of our OpEx really is directly tied to the volume within that business. Now obviously there are volume related aspects in the other areas which are mainly our personnel G&A, I.T. et cetera. And obviously there's some fixed and some very low expenses there. But if you think about our cost structure it really is quite variable. The larger expense line is being tied to volume quite directly. Of course in the areas that are not tied directly there are things we can continue to do to refine and optimize as Dan talked about. Eric Sheridan : Thanks so much guys. Operator : We do have another question from the line of Naved Khan from SunTrust. Your line is open. Naved Khan : Yeah, thanks a lot. Couple of questions. So David in your commentary you spoke about maybe 2020 seeing payment process for your own payment platform going to 25%. What are the levers that you control to kind of get that from 15% in 2019 to 25% this year? And then the other question I have was just maybe can you shed some light on your maybe early results from the Grabbe [ph] partnership how that might be working for you? David Goulden : So let me start off with the payments platform actually Glenn was the one who gave us the numbers out, but let me just guys talk to you about how we see it's developing and what the impact will have on our income statement. So as you see we basically had a growth from 10% in 2018 \u201815 in \u201819 25 in 20 we expect obviously to exit 2020 high and 25% payments. That's the average for the year. That might be helpful just to understand a little bit about what that's doing to our income statement cause I've always had questions about in prior and prior calls. In 2020 we expect the payments actually to contribute both - to both revenue growth as it has been but also to start contributing to EBITDA growth as well with very little impact at all upon our EBITDA rate in 2020 will contribute towards even that growth. As we recover an ever increasing percentage of our payment costs. So that's how we think about payments rolling through all our business. Obviously there's still a very attractive nature in our agency model as well so one's not completely replace the other but as Glen said for all sorts of reasons including the ability to participate in merchandising and also to be able to package and control things together in the other connected trip payments will become an ever increasing part of business and we're pleased with how it is progressing and we're on track to get it to stage which starts to contribute towards our growth which we'll start doing this year. Glenn Fogel : And regarding the Grabbe relationship I'm very pleased about how that's been progressing and you'll remember we invest in Grabbe for three reasons. One reason was Grabbe has significant number of customers and we want to find all different ways that we can expose our hotel a combination over our travel [ph] services to customers in different ways and that's really was a great way to do it, one. The other thing was, our travelers when they arrive in a place that they're not familiar with they want to know how are we going to get around. And many people sometimes mistakenly assume that whatever ride sharing capability they have in their home countries is going to be in place they go visit and it's not going to be they're not going to know what they're going to do in the future what am I going to do. And one of the great things is we said that we would come up with Grabbe a way that a person can use the Booking.com app and in a seamless way can get a ride sharing without having to download another app and put a credit card and so on that they're not familiar with and it'll be seamless and a great experience. And I mentioned last quarter how we've gotten that up and running in Singapore and the third thing of course he said we'd like to have a financial return on the money we invested. One of the things I mentioned last quarter was how. By the end of the year I expected us to be able to have that Grabbe at operation on the Booking.com app by India [ph] for Indonesia and Thailand. And I'm very pleased that we are now actually operational in every single territory that Grabbe operates on the IoS platform. So it's just a great shout out to the team who's been working on that and thank you guys for getting that done ahead of schedule and really pushing that through. We'll be operational on for Android I think and to four weeks I've been told and we're talking about it's now beyond Singapore, it's Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Philippines as minorities everywhere the Grabbe is. And I tell you I've seen this used and it really is something that makes it so easy to get off that plane in that airport you just go that Booking.com apps and right away you can get that car to take you to a hotel it's a wonderful experience and we're also on the other side being able to show our hotel accommodations to more and more Grabbe customers so good in all areas. Naved Khan : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Stephen Ju : Thanks very much. So Glenn I guess out of adversity can come opportunities, so in an environment in which folks are going to be really starved for business. Are there any Silver Linings we should be thinking about in terms of booking becoming a more important partner for your suppliers or being able to onboard more supply for the future? And I guess for the integrated travel experience, as well as the rollout of your own payment rails, you are talking about transforming what the Booking.com experience has meant for the consumer for some time now. So do you feel like you have in know you have to retrain them to look for a non-hotel products or pay up front. And do you think you need to incur some cost to bring up that awareness. Thank you. Glenn Fogel : So nobody wants their business to succeed because of unfortunate events. Nobody would hope for that. But sometimes the events happen anyway and you do end up being a beneficiary of those events. Companies that are stronger when they enter into a bad period emerge even stronger. And in this industry I've seen it happen over and over again. There is no doubt I've talked in the past about potential recessions and what would happen in a recession and why I believe that would make us more valuable to some players so that they would use us more to get demand because they needed more and you have pointed out what could be a very unfortunate thing for many players in our industry. So yes. Silver Linings is one way to describe it. I do believe that in the long run we will emerge from this in a much better position a stronger competitor and we will end up being better off though of course no one would ever hope for that to happen under that under that way. In regards to the consumer. Consumers are amazing how they - they learn very rapidly how to save money get value when they see a new option. And it's interesting you don't even see announcements of them in different products many times. it's just you're playing around with it and you see it. Now we of course will be using all sorts of marketing methods to get and make sure our customers are aware of the better way to do your travel planning your travel execution. But I have - I am not concerned at all that when we have that better products I am not concerned that people will know about it. Stephen Ju : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Doug Anmuth : Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask two. First you talked about the 15% Booking.com bookings using the payments platform. Can you talk a little bit more about what you're seeing in terms of conversion rates and speed to booking and other metrics that you may look at in payments? And then secondly Glen you mentioned going to expose flights ultimately to 50% of your customers, just curious why that's the number kind of why you'd stop there? Thanks. Glenn Fogel : Well we wouldn't actually stop there. That's just my target for this year. We do intend to have 100% of the people eventually be exposed to and 100% using it. But this is it takes time because of regulatory licensing things it's not as though you can just immediately just start selling airline tickets everywhere. That takes time to get your licenses and certain in certain jurisdictions. A - David Goulden Yeah, let me just characterize a little bit of what we're seeing on the payment platform and why we think it's very important now in the future. So that the benefits come in different areas and that multiple and sometimes they are additive. So in some cases just offering people payments in different methodologies payments in currency of their own choice or payment process all of their own choice was be you know to offer a Chinese customer to pay Ipay which pay off something like that just offering up payment choice even if the underlying hotel profit is the same. We have seen conversion increases even if people don't use that choice. It's a bit a bit like offering something in the local language of course we offer our site for local languages to thank you offer something present in some of these native language or in this case you give him a payment choice that they recognize that you recognize he's actually something that myself will help with conversion we can demonstrate that that does albeit a small amount. If they don't use payments and then of course if they do use payments it helps a little bit more. So you do get some conversion benefits but the other thing that payment platform belongs to as well is we can also as I mentioned we can stop participating in the pricing process the emergent rising more proactively so we can offer basically Booking.com can get involved in that and offer booking sponsored benefits or other offers to the customer. You can only really do if you are participating as immersion and you're taking the payments on behalf of the property I'm passing it through. So the other thing that the payment can do the payment platform also will do it it'll help bridge a gap between a customer a customer and a property in terms of customers can pay in the payment platform for all the payment, currency of choice and we can pay out to the property upon it in their payment currency of choice. So for example again the hotel in Italy or in Paris may not take all the payment methods that we offer to our Asian customers and we can give them virtual credit cards in for example a MasterCard or a Visa format. So there are all sorts of different benefits from the payments platform and they'll want to talk to you about that helps in the business as well is that the agency model of course leaves the payment process open to the customer to deal with the property and vice versa and we actually get a lot of off a customer service request calls are to do with things that go wrong somewhere or we're not expected in that equation between the property and the customer, we weren't where we're not participating because we're just being agents providing the booking. So we find that if we made the payment process we can reduce the number of customer service incidents around the payment question and actually increase the rules as the overall satisfaction and experience of both the customer and the property partner. So there are many benefits of the payment platform. Others have mentioned a few in some cases you get all of them in one transaction in some cases you only get one. But it's something that we are developing rapidly inside of Booking.com because we got a lot of experience in payments in both Agoda and in Priceline. So we're taking leverage with that capability where we've already seen those benefits occur. Doug Anmuth : Thanks very helpful. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Heath Terry : Great. Thank you. You called out specifically the January 21st date is the one where you've sort of started to see the headlines for coronavirus, wondering if you could share with us sort of where your expectations were then for bookings growth in the quarter and just to get a better sense of sort of where you know the magnitude of the shift between then and where we are where we are now. And then also on the - as we think about sort of where you're seeing the divergence in bookings growth and room night growth continuing and spreading, I know in the past you've talked about obviously that being a function of cheaper ADR. Just wondering if maybe you could get a little bit more into detail with us on that, as far as how much of that is geographic. How much of that is you believe customers continuing to downshift to cheaper rooms and how much of it might be an access to inventory issue as hotels look to retain more of their compression nights for their own platforms. Glenn Fogel : Sure, let me take those in reverse order, so the ADR question is the best place to go is back to back to Q4 because we were operating obviously in a business as usual type environments. And without going through a long explanation because we gave a fairly long explanations to what's happening to ADR and why we saw that ADR reduction in the fourth quarter. My part of it is because we were lapping a rather unusual increase a year ago sort of for really became a three if you normalize that and then we saw basically half of that decline due to lower rates in the key countries which were like US, Japan, Hong Kong, of course you know again on a free virus model and some of that was macro, about half of the decline in ADRs was due to a shift towards lower a ADR country again. So that was also macro because some of the higher ADR countries got very expensive from a tax point of view. So when we go back and look at Q4 and look at Q3 we saw basically two points of normalize reduction in ADRs in Q3 and three points in Q4. We believe about half of that with our macro and half of that was mix related going forward. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of flavor to call what's going on. Going into 2020, we expect to be ADR reductions to be down to a couple of points, again on pre corona virus basis basically just assuming that the macro piece that continued with a little bit more in the first half a little bit less in the second half due to the lapping effect of what we saw occurring last year. And just to go back to the very first part of the question. Just like we try not to give specific guidance for where we were for the year, pre corona virus and we did give you a - I think a fairly good flavor as to how we thought the business would operate during the pre the corona virus. We try not to get into a lot of bridging exercises between where we were Q1 before and afterwards for what it's worth I can tell you that we're tracking nicely ahead of our internal expectations for the first three weeks in January but it's only a three week period of time. So take it for four was worth but we were running slightly in front of the expectations we have for the year which I outlined relative to what we talked about 2019 and when we expect things to continue into 2020. I don't want to get into a specific we thought room like growth would be X and is Y because we can never really compare against the hypothetical growth, we were comfortable with where the year was shaping up. We felt good about the profile of business we talked about in 2020 relative to what we saw in 2019 and the business model continuing and hopefully that gives you a flavor you can have really come to your own conclusion as to what it was, but we were pleased with how things were shaping up going into \u201820 and the shape of \u201820 as we looked at the full year. Glenn Fogel : So this concludes the remarks and I want to end by saying the summary, our 2019 performers met some important financials strategic goals. I'm very pleased about the steps we've taken to date to write more value to the customers and our supply partners and we look forward to doing more so in the future. And we're going to manage through the current travel environment and I am very confident in our long term prospects. And finally I want to thank our supplier marketing partners, our more than 26000 employees distribute across more than 300 offices and a very special thank you to a subset of those 26000 over the last couple of months have been working so hard in this environment. I want to thank them very much and most of all I want to thank our traveler customers who are out there exploring the world. Good night. Operator : Good bye. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.+",

And now I'd like to introduce Booking Holdings speakers for this afternoon, Glenn Fogel and David Goulden. Please go ahead. Glenn Fogel : Thank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings' First Quarter Conference Call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. We are living in difficult times. Since our last call in February, the spread of COVID-19 has grown exponentially, bringing uncertainty, turmoil [Technical Difficulty] ever seen. Billions of people have been under stay-at-home orders, and there have been and continue to be closures of orders, government enforce travel restrictions and strict guidelines regarding social distancing. These actions have profoundly affected our industry in every corner of this [indiscernible]. While our Q1 reported room nights declined 43% year-over-year, we did not see the virus' full negative force on our business until mid- to late March. So the 43% decline does not truly reflect the state of our business nor the travel industry today. In March, our reported room nights declined over 100%, meaning we received more cancellations during that month in new bookings.  Looking at things a different way. Our newly booked room nights, which exclude the impact of cancellations, were down over 60% year-over-year in March and down over 85% in April. This gives you a clear indication of how much our business is currently impacted by this crisis. That being said, while the virus impact on travel is unprecedented, I am confident that this crisis will eventually end and people will travel again. Travel is fundamental to who we are. And while it may take some time to return to pre-COVID-19 levels, we will get there eventually. And then we'd expect travel to continue to grow thereafter.  So what are we doing now as we wait for effective treatments for a successful vaccine? During the first quarter, when it became clear that the virus impact was going to be more significant than anyone initially anticipated, we quickly developed a series of plans to help us navigate through these challenging times. One, stabilize the business from the immediate shock of the crisis; two, optimize the business for the expected decrease in travel demand over the next few years; and three, position the business to capture travel demand when it returns. So we can emerge from this crisis on strong footing and extend our leadership position.  As we entered the stabilization phase at the beginning of the crisis, our employees' health and safety was a top priority. But what we have -- although we have a few offices currently open in Asia, the vast majority of our employees are now working from home, including our customer service teams, which is no small accomplishment considering the technology requirements and the huge increase in change requests and cancellations that we experienced. I am very proud of our teams and pleased to say that we are functioning well in this new distributed environment.  Another immediate priority was helping our customers and our supply partners. For a number of weeks, we were fielding a significantly higher number of daily inbound calls than we typically received. For our customers, this entailed supporting them as they sought refunds from bookings that were no longer possible due to government regulations or made requests to modify their travel plans. For our partners, many of whom do not have the ability to process such a large volume of customer service calls, we supported them by handling the unprecedented level of cancellations and date modifications request.  Looking ahead, we'll be working with our trial partners to create plans to stimulate trial orders to book again once this crisis is behind us. We know how critical it will be to bring demand to our supply partners in a cost-effective way. Also as part of our stabilization plan, we took immediate steps to conserve cash and increase liquidity such as halting stock buybacks, dramatically reducing marketing spend worldwide, cutting nonessential costs, implementing a general hire increase and reducing executive compensation, with our brand CEOs and I forgoing salaries during this crisis, and the other senior managers throughout the company voluntarily reducing their base salaries and our Board of Directors forgoing their cash fees. In addition to reducing costs, we bolstered our liquidity by raising over $4 billion in debt. These measures have enabled us to have sufficient liquidity to weather a long period of significantly reduced travel demand and have the necessary resources to invest in securing demand when people are ready to travel again.  We've now begun to refine and execute our optimized plan in which we will adapt to the new reality that assumes it will be -- likely be years, not quarters, before we witness a full recovery of global travel demand. We believe that either a vaccine or effective treatment is needed before people will feel fully comfortable traveling the way they did before the pandemic started. And even after our vaccine or treatment is declared safe and effective, we believe it may be some time before there is efficient quantity and distribution to them to give people and governments confidence for people to travel freely. Furthermore, as in pre-COVID-19 days, that will be dependent on the overall economy, consumers' financial health having gone through a very deep recession and consumers' confidence in their own economic futures. For these reasons, we expect travel to fully recover a leader than many other industries. However, when travel demand does start to recover, we believe there'll be attractive growth opportunities.  We are in the process of assessing the cost structure of our entire company in helping plans to align it with expected market demand. As part of these efforts, we're also evaluating our strategic initiatives and the timing of significant expenditures. We intend to continue to invest in our key projects, such as payments, in the connected trip that we believe will position us well for the future. But we are also reexamining all areas of the company to see where can we reduce or delay cost where possible. Fortunately, our financial strength allows us to make strategic decisions oriented towards the long-term interest of the business. We recently completed a strategic evaluation on OpenTable and KAYAK, announcing last week a series of actions to reduce operating costs. Unfortunately, this included the decision to lay off and furlough some employees. As a principle during this crisis, we have not reached first for employee reductions to lower costs. But after making adjustments in other operating expense areas, we made the tough decision to ensure the size and scope of our business is proportionate to the new realities of the travel market. We are now working with the other brands to examine their cost structures, and we will be thoughtful and deliberate in our evaluations.  In an attempt to minimize the impact on our employees during these difficult times, we have been evaluating and employing various governmental financial support programs. Booking.com recently announced that it would participate in the employee aid program offered by the United Kingdom. And we were able to place employees on furlough there, which has enabled employees to receive a significant portion of their full-time salary. We have also applied to the Dutch government 15E under the recently enacted program to support employment in the Netherlands. This program provides funds to Dutch companies impacted by this crisis and covers a portion of employee salaries for a 3-month period with the requirement that companies which receive this aid maintain employment during the time the aid is provided. These programs, along with all the other steps we have taken, will help us support employees and maintain jobs as we continue to fully evaluate the operating environment. We will continue to look at other available options that might help us mitigate near-term headcount reductions during this period of significantly reduced revenue.  The actions we are taking are stabilization and optimization phases are being done so that we can capitalize quickly and efficiently on travel demand when it becomes safe for people to travel again. We want to emerge from this crisis and a strong organization that is equipped to deliver for our customers and our partners will capitalize and in a position to increase our market share when the world is ready to travel again.  On a smaller but somewhat positive note, we are seeing some stability in our newly booked room night growth trends. We hope that this is the beginning of the road back to recovery, but it is simply too early to say with certainty. Some governments have seen progress in limiting or reducing the pandemic. They have slowly begun to reopen their economies, and we have seen new bookings, primarily for domestic travel, although still at very low levels. Some or many of these reservations may ultimately be canceled, but we believe it does show that travel for essential business and personal reasons will slowly return as society makes progress against the pandemic. As travel returns, we expect to see improvement in our revenue.  We are also prepared for disruption in that progress as relaxation of social distancing in some geographies may lead to a resurgence of infections and reinstatement of government restrictions. Our aim is to optimize the business to participate in the ultimate return of demand [Technical Difficulty]. David Goulden : Hello are we still on the line? Operator : Yes, one moment, please. David Goulden : Thank you. Hello, operator, can you hear me? Operator : Yes, I can hear you. David Goulden : Okay. Am I live on the line? Operator : Yes, you are. David Goulden : Thank you. Thank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. Operator, am I on the line? Can you confirm that, please? I can... Operator : Yes, you are, sir. David Goulden : Thank you. Thank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I'll review our operating results for the first quarter, discuss our stabilization initiative to bolster our liquidity and provide some color on trends we saw in April. All growth rates related to the prior year comparable period, unless otherwise indicated. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP can be found in our earnings release.  Now on to our results for the quarter. At the time of our last earnings call on February 26, the outbreak of COVID-19 was largely contained to Asia, and we're yet to see a meaningful impact in our business across Europe or North America. As we moved into March, the COVID outbreak continues to spread throughout Europe and North America, leading to the eventual declaration of a global pandemic and the implementation of numerous travel restrictions and shelter-in-place orders. Not surprisingly, we saw a resulting sharp duration of our top line trends in March with significant levels of cancellations and a substantial reduction in the level of new bookings. Although we only felt the full brunt of the COVID-19 pandemic around mid- to late March, our Q1 results were still significantly negatively impacted.  Our Q1 reported room nights declined 43% for the fourth quarter. However, that decline exceeded 100% in March, we received more cancellation of the new bookings in the month. Our cancellation rate peaked in mid-March, has been steadily improving then as we work through the way the cancellation of bookings made prior to the imposition of restrictions on travel. Gross bookings declined 51% in Q1, which is a greater decline than reported room nights due to average daily rates for accommodations decreasing about 15% year-on-year on a constant currency basis. Consolidated non-GAAP revenue for the first quarter was $2.3 billion and decreased 21% year-on-year. Revenue in the quarter was less negatively impacted the room nights and gross bookings due to the fact that many cancellations were received in Q1 were checks -- that were expected to occur later -- were expect to occur in later quarters. Adjusted Q1 for EBITDA was $290 million, which was down 60% year-on-year. We benefit from having a highly variable cost structure that naturally declines in periods of low travel demand. As Glenn noted, we are taking further actions in reducing other areas of spend as we stabilize and then move to optimize and line our cost structure with the new demand environment. With that being said, there were some areas of expense pressure in the quarter related to COVID-19 pandemic that I'll walk you through.  Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense, decreased 29% year-on-year, as we saw a significant reduction in demand in the paid channels. In addition, we took actions to substantially reduce our brand marketing spend in response to the diminished travel demand environment. We expect our marketing expense will remain significantly below 2019 levels for the remainder of the year. Sales and other expenses increased 75% year-on-year due primarily to $183 million increase in provisions for expected bad debt and other credit losses resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.  Excluding the impact of the increased provision we recorded in the quarter, sales and other decreased 10% year-on-year as this expense line is substantially variable in nature. For example, we recorded lower expenses associated with payments in Q1. This reduction was partially offset by higher outsourced customer service costs as we work through the heavy volume of cancellations we received in the quarter. Personnel expense decreased 3% year-over-year, primarily due to a decrease in stock-based compensation which was impacted by reduced financial performance as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Excluding SBC expenses, personnel increased 12% year-over-year and although we have implemented a hiring freeze, personnel expense this quarter was impacted by annualized hires that were made last year. We expect the pressure on personnel expense will diminish as we move through the year.  G&A expenses increased 6% year-over-year largely driven by higher indirect taxes, including digital service taxes. Excluding these indirect taxes, G&A expense decreased 7% year-over-year as we reduced discretionary expenses such as G&A expense. We will see less year-over-year pressure on G&A from digital service taxes once we lap the enactments of the French DST, which occurred in Q3 of last year.  Finally, information technology expenses increased 20% year-on-year, driven by higher software fees and outsourced data center and cloud costs. On a GAAP basis, we incurred an operating loss of $308 million as our GAAP operating expenses in the quarter included a charge of $489 million related to an impairment of goodwill for OpenTable and KAYAK. This impairment charge is driven by a reduced financial projections as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We excluded the impairment of goodwill for our non-GAAP results. Our Q1 GAAP net loss was $699 million. Our Q1 GAAP net loss includes $307 million of pretax losses on our equity investments in Trip.com and Meituan and the $100 million impairment charge related to our strategic investments. This was partially offset by $33 million of FX remeasurement gains on our euro bonds. We exclude these unrealized losses, impairment charge and remeasurement gains from our non-GAAP results.  Now on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q1 ending cash and investment balance was $9.2 billion, which decreased from our December ending balance by $11.8 billion due to several factors, including the following primary drivers. First, we had $380 million of operating cash outflow in the quarter, which was driven by an $820 million use of cash due to change in working capital as well as the lower earnings we generated in the quarter. Working capital in Q1 was negatively impacted by a prepayment of tax rate in the Netherlands of 719 -- $717 million that was subsequently refunded in April. The large reductions in our deferred merchant bookings, accounts payable and accrued expenses balances were mostly offset by the significant reduction in our accounts receivable balance in Q1. The deferred merchant booking reduction was driven by both lower bookings and customer refunds. We expect these balances will all continue to decline in the low level of bookings we are currently seeing in the business.  Second, we repurchased $1.3 billion of our stock in Q1, almost all of which was purchased under a stock buyback plan we filed last November. We halted buybacks as soon as we recognize the growing impact of the pandemic. Third, we had CapEx of $80 million in the quarter. And finally, the value of our investments decline in parts by the $307 million unrealized loss on equity securities and the $100 million impairment related to a strategic investment that I mentioned earlier. In addition, we had $106 million decline in investment value that did not impact the P&L but was reflected in the balance sheet. The majority of the remaining $288 million difference between cash and investments at year-end on March 31, is primarily due to the timing of the settlement of sales was from corporate bonds that were classified in prepaid expenses and other assets at the end of March. These sales have settled in April and moved into cash and investments.  In our efforts to stabilize the business from the immediate shock of the crisis, we've taken several steps to show up and bolster our liquidity position. We halted repurchase of our stock, and we will not initiate repurchases until we have better visibility into the shape and timing of a recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. We worked to receive a refund in April of the prepayment of taxes in the Netherlands that was made early in Q1. We amended our revolving credit facility to substitute a minimum liquidity covenants for the previous leverage covenants due in June 21 to ensure we continue to have access to the source of liquidity. And finally, and most notably, we completed a bond and convertible note offering on April 8 that raised $4.1 billion of capital.  If you adjust our March 31 ending cash investment balance of $9.2 billion for our bond and convertible note offering and the settlement of the corporate bond sales and the refund of the Dutch tax prepayments, all of which occurred in April, on March 31, cash and investment balance will increase to about $14.3 billion. Approximately $12 billion of this is highly liquid after considering the actions we've taken, including recently completing the sale of our trip.com ADSs, moving on cash and investments into corporate -- moving on cash and investments in corporate bonds into AAA treasury and government money market funds. After the bond and convertible offering, we have about $13 billion of debt, $4 billion of which matures before the end of 2022.  Due to the COVID-19 crisis, I will not provide quarterly guidance like we normally do. However, I will provide some color from our preliminary April results, which will give you a clear picture of our recent top line trends considering that April was the first month fully impacted by the pandemic. As Glenn mentioned, our newly booked room nights in April were down over 85% year-on-year. As a reminder, newly booked room nights excludes the impact of cancellations. Of course, these new bookings may be canceled in the future, especially as the very high percentage of new bookings in April were made with flexible cancellation policies. Reported room nights continue to be negative in April as cancellations outpaced new bookings. We expect our revenue in April to have a greater year-on-year decline than newly booked room nights, considering the impact of the cancellations in March for April stays. And also since many hotels, especially in Europe, were not open in April. New bookings revenue for full second quarter may vary from April's results, depending upon the level of travel demand and a combination of availability we experienced in May and June. Now as Glenn noted, we're seeing some stability in our newly booked room night growth trends with a year-on-year decline rate being quite consistent for April after reducing rapidly through the first quarter. We believe that domestic travel will rebound sooner than international travel as we expect travelers to look to their home country or region first for a safe level option.  In April, we witnessed a meaningfully higher domestic mix in our business. Historically, domestic accommodation bookings represents about 45% of Booking.com's total business. And if we consider Western Europe as one market, the historic mix increases to about 55%. In April, Booking.com's domestic share increased to approximately 70%. And if you consider Western Europe as one market, the domestic mix increased over 75%. Towards the end of April, we saw some very early indications that domestic travel was starting to return in certain markets where shelter-in-place rules were relaxed, including Greater China, South Korea, Vietnam and Germany. Newly booked room nights in the U.S. declined less than our global average in April, and we saw an improvement in domestic travel during April, but we cannot tie this to relaxing of shelter-in-place rules, and these have only happened in a few states and in recent days. I must emphasize again that it's too early to say we're witnessing anything like a broad rebound in travel, especially as we've seen some countries like Singapore, where travel demand was less impacted than other places initially, but is now seeing significant travel demand decreases associated with new outbreaks. If we look across all our business, the rates -- the decline rate for newly booked room nights in the last few days in April was only a few percent better than the decline rate in the first few days. We've also observed a meaningful change in Booking.com's customer booking behavior. In April, their customers mainly booked either very close to stay or several months out. The combined mix of both very short booking and bookings for over 2 months' time is twice the normal amount. This booking behavior change has also been accompanied by an increase in mobile bookings, particularly in our app, helping drive a higher mix of direct bookings, and we'll continue to focus on providing our customers with a great app experience.  As Glenn emphasized, we have a tough road ahead of us as we look to navigate through the unprecedented challenges that COVID-19 has presented to us. We're working hard to stabilize our business through actions, including our cost-savings initiatives and a significant bolstering of our liquidity position. We'll continue to optimize our business and our costs to align with expected market demand, and we'll work to position ourselves to capitalize upon the reemergence of travel demand, when that time occurs and whenever that demand occurs. We have the confidence that through these actions, we'll be well positioned to come out of this crisis and extend our global leadership role in the travel marketplace. With that, we will take your questions. Glenn Fogel : And David, can you hear me? David Goulden : I can hear you now, Glenn. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. The first response is from Mark Mahaney, RBC Capital. Mark Mahaney : Maybe I'll try two questions. First, David, I think at the end, you talked about this increase in app bookings or a rise in direct bookings. Is that something you actually were able to drive that just happened randomly? And is there a way that coming out of this crisis that at the margin, you can tilt more of your bookings to you can accelerate this transition to direct bookings? And then secondly, thanks for the data points on the improvements in a couple of the markets. Any quantification on those? Is there any way to say that any of these markets, South Korea, Vietnam, whatever, are back at down 50% or something like that? Like what's the -- can you kind of draw the curve a little bit, if it -- or it may be too early? David Goulden : Yes, Mark, this is David. I'll take that. Let me go to the second question first. We have called out markets where there's been a double-digit improvement in the rate of decline from the start of April to the end of April. We really only kept our remarks through the month of April because early trends in May are too early to call. So I'm not going to tell you exactly how much they're down. I mentioned to that in total, even with this improvement we've seen in these markets, all-in room like decline rate is only a few points better at the end of the month than it was at the start. But the markets that we called out we see double-digit improvements during the course of the month of April. In terms of the shift towards app, first of all, I'll just caveat, as I said before, anything that we talk about in terms of April when we're running at kind of 10% to 15% of our normal volumes, you have to take and qualify through that lens and try not to draw too big a trend from it.  We did see during the course of the month that we saw more app customers, we saw more Genius customers, which is often tied to app use as well. And we're pleased the fact that in the areas we saw some demand increase or we saw the residual demand occur, more was going into the app. We'll continue to try and emphasize the app as we come first because we want to make sure that we drive more direct business and of course to the app, is one of the strongest ways to drive direct business. But I wouldn't say there was a particular strategy that drove us there. I'm pleased that, that's the way the things came out, and we're going to continue to understand how our customers are buying and try and continue that trend as demand starts to recover. Mark Mahaney : Thank you, David. Thank you, Glenn. Wishing you both the best. David Goulden : Thank you, Mark. Glenn Fogel : Thank you. Operator : Your next response is from Kevin Kopelman with Cowen. Kevin Kopelman : Great. I just wanted to dig into the cost trends that you're seeing in April and also what you're planning for going forward. So could you help us think about that? Maybe starting with advertising, how that might trend relative to that new bookings metric? And then moving on to personnel and your other big chunks of expenses, what you're planning for there? Glenn Fogel : David, why don't you... David Goulden : Yes. Thank you, Kevin. Thank you, Glenn. Let me take that. So marketing expenses are going to correlate quite closely to the rate of newly booked room nights. So you can assume a close correlation there. I've actually walked through a number of these in the prepared remarks to Q1, Q2, but just to summarize, sales and other -- obviously, a piece of that is -- a large piece of that is tied to our merchant platform, and that is variable with volume, but things like customer service costs and bad debt, as you saw, was a major factor in Q1. Those may continue to be a factor in Q2. Next biggest area, of course, is personnel. And as we mentioned, the hiring freeze and the other actions that we took did not have much of an impact in Q1. In Q2, you'll get the full impact of those. Also to the extent that we are successful with our application for kind of aid that would generally help Q2 and some of the optimization actions that we've already taken, like KAYAK and OpenTable, will also help Q2. So as we move through the year and continue with optimization activities, that will also help with personnel expenses. We move through the year, although the government aid programs will be mainly focused upon Q2 and not the second half. As I mentioned, the pressure on decrease on G&A, particularly as we start to lap the DST expenses last year. And information technology is an interesting line. We saw obviously a fair amount of pressure on that in Q1. I pointed out that some of those costs related to our volumes. And even though our revenues were basically not pretty high in Q1, the volumes that we had to process through the business through refunds and cancellations, et cetera, were also high and that drove it costs up. That was one of the factors. We expect there to be less pressure on that line going through the rest of the year. Kevin Kopelman : And then if I could just ask one quick follow-up. Can you talk about how successful you've been in getting refunds out to customers who have had to cancel and also helping them coordinate refunds when they're dealing with the hotels? David Goulden : Yes. Well, Glenn. Glenn Fogel : Yes. So this is a difficult issue. We have customers who have purchased reservations far in the future perhaps, that were nonrefundable. And then there was a case of a pandemic and is a force majeure situation. We have a situation where the customer says, well, I can't travel because the government has said that you cannot travel there and we have hoteliers who are saying, wait, I can't refund everybody, I may have even spent the money here, and it's a difficult situation. So we always believe in trying to do what is best for the customers, and our contracts with our hoteliers is completely set up for this exact situation -- in force majeure situation, in which case, go over a long history of travel. That in a situation like this, the hotel should refund the customer. So what we'll do is we will provide monies to the customer and recover from the hotel. Now we've talked about that there is an issue.  Many of these hotels are closed right now. There's nobody actually there to have discussions with. We hope to get a significant portion over, but we don't know yet if you're not talking with the people. We always want to come up with a good relationship with hotels. So as they reopen, as things start again, we want to do this in the best way possible. I don't think we have any specific numbers to give. David has put in the reserves. And I think that's -- we hope for the best going forward. Operator : Your next response is from Naved Khan of SunTrust. Naved Khan : Just a couple of questions. So in the new bookings that are coming in, are you seeing any kind of pattern in terms of people -- more people opting for maybe alternative lodging versus the hotel or quite diverse? And then in terms of just the fixed cost, I think, David, you gave us a sense of where these were on your Q4 call. I think you said less than 50% of the OpEx. And after the initiatives that you're taking -- that you've taken or will take -- give us a sense of where these could land ultimately. David Goulden : Yes. Naved, on the new bookings, I mentioned the fact that we're seeing a bit of, what I call dumbell in the current patent, which means that they're either pretty close to the current stay or they're a long way out. What happened in the first quarter is hotel and alternative performed about the same. So they basically were almost in lockstep from a growth point of view throughout the quarter. In April, we saw a shift to alternative associated with those longer-term bookings. So we saw alternative combinations doing better in the April bookings, particularly at the far end of the dumbbell, which is the two month plus out bookings, particularly in the domestic markets where we saw some decent return rates in the domestic markets in the month of April.  So that's what we saw relative to the mix. On the fixed costs, we are still, as Glenn said, I think you have more detail in his commentary. We are still building our optimized plans for many parts of the business. We really only put those in place yet. In one of our business segments, and we're working through the other business segments as we speak. And of course, the timing of that is also going to be tied to what we're doing around some of the government A programs. So I don't want to come with the number just yet. I'll give you a data point, for example, that the reductions that we took at KAYAK and OpenTable, reduced the personnel and off expenses there by about 20%. And those will be part of that fixed or semi-fixed cost base we talked about. That's one example. Beyond that, I really don't want to go into any of these will be come to finalize our plans yet, but as we do and when we do, we'll let you know what we expect them to do to our cost base. Naved Khan : Got it. Thank you and good luck. Glenn Fogel : Thank you. Operator : Your next response is from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Unidentified Analyst : This is Alex Wang on for Brian. Just two questions. One, Glenn, you talked about sort of positioning the business to become stronger. Can you talk to us a little bit how you think about new strategies or approach in the U.S. market specifically coming out of the downturn? And then the second question, just given the state home dynamics and with strong social media use, do you see an opportunity to potentially use more social advertising to drive growth coming out of the downturn? Glenn Fogel : Thanks, Alex. It's very important for us as we come out as optimize to make sure that we're doing everything we can to become a better competitor in the U.S. We've talked in the past that we believe we under-index in the U.S., and that is something that is important to counter and be able to do. One of the things that we believe is providing a better overall value proposition to the customers. It's also as we talked in the past, and making our customers more -- or potential customers aware of this better value proposition. And that goes through the connected trip that we've talked about in the past. Now importantly, we think that we'll be able to buy something different and better to the consumer. But your point is a good one about social media and how do we get that message to those consumers. And with our CMO came from Google, who has been here about 10 months now, we absolutely believe that social area -- social media is a way to try and drive that message to the consumer. And we will be doing things in the future, albeit always looking what's the right ROI for that. It does us no good to waste advertising money. Operator : Your next response is from Lloyd Walmsley of Deutsche Bank. Lloyd Walmsley : Two questions, if I can. First, can you just talk about how you see the P&L coming out of this? And specifically, do you think that performance marketing can structurally benefit perhaps from lower competition in advertising auctions? And then secondly, wondering if you're seeing any shift between kind of urban and more ski and beach type of locations in April bookings? And given somewhat of a shift to alternative, give us an update on how you feel about your whole home inventory position as people perhaps look to locations with less urban density. Glenn Fogel : All right. Well, let me start with the second one first about the nature of the -- where is the demand going in April and such. And I can't give any more specifics beyond what we've already described to a slight increase in people going for the alternative accommodations over home. I can say, no, there's not a lot of skiing in April. So that's what I can tell you. Remind me, your first question was. Lloyd Walmsley : First question was do you -- how do you see the P&L coming out of this? And then might there be some longer-term structural benefits and lower competition in advertising auctions? Glenn Fogel : Yes. So one of the things that I think is important to understand, while we do believe that, certainly, because of this pandemic, some of the smaller players in the industry are going to have trouble going forward. But the big players are still going to be around. They're going to be very competitive as they were in the past. And they are the ones who are the sophisticated players in the performance marketing area. So I don't think it's going to change a great deal there since the people who've been -- we competing against the past are going to be the same people going forward. So I don't see significant change in there. In terms of the P&L, when we get to that place down the road, that training sun where we have fully recovered, I hope to be doing what we did in the past, have the leading margins in the industry and still growing nicely. And that's about the best one can put forward in terms of a long-term prediction. Operator : Your next report is from Doug Almond of JPMorgan. Unidentified Analyst : This is Dave Young on for Doug. So first one, can you talk about your business travel mix, what the mix was going into COVID-19 and do you have any data that suggests maybe what business is helping recovery in some of the markets where you are seeing some? And then in those markets where you are seeing some pickup in demand, were those countries recovering in a similar manner? Just looking to see if the timeline in those countries can help educate us on how other country recoveries might look like going forward? Glenn Fogel : So why don't I take the latter one -- I'll let take the former one. One of the things I think is somewhat -- I think it's something that can be deceiving in terms of trying to take what has happened in one country and then model outcomes everywhere else. And we've seen a little bit of cases where countries have begun to open up doing better. But then because they opened up the economy, there's a resurgence in infection, and then they put in the reinstatement of the restrictions and things go back. And I think it's hard to do that. And also, you have different countries that have different travel patterns. And also -- so I definitely would not -- I definitely would not take what is happening in one and then apply that across the entire world, saying, okay, that's how this is going to roll out. I think that'd be a chance to come up with a very bad prediction for the future. And David, in terms of the first question? David Goulden : Nothing really -- no major update on business travel as we don't have a formal percentage. We have a self-declared estimate that maybe as much as 1/5 of our business might be business travel, but it's not an always in number. It's not a number that we really track or spend a lot of time looking at. It's basically just a self-declared booking field. What I would say is -- and obviously, as Glenn said, we're just talking about very small deviation. We're trying to give as much color as we can for what we saw in April. What I will tell you, and it's pretty obvious that our domestic business was -- rates grew appreciably faster than the international rates. And to the extent that business travel was international. That's still very depressed. I'm not saying a large piece of -- obviously, a chunk of it is. So that's another way to look at it. We don't really have any specific data for the month of April, what happened to business travel versus non-business travel other than the fact that we know what happened to domestic versus international. Operator : Your next response from Stephen Ju of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Stephen Ju : Earning and experimenting to merchandise better to the customer and connected travel have been themes you've been talking about for some time now. But with the demand environment being what it is, does that slow down the product development team in terms of the ability to innovate because I guess there's a comparative lack of data and consumer behavior. I guess your competitors are probably struggling with the same difficult circumstances as well. But strictly, as you think about what you wanted to achieve for booking in terms of product development and what the company looks like on the other side of the crisis? Glenn Fogel : You're right. One of the things that's been a great advantage for us is our experimentation ability because with more data, we able to come up with insights and be able to develop things much faster. And that's always been a great advantage for us. And if there's no demand, you're right, it's hard to put something in and say, is this working or not? How well does this work or not. So I agree with you that, but 1 can still make great insights with what, in comparison, a small amount of data, but still can give you the insights. Don't forget, we were a lot smaller 10 to 15 years ago but we were able to come up with a lot of new things that were very valuable and help make us a leader in innovation in this industry. And we believe that we'll still be able to do that. And the connected trip will still be going forward because we do believe, and we are seeing -- we're seeing data before COVID that was indicating we're going in the right way. And I do believe that this will continue going forward. As demand comes back, we'll be able to do more and more with that data. Operator : Your next response is from Eric Sheridan of UBS. Eric Sheridan : The inventory longer term, Glenn. Any views about how supply might consolidate on the other side of COVID-19 just because of the benefits of needing scale versus some of the historical trends, which could be quite a positive for the OTAs as demand is needed and demand starts to pick up? Looking back at past periods, the OTAs tend to take share and tend to be a better partner for the hotel industry. So just curious about the relationship with supply and how you, yourself, see supply evolving over the long-term on the other side of COVID-19? Glenn Fogel : In the long run, the very long run, there'll be supply that will be commensurate with what it was before COVID and it will match up with what it is in the long run. There may be, there may be in the period right now going forward or going to this recovery, that there may be some decline in some areas of supply that just isn't as great a place to stay. And therefore, the demand doesn't go there and prices have adjusted that the better quality places are a little bit cheaper and people will go grab a take there. But here's the point. The buildings don't disappear. The hotel business doesn't -- building there -- if there's demand, it will get to maybe a new owner, it may be recapitalized and such. But it will be there. So I think in the long run, I am not concerned about a constraint on supply that impacts our ability to provide great value to the consumer at all or a chance that the supplier doesn't need us anymore. I don't see that happening at all. Operator : Your next response is from Deepak Mathivanan of Barclays. Deepak Mathivanan : Glenn, how would you characterize your answer to the previous question on the alternative accommodation side? I mean accommodations has a great mix of inventory from urban apartments to with traditional vacation rentals, and also people like hosts that are using this in homes. Have you seen any meaningful disruption on that side? Is that something that's going to change meaningfully long-term in your view? And then second question, I was also going to ask about your thoughts on investing behind brand. It feels like particularly in markets like U.S., you can invest on brand and then support it with some of the direct channels to capture a meaningful share of the initial recovery demand. What are your views on that? Glenn Fogel : Let me talk about the first one, we'll go back to the second one. So in terms of alternative accommodations, interesting question about will there be decline in the supply because there's no demand right now for many of them, and they just say, well, I'm not going to bother this, one. Two, is there an issue people are -- decide this isn't a great thing to do because they're concerned about having strangers in their homes and just don't want to have that, how long does that go for? You have also the trends beforehand about the regulatory environment, this issue of the pandemic increase regulatory restraints on the supply or not. The flip side of that is very interesting, of course, is where did the Airbnb and a lot of this business really come out of was the Great Recession in 2008, 2009, where a lot of people said I need to get extra income, so I'll rent out my spare bedroom or something of that nature.  Now of course, it's more to do a much more professional, I think. I think in the end, this is a good business for everybody. People like alternative accommodations. The people, the host, people own these properties, people are doing those cone industries, they like it. It's good money. And as demand comes back, they'll continue to do it. And there will be supply to meet that demand on the demand side. People, as you see right now, in just April alone, people see a need for it. I think that's good. I really don't see a lot of changes. One of the things -- and I'll just use your question to point to this is that people think the world is going to be so different and I don't think the world is going to be hugely different once we get past this. There have been pandemics in the past. I'll go back 100 years, go back, Hong Kong, flu, there have been pandemics. There have been terrible things. But in the end, people want to travel, people are willing to supply accommodations. And I don't see that there's going to be a great change in the long run. And your other question was? Deepak Mathivanan : Yes. It was just on using brand advertising and supported with direct channels to capture a lot of the incremental demand during the initial recovery curve. Do you think that's something that's possible? How are you thinking about it, at least in certain markets like U.S., where it feels like brand advertising can be more efficient initially? Glenn Fogel : Well, we're talking with the whole marketing team about that. One of the things you don't want to be doing. The reason we're not brand advertising right now is you don't want to be putting a message out when nobody is really listening or very few people are listening to it and you're spending the money for the number of people who you're spreading this message to who really are not interested in traveling right now. That's not an efficient use of the money. I talked a little earlier about we really want to be ROI-efficient in this. So I'm not sure -- certainly, when we think that enough people are ready to travel, then it'd be good to start pushing that message out to them. The critical thing is, when is that right point. We'll be measuring very carefully to see when that right time is. Operator : Your next response is from Justin Post of Bank of America. Justin Post : Two questions, and I apologize I have been asked. But first, thinking about your merchant platform today, much bigger than before. Does that help you when people are ready to come back and hotels are engaging with different offers or pricing or things like that? And then secondly, if you assume where people are going to travel in their own countries versus international, does that change anything for ADRs or your market share or your take rates? Glenn Fogel : Well, I'll do the first one. I'll let Dave talk to the second one. The merchant platform will be very important, and that's why we do believe it's unimportant is to continue to invest in our payments product and get that out because, as you point out, providing value, providing the right price, putting it together through that connected trip. That's one of the things we've talked about a lot. We still believe this is a great thing for consumers, really being able to put together different packages in a way. So paying one way and clearly, one of the things, too, is us having more control over the cash makes it much easier if a refund is needed to be doing it from one thing instead of a customer having to deal with refunds from their air, from their hotel, from their car, maybe other things that are -- attractions. They did all different people they talked to try and get refund from. By doing in one package connected trip with us through our merchant payment platform, we'll be able to give much better value, both in the time when they buy it and even if they have to deal with getting a refund. So that's more important. And David, I'll let you talk about ADRs and what do you think. David Goulden : Yes, sure. Thanks, Justin. So historically, both ADRs and length of stay been a little shorter for domestic travel because people's longer trips would be international and therefore, they've been going towards higher ADRs and long length of stay. Now to the extent those international trips get moved back into the domestic marketplace, that distinction may actually not be as great. Because if the domestic marketplace was generally more short-term-oriented and that mix shift and it becomes more the place where people want to go for the longer major vacations, et cetera, that may not be as big a factor as it was before. And there's really no difference to take rate. Operator : Your next response is from Daniel Powell of Goldman Sachs. Daniel Powell : Great. Two, if I may. First is kind of to build on the question around timing of advertising and when you decide to sort of step back on the gas. I guess sort of what are you looking for sort of indicate when would be a good time to step in? And what would your expectation be around ROIs, if there's been somewhat of a vacuum created from hotels and other partners perhaps not being as able or willing to spend when things start to look a little bit better? And then the second question, you mentioned maintaining good relationships with your suppliers. Wondering if you could sort of give us a sense of during the global financial crisis, what did your relationships, what did your access to inventory look like coming out of that environment versus what you might expect in this one? Glenn Fogel : Sure. So regarding the brand advertising, I'm sure you'll forgive me for saying, I'm not -- I really don't want to give away exactly when we're going to put on the gas or what the signals are so our competitors can then get a jump on that. I'm sure you all understand that. Look, it is important, though, for us to feel that we are going to be effective in using that brand advertising and going through it. And as the question earlier about there's a lot of the things that we can do desktop now and be able to put out what is half video, half of -- half brand enhanced performance through video channels that you can start seeing some better response and a better sense of where your ROIs are not be able a little bit more selective in how you use that. I think we're going to definitely be pushing that way.  In regards to the supply relationships and the Great Recession as a model going forward, we were very pleased to see that -- and this is why we feel comfortable and confident to talk about how a deep recession can be helpful to distributors because in the past, the suppliers leaned in heavily into distributors who have demand for the obvious reason, that if you're a hotel and you're running 40% or 30% rate, you need to get that demand, and we're here to provide it to them. So that helps build that better relationship and I do think that's what you're going to see going forward. And I do agree. I think that some of them may not be doing as much brand advertising as perhaps they were in the past. That'd be due to cash constraints and other things where they need to make sure they're maintaining a certain amount of cash flow. Daniel Powell : Great. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next response is from Lee Horowitz of Evercore ISI. Lee Horowitz : Great. Given the moves you guys have made with your balance sheet and shorten things up and obviously depressed private and public valuations, I'm wondering how you're thinking about your potential ability to be an acquirer of assets across the travel space during this crisis, given your strong balance sheet? Glenn Fogel : Well, we like -- we always like having a strong balance sheet for many reasons, that being one of them. And of course, valuations, as we know, have changed drastically, but they've changed drastically for a reason. And so a risk factor is significantly increased than it was a short time ago. So our way we approach acquiring assets or any type of acquisition, is always the same, which is we measure in terms of what will add to our business for the franchise to help consumers and partners, what is that's going to be great. What do we think about management? Do we think they're good? Do we think they can help us or not? And if not, can we operate this or will this add without that management team? This is something that we always we built our company through M&A, as you know, and we're going to continue to look out for that. But we recognize that this is a frothy time, and we have to be careful and picky in terms of what we do because the risk factors are much higher now. And Dave, do you want to talk anything more about the balance sheet or no? David Goulden : No. Operator : Okay. Our final question is from James Hardiman of Wedbush Securities. James Hardiman : So really appreciate all the data points on March and April, obviously, somewhat limited. But I wanted to take a step back. I was curious if you guys have done some consumer work, seems like you're in a unique position to sort of understand what types of travel consumers are most likely to reengage in the soonest? Obviously, there's air travel, hotels, restaurants, vacation homes, apartments, even car rental, all of which you guys have your -- a piece of, how are you thinking about which of those are most likely to resume normality, the quickest? Glenn Fogel : Well, what we've seen is the hotel area, and Dave talked a little bit about what we've seen in that, a lot of air is still extremely limited, whether by government restrictions, like people to go to certain countries or the amount of flights and times available, and people just on fearful about getting on a clean right now. And you may have seen, for example, the RyanAir data that just came out in Europe, RyanAir is a good bellwether for air travel in Europe in April. It was essentially almost nothing, but really almost nothing. And that's, unfortunately, what we've seen in other parts of the world, extremely low amounts of air travel. But it's all will go somewhat together as people feel more comfortable about how their entire situation. It's the vaccine we talked about, it's a treatment perhaps, it's also in their economic situation, all those things. So I think what we'll see as things start coming back, yes, some things will be the other one. But I think overall, it will all come back pretty very similar. James Hardiman : Got it. And then last question for me, if I may. It sounds like you're not quite ready to give any sort of a monthly cash burn number, just given some of the expense optimization that's still going on. But maybe walk us through some of the puts and takes. You've got about $1 billion of deferred merchant bookings. How quickly is that coming down? Are there timing differences between when you provide refunds to customers versus when you're getting those refunds from the hotels? And then can you help us with an interest number given the transactions that's taking place as in late? David Goulden : Yes. Well, thank you, James. So this is Dave, I'll wrap up with this one. So we haven't given a cash flow projection for the year. We did give you an indication as to kind of what our cash position would look like at the end of 2021 before we did our bond offering. And now because we have significantly $4.1 billion more than that. So we're not going to get into to a monthly burn. We walk you through the changes to our balance sheet for working capital movements in Q1. Those balances will continue to reduce until we start to get travel demand occurring once again. And I think the best way to handle it is once we've really gone through our optimization plans, and we decided where we're going to reset our cost base too, at that point in time, we'll give you more color as to where we are. I do not have an interest rate number for you off the top of my head, but we can follow-up with everybody forward with that one. James Hardiman : Good enough. Appreciate it. Operator : There are no further questions in the queue at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Glenn Fogel. Glenn Fogel : Thank you. I understand there was a technical difficulty. And some of the last part of my speech -- my prepared remarks was cut off. I think what actually works out well because the last 2 paragraphs, which were actually in a nice way to close this off. So let me disclose that all for everyone. Look, we know the progress against the pandemic is going to be disruptive at times as relaxation of social distancing in some geographies may lead to a resurgence of infections and/or reinstatement of government restrictions. Our aim is to optimize the business to participate in the ultimate return of demand, manage our expenses in light of our best estimate of the shape of that return, invest in our business to build on our leadership position in the industry and serve our customers, employees and partners and build shareholder value going forward.  We have a tough road ahead of us. And we have been through many difficult issues in the past, the last few weeks, and we're going to have some in the future, the weeks, the months and quarters to come. The pace scale and impact of COVID-19 is unprecedented. But we know one day, we will be on the other side, and we are doing everything we can to ensure we are well positioned to navigate through these challenging times. We have the confidence that with a highly variable cost structure, strong cash and liquidity, great global brand awareness and some of the best people anywhere, we are well positioned to come out of this crisis and extend our leadership role in the global travel ecosystem. Now I'm going to close by giving a heartfelt thank you to all the employees, our customers, our partners and the governments as we work through these difficult days together.  And to our employees, I have never been more proud of you and your enormous efforts to support our customers, partners everywhere. We know there will be more tough days ahead. Not just for us, but for so many people industries all over the world. But I am confident we will get through it. And lastly, I want to say thank you to all the frontline workers out there. The doctors and nurses, the scientists trying to come up with a cure or vaccine, the delivery people, the people making sure they'll be food in the stores, basically, to everybody in a job that is designated as critical. To all of you working night and day to help our will get through this. Thank you from all of us at Booking Holdings. Good night. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.",

And now I'd like to introduce Booking Holdings speakers for this afternoon, Glenn Fogel and David Goulden. Go ahead, gentlemen. Glenn Fogel : Thank you. And welcome to Booking Holdings' second quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. We felt the full impact of COVID-19 during the second quarter, with reported room nights, which includes the impact of cancellations, declining 87% year-over-year. Newly book room nights, excluding the impact of cancellations, declined 68% in the quarter. The high cancellation rate of pre-COVID bookings, which we witnessed in March and April, combined with the overall weak travel demand environment, significantly impacted our revenue and EBITDA this quarter. Revenue declined 84% versus last year, and we recorded an adjusted EBITDA loss of $376 million. The first time we have produced a quarterly EBITDA loss since 2001. We witnessed the greatest negative impact from the virus in April is newly booked room nights in that month declined over 85% year-over-year. After April, room night trends have steadily improved with newly booked room nights in July, declining about 35% year-over-year. The improved booking trends were primarily driven by domestic travel with international trends, seeing much more limited improvement. In July, we reached slightly positive year-over-year growth or overall domestic newly book room nights, though, of course, there are many countries that still have negative year-over-year growth rates. In addition, it is an obvious point that our domestic business is benefiting from prohibitions and restrictions on international travel, which forces consumers who want a holiday to travel domestically. While almost all of our global markets showed improvement through the quarter, Europe and the United States had the highest contribution to the improved domestic booking trends. As a reminder, a very high percentage of our new bookings have been made with flexible cancellation policies and may be canceled in the future. And as we see, new outbreaks of COVID-19 and cancellations may increase again. While we are pleased to see signs of recovery in domestic travel, we want to emphasize that it is impossible to tell how the coming months will unfold. Unfortunately, many areas of the world continue to have very high infection rates. And in some regions, they are dealing with new outbreaks after having significantly lowered their infection rates. As a result, after a period of relatively steady improvement in many geographies, in recent weeks, we are seeing these growth rates worsen in some countries. We continue to believe that in order to recover to pre-COVID levels, we will need to have a vaccine or effective treatment, which will take time to produce and distribute globally at the scale needed. We are pleased to have recently read news about progress on this front. But we believe it will be years and not quarters before the travel market returns to pre-COVID volumes. In those countries and regions where shelter-in-place rules were relaxed and economies reopened, we witnessed booking trends improve quickly. We believe part of this initial burst of demand is due to people's pent-up desire to go somewhere after being in a lockdown situation. It also demonstrates people's deep desire to travel, providing it to safe. Throughout this initial reopening phase, we have seen new customer booking and travel patterns emerge. In line with our growth in domestic travel, we are seeing that bookers are choosing to stay closer to home, and are more interested in less urban areas than pre-COVID. The share of these types of bookings on our platform has increased meaningfully this quarter. We also see that our customers are booking more alternative accommodations than in the past, which often have the benefit of reduced potential interaction with other travelers. In Q2, Booking.com, alternative accommodations represented about 40% of all new bookings in the quarter. We've all seen an increase in travelers booking stays with more flexible cancellation policies due to the uncertain travel environment we currently face. Our platform is well-positioned to capture these travel demand patterns due to our very capable marketing teams, global footprint, extensive accommodation choice and diversification of cancellation policy and rate types. We have adapted our marketplace to operate more efficiently in this new travel demand environment to benefit both our supply partners and customers. We are working closely with our supply partners, so they can more effectively market on our platform to capture the growing travel demand. As our partners seek assistance to better respond to these new domestic and intra-regional demand patterns, we are working to provide more information, and it wise as to the nature of the demand and offering the best programs on our platform that will help them capture this demand. We are also helping our partners more effectively communicate and showcase the steps that they have taken to increase their own health and safety protocols at their properties. Something we know travelers are keen to understand, in order to make informed booking decisions. Finally, we continue to extend our payments platform to more of our supply partners, and it remains a key initiative for us this year. Developing merchant capabilities has valuable benefits for both our supply partners and bookers. As we discussed on our Q1 earnings call, we articulated a series of plans to help navigate the company through these challenging times. First phase was focused on stabilizing the business in the initial stages of the crisis, which included supporting our employees and increasing our cash position. The second phase was focused on optimizing the business for the expected decrease in travel demand over the next few years. The final phase is focused on positioning the business to capture travel demand as it develops, so that we can emerge from the crisis on a strong footing and extend our leadership position. We completed the stabilization phase and are now working through our optimization phase. These actions have allowed us to lay the important groundwork that will set us up to emerge from pandemic in a position of strength. During our optimization phase, we assessed our total cost structure and develop plans to align it with expected market demand over the next few quarters. We completed this work at KAYAK, OpenTable and Agoda in the second quarter, and recently completed in a Priceline in July. The restructuring charge we took in the second quarter only relates to the rightsizing activities at KAYAK, OpenTable and Agora. These actions had the effect of reducing headcount by approximately 22% across these brands, including some including some furloughed employees. While the cost savings net of restructuring costs will be modest this year, we expect that these cost reductions will produce over $80 million of annual personnel savings. With respect to Booking.com, we have further developed our intentions for the appropriate level of personnel and other cost reductions in light of expected business loss. Booking.com is in the process of consulting with its works councils and employee representatives and working through local labor regulations in the countries where we operate. We hope to finalize our plans and to have more definitive news over the coming months. We expect that up to about 25% of Booking.com's global workforce could be impacted by these actions. We expect that business functions most closely tied to its transaction volumes will be impacted the most. At this time, and subject to our consultation with the Dutch Works Council, employee representatives and other organizations, we estimate that these cost reductions at Booking.com could produce annual personnel savings between $250 million to $300 million. This preliminary estimate may change and we will update you in the coming months on the expected restructuring costs associated with these reductions. It is our hope to make all announcements to employees about these cost reductions by the end of 2020. In conclusion, we have learned from when we could not travel, how important travel is to our lives, whether to see family or friends, or to explore new places and cultures, travel is fundamental to who we are. Our Wish List Campaign, which drew on insights from millions customers like accommodations they would want to visit, affirm the innate desire or demand that will always endure forward travel. This campaign reiterates the energy and passion that we know remains for travel. This has been a challenging quarter and we've had to make some very difficult decisions. We believe it will take years for travel to fully recover, but I have great confidence in our employees and our capabilities and I cannot be more proud of how our entire team has handled themselves during these trying times. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden. David Goulden : Thank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I'll review our operating results for the second quarter and provide some color on the trends we saw through the quarter and into July. All growth rates are relative to the prior year comparable period, unless otherwise indicated. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Now on to our results for the quarter. In our last earnings call in May, we discussed the trends we saw early in the second quarter, including a year-over-year decline in newly booked room nights of about 85% in April. As a reminder, newly booked room nights excludes the impact of cancellations. April ultimately proved to be the low point for newly booked room night declines in Q2 as we saw a steady improvement in both May and June, driven by increasing levels of domestic travel. Domestic room night declines improved steadily in Europe, North America, and across Asia. However, we saw less improvements in the domestic declines in South America, Middle East, and Africa. Newly booked room nights for the full quarter declined about 68% as we exited the quarter down about 50% in the month of June. Our Q2 reported room nights, which include the impact of cancellations, decreased 87% for the full quarter. Reported room nights in June declined by about 55% and improving from an over 100% decline in April when we receive more cancellations than new bookings. We saw a continued improvement in the cancellation rate since April as we work through the way the cancellations for bookings made prior to COVID-19. Although we're now getting closer to pre-COVID levels of cancellation rates, this improving trend could easily reverse if we see continued outbreak to the virus or new impositions of travel restrictions, especially considering the very high percentage of our recent bookings that are being made with flexible cancellation policies. Gross bookings declined 91% in Q2, which is greater than the decline in reported room nights due to the average daily rates for accommodations of decreasing about 35% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Note that the high level of cancellations in the quarter significantly distorted ADRs. As a point of comparison, our newly booked ADRs, excluding the impact of cancellations, declined year-over-year by only a couple of percentage points in Q2. And an increasing mix of bookings in the high ADR markets like the U.S. and Western Europe helped largely offset the pressure of the offset the pressure of the broader lodging industry ADR declines. Consolidated revenue for the second quarter was $630 million and decreased 84% year-over-year. Revenue in the quarter was less negatively impacted than reported at room nights and gross bookings due to the fact that some of the cancellations we received in Q2 were for check-ins are expected to occur in later quarters. This dynamic created by cancellations in the quarter also substantially increased the ratio of revenue as a percentage of gross bookings in the quarter. The substantial the quarter also substantially increased the ratio of revenue as a percentage of gross bookings in the quarter. The substantial reduction in revenue contributed to an adjusted EBITDA loss of $376 million in Q2. While we made significant reductions in our variable expense lines reduction in revenue contributed to an adjusted EBITDA loss of $376 million in Q2. While we made significant reductions in our variable expense lines like marketing, sales and other, our more fixed expenses decreased to a lesser extent in Q2. As we mentioned, we've taken actions across the quarter to reduce operating expenses as we optimize and align our cost structure with the new demand environment. However, the cost benefit of these actions were not fully realized in Q2 and the cost reductions and net restructuring charges are expected to be modest in 2020. Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense item, decreased 85% year-over-year as we saw a significant reduction in demand in the paid channels. In addition, we substantially reduced our brand marketing spend in response to the diminished travel demand environment. We expect our marketing expenses will remain significantly below 2019 levels for the remainder of the year. Sales and other expenses decreased 47% year-over-year due primarily to a reduction in expenses associated with payment transactions as well as lower outsourced customer service costs as we move through the quarter and needed less support in processing -- reduced level of cancellations in May and June. Bad debt and other credit losses were up about 25% year-over-year in the quarter. However, we saw a far small increase in provisions in Q2 than what we recognized in Q1. We expect sales and other expansion will continue to be down year-on-year in the second half of 2020. However, the extent of the decline will be impacted by level of volume we see in the business. Personnel expenses decreased 18% year-over-year on a non-GAAP basis, primarily due to a $100 million benefit from government aid packages, primarily in the Netherlands and the U.K. Currently, we do not anticipate further material benefits to personnel expenses from government aid in future quarters. We expect personnel expenses in the second half of 2020 will decline less than we saw in Q2 as we'll no longer see the benefit from government aid. We expect the personnel cost reductions we made in Q2 at Agoda, KAYAK and OpenTable, plus the reductions we made early in Q3 of Priceline to produce over $80 million of annualized personnel savings starting in the second half of 2020. As Glenn mentioned, we have further developed our intentions for the appropriate levels of personnel booking.com and are in the process of reviewing these potential reductions with works councils, employee representatives and other organizations. We estimate that the potential cost reduction of Booking.com could produce annual personnel run rate savings between $250 million and $300 million. And because of the processes we have to go through at Booking.com over the next few months, we expect the majority of these savings will not be realized until 2021. As Glenn mentioned, we'll update you on the estimated cost of achieving these savings as soon as they're available, at which time we'll file any required amendments to our 8-K. G&A expenses decreased 43% year-over-year, largely driven by reduced discretionary spend such as T&E and other personnel-related expenses as well as lower office expenses due to employees working remotely. We expect that G&A will continue to be down meaningfully year-over-year in the back half of the year. However, the level of decline may be less than what we saw in the second quarter. Information technology expenses decreased 1% year-over-year due to lower outsourced data center and cloud costs. We expect the IT expenses will remain roughly flat versus the prior year in the back half of the year. Finally, we've broken out restructuring charges separately in the operating expenses in the P&L. The $34 million of restructuring charge to be recorded in the second quarter only relates to the rightsizing activities at KAYAK, OpenTable and Agoda. I note these restructuring charges are included in our non-GAAP results. On a GAAP basis, we incurred an operating loss of $485 million in Q2. We recorded GAAP net income of $122 million in the quarter as we benefited from an $835 million pretax gain on our equity investments, primarily related to our investments in methane. This gain was partially offset by $55 million of FX remeasurement losses on our eurobonds. We excluded these gains and remeasurement losses from our non-GAAP results. Now on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q2 end cash investment balance increased to $13.4 billion from a March ending balance of $9.2 billion, primarily due to the $4.1 billion bond and convertible note offering we completed in early April. Our long-term investment balances benefited from the $835 million gain on equity investments in the quarter I previously mentioned. These increases to our cash and investment balance were partially offset by the $1.2 billion cash settlements at one of our convertible notes in June. We had $122 million in positive operating cash flow and $52 million in positive free cash flow in the quarter. Change in working capital were a source of about $300 million of cash in the quarter compared to $820 million use of cash in Q1. The improvement from Q1 was largely driven by a Q1 prepayment of taxes in the Netherlands of about $720 million that was subsequently refunded in April. The small reduction in Q2 relative to reduction in Q2 relative to Q1 in our deferred merchant bookings and other current liability balances were mostly offset by a small reduction in our accounts receivable balance in the quarter. Our improvements -- our improved liquidity position is the result of efforts we took to stabilize our business for the immediate shock of the crisis. We'll continue to focus on a strong liquidity position for the immediate shock of the crisis. We'll continue to focus on a strong liquidity position given the high level of uncertainty created by the COVID pandemic. As a part of these efforts to bolster our liquidity and consistent with our clients last quarter, we've halted our approaches of stock and will not initiate repurchases to have better visibility into shape and timing of a recovery. Now on to our thoughts for the third quarter. Consistent with our approach last quarter, I'll not provide full quarterly guidance, but we'll instead provide you with some color on our preliminary July results, which will help you get a better sense of recent top line trends. As Glenn mentioned, our newly booked room nights in July were down about 35% year-over-year. Of course, these new bookings may be counseled in the future, especially as a very high percentage of new bookings continue to be made with flexible cancellation policies. The year-over-year decline in reported room nights in July was about 45%, which is worse than our newly booked room night decline in the month as the cancellation rate remained above prior levels. Bookings for the full third quarter may vary from July's results depending upon the level of travel demand and cancellations we experienced in August and September. We expect gross bookings in the third quarter will decline year-over-year by several percentage points more than our reported room nights due to negative pressure on local currency ADRS. And we expect revenue declines for the quarter will be roughly in line with what we see in gross bookings. We currently expect adjusted EBITDA will be positive in the third quarter, given the trends we're seeing in our business so far through July, as well as the fact that Q3 is our seasonally strongest quarter. This expectation is based on the assumption we do not see a meaningful increase in travel restrictions or shelter in place rules or decrease in consumer willingness to travel as a result of continued or increased core outbreaks in the quarter. As we noticed -- as we noted, we've seen an improvement in our newly book room night trends to continue into July, largely driven by domestic travel. Our newly booked domestic room nights increased slightly year-over-year in the month of July for the first time during the COVID pandemic. Domestic room nights represented over 70% of our newly booked room nights in both Q2 and July, up significantly versus 2019, which was about 45%. Our Booking.com is domestic, alternative accommodation newly booked room nights increased nicely year-over-year in July. And its domestic core accommodation newly booked room nights were down slightly. We continue to monitor other changes in Booking.com's customer booking behavior. We have seen the length of the booking window begin to return to prior year levels in June after expanding versus the prior year in both April and May. Mobile bookings, particularly through our app, continue to gain share in the second quarter into July. And finally, we continue to see greater than 50% of our newly booked room nights coming to us through the direct channel. On a regional basis, Europe and the United States have been the largest contributors for the improvement in newly room night trends since April. However, as Glenn mentioned, in the past weeks, we've witnessed a plateauing or deterioration of new booking trends in several places that have seen increasing outbreaks of COVID-19 cases, including Spain, Belgium, Australia, Japan, Vietnam, Taiwan and the U.S. We've also seen an associated increase in cancellation rates in many of these places. These recent trends are a reminder we're still in the very early days of a fragile recovery that will likely be uneven for some time to come. As Glenn emphasized, this has been a challenging quarter that has involved some very difficult decisions and a number of other actions that will ultimately help us optimize our business with expected level of market demand. We have confidence that through these actions, we'll be well positioned to come out of the crisis and extend our leadership role in the global travel marketplace. With that, we'll now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Kevin Kopelman with Cowen. Kevin Kopelman : Great. Thanks a lot. I appreciate the update and all the details on July. Could you talk about what you're seeing from your data in terms of market share, whether you're taking market share based on those July numbers? And if so, what are the key drivers there? Thanks. Glenn Fogel : Hi, Kevin. It's Glenn. No, we don't go around trying to at what we think our share is up or down. Obviously, you probably have a very good idea to what you think of our competitors and where they are. I will say what David said is, we are pleased with what we saw in July. What I think what's very, very important that everybody, keep in mind that this is a very volatile recovery and the countries that David went out and listed that we have seen increased outbreaks. That was not a complete list. We'd use up the entire time if we listed every single place that have seen places that are suddenly having increases in COVID. So I would caution, again, just what David said, yes, we were pleased with what we saw in July. But we have to be careful about the future. Kevin Kopelman : Thanks. And then if I could ask one other question on the cost cuts. You mentioned $250 million to $300 million in personnel is that a good number for kind of overall cost savings? Or what would that number look like if you included all the actions you've taken across the company to cut back? Glenn Fogel : Yes. Kevin, we gave you two numbers. We gave you $80 million annualized for the brand apart from Booking.com. And then $250 million to $300 million for the potential savings of Booking.com based upon all the process points that we talked about. So those would directly impact the personnel line. So those we've broken out. We mentioned in some -- many other areas of the business, our expenses are down, but we haven't really work through all the details exactly what those are going to be is we are focused upon our employ our employee-related costs first. But obviously, with less people, there will be less expenses to come with it in other areas. And as we work through those plans as well, we'll make them available. But the biggest change is going to be to personnel cost. Kevin Kopelman : Thanks, David. Thanks, Glenn. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Chris Kuntarich : This is Chris on for Lloyd. Can you just first talk about the performance of your alternative accommodation business in the quarter in July? Just curious if that was growing. And yes, whether or not you guys in testing new distribution channels in the quarter. David Goulden : So Chris, one of the things I think -- and let me go to the Q2, that 40% number that I gave in my opening remarks, and as we said, that is an increase. It's a big number compared to what we had seen in the past. And it's something that we're pleased. But of course, we all, I think, have a good sense of what's going on. And that is a change in demand because people's concern about being in a large group and a hotel lobby. I think the thing that we really have to think about is what do we think about in the future. Is this a momentary thing? Or is this something that's going to continue long-term or not? And I'll say one thing that we talked about in the past is how we want to continue. We say, this in one for COVID that we want to continue to build our alternative accommodations. Now we thought it was an important thing for us to continue to build out all the types of alternate combinations, and we recognize that we are probably short in certain types, particularly the single property, home type property, and we want to continue to build that. And we also talked that. And we also talked about -- we thought that we were perhaps under-indexing in terms of awareness in certain geographies like the U.S., for example, and we want to continue to improve upon that. So we're going to do that. And we certainly are going to use every single marketing channel we can to get that information out to consumers that we have a great product, and that is something that they can look to us to get a great deal. And that's something that I think is important. I am very pleased, of course, with the numbers we saw, but I also like the fact that we are perhaps the unique in the terms of all the types of combinations we are able to provide all throughout the world. And that's given us, I think, a great opportunity going forward. Chris Kuntarich : Got it. And if I could just squeeze in there a quick follow-up here. Just thinking about marketing ROIs here. Could you just talk about what you guys are seeing in the performance marketing channels? Yes, it looked like you had gained a lot of share in Trivago. I was curious, if there was any other channels you guys were seeing similar results. Glenn Fogel : Well, I think, I'll confine myself saying, look, we're always looking for high-quality traffic at the right price. Now when I say, high-quality, they want to convert well, one of the low probability of cancellation, I wanted to come back to us later directly. And that's what we're going to continue to do and we've always done that. And that's no change from our previous way to run our business. Chris Kuntarich : Got it. Thanks. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Alex Wang : Hi. This is Alex Wang on for Brian. First question, can you just talk to us about the new growth opportunities like the U.S. or in destination, in areas you're focused on to improving the go-to-market strategy, particularly in the U.S.? Glenn Fogel : Alex, you say -- so you're asking what is our -- just in general, you\u2019re saying -- again, our go-to-market in the U.S., you're saying? Alex Wang : Yes, that's right. So, ability to sort of maybe, yes, improve sort of the brand and then growth opportunities in the market like the U.S. and then any difference in the go-to-market strategy? Glenn Fogel : Yes. Okay. So, we have said this in the past and I\u2019ll repeat clearly more so now. We think the U.S. is a great opportunity for us. We think we under index, we've got a great partners. I was just saying, all types of accommodations. And with what we're building with our connected trip, we think we're going to offer an incredible value proposition to consumers. So we are absolutely excited about the long-term future of Liz right now. Yes, people are traveling a little bit more, certainly than they were in April. But we all know what the situation is right now. And what you don't want to be doing is spending a lot of money pushing out a brand message, if people are not hearing -- are not listening to it, because they are not ready to travel or they can't travel. So we want to be careful about that. So I think we're going to have to wait. And so we have a healthier environment, where people -- more people are ready to listen to that message, before we're going to start spending money on it. Alex Wang : Got it. And just as a follow on. With the reported or stated -- sort of, reduced headcount at Booking.com, can you give more color around areas of the company that you're looking into here. Particularly, given, I think, Booking.com has been run pretty lean in the past. And then, just sort of higher level, how does this change your investment priorities beyond hotels now compared to where they were pre-COVID? Glenn Fogel : So we made very clear in our discussions with our employees, our works council, our employee organizations. And everyone have to have these conversations with. As you know, there are different regulations around the world in terms of potential conversation to have. We made it very clear that the higher wage is going to be on volume-related positions, because our volumes are way down. Those are the ones. And I made it very clear how much I believe in the future of the connected trend, the investments we're making, the things that we believe in the long-term will give us a competitive advantage over everybody. And I would -- I think, I'd be doing the wrong thing, if I was saying, we should stop trying to invest in those areas. I think they're important for the long run. And, yes, this is a terrible time right now. And yes, our financials are being hurt by this. That, to me, does not mean we should stop investing in our future. Alex Wang : Great. Thanks, Glenn. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Eric Sheridan : Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe two, if I can. Glenn, curious what you might be doing in terms of investing on the supply side during a period of lower demand? As you said, the mix shift moving towards alternative accommodations to some degree on what people are on the book. Is there anything you're doing in terms of changing some of the strategy of partnering on supply or trying to bring supply on against the demand environment you find yourself in. That's number one. And then maybe on the buyback, I know, you need to see a better environment to come back to the capital return policy, can you give us a little bit of sense of what that environment might have to look like? Like what should we be looking for from the outside in that you would need to see in the business, before you're back to returning capital? Thanks so much for any color. Appreciate it. Glenn Fogel : Sure. I'll take the first one and I'll let Dave talk about our potential capital return at some point, balance sheet in general. So one thing we've talked about in the past a great deal is, if there was a recession, what's going to happen in terms of the supply relations. Would they be more willing to lean in with us? Would they be more open to conversations? What will they do? And what we've been seeing, and it's pretty much what we thought would happen is that, when demand goes away and supply is looking for demand, they're looking to do it any way they can and they are open to conversation that perhaps they weren't in the past. So our teams are out there talking with on the supply side and whether it be alternative accommodations, properties or in the big hotel tans or anybody who is in our business. Right now, they need demand, and they're looking for can you supply to me. So our teams are coming up with creative in different ways to try and provide something that will help them because we now look, we this number two sided marketplace. We got to do good for both sides. And that's what we're doing right now and I think we're making progress with it. We're having some very good conversations that may not have had in the past. But I think that in the future, we will hopefully have this be a long-term better relationship with some of our partners as we continue to develop ways that we show their win-win for everybody. David Goulden : Yes. And Eric, on the buyback side, just to elaborate a little bit upon what I said. So, I said, we certainly would not initiate and so we have better visibility into the shape and timing of a recovery. So, what do we mean by that? We mean having best certainty as to what the future looks like. And when it's going to happen and what the shape of the recovery is going to look like. Nobody is predicting a V-shaped recovery now. I think that's not what people are looking at, but we're looking at some period of uncertainty right now. Until we figure out more about what's happening with vaccine and how that would impact people's comfort. And then, of course, is the economic impact of the COVID prices and what that does to people's ability to travel and spend money, so all these things go into it. So, there's not a single milestone to look for. But if you ask me to characterize the environment, which we will consider, reinitiating capital returns, it would be an environment where we have much more visibility and confidence into the shape of the future. Eric Sheridan : Great. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Naved Khan with SunTrust. Naved Khan : Yes. Thanks a lot. Maybe, Glenn, can you maybe shed some light on the mix of direct versus paid bookings, I think historically, you talked about how directors think historically, you talked about how directors had already crossed 50% market. How does it look does it look today? And do you think that today? And do you think that maybe an elevated level of direct bookings can continue to occur on a go-forward basis? Or would you think of that as a temporary shift? And then I have a follow-up. Glenn Fogel : Sure. So we've said this and we will continue to say how important we believe is direct booking is really where we want to be in the future is provide such great value than our customers, once they learn about this, they come back to us directly. They don't want to think about going somewhere else. And such great value that our customers once they learn about this by, they come back to us directly. They don't want to think about going somewhere else. And through the connected trip and building up all different types of, let's say, lower friction type ways to travel. That it makes it so that we are the first thought always. I'm not sure, David, if you want to give me more color to where we are now. I'll let him do it. But I will say the system is important to us. David Goulden : I think, Glenn, as we said, we continue to be over 50% direct. But I think there are some important things that are driving that, which are good indicators. And we mentioned them briefly a little bit on the last call as well. I mentioned in my remarks earlier that we continue to see the app being an important contribution because that is really our stickiest kind of touch point with our customers because that is not only a place you go to book travel, but increasingly, it's way interact with us during the travel experience, which is very important as well. And we also see, as we mentioned last quarter, we also see things like an increasing percentage mix from our Genius customers as well, this quarter as well. So these are positive things correlate long-term to a higher mix of direct bookings and just this ability to create, as Glenn has said a few times, the connected chip, where you're not just booking with us and then going on the trip, but you're really booking multi verticals. You're interacting with us during the trip, we're providing things like dynamic customer support, et cetera, a very different environment in the future, which is obviously powered by big data, machine learning, AI, et cetera. So, we think these are important signs that we're moving in the right direction. Naved Khan : Great. And the follow-up I had is really just to clarify the domestic mix you gave us, Glenn, 70% domestic. How does that treat the EU -- treat it as a single entity? Or are you looking at country levels? Glenn Fogel : It's a country domestic. We do -- we sometime look at our region, Intra regional. But if you're an Italian tourist and you went to France, that's not a domestic travel. Naved Khan : Got it. Thank you. Glenn Fogel : I'm looking at David, just to confirm. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan with Barclays. Deepak Mathivanan : Great. David, can you help us quantify the pressure on new bookings from the mix shift towards domestic ADRs, obviously, on a comparable basis are lower in various markets. But are there any other variables either from consumer spending less or staying fewer nights that will keep the bookings growth below the trends on the new room nights? And then what is the equal and dollar bookings comparable metric for the down 35 room nights during the month of July? Thank you. David Goulden : I'm going to ask you to clarify the second part, Deepak, let me ask -- answer the first part. So yes, there's obviously many moving parts with ADRs this quarter. And as I mentioned, for newly booked room nights, the ADRs actually, in total, only off a couple of points, even though there's a mix shift, obviously, within that too domestic. So we see a number of things going on. What we see is in some case, obviously, some people are substituting what would have been an international booking for a domestic booking, and those can potentially be higher ADRs because historically, international travel typically resulted in a higher ADR and longer stay. And to the extent that some of that is substituting into domestic, that could be helping our ADRs on a country-by-country basis because in some of our core countries in Europe, we actually saw ADRs up quite meaningfully in the quarter. So there's a number of mix related things going on within the whole ADR environment. And as I said, essentially flat, just down a couple of points in total in the quarter despite the fact that we know that like-for-like, there are certainly ADR pressures in the marketplace. And Deepak, I missed the second part of your question, could you just repeat that, please? Deepak Mathivanan : Yes. No, I was just going to ask, how should we think about the down 35 and room night on an equal and dollar bookings basis? Is that -- to your point, should we view that as fairly close? David Goulden : No, no, we took -- well, in terms of -- well, no, there's still going to be an ADR pressure on that. So what we said was we're down 35 in July in room nights on a newly booked basis, down 45 on a reported basis, the cancellation rates running a little higher than they were last year. And then a few points more than that down in terms of gross bookings and revenue. Deepak Mathivanan : Got it. That's very helpful. Great. Thanks, David. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Doug Almond with JPMorgan. Unidentified Analyst : This is Dave on for Doug. Thanks. Thank you for taking the questions. First one, could you talk about the profile of the people who are still traveling, for example, would you consider them to be avid travelers with higher LCVS? And they're traveling despite all that is happening? Or just people who are traveling because they have to? And could you just tie that to how important you think it is to gain shares early in the recovery? And then secondly, for David, on the fixed cost side, given your comments about cost savings being more volume related, should we expect these costs to come back with volume returning? And do you think margins will look meaningfully different when volumes return to pre-COVID levels? David Goulden : Why don't you take the first one, and I'll take the second. Glenn Fogel : Yes. So in terms of profile, I have not looked in any sort of customer segmentation recently in terms of the write-down. So I can't speak specifically in terms of deep debt on the profiles. But I would say that it would not surprise me if I did it now next week, it will show not that different in terms of what it was pre-COVID. People still want to travel, people still sometimes have to travel, and sometimes do it voluntarily, but the shape is -- the change is where they're traveling and how they're traveling. So, for example, because people can, as I mentioned, you can't travel internationally from the U.S. to Europe, let's say, what is happening, those people are traveling domestically. And we've seen that in terms of people very much wanting to travel close to home at first, because they want to be able to drive there, because concerned about getting on a plane. But in terms of the actual different types of customers within it, I don't think I've seen much of anything, except for one thing that I think is very, very critical to talk about, and that is business travel. Now we have always been a much more leisure oriented company. And we all know from the businesses that we work in that business travel has been significantly curtailed or stopped? And what does that do? Well, certain properties, certain supply chain, for example, high-end hints that are no longer able to get that high ADR revenue. And that, of course, is helping in terms of a distributor like us because we have leisure customers to help fill those things. Now how long will this go? This is a long-term trend. I think that this could be helpful to us, and may be helpful to us in the long-term. As the shift from business to leisure continues for a long time, we will be in a better position with our supply partners because we're able to provide them with what they need, which is heads and beds. David Goulden : Yes. And on the cost side of things. So yes, we said the majority of the personnel reductions will be in volume-related functions. Obviously, that will -- those will, over time, come back. We look to continue to drive efficiency in many of those areas through our business, over time through automation and other areas. So they don't necessarily have to come back for job as volume return, they will come back. And in terms of our expectation for the longer-term when we get to pre-COVID levels, which as we said, is not about quarters but is about years. We expect the business to have a very attractive margins when demand fully recovers. All things being equal, we expect to have industry-leading margins in the long-term. Obviously, the business in the future will look a little different than it did pre-COVID. For example, we're building out new products like air which will be dilutive to margin rate, but will also be important to our business and our strategy in the connected trip and selling more accommodations. So there'll be puts and takes, but we expect to have industry-leading margins in the longer term. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you both. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Stephen Ju : Okay. Thank you. So Glenn, is the nature of the personnel reductions going to be, I guess, evenly distributed across your focused regions? Or are you planning any geographical exits of the business as a whole? And I guess in a roundabout way, I'm trying to ask about your plans to go after the China outbound opportunity? And also just following up on the connected trips. You recently signed an agreement with Kiwi, I believe to distribute their content. So where are you in the integration process? And how will this be presented? Thanks. Glenn Fogel : Yes. So two separate questions. So in terms of, again, we're having our conversations with our important partners, works councils, employee organizations, et cetera, and having going through this site Booking.com. And the key thing we mentioned is how a lot of this is volume related. So where the volume is most effective areas are going to end up having a higher weighted impact. That's just the way it's obviously going to happen. I don't think you can -- we certainly are not purposely coming with a strategy change. We believe that it's important for us to be able to provide travel services throughout the world, as the leader in the world, we want to maintain that. In terms of our regular amusement, I think that's what you're talking about Kiwi, correct? Stephen Ju : Yes. Glenn Fogel : Right. So we think attractions is an important part of our connected trip theory and strategy that we've talked about. And the faster we can get different types of attractions up and running and available to our customers the better. However, we do the connection ourselves, where we go out, we partner with somebody or we buy somebody, whatever it is, we want to get that stuff up, so we can provide that value. And [indiscernible] is a great partner. They had proposition. We decide to join up. And we are now live in a certain number of cities, and we are going to continue to build that out. And I believe that this is one of the things that will help really provide value. When somebody is traveling, they use that app that David mentioned, more people use the app. And when you're in a location and you're able, just one touch be able to go to an attraction. I think that's a convenience, and we'll be able that value, a price differential. I think that, again, will give us a competitive advantage, but we're going to have the supply first, of course. Stephen Ju : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Justin Post : Great. Thanks for taking my question. I apologize, if it's already been asked, but just thinking about hotel recovery and hotel industry as they try to get back on their feet. First, how do you think about air capacity? And -- are the airlines going to be even more dependent on leisure travel? Or is there going to be a little bit of a less capacity out there? And then secondly, as the hotels really go-to-market and start filling their rooms, about maybe 2021 or 2022, what advantages -- offering discounts or promotions on booking, could they have versus maybe going to Google or your competitors? How are you thinking about really -- I don't want to say take an advantage, but really, building booking out as a great place to go to find deals and help hotels to find fill inventory? Thank you. Glenn Fogel : Yes. So two separate things. So the first thing about airlines, and I was just talking about the potential long-term change in business travel, which would, of course, impact the financial structures of a lot of airlines that make a lot of their profits when everybody is up in the front of the plane. And if that's not there, that's not going to happen. On the other hand, though, we'll know that places like Ryanair has been extremely successful in Southwest, extremely essential long-term, without having a very high, very expensive first-class or business class product. Overall, I believe that this could be a change in terms of leisure, it does become more important and that generates tilts favorable to us because we are a more leisure-oriented company. In terms of the hotels, so I said, I don't -- same type of thing with some of our partners who are more dependent on the business traveler. And as they continue to even come back or cover, it's going to -- for some of them, it's going to be a little bit harder because they're not going to get that very high ADR business person and they will be looking for someone like us. And you mentioned that going to a Google direct or hotels are going to do anything that can way to get me. If it's cost-effective, they will do it. Now over the years, we have established something that actually is more cost effective, that is an easier way and for most of the hotels around the world, they cannot get anywhere near our capabilities to bring them demand around the world. They don't operate in the number of languages we do. They don't do the customer service in those languages. They don't have the sophisticated machine learning. They don't have all the things -- I can list so many that we do, and we do it in a fraction of the cost that will cause them to even try to do that. So it's financially advantageous for them to work with us to get that demand. And as the one of the biggest demand platform in the world for travel, there's no hotel in the world discussing, well, I just don't want to do that. No, they're got to do that. And if there is a marginal benefit to go into another channel to well use that too. But I'm not concerned about hotels not coming to us even more so nowadays. Justin Post : Thank you, Glenn. Operator :   And your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC. Mark Mahaney : Okay. Thanks. Two questions, please. Glenn, have you seen any impact from the cut back in performance marketing spend by Expedia in the North American market? Does that -- have you seen any interesting dynamics? Or is the overall just dramatic decline in travel demand, just making that impossible to really call out? And then I want to ask a long-term question about -- I think if you hadn't have COVID this year, there would have been more evidence that booking was building out kind of an operating system for lodging worldwide. I think that was part of your strategy to payments, website development, etcetera. If I interpreted it right, and I think I had -- could you talk about like how much that's been pushed back because of this COVID crisis and your thoughts on if we're -- if we can possibly look out two or three years, how far you are towards building an operating system for lodging and globally? Thank you. Glenn Fogel : HI, Mark. So I can't comment much about Expedia or what they're doing. So I'm sure you see more Google puts out in terms of numbers, etcetera. We're pleased with what we're doing. It's the same strategy that we've had. We're looking to high-quality traffic. We're trying to do it. It's harder now for us just in terms of the miles we use in the past obviously are not as valuable now because cancellations are so affected by government changes. And it's a more difficult thing. We're trying to do it the way we've always done it is not is not doing anything foolish, but I really can't talk about Expedia strategy on what they're doing.  In terms of the operating system, so we're not really building an operating system in terms of going out and trying to build a PMs for hotels. That's not our idea. What we want to do is provide a very integrated benefit for the hotels that makes it so they're getting great value out of things that we're doing with them. So for example, you mentioned the issue of building websites for hotels. That's been pulled back significantly. That was -- some of that is not longer being pushed forward. What we are doing though, is working with them as we build out our connected trip. For example, let's go with a ground transportation and working with them perhaps, in a way that they don't have a way for their customers to get there from the hotel. Well, certainly, we have a way with our customers who come to us first to book, but we can also work with them. So, if a customer booked with some other distributor, not forbid, is correct. We can still create something that would enable them to also be part of that to getting that ground transportation and such. So I think that's more the orientation. Now you talk about how much has been pushed back? Yes, of course, things have been pushed back. And I think that you can always work it by the number of months that we have these kinds of situations with demand so far down is the number of months that we've been pushed back. But I did make that point about -- it was asked about the workforce reduction, the stuff. We're not stopping on investing. We're still investing, and we're still pushing forward to create this connected trip, because that will be our competitive advantage down the road. Mark Mahaney : Okay. Thanks a lot, Glenn. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Daniel Powell with Goldman Sachs. Daniel Powell : Great, thanks for taking the questions. Two, if I may. On the first, I want to come back to the direct bookings proportion and you said that it was still above 50%. I guess, could you describe some of the puts and takes and reasons that number might not be moving higher for you during this period where suppliers and competitors might be more constrained from a marketing perspective and from a scale perspective? Glenn Fogel : Yes. So, hypothesize why it's not a higher number. I'm not going to try and do that. I'll say that we're pleased with where we are with our direct bookings. We want to continue to increase it. We've seen our app downloads to be increasing nicely. We'd like -- we've seen that and like that. We're going to continue on the steady pace that we're on. Certainly, we could have increased it, perhaps if we were willing to spend a huge amount of money on brand marketing. But I made the point about why that would not be the most efficient use of our money. It would drive up perhaps the direct bookings a little bit, but at an incredible cost. So, we always want to make sure that we're getting the right bang for our buck, so to speak, and we're pleased with what the pace we're going at. David Goulden : I'd just add that when things are down on the level they are right now, I mean, we're talking when things are down over 80%. I mean, we're talking about mixed numbers now on a much reduced volume basis. So I think we're going to have to wait and see how it plays out. We're so confident that we're moving in the right direction. And as Glenn said, there are many puts and takes when things are moving as rapidly as they are with volume levels as they are. Daniel Powell : Thanks. That's really helpful. And then second one, with the shift to alternative accommodations and the relative strength that you're seeing there in the business. Is there anything from a modeling perspective, we should be looking out for their tailwinds to take rate? Are there higher customer service and payments related costs? Sort of what are some of the things we should look out for there? Glenn Fogel : Yes. We've said a couple of things about the alternative accommodation business. As you know, historically, they've had lower operating margins, not because of the take rate difference, but because basically, the reason that you just mentioned. There are typically more touch points, which we've been doing a lot of work to automate. So, we have definitely been working to close that gap and have been closing that gap. And of course, alternative operating, a nice healthy profit margin throughout 2019. So, there are some mix shift differences. There's not a massive gap between the two segments, but there is a difference, mainly again due to touch points, but things we've been working on. So, it's not a trend that we are particularly concerned about. It doesn't, in total, make a big difference to the operating margins. David Goulden : And as Glenn said, we're uniquely positioned. So, as demand fluctuates, because we believe that this push towards alternative is certainly happening when people are feeling less safe about travel, when people feel more safe about travel, potentially, things might normalize. And then we're in a great position to continue to work on all aspects of the accommodation marketplace. Glenn Fogel : And there's one thing long-term that we are thinking deeply about is, because this style of accommodation, has seen this increase, but I would imagine many people have not used it before. And they have now found it to be, it's not so bad, I like this. So in the long run, there could be a lot more demand for this, and sort of, let's say, accelerated trend that can go out for a long time. But what that means, though, there would be a change in the supply side in the long-term. And you'll see many, many people in the accommodation business perhaps who previously had not -- or just dipping their toe and creating this type of accommodation, the combination. We'll be putting investment capital into it and it becomes more and more professionalized. And as this becomes more and more professionalized, that will help lower the frictions, lower those costs and I believe what David was just talking about the difference in terms of the operating margin, and which we've already seen close tremendously will close even more so. Daniel Powell : Got it. Thanks so much for the detail. Operator : And our last question comes from the line of Lee Horowitz with Evercore ISI. Lee Horowitz : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just one, I'm wondering if we could dig in a bit on the July trends across Europe. David, you talked about deterioration plateauing in countries like Spain or Belgium, but you didn't mention any kind of some of the other regions in the area. Is it fair to think that the region as a whole continues to improve? And then, Glenn, you talked about the demand pull forward for alternative accommodations. I guess, is it fair to think that you're looking at this as perhaps a stickier trend, a structural shift that's being perhaps pulled forward from COVID? Or do you think it's mostly just the sign of the times? Thanks so much. David Goulden : Yes, let me answer the room night growth question trend question firstly. So what we saw in July and Europe was continued improvements. So we saw continued improvement in June and into July in aggregate. As I mentioned, we called out a couple of countries where we are seeing things towards end of July slowdown or go down a little bit. But in aggregate, July was up for newly room nights compared to June in Europe. Whereas in the U.S., the biggest improvement was in June and then things actually basically flattened out in July in the U.S. So Europe where things were still improving in the U.S., they flattened out with June and July being about the same. Glenn Fogel : So Lee, I'm not try to say -- I don't think it's a step change, I suppose, but it's just an extension of a long-term trend. And when you think about some of the other trends that have been happening that have been accelerated, the idea of vacations where people say, okay, I don't want to go to work on a Friday. I'm going to take me a long weekend around a place or something like that. And there with so many people who have learned that they can work remotely that increase in that, I'll take Friday off and take -- go down to the beach or get something like ultra recommendation or whatever. I see all those trends accelerating and that really helps that combinations. Because if you're going to take a couple of days away from work, where you are working, but you're not at work, you want something more than a double occupancy, hotel property. You may want a separate room that you can do your work from. So all of these things are coming together, so I think it is something that going to -- it's accelerated already. I think it's going to continue for a long time. And we feel pretty good about the fact that we are very well positioned and continue to grow out our alternative combinations. And at the same time, for the people who want that hotel. They want the resort. They want somebody else changing the sheets, we got that too. So I think for me, we're looking good for the future as travel comes back, which we know it will. It always has, it always will and the more we read about some of these vaccines perhaps coming out in the not-so-distant future, we're pretty positive about the long term. Lee Horowitz : Great. Thank you both. Glenn Fogel : Thank you. So I want to just give you some concluding remarks. And I just have to absolutely thank all of our employees again, they have been working so hard since the beginning of this crisis, helping our partners, helping our customers in these incredibly difficult times, doing it from home. The near-term may be volatile. It's going to be volatile. As I just said, I am so confident, though, about the long-term value proposition that we're putting together. And I'm actually focused on the steps we're taking today to make sure we have a better company tomorrow. Please be safe and good night. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.",

And now, I'd like to introduce Booking Holdings speakers for this afternoon, Glenn Fogel and David Goulden. Go ahead, gentlemen. Glenn Fogel : Thank you. And welcome to Booking Holdings' third quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. While the impact of COVID-19 continues to weigh heavily on our results, we were pleased to see a sequential improvement in trends in our third quarter, which is our seasonally largest, and by far, most profitable quarter. The reported room nights, which includes the impact of cancellations, were down 43% year-over-year in the third quarter, which was a marked improvement from the 87% decrease we experienced in the second quarter. Continued pressure on ADRs in the quarter slightly offset by 1 point FX benefit, led gross bookings and revenue decline by about 4 percentage points more than room nights.  We recorded approximately $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter, which was an improvement from the $376 million loss we reported in Q2, but this was 60% lower than in the third quarter last year.  As our results show, we are operating significantly below pre-COVID levels. However, we were encouraged by an improvement versus the second quarter, and we're pleased to see travelers and supply partners connecting through our platforms as they emerge from this spring's first wave of coronavirus infections. Delivering these results in what continues to be an extremely challenging and unpredictable environment is a credit to our team's relentless efforts to provide the best value and service to our traveler customers and supply partners. The improvement in booking trends in the third quarter versus the second quarter was almost entirely driven by domestic travel with a very modest improvement in international travel. As we noted last quarter, our domestic business is benefiting from government restrictions on international travel, which forces consumers who want to travel they have to do it domestically. We believe the improvements in trends we've seen in this challenging environment demonstrate people's deep desire to find a way to travel with Q3 results benefiting from some pent-up demand after the lockdowns in Q2. Looking more closely to the shape of the quarter, the year-over-year decline in reportedly nights was relatively consistent each month of Q3 as the steady improvement in global trends that we saw from April through July flattened out in August and September. In October, reported room nights declined by about 58% compared to October 2019, and over the last seven days through yesterday, declined by about 70%. We believe this worsening result is driven by increased virus infections and certain governments reimposing public health related restrictions. We believe that travel will continue to be greatly affected by infection trends and governments\u2019 public health responses. David will provide some more color on the regions in his remarks. As we think about the full fourth quarter, it's difficult to predict exactly what the next two months will look like in terms of travel demand, as we enter the winter months in the Northern Hemisphere amid rising COVID case counts in many areas. Given the trends we're currently seeing, we believe that year-over-year room night decline to be greater in Q4 than what we observed in October. If this turns out to be the case, it will be a very challenging for us to reach profitability in Q4. Despite the expected challenging fall and winter ahead of us, I remain confident in the long-term outlook for both our industry and our company. I strongly believe that people have an innate desire to travel, which will ultimately drive a recovery out of this crisis. When we think about the timing and shape of this recovery, we continue to believe that a key milestone will be a widely distributed vaccine or effective treatment, which will give people confidence that it is safe to travel. While we're encouraged by the news of progress being made on this front, we understand it will take time to produce and distribute any vaccine on a global basis to achieve effectiveness. I'm also encouraged to see some governments such as Japan and Thailand taking concrete incentives to incentivize travel. More programs like these and increased cooperative action from governments around the world would help accelerate the travel recovery. One of the progress we're seeing leaves me optimistic on the long-term outlook for our industry. I continue to recognize there'll likely be years and not quarters before the travel market returns to pre-COVID volumes. In the meantime, we continue to execute against a series of plans to navigate the company through these challenging times, and lay the important groundwork that will set us up to emerge from the pandemic in a position of strength. As we previously discussed, we've assessed our total cost structure, and developed plans to align it with expected market demand over the next few quarters. This work is complete at KAYAK, OpenTable, Agoda and Priceline. And we started to see some of the associated $80 million of annual cost savings [paid] in during the third quarter. We are making progress with our initiatives to reduce the workforce at Booking.com by up to approximately 25% with an associated annualized savings estimated between $250 million to $300 million. We've been taking restructuring action at Booking.com in various countries. And in some countries, we've implemented voluntary labor schemes. We are continuing to work with our works councils, employee representatives and other organizations to finalize plans in other countries. It is our hope to make the vast majority of the announcements to employees about these personnel reductions by the end of 2020. It's important to stress that these personnel restructuring decisions are difficult, and we do not take them lightly. Given the expected timeframe of the recovery that we have discussed, we believe that our restructuring plans are the correct actions for the company in order to right size the business. In addition to our cost reduction actions, we remain focused on positioning the business to capture more travel demand as it develops during recovery and over the long-term. Part of this effort is continuing to build towards our long-term vision of the connected trips, seamless multi-product offering, which we believe will ultimately improve the customer experience on our platform, and drive enhanced loyalty and frequency over time.  In addition, we believe offering other travel products will provide opportunities through merchandising and customer acquisition to enhance the growth of our core accommodation business. Booking.com is continuing to take important early steps to build a flight product, and recently announced the launch of flights on Booking.com in the U.S. We see flights as a key component of the connected trip. It is an obvious opportunity for us to remove friction in the booking process for our customers. The connected trip vision of providing this frictionless customer experience we brought together by a seamless payment network, which we continue to develop and extend to more of our supply partners. We strongly believe that developing these payment capabilities has valuable benefits for both our bookers and supply partners, including potentially lower payment costs for our suppliers. Also, we will continue to work closely with our supply partners to help them respond to this environment, and more effectively market their properties on our platform in order to capture more travel demand as it returns over time. Finally, let me address the matter that we are following closely and that many of you may have questions about. The European Commission is working on a new regulatory framework for the digital economy, which, among other things, proposes to designate some large online companies who operate across Europe as gatekeepers and to establish rules and regulations for these businesses. The criteria for being a gatekeeper and the associated rules and regulations are in development. So the potential impact is difficult to estimate at this time. There have been questions and speculations that Booking.com maybe one of the designated gatekeepers, which we firmly believe would be incorrect for a number of reasons. The principal reason is that the accommodations market in Europe is very open and very competitive. Consumers have multiple online and offline choices to book accommodations and accommodation providers have multiple online and offline channels for our customers.  To put this into perspective, Booking.com booked about 7% of all potentially bookable accommodation room nights across all properties on our platform globally in 2019. Across Europe, that number was about 11%. As I mentioned, a new European regulatory framework is under development, and we will update you on developments during future calls. In conclusion, we believe we are responding well to this pandemic crisis. We are providing great service to our customers and are working with our supply partners so that together we can get them as much business as possible during these difficult days. I think it\u2019s been clearly sad that we had to let go and are still in the process of letting go so many dedicated hard working people. But it is a necessary step. And we expect to have some challenging quarters ahead of us. As I said before, we believe it will take years for travel to fully recover. However, I am confident in our team's ability to execute during these unprecedented times and continue to deliver value to our traveler customers and supply partners alike and to emerge from this crisis on a strong footing.  I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden. David Goulden : Thank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I will review our operating results for the third quarter and provide some color on the trends we saw through the quarter and into October. All growth rates are relative to the prior year comparable period unless otherwise indicated. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP can be found in our earnings release.  Now on to our results for the quarter. On our last earnings call in August, we discussed the trends that we saw throughout the second quarter and into July, including the year-over-year decline in newly booked room nights steadily improving from about 85% in April to about 35% in July, driven by increased levels of domestic travel.  As a reminder, newly booked nights -- newly booked room nights excluded impact of cancellations. As Glenn noted, the steady improvements in global trends that we saw from April to July flattened out in August and September, resulting in our newly booked room nights declining about 37% for the full quarter. Our Q3 reported room night, which included the impact of cancellations, decreased 43% for the full quarter, which is worse than our newly booked room night decline in the quarter as the cancellation rates remained above prior year levels. This improvement in room night declines versus Q2 was helped by pent-up demand from lockdowns and other travel restrictions earlier in the year. At a regional level, we saw North America continue to improve as we moved throughout the third quarter. However, this improvement was offset by softening trends in Europe. Room night declines in Asia were consistent throughout Q3. Unfortunately, as we moved into September, we saw COVID case counts climbing higher in many European countries, and governments beginning to respond with imposition of travel restrictions. This difficult pattern continued throughout the month of October, leading to a further slowdown in bookings in Europe. In October, we also saw a slowdown in North America, while the room night declines in Asia remained consistent with Q3. And as a result, global newly booked room nights through October were down about 50% year-over-year, and reported room nights for October were down about 58%. Over the last 7 days through yesterday, these trends have further deteriorated with newly booked room nights declining about 58% year-over-year and reported room nights declining about 70% year-on-year. This is the global average, and in Europe, these decline rates are much higher. These recent trends are a reminder that this is a fragile recovery and that we're now seeing a second dip in our business driven by COVID. We believe that the recent increase in COVID cases in Europe and the U.S., coupled with cold weather and travel restrictions in these geographies, will result -- will likely result in the second dip being U-shaped and lasting until the early spring of 2021. Domestic room nights represented over 70% of our newly booked room nights in both Q3 and in October, up significantly versus 2019, which was about 45%. After growing year-on-year in the third quarter, our newly booked domestic room night reverted back to a year-over-year decline in October. Booking.com's domestic alternative accommodation newly booked room nights also decreased year-over-year in October after increasing nicely in the third quarter. Our October reported room night decline, which includes the impact of cancellations, was worse than our newly booked room night decline in the month as the cancellation rates remained above prior year levels. Although we saw continued improvement in the cancellation rate through the third quarter, this trend also reversed course in October. Given the recent high COVID case counts and increased travel restrictions, we expect to see further pressure on cancellation rates for the remainder of the fourth quarter, especially considering the percentage of our recent bookings that are being made with flexible cancellation policies that remains higher than the prior year. We continue to monitor other changes in Booking.com's customer booking behavior. In Q3, we continued to see an increase in the mix of customers booking alternative accommodations versus the prior year levels. However, as we progressed through the quarter and into October, we saw this increase in the alternative accommodation share moderate. Booking.com's alternative accommodations represented approximately one-third of all new bookings in the quarter. We've also seen the length of the booking window contract in the third quarter after expanding versus the prior year in the second quarter as customers made a higher share of bookings in both quarters to stay in the peak summer period. The booking window continued to shrink versus last year in October as customers focused on their short-term travel needs. Mobile bookings, particularly through our app, continued to gain share in the third quarter and October. And finally, we continue to see greater than 50% of our newly booked room nights coming to us through direct channel. Gross bookings declined 47% in Q3, which is a greater decline than reported room nights due to the average daily rates for accommodations decreasing about 8% year-on-year on a constant currency basis. As a point of comparison, on newly booked room night ADRs, excluding the impact of cancellations, declined year-over-year by only a couple of percentage points in Q3. An increasing mix of bookings in higher ADR markets like Western Europe and the U.S. helped offset -- wide offset the pressure of the broader lodging industry ADR declines. Consolidated revenue for the third quarter was $2.6 billion and decreased 48% year-over-year, about in line with the gross booking decline. Adjusted EBITDA of $1 billion in Q3 was down 60% year-on-year. And while we significantly reduced our variable cost lines like marketing and sales and other, our more fixed expenses decreased, to a lesser extent, in Q3. As Glenn mentioned, we continued our actions in the quarter to reduce operating expenses as we optimized and aligned our cost structure with the new demand environment. However, for 2020, we expect the savings recognized in our personnel expense line related to these actions will be more than offset by charges reported in the restructuring and other exit costs line. Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line, decreased 48% year-over-year as we saw a significant reduction in demand in the paid channels. In addition, we substantially reduced our brand marketing spend in response to the diminished travel environment. We expect our marketing expense to remain significantly below 2019 levels in the fourth quarter. Sales and other expenses decreased 53% year-over-year primarily due to reduction in expenses associated with payment transactions, a reduction in the provision for bad debt and credit losses as we saw an improvement in our collection rates relative to our prior expectations as well as lower outsourced customer service costs as we needed less support in processing reduced transaction volumes. We expect sales and other expenses will continue to be down year-over-year in the fourth quarter. However, the extent of this decline will be impacted by the level of volume we see in the business. Personnel expenses decreased 9% year-over-year primarily due to lower bonus accruals and reduced headcount. The restructuring actions we completed at Agoda, KAYAK OpenTable and Priceline benefited the personnel expenses by approximately $20 million in the third quarter. Additionally, personnel expenses benefited from $22 million in government aid packages primarily related to programs we were already participating in within the Netherlands and the UK. Currently, we do not anticipate further material benefits to personnel expenses from government aid in future quarters, and we expect that personnel expenses in the fourth quarter will decline about the same as it did in the third quarter. G&A expenses decreased 34% year-over-year largely driven by reduced discretionary expenses such as T&E and other personnel-related expenses, lower indirect taxes as well as lower office expenses due to employees working remotely. We expect that G&A will continue to be down meaningfully year-over-year in the fourth quarter, about in line with the decline we saw in the third quarter. Information technology expenses were up 1% year-over-year. We expect that IT expenses will be up slightly versus the prior year in the fourth quarter. Finally, we've broken out restructuring charges separately in operating expenses in the P&L. The $41 million in restructuring charge we recorded in the third quarter primarily relates to rightsizing activities at Booking.com. I note that these restructuring charges are included in our non-GAAP results. With respect to Booking.com, in September, we initiated the first wave of restructuring actions in over 40 countries, which did not include the UK and the Netherlands, where Booking.com continues to consolidate its works councils and employee representatives. We currently estimate that the remaining restructuring charge related to actions at Booking.com will be approximately $100 million, some of which we expect to record in the fourth quarter and the rest into early 2021. At this time, and subject to our consultation with the Dutch Works Council, employee representatives and other organizations, we currently estimate that these collective cost reductions plus attrition at Booking.com could impact up to about 25% of the global workforce and could produce annualized run rate personnel savings between $250 million and $300 million, which we expect to be almost fully phased-in in the second quarter of 2021. Again, these estimates may change, and we'll update you in the coming months. It's our hope to make the vast major of announcements to employees affected by these personnel reductions by the end of 2020. Our non-GAAP EPS was $12.27, down 73% versus the prior year. Non-GAAP net income reflects a non-GAAP tax rate of 41%, which is significantly higher than Q3 last year due to the impact of disproportionate non-deductible expenses, including SBC relative to a low projected full year pre-tax earnings estimates. On a GAAP basis, we had operating income of $315 million in Q3 as our GAAP operating expenses in the quarter included a charge of $573 million related to an impairment of goodwill for OpenTable and KAYAK. This non-cash impairment charge is driven by reduced financial projections and a longer expected recovery for KAYAK and OpenTable due to COVID-19 pandemic. We recorded GAAP net income of $801 million in the quarter as we benefited from an unrealized $730 million pre-tax gain on our equity investments primarily related to our investment in Meituan. In addition, we recorded a $64 million pre-tax expense in the quarter related to our French and Italian tax matters. There was also $117 million of FX remeasurement losses on our euro bonds. We excluded the impairments to tax expense, the unrealized gains and the remeasurement losses from our non-GAAP results. Now on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q3 ending cash and investments balance increased to $14.9 billion while June ending balance was $13.4 billion due to positive operating cash flow as well as the unrealized gain on our long-term investments. We generated $920 million of operating cash flow and $848 million of free cash flow in the quarter, both down approximately 50% versus the prior year. Change in working capital represented a use of cash of about $300 million in the quarter driven by seasonal effects and the impact this had in the third quarter due to a high concentration of check-ins, which resulted in an increase in our accounts receivable balance. We'll continue to focus on maintaining a strong liquidity position given the high level of uncertainty created by the COVID pandemic. And consistent with our comments last quarter, we've halted repurchase of our stock and will not initiate repurchases until we have better visibility into the shape and timing of a recovery. Now on to our thoughts for the fourth quarter. Consistent with our approach last quarter, I will not provide full quarterly guidance, but instead, we'll provide you some additional color from our preliminary October results, which will help give you a better sense of our recent top line trends. As I mentioned earlier, our newly booked room nights and reported room nights in October declined year-over-year about 50% and 58%, respectively, and at higher rates in the last week. Room night declines for the fourth quarter will likely vary from October's results, especially considering the recent rise of COVID-19 cases and imposition of travel restrictions and the impact that will have on the level of travel demand and cancellations in November and December. We expect the room night declines in November, December will be worse than they were in October. We expect gross bookings in the fourth quarter will decline year-over-year by several percentage points more than our reported room nights due to negative pressure on local currency ADRs, and we expect that revenue declines in the quarter will be several percentage points less than the decline in gross bookings primarily due to book to stay timing differences similar to what we saw during the first wave of the pandemic. Given our expectations for further reductions in room night growth from October, coupled with continued ADR pressures, we expect it will be very challenging to reach a positive adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter.  On a more positive note, if we compare our internal outlook for the full year 2020 now with where we were when we spoke to you in August, we're ahead on all major income statement and cash flow metrics. In conclusion, as Glenn emphasized, we are quite pleased with our third quarter results in a challenging environment. And while we expect the fourth quarter to be an even more difficult environment, we have confidence that we will continue to execute against what we can control. We made some difficult decisions and taken a number of actions that will help us optimize the business. We have confidence that through these actions, we'll emerge from the crisis in a stronger position.  We'll now take your questions. So Laura, can you please open the line for Q&A? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question will come from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Alex Wang : This is Alex Wang on for Brian. First, can you just -- I appreciate all the details on alternative accommodation. But can you give us a sense of how that business is doing globally sort of year-to-date? And what do you see as the main sort of investment priorities for that business, whether it may be supply or branding? And then second, I appreciate all the comments on the Booking.com launch of flights in the U.S. Maybe talk to us a little bit what you're seeing in early tests or any early learnings? And any other areas where you might want to expand to in the U.S., whether maybe packages or you talked about payments as well? Glenn Fogel : Sure, Alex. It's Glenn speaking. Why don't I take -- we'll go in reverse order. I'm going to talk around flights, I\u2019ll talk a little bit about the alternative accommodation strategy and where we're going, and then I'll let Dave if he wants to talk to you about what you want in terms of year-to-date. So talking about the things we're doing with flights. We just started it for Booking.com in the States. So it's very, very, very early. But as I've always talked about this connected trip vision, flights is a very important part of it. Many people start with flights. So we believe that it's going to be an important way to get more customers into our funnel and see all the great offerings we have. Now payments is a very important part of our overall connected trip because, one thing, if you want to offer up, for example, a package, as you discussed, which we do want to offer at -- when we get to it, you have to have a payment platform. You've got to be able to do that because you can't combine into at one price, if you're not willing to able to take all the money from the customer upfront and then distribute to the different suppliers. That's the way to do it. So these things are very important to us, and it's early, but I am pleased to see us up and running. And later on, we'll be able to come back to you, hopefully, with some numbers and give you some -- in the future, some idea of how it's doing. Regarding alternative accommodation, it's clearly an important part of the business. We talked about it last quarter, how, many people in the second quarter went for alternate accommodations when you compare it back to the 2019 numbers because for the reasons that we talked about in terms of safety, people wanting to feel that they were weren't a big crowd, a lot of the issues we talked about last time. That's important around the world. And we've always talked about how important it is to offer up to our customers every single type of accommodation they may want. And we know by having more selection, that improves the proposition to the consumer. So we're continuing to do that. Now I've also talked about how, particularly in certain geographies like the U.S., we were not getting as much of the inventory as we should have and that we know is needed in certain types of alternative accommodations, primarily the individual home unit, and we continue to build that out, too, because we know people want that one, too. So strategy is to continue to build that out and make sure that we're offering the customer what they want, when they want it.  And David, I don't know if you want to give anything in terms of this question about year-to-date. David Goulden : Yes. I can provide a little extra color, Glenn, and Alex, in response to the question. Perhaps it\u2019s just the best way to talk about things in the third quarter because the USA numbers are really skewed pretty much by what's happened so far this year in Q1 and Q2. So just to remind you, we have over [6.5 million] listings in the alternative space. We mentioned that we saw a growth in Q3 in our domestic business. And to give a little bit more context around that, within the domestic business, alternative accommodations grew low double-digits, whereas the rest of the business or the core business grew low single-digits. So that kind of gives you a spread for how they did relative to each other in the third quarter. The area we saw the biggest improvements in alternative accommodations growth vis-\u00e0-vis what we saw in the second quarter was in Europe, just another data point. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Kevin Kopelman from Cowen. Kevin Kopelman : I was hoping if you could just dig into the trends and the situation a little bit in Europe that you described from the past week. Can you just kind of walk us through how far along we are in the process of the countries kind of locking down or shutting down, maybe compare that to April and what's going on in the business, specifically in Europe, just so we understand how far along we are in that process? That would be reflected in those numbers you gave us. Glenn Fogel : Sure. Thank you, Kevin, for the question. It's obviously a very hard thing to answer because none of us are actually in the governmental meetings that are making these decisions on what to do in terms of lockdowns, how strict to be, when you're going to say you're going to open it up and they're making those projections now and they could very easily change. And people are even changing what they say week-to-week, day-to-day. And we see each day there's a new pronouncement by a new government. What we can say, though, is when these restrictions are put up, we do get cancellations right away, of course, for people who are planning to travel to certain regions. And that, obviously, is going to impact our as-booked room nights.  Certainly, people also say, \"Hey, I'm not going to make a new booking. I was going to make that new booking. I'm not going to do it because either, A, I'm not going to be able to travel there; or B, I'm concerned that, that area is going to be restricted or where I'm leaving from could be restricted.\" Now compared to April, though, I think there's a sense that I've gotten some thoughts about from some of the people who are involved in talking to our public affairs field, talking to governments, et cetera, is that they're trying to do it in a more selective way. Everybody knows the impact on the economies that a full lockdown, complete lockdown can do. So the governments are doing their best to try and not do complete lockdowns. But travel is always something that is immediately looked at as a potential increase in infections because people come from different regions. So I feel that we are still going to have a lot of disruption due to these very, very steep increasing infection rates. And I can't give you anything more than that. I don't know -- unless David, do you have anything you'd want to add? David Goulden : I just want to add, I think you said it upfront, Glenn, but just to be clear that right now, the declines that we're seeing in Europe, they're obviously worse than the global average numbers I gave you, but they're not as deep as we were back in April, just to be clear. But we do see the shape of things being a little different as well. We think -- we obviously saw -- witnessed April was much more of a deep V in terms of the shape of the first wave as those -- the shock back in the long-term bookings that were on the book got canceled. We believe that we're going into more of a U-shaped trend environment for the rest of the winter, what we hopefully is deep. But of course, the winter months are also a factor because in the North Hemisphere, particularly in Europe, it's much harder to travel to warm weather without getting on a plane. So the substitution effect we saw in the third quarter from international to domestic are probably going to be less in the winter months than we were able to enjoy in the third quarter. There are a few factors going on. But just to reinforce, it is worse than the average, but not quite yet as bad as we were in April. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche Bank. Chris Kuntarich : This is Chris on for Lloyd. You guys have made some comments earlier on about performance marketing as well as cancellation rates starting to step up. Could you just talk a little bit about your ability to deploy performance marketing dollars in 4Q as those cancellation rates step up? How should we think about kind of balancing that with the shorter booking windows as well? And then just specific to the U-shaped recovery that you guys are talking about, are you making any vaccine or any additional assumptions? I know, David, you just kind of walked through some of them, but anything else we should think about there? Glenn Fogel : So Chris, on the performance marketing, you're smart to point out the fact that cancellations is going to impact the ROI significantly. So when we start seeing virus rates going up, we are immediately taking action that we don't want to be paying for a whole bunch of clicks that are not going to end up in revenue. Even if they end up in a booking, the booking gets canceled and you end up how you spent the money for nothing. So absolutely, there's a direct relationship. And as virus rates go up, as restrictions follow up in terms of restricting travel, we are immediately readjusting our expectation in terms of our performance marketing. So that is absolutely correct. In terms of the yield, we have not made any call in terms of when a vaccine is going to be declared effective and safe, nor how long it will take to be distributed or not. I think everybody, though, has read all the news about these things. I don't think anybody is expecting a large distribution or global distribution anytime soon, so certainly not nearly in the first quarter. So we're not based on our decisions on that at all. We are hopeful, though, that we've seen what happened in the spring, and we saw government actions did help, and we saw what happened in the summer. There was that rebound, pent-up demand. So we're hopeful. And David, you made the curve. So you can explain further on how we came up with what we are -- why we're doing what we're doing. David Goulden : Well, I think, Glenn, you summarized it well. But I think that we just believe that there won't be much change in the environment in Europe and maybe in North America through the winter months. We believe that, hopefully, that when we get to the early spreading, that might be coupled with more progress towards a vaccine or vaccines. We're not making a call on when one is going to become available, as Glenn said, but hopefully, there'll be better news. But also there'll be better weather and people thinking about the spring and the ability to travel again and the prospects of warmer climates, warm weather to come. And we expect that will hopefully be kind of the slope up on the U. We are optimistic that when we see the recovery, it will be a strong recovery in the spring, as I think we saw it was in the summer this year. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Eric Sheridan from UBS. Eric Sheridan : Maybe I can broaden out the question on advertising. Glenn, how far are you in terms of what you want to accomplish over the medium to long-term in realigning your marketing channels and making sure you're maximizing for ROI? And maybe if you could just give us a little bit of color on some of the payments, while it's a low end demand environment that you might be sort of testing and learning and thinking about in terms of realigning for some of the outcomes you're looking for in a multi-year view? And maybe just a little bit additional color on some of the direct mobile booking activity you're seeing, that's quite promising for the long-term. Glenn Fogel : Sure. So in terms of the long-term view of marketing, so as you all know, we built our company based on performance marketing. We also know, though, that we need to increase awareness in certain geographies, and we've always talked about being able to do that with -- from a brand perspective. One of the things that we just tested out and is very small, very small in the States, a digital brand campaign. You may have seen it, America is For Everybody. And we did it on a digital base. That was a digital brand effect to see how that would do. You may have seen the print version in the New York Times, not very digital but having an actual printed thing, but very low cost, and we thought it's very important to get that out, really what our values are as a company and what we stand for.  But it certainly is important that we get that awareness out there, 2 areas where we are, let's say, that we are under-indexing like the States. And we'll continue to do that as demand comes back, coming up with the different ways and always testing. We're always testing and digitally, you can do it better in terms of figuring out what your ROI is or not. Of course, the most important thing for us always is providing great service, and all the things we talked about, the great price, the great selection, the great customer service. If we can get the loyalty, people come back directly, instead always having to pay all that money for marketing to get people to come back. Get people to come directly is really the ultimate goal, of course. In terms of mobile, David, why don't you want to take that one, if you want to give anything further in terms of where that is? David Goulden : Yes. Thanks, Glenn. No additional hard data points to provide now. But just to give you a little color, obviously, we said several quarters ago, we were over 50% mobile, and that's continued to increase in a positive direction. And we are pleased with the fact that the app, it continues to be a very major part of the mobile business but also increasing in line with the growth in mobile. So at the appropriate time, we'll give you a few more data points on that. But we're not quite ready to break those out today, but they are trending positively. And to Glenn's point, particularly with the app, not just as a place where we can get more direct business, but also a place where, essentially, the customer trip -- the customer connected trip will actually live and we can interact not just during the booking process but also during the trip as well in a very real way. We can also deliver the multi-product capabilities. That is super important. So we're pleased to see that move in the right direction. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan. Dae Lee : This is Dae on for Doug. I have two. First one is that given your strategy of having all property types in the single platform, can you get an update on the work that you guys are doing to surface the right property type to the right traveler at the right time? And how are you messaging the travelers who have certain property types in mind? And then my second question is on -- what's your view on overall competitive environment right now. Are you seeing that competition is holding up better or worse than previously expected through these challenging times? Glenn Fogel : So let me take the second one. I'll let David take the first one. I didn't hear it so well. In terms of the overall competitive market, the travel business has always been extremely competitive. And whether there's a terrible lack of demand because of a pandemic, or it's boom times, back -- just -- it's hard to believe, but just a year ago or so, the competition continues to exist. And in fact, it's interesting because the European Commission, the regulators who are talking about that potential new regulations coming out, interestingly, they put out a report only a few weeks ago. And in the report, it\u2019s mentioned, in fact, that online travel is considered a fiercely competitive market. So clearly, regulators recognize that, too. And I don't think it's changed at all in terms of the fact that there's a lot less demand than there used to be. I think it's always competitive and always will be. Yes, David, the first part? David Goulden : I'm sorry. Back to the first question, just kind of how we match property type to travel. I mean, that really is what our business is all about. And you could see property type to travel or travel to property type. And obviously, we do that very dynamically. So we're, of course, using machine learning and artificial intelligence. The more you visited our sites or site, the more we know about you. Therefore, we're going to optimize our results to your search to kind of match your prior needs and behavior. But of course, more recently for both the traveler and the accommodation, we'd be focused much more upon the domestic market opportunities, letting our suppliers make themselves available and attractive to our travelers. If you spent any time on our site recently, particularly Booking.com, you'll see that there's extensive information that the properties can put in now about what they've done across a number of dimensions to handle safety and health during the pandemic. So it's absolutely kind of just a core premise of how the business operates that we intelligently do that mapping and matching.  Now of course, because we have the benefit of having a very, very broad range of both traditional hotels and alternative accommodations on the same platform, we can let people filter, search, compare side-by-side on a very comparable basis. And we think that provides a unique value to a lot of our customers. But as you would expect, we've been optimizing and modifying that quite a lot. And if you search for something this time this year and compare it to this time last year because of the pandemic, you get very different priority results coming back to you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Justin Post from Bank of America. . Justin Post : Your main competitor is talking about some pretty big cost savings that they're going to be able to achieve when you look out. I'm just wondering if you can give us -- looking to the other side, how you're thinking about margins. I know in '19, your EBITDA margins were high 30s. But do you think this is an opportunity for the whole industry to get more profitable? And would you think about your margins being higher when you get back to kind of those levels of bookings? Glenn Fogel : David, why don't you take that in terms of our long-term thoughts about margin? David Goulden : Yes. Sure, Justin. Let me give you a couple of thoughts here. So first of all, we expect our business to have very attractive, and continue to have industry-leading margins when demand fully returns. There'll be a couple of puts and takes. So for example, as we build into new products like air, those will be dilutive to the margin rates, but obviously, healthy margin dollars and important to our business and strategy. And things like payments, again, will be diluted to the margin rate, but will contribute margin dollars. You have to take that into account in thinking about the long-term future. But as I said, we expect to have industry-leading margins in the long-term. Between now and when we get back to full recovery, there'll be some puts and takes. Obviously, for example, as we grow rapidly, as we expect to over the next few years, as the industry recovers, we will incur marketing expenses related to our bookings prior to those bookings turning into revenue. So during those periods of reacceleration, there'll be some downward pressure on our operating margins as we kind of build that book of business again. As I said, in the long-term, we expect to be very well positioned. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC. Mark Mahaney : Okay. Just wondering if you could talk about more recent trends you're seeing in Europe. And I apologize, I'm sure you covered this part on the call, but if you could just repeat it now or provide any more color, especially in the wake of the recent lockdowns, is that already -- do you know is that already having a shift in how people are traveling? And have you seen this kind of sustained shift over to alternative accommodations, I guess, across the business? Is that something that you think may lead to almost a semi-permanent change in consumer behavior, just a much greater willingness to embrace alternative accommodations than they were pre-COVID that's happened during the crisis, but do you think there's a reason to think that, that will be kind of a permanent condition, kind of a modest shift over there? Glenn Fogel : Hi, Mark. So as I talked a little earlier about this certainly in the prepared remarks, we've seen a significant drop and talked about the last 7 days. Things move very quickly. Changes happen very rapidly when governments make changes in terms of ability to travel, restrictions in terms of going to restaurants, non-essential shops being closed. These things make immediate impact on people. In fact, I haven't actually tried it this time, but you can watch on our systems. You can watch an announcement go out and very, very quickly. You can see the impact towards cancellations or drops in bookings for future stays. So there's an incredible correlation between that. In terms of alternative accommodations, my thoughts -- it's interesting, the beginning of the crisis, I wasn't sure which way this might go because on the one hand, I thought that people would want to not be in a crowded hotel and risk getting infected or going to elevator. And so therefore, they would want an alternative combination where they could be separate from people, but I also recognize that people may be wanting industrial strength, disinfecting of rooms and professionalized treatment of the entire place. So maybe you go for hotels.  Clearly, we've seen the statistics very early in the Q2 area where we saw that significant increase in share shift to alternative accommodations for us than we've seen in Q3. It's not as much. I do believe that the trend that has been going on for a very long time of more and more people contemplating and then using the alternative accommodations, I think that trend has just been accelerated. In fact, it brought forward what would have happened perhaps on a year or 2 years or whatever in the future because now people did try this. And now I do believe that there is a continuous shift once you've tried it. And if you like it, you're going to put it in your consideration set for the future.  Now of course, when we talked about our share of alternative accommodations in total, when there's -- let's say -- let\u2019s go to even Q2 when it was a big number, 40%. Well, that meant 60% of the new bookings were for hotels. Hotels are still a really popular way to stay, and they will always be. That's one of the things that's great about our platform because we offer both. We offer the most of both. And that is something that is a winning combination for our customers. When they come on, we know from the data that many people who come on to our site, they're not sure yet where they want to stay. And they're looking at a lot of different types of accommodations. By offering them all the different types of accommodations, that makes us a winner in terms of getting them to book it with us. And I think that's going to be what we're going to keep going forward. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Stephen Ju : Okay. So Glenn, digging in a little bit on the flexibility you called out, given what consumers went through during March and April, with trying to cancel trips and getting refunds and -- are your users choosing to go for the higher-priced cancellation-enabled option? Because I would imagine -- and I would imagine having cancellations with your hotel partners is probably a little bit more seamless versus the alternative accommodation. So is there any new work you think you might need to do to prepare your supply partners for what might be the new consumer normal of elevated cancellations? Glenn Fogel : Yes. So there is a tremendous shift into people wanting to have the free cancellation option. There's no doubt about that. And it's understandable. There's also -- we see in the booking window, people booking much, much closer into when they're going to actually arrive with their accommodation. Again, both of these things making perfect sense of what's going on around the world right now. And how long that will continue for? It's uncertain. But there was a crisis in the beginning of the year for everyone who had done a non-refundable accommodation. But then what happened is you had countries that were shutting down travel and the issue became, well, now the person can\u2019t go there. It was nonrefundable, but it's a force majeure situation. Do they get their money back? And if so, from who? Who's going to give it? The hotels aren't even around to actually give the money back, many of them, et cetera. And I will make the point of how proud I am of the customer -- our customer service team doing with all those people desperate to get their money back at the same time having to deal with the suppliers saying -- who would say, \"Listen, we're closed. We don't even have access to the money. We can't return it.\" And I'm really pleased with the way we acted in taking the money out of our own pocket essentially and giving it to those consumers who need that money now. They need it now; they can't wait. In doing that, I'm just so proud of our teams that did that and really made things better. Now it's much -- or many months after that, now if you book a non-refundable accommodation, even if there is a close-down by a government, you're not getting your money back because everybody is aware of the situation. Every -- your eyes are wide open when you buy that nonrefundable, you're not going to get that money back. And so people aren't pretty much behind the refundable one. I do expect though over time that will go back because of the benefit of getting a better price. David, do you want to give any comments on this at all, that I don\u2019t know what you\u2019d say? David Goulden : No, I think you covered the major areas, Glenn. Obviously, we are -- as we enter, euphemistically, the second wave -- we were in -- all were into lockdown in the first, including customers and ourselves and our partners. There'll be some differences. Glenn talked about the force majeure which is obviously important. Typically, there are fewer bookings that are on the books right now because we're operating at much lower levels than we were back in the January, February time before everything hit. So that will also -- we do some of the extra workload that we have been on customer service, although we expect there to be some. And as I mentioned, we've seen customers, particularly recently favoring the more flexible cancellation policies, which, of course, isn\u2019t everybody's practice and that also -- has also had a slight leaning towards the agency product where the cancellation options are all flexible. So we're going into it eyes open. I'm sure there are going to be some things we haven't foreseen that come along. But I think it will be quite different in terms of how we'll be able to deal with this vis-\u00e0-vis the \"all hands on deck\" situation back in April and May. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Deepak Mathivanan from Barclays. Deepak Mathivanan : Glenn, I know it's early and things are volatile in the second wave right now. But any reason to not think that the demand during peak of the second wave will be better than what you saw in April and May? There are government restrictions, but consumers obviously have found some ways to travel safely and then restrictions are also somewhat measured and probably shorter now. Just obviously, vaccine will be ideal, but curious how to think about consumer behavior changes in the second wave versus the first outbreak? Glenn Fogel : Deepak, I think that certainly, what you're saying could be the case, and I think it's hard to say, and as David said, we're not expecting to hit the lows of April yet. But I'll point out there are counter facts, too, such as, as we're entering the spring and into the summer, it was getting warmer. It was getting lighter in the Northern Hemisphere and you could travel locally and have a nice holiday away from wherever you were. If you were in a city that was suffering significant infection rates, and you just wanted to get out, it was easy to say, we\u2019re going to drive or get my car and drive not so far away and it's pleasant, I can go outside, maybe near a beach, maybe near a lake, whenever, let's take a little holiday, okay? Not so great in the middle of the winter in the dark. So that's kind of a factor. Who knows? I think the right way to think about this stuff is not think about right now, second wave, next couple of months. I think the important thing is to think about the long term. And that's what we continue to put our focus on, is making sure that we're coming up with our systems, our products, our services, working with our suppliers so we have everything set up right when that demand comes back for real in the way we know it will because all pandemics do end; they do. Whether there is a vaccine or not, and we hope there'll be one soon, and all the news says they'll be one relatively soon. But even if not, even not a vaccine a pandemic will end, people will start traveling again. And we will, I believe, have that very wonderful rebound and come out of this crisis. Deepak Mathivanan : Got it. And then second question on alternative accommodations, if I may. Can you elaborate on what type of use cases is driving the alternative accommodations growth? Clearly, like you said, there's domestic and there's drive-in. But in the marketplace, it seems like there's appetite for longer-term stays now. Are you seeing a broader use case expansion under alternative accommodations as well? Glenn Fogel : Well, there's definitely a widened use case because we're operating in a very, very different world right now. I haven't done any research. We have not done the research to really nail down how many people decided, I want to use an alternative accommodation because I cannot live in just a one-room apartment in the city for the next month. I need to get out in a bigger space in the country. I don't know how many of you did that. Where people said, I'm working from home, and I live in a studio, I need another place. I can't do that; where a family that say, the kids are going crazy. We got to get out of this place and go there. So there are a lot of alternative uses of the alternative accommodations that never existed before. And that could very well have driven that up. I think in the long run, though, again, people having experienced this, now it goes into the consideration set for any type of use, standard holiday or not. And that's why I do believe, in the long run, continue to build our inventory for the single property type use is very important. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Lee Horowitz from Evercore ISI. Lee Horowitz : Two if I could. One, just on the U.S. in the third quarter. Can you speak at all to any market share shifts you're seeing in the U.S. market and how you may be thinking about using the COVID disruption and obviously your strong balance sheet and operating structure to perhaps lean into this depressed demand environment to pick up share in some markets where maybe you've been underrepresented? And then second, on the cost-cutting guidance on the 250 million to 300 million, my understanding is one that, obviously, a lot of that is variable in nature and coming down with the overall travel demand environment, but that some of it could perhaps be permanent. I guess is there any way to contextualize how you were thinking about perhaps some of the permanent cost savings that may be associated coming out of that, whether that's digitizing of customer relationship management or things of that nature? Anything that could be helpful on the permanent nature of some of those once we get back to, say, 2019 levels? Glenn Fogel : So why don't I take a little bit of the first part of the U.S. and then, David, you can say anything you want to add to that and then talk about the cost cutting. So absolutely, I've said many times that we are under-indexed in the U.S., and that's a great opportunity for us. That's a case where we have the capability of adding to our future growth by doing better things in the U.S.  In terms of how to do it, in terms of -- you mentioned the balance sheet, how much is lean, et cetera, right now, there's not a tremendous amount of demand right now for doing anything. So the idea of putting together a big brand campaign or just to make them more awareness right now, we're just trying to lean into performance marketing, that to me is not a good use of money. We've always said that we want to be frugal in the way we try and get more customers and how we build our brand et cetera, want to do it the right way. So obviously, I mentioned already about getting more supply for a certain type of alternative accommodation in properties, that's absolutely something that we are doing and going and doing that. And it's also coming up and putting and investing in flight in the U.S. I mentioned that one already, and I mentioned now down the road, we'll have packages. So building on that and building out payments, which are so important for all different reasons. We can go into why that's an important thing and making sure we have that set up right in the U.S. and we have lots of our hotel partners onto the payment network.  So all those things are investments, and that is what we are doing. But what we're not going to do is go out and do a giant, giant brand campaign where literally nobody is listening to that right now in this winter. And we're not going to do it that way. David, do you want to add anything? David Goulden : Yes, I do. Thanks, Glenn. Just to -- relative to the U.S. in the third quarter, when we look across the major markets, the U.S. was by far the strongest of the major markets for us from a performance point of view. The decline rates there were lower than the average and lower than any of our other territories. So we're not talking market share, but just to give you something directional to think about in terms of how the business performed. And then, Lee, on the cost side, yes, you're right, there's $250 million to $300 million of expense reductions annualized from Booking.com. There's also $80 million from the other brands as well. So please don't go that piece as well. You're right. Most of those related to volume-related functions in the business, things like customer service, so credit collection partner search. It's not entirely but largely functions like that which are tied to volume. So as volumes come back, as we expect to do over the next few years, we obviously need to replace that cost base. So we're looking at all sorts of alternatives, including how much more technology can we deploy in those areas as we would do normally.  The cost savings that we're not talking about right now are because we're in the middle of a crisis and we've got our hands full. We've getting the volume cost aspects out of the business. Already operating efficiencies in the business in other areas beyond what we're doing now, that's not the immediate focus. It's something we can take and to look at once we get beyond the crisis and we start to see a recovery. Of course, we've been running a fairly efficient business in the first place. We're not sitting with a large amount of excess fixed costs to optimize, but there's always opportunity. And if you recall, we started talking about some of those things a little bit before the coronavirus hit in the spring of this year. So we'll come back to those in the fullness of time. And we'll also look to make sure that as we continue to drive efficiencies in the business that we don't bring back all the costs that had to -- lead the business as the business returns to prior volumes. Operator : And that will be for your last question. I would now like to hand the call over back to Mr. Fogel for closing remarks. Glenn Fogel : Thank you. So the first thing I want to do, I just want to say thank you once again to all of our employees who have been working so hard to help our partners and customers in these very difficult times. And of course, I absolutely want to thank our customers who choose from the many available options to book their travel through us. And finally, I have to thank all of our supplier partners who continue to work closely with us as we try and get through this crisis. While the near term will definitely be challenging I remain confident in our long-term value proposition, and we are focused on the steps we have to take today to create a better company tomorrow. Please be safe, and good night. Operator : Thank you, sir. And again, thank you so much presenters. Thank you, everyone, for participating. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect. Stay safe, and have a lovely day.",

And now, I would like to introduce Booking Holdings speakers for this afternoon, Glenn Fogel and David Goulden. Go ahead, gentlemen. Glenn Fogel : Thank you. And welcome to Booking Holdings\u2019 fourth quarter conference call. I am joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. Despite a travel environment that continues to be very challenging, we closed out 2020 by delivering fourth quarter results that were a bit better than the expectations we talked about on our last earnings call. David will provide the details on the fourth quarter results in his remarks. For my time, I will first briefly reflect on our execution during the extremely difficult year of 2020. Then I will share our thoughts and strategic priorities for 2021 and beyond. Without a doubt 2020 presented the biggest disruption to modern global travel the world has ever seen and our results for full year 2020 were down substantially from 2019. However, travelers still book 355 million room nights through our platforms during 2020 and we remain profitable by generating approximately $880 million in adjusted EBITDA. Delivering these results during this unprecedented and unpredictable year is a credit to our team\u2019s relentless efforts to provide the best value and service to our traveler customers and to our supply partners while all the time remaining incredibly focused on operating efficiently. When we spoke to you on our earnings call in May of 2020, we outlined a series of plans that would help us navigate through the COVID-19 crisis. First, we said we would stabilize the business from the immediate shock of the crisis. Second, we said we would optimize the business for the expected decrease in travel demand over the next few years. And third, we said we would position the business to be able to capture travel demand when it returns. Based on our accomplishments in 2020, I can confidently say that we executed well against these plans. In the beginning of the crisis, we successfully stabilized the business by taking several immediate steps including, quickly closing offices and smoothly transitioning to a distributed work environment to protect the health and safety of our employees, which was and continues to be a top priority, working closely with travelers and supply partners to process the unprecedented level of travel changes and cancellations, and bolstering liquidity and preserving cash by holding stock buybacks cutting non-essential costs and raising over $4 billion in capital through a debt offering. And we began the process and have almost entirely completed our work to optimize the business for the decrease in travel demand through the restructuring actions we have taken at each of our brands across the company. As a result of these actions, our 2020 year end headcount decreased approximately 23% versus 2019, primarily in volume-related position. We expect these reductions to result in annualized cost savings of about $370 million in personnel expenses with about $110 million of savings recognized in 2020. All our work is never done in terms of finding opportunities for cost efficiencies. We believe the headcount reductions needed to optimize the business for the current demand environment are now generally behind us. Finally, we believe we have positioned the business well for when travel demand returns. We continue to make progress against our key strategic priorities during 2020 and this progress has continued as we have moved into 2021. We remain active in performance marketing channels, and are being agile and adapting our approach to this very uncertain environment, and we will leverage our learnings from the past year to continue to capture demand in these performance channels at appropriate ROIs. In addition, our marketing team has been working hard to develop campaigns and messaging that we will deploy when we believe the time is right to encourage people to travel once again and use our services. As we think ahead about 2021, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the exact shape and timing of the recovery for travel. The rate of recovery will depend heavily on the rate of new COVID-19 cases, including new potentially more transmissible and more dangerous variants and on the timing of effective and broad based vaccine distribution, which we believe will be a key step in helping people feel safe to travel again. We are tracking early signs of encouraging summer booking trends in Western Europe, primarily the U.K. and Germany, relative to what we are seeing globally. Although in each case, gross booking levels are still below where we were at the same point in time in 2019. While seeing green shoots of a summer booking season positive, it\u2019s uncertain whether these trends will continue and whether we will see this summer booking strength expand into other countries and regions, and of course, whether these advanced will turn into stayed room nights, or will be canceled. What would be most helpful will be continued government action around the world to accelerate vaccine distribution, while providing direct and indirect support to the entire travel and hospitality industry. Additionally, international travel remains extremely depressed and recovery will not be possible until government restrictions on international travel are lifted or modified to travelers who can show they are safe travelers are allowed to travel freely. As you know, our International business has been a great advantage for us historically and we expect it will be in the future, but we anticipate this to be a longer recovery. We know that people have a very strong desire to travel. We saw this first hand in 2020 when we witnessed a strong improvement in our booking trends from the lows of April through the peak summer travel season, driven in part by pent-up demand as people came out of lockdowns. The travel that was booked last year was much more domestic-oriented than in prior years as many people adapted to the restricted travel environment and still found a way to take a trip. With many travel restrictions now in place around the world, we believe there is once again a high level of pent-up demand for travel. But when this demand will be fully unlocked is of course difficult to predict and it will depend on vaccination rates and other factors. While the trending of the pickup in travel demand is beyond our control, we are focused on things we can control, primarily better positioning our business by continuing to invest and execute against our key strategic priorities including, expanding the payment platform at Booking.com, building out our Connected Trip capabilities and growing our market share in the United States. Our integrated payment platform at Booking.com provides payment options favored by both travelers and our supplier partners across hotels, alternative accommodations, cars, flight and attractions. It is strategically important as it enables merchandising capabilities that we haven\u2019t had access to historically at Booking.com, but we expect to utilize selectively in the future to help drive growth. In addition, this payment platform is foundational for enabling our Connected Trip strategy. We continue to make progress expanding the payment platform with approximately 22% of Booking.com\u2019s gross bookings in 2020 processed on the platform. This was up from approximately 15% in 2019 and was less than 4% back in 2017. So this is a dramatic shift in our large-scale business. We are optimistic about recent improvements in our Booking.com U.S. payment platform, which will enable increased utilization of payments in this critical market. We expect to see a higher percentage of Booking.com\u2019s gross bookings processed on the payment platform in 2021 as compared to 2020 and expect these increases to continue beyond 2021. Our Connected Trip vision is a multi-parted offering including accommodations, flights, ground transportation and attractions in dining connected by our seamless payment network and ultimately supported by personalized intelligence to provide a frictionless experience for our bookers all the way from the initial booking to experiencing their trip. We are building towards this vision, because we believe that Connected Trip will drive increased loyalty and frequency and will enhance the growth of our accommodation business to additional customer acquisition and merchandising opportunities. Developing a robust flight product at Booking.com remains an important strategic component of the Connected Trip, as it gives us the ability to engage with flight bookers early in their travel journey and allows us an opportunity to cross-sell our accommodation and other products to those bookers. In the coming years, we expect flights will represent an increasing mix of our overall business, which will help drive incremental revenue and EBITDA dollars. As mentioned in the past growing our share of the U.S. travel market remains a key strategic priority for our company as the U.S. is one of the largest travel markets in the world and we have historically under indexed there. We are taking several steps to increase our competitiveness in the U.S. market and are focused on making sure we are offering great value to our customers, improving our payments platform to enable bundling and merchandising opportunities, increasing overall consumer awareness of our Booking.com through marketing and expanding our alternative accommodation supply. While we have built a large and competitive alternative accommodations business globally, we believe we have a significant opportunity for improvement in the United States, which will involved, product improvements, supply acquisition and raising consumer awareness of this type of inventory on Booking.com. The key to invest and execute against these three strategic priorities as when we capture demand as travel recovers will be our focus in 2021. We believe successful implementation of these priorities is key to achieve higher growth rates, increasing market share and eventually building a larger business with higher earnings than we had prior to COVID. We expect this larger business to have a higher mix of merchant transactions and non-accommodation products, both of which will negatively impact our EBITDA margin rates. But we expect to continue to lead the travel industry in this metric. Finally, I want to address the European Commission\u2019s initial proposal from the Digital Marketing Act and Digital Services Act released in December. The European Commission has proposed regulations and to keeping markets fair and open, which is an ambition that we support. However, at the present time, it is not known for certain what the ultimate rules will be, how they might be applied or what the impact will be on us and other market participants. We are engaged with state service to work towards regulations to tackle the legitimate problems of the large gatekeepers in the digital community of which we believe we are not one. We will update you in the area during future calls. In conclusion, there are still tough days ahead of us and everyone in the travel industry. COVID case counts remain high and the wider global distribution of vaccines is still too slow. However, I am more confident than ever in our long-term future and we will at some point see a strong recovery in travel demand. I firmly believe that our company is very well-positioned to capture this demand as it comes back. In the meantime, we will focus on what we can control, namely investing in our business and executing against our strategic priorities to ensure we exit this crisis on a strong footage, which will enable us to build a larger and faster growing business over the long run. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden. David Goulden : Thank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I will review our operating results for the fourth quarter, provide some color on the trends we have seen so far in the first quarter and then discuss our expectations for 2021 and our longer term operating model. To avoid the comparison to the initial spread the pandemic in 2020, all growth rates for 2020 and 2021 are relative to comparable period in 2019 unless otherwise indicated. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. Now onto the results for the fourth quarter. On our November earnings call, we discussed the trends we saw throughout the third quarter and into early November, including the year-on-year decline in reported room nights worsening from about 43% in the third quarter to about 58% in October and then further deteriorating to about 70% over the seven-day leading up to our November earnings call, driven by rising COVID case counts, and many European countries and governments beginning to respond with imposition of travel restrictions. As a reminder, reported room nights include the impact of cancellations. The worsening trends we saw in early November, improved a little resulting in our reported room nights declining 60% for the full quarter. November proved to be the low point for the quarter. The decline in room night growth rates versus Q3 were driven by Europe, where growth rate declined quite considerably. Looking across the other regions North America were similar to Q3 and Asia and the rest of world both improved compared to Q3. North America was the strongest region in Q4 with significantly lower year-on-year earlier decline in room nights than the other regions. Mobile bookings, particularly through our apps continued to gain share in the fourth quarter and represented over two-thirds of our total room nights in Q4 and about two-thirds of 2020. We continue to see -- we also continue to see growth in 50% of our total room nights come to us through the direct channel. Domestic room nights represented about 85% of our reported room nights in Q4, up significantly versus 2019, which was just below 50%. Our cancellation rates continue to be up year-over-year in the fourth quarter and also increased versus Q3. We continue to monitor other changes in Booking.com customer booking behavior. The mix of customers booking alternative accommodations in Q4 was slightly lower than Q4 2019, while the full year was up slightly versus 2019. The slight decline in the overall mix of alternative accommodations in Q4 was due to the underperformance of the European region, which is where we have our highest mix of alternative accommodations. The mix of alternative accommodations continued to increase year-over-year within Europe in Q4. Booking.com\u2019s alternative accommodations represented about 30% of its reported room nights for the full year 2020. The booking with the contracted versus 2019 in the fourth quarter are about the same rate as we saw in the third quarter as customers continue to focus mainly on the short-term travel needs. Gross bookings declined 65% in Q4, which is a great decline in reported room nights, due to the average daily rates for accommodations decreasing about 15% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Consolidated revenue for the fourth quarter of $1.2 billion and decreased 63% year-over-year. As we expected, revenue in the quarter was less negatively impact than gross bookings due to the fact that revenue benefited from check-ins in Q4 from bookings received in the relatively strong third quarter. Our full year revenue was also significantly less impacted than our gross bookings driven by the differences in the timing between fees and revenue, which is recognized as check-in primarily related to 2019 bookings that check-in, in Q1 2020. As a result of these coming factors, our full year revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was 19.2%, which is significantly higher than the 15.6% in 2019 and 2018. If our revenue as a percentage of gross bookings in 2020 been in line with 2019, revenue would have been more than $1 billion lower for the full year. The difference between 15.6% and 19.2% is almost entirely explained by this timing difference. The 63% reduction in revenue resulted in adjusted EBITDA loss of $38 million in the fourth quarter. While we significantly reduced our variable expense lines like marketing, sales and other, our more fixed expenses decreased to a lesser extent in Q4. As Glenn mentioned, we have almost entirely completed our restructuring actions, reduced personnel expenses to align our cost structure with the new demand environments. The savings recognized in our personnel expense line related to these actions was about $70 million in Q4 and about $110 million for the full year. We recorded charges of $74 million and $149 million related to these actions in the restructuring and other exit cost line for Q4 and the full year respectively. Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line decreased 61% year-over-year as we saw a significant reduction in demand in the paid channels. In addition, we substantially reduced our brand marketing spend in response to the diminished travel demand environments. Sales and other expenses decreased 45% year-over-year, primarily due to a reduction in expenses associated with payments transactions, partially offset by a mix shift in customer service to outsourced call centers. Personnel expenses decreased 13% year-over-year, primarily due to restructuring actions I mentioned previously. G&A expenses decreased 36% year-over-year, largely driven by reduced discretionary expense in such areas as T&E, lower indirect taxes and lower office expenses due to employees working remotely. Information technology expenses were up 1% year-over-year in the fourth quarter due to investments in software license fees related to cyber security and privacy software. Finally, we have broken out restructuring charges separately in operating expenses in the P&L and I note that these restructuring charges are included in our non-GAAP results. We recorded a non-GAAP net loss of $23 million in the quarter. Our full year non-GAAP tax rate of 42% was meaningfully higher than our 2019 tax rate of 19% due to the greater impact of non-tax deductible expenses on a lower base of earnings, as well as the geographical distribution of earnings and losses. Our Q4 non-GAAP tax rate was driven by change in our full year tax provision following better than expected pretax results in the fourth quarter. On a GAAP basis, we had an operating loss of $153 million in Q4. We recorded a GAAP net loss of $165 million in the quarter, as the benefit from an unrealized $553 million pretax gain on our equity investments, primarily related to our investment in Meituan was offset by income tax expenses of $410 million, $98 million of interest expense and $61 million of FX re-measurement losses on our euro bond. We excluded the unrealized gains and the re-measurement losses from our non-GAAP results. The $410 million of income tax expenses is primarily due to the discrete tax expense related to the Meituan unrealized gain and the change in our full year tax provision, following better than expected results in the fourth quarter. Our full year GAAP tax rate of 90% was meaningfully higher than our 2019 tax rate of 18% due to the reasons mentioned from non-GAAP tax rate with the non-deductible goodwill impairment charge, driving an additional significant impact. Now onto our cash and liquidity position. Our Q4 ending cash and investment balance decreased to $14.8 billion from our September ending balance of $14.9 billion due to an operating cash outflow largely offset by the unrealized gains on our long-term investments. We had a $557 million operating cash outflow in the quarter driven primarily by changes in working capital, which represented a use of cash of about $400 million in the quarter, as well as a net loss recorded in the quarter. The change in working capital driven by seasonal effects were amplified by the slowdown in bookings from Q3. We will continue to focus on maintaining a strong liquidity position given the high level of uncertainty created by the COVID pandemic and consistent with our comments last quarter, we have halted repurchases of our stock and will not initiate repurchase until we have better visibility into the shape and timing of a recovery. Now on to our thoughts for the first quarter and to remind you we will make comparisons with 2019 unless otherwise indicated. There continues to be considerable uncertainty about the shape and timing of the recovery for travel, which means we are unable to provide detailed guidance at this time. January room night declines were slightly worse in Q4, driven by the increasing spread of COVID-19, including the new strains with associated additional travel restrictions. However, starting in middle of January, we saw an improvement in room night declines driven by domestic travel bookings in most part of the world and we have seen this improvement continue into February. In recent weeks, some regions have improved back to positive domestic room night growth. While difficult to predict with accuracy, if the domestic room night trends continued to improve, Q1 room night declines could be a few percentage points better than Q4. To give you a snapshot of what we are seeing recently room night declines of last seven days were about 50%, In Q1, the overall booking window is contracted versus 2019, although to a lesser extent that we saw in the fourth quarter. In Western Europe in January, we saw an expansion of the booking window versus 2019 and we have seen this expansion continue into February as the share of further out bookings including those for summer travel has increased. As Glenn noted in Western Europe, particularly in the U.K. and Germany we have recently seen stronger summer booking trends relative to what we are seeing globally and in these countries gross bookings for the summer period are 25% of where they were at the same time in 2019. These stronger booking trends in Western Europe are currently being offset by weaker near-term booking trends in the region due to extensive travel restrictions and we remind you that the significant majority of the summer bookings are cancellable. We are also encouraged to see that some countries are making notable progress in vaccinations including Israel, UAE and the U.K. We are confident that when vaccinations are broadly available and when travel restrictions are lifted people will return to travel. We saw this happen recently in Israel where vaccination rates are the highest in the world and after the national lockdown within Israel was eased on February 7th, we quickly saw domestic bookings return to solid double-digit growth versus the same period in 2019. Turning to the income statement, as I said, we expect Q1 room nights declines could be a few percentage points better than Q4. We expect Q1 gross bookings to decline a few percentage points more than room nights due to continued pressure on local currency ADRs. We expect Q1 revenue to decline slightly more than gross bookings assuming bookings continue to improve for the rest of the quarter. We expect marketing expense in Q1 will decline at the same level as gross bookings. We expect sales and other expenses in Q1 will be similar to what they were in Q4 on a dollar basis with some variability based upon where Q1 volumes land. We expect personnel expenses in Q1 where we saw higher than they were in Q4 on a dollar basis, primarily due to increased SBC expenses and seasonal increase in benefit costs, partially offset by a higher amount of savings in Q1 related to the restructuring actions we have taken. We expect that almost a full run rate from our personnel restructurings will be realized in Q1. We expect G&A expenses in Q1 will be about the same as it were in Q4 on a dollar basis. We expect that IT expenses will be higher than they were in Q4 on a dollar basis, primarily due to increased investments in security, data privacy and some operational system enhancements. We currently estimate the remaining restructuring charge related to actions of Booking.com will be about $40 million and we expect to record more than half of these remaining charges in the first quarter. About half of the $40 million related to personnel related actions and the other half relates to real estate. Given what we just explained and to remind you that Q1 is our seasonally lowest revenue quarter, we expect to report a greater EBITDA loss in Q1 than in Q4. For full year 2021, I want to briefly walk you through some factors that we expect will impact our topline operating margins for the year. We expect the environment of travel to improve during 2021, but the shape and timing of that recovery remains uncertain. We expect occupancy rates to remain below where they were pre-COVID putting continued negative pressure on ADRs, which will result in our gross bookings being lower than our room nights. As I alluded earlier, our revenue was less negatively impacted than our gross bookings in 2020 due to timing factors, which benefited our 2020 revenue by more $1 billion. The opposite dynamic will happen when we experience acceleration in bookings, which will lead to our gross bookings recovering faster than revenue. Said another way, if we see this acceleration in 2021 there will be more bookings made in 2021 that will check-in in 2022 than there were bookings made in 2020 that check-in in 2021. This timing factor could have a meaningfully negative impact on our revenue as a percentage of gross bookings, but exactly how meaningful this impact will be depends upon how quickly our room nights and gross bookings accelerate in 2021. Due to these differences and the timing of bookings versus check-in, we also expect deleverage in our marketing expenses in 2021 as we incur the majority of our marketing expenses at the time of booking. The most significant expense items in sales and other are payment processing costs and outsourced customer service expenses. We expect sales and other to be lower in 2021 than in 2019. The reduction will be smaller than the reduction in revenue. A few comments to help you think about our less variable expenses to 2021 and how they will most likely compare with 2019. We expect G&A to be down double digits versus 2019 driven by T&E, office and occupancy expenses, with some variability from GST taxes if new ones are enacted during the year. Personnel expenses are likely to be quite similar to 2019 on a dollar basis. To help you understand this better, there are a few factors that contribute towards this. Our personnel expense run rate immediately before COVID hit was about $200 million higher than 2019 actual personnel expenses. Less than half of this was the annualization of people expense we added during 2019 and the rest was from people expense added to the business in the first quarter of 2020. Our restructuring actions will reduce headcount expenses by approximately $370 million. So an impact of these two together will be to reduce personnel expenses by $170 million versus 2019. As we continue to invest in the business, we expect 2021 year-end headcount to be a little higher than at the end of 2020 with a mix shift towards product and technical positions. This will add about $100 million in personnel expenses in 2021. And finally SBC is expected to be higher than 2019 due to due to a few factors including the modification of some stock awards in Q1 2021 and the issuance of stock options in 2020. Finally, IT expenses in 2021 will be higher than in 2019 due to investments in security, privacy and operational system enhancements as reported to our Connected Trip strategy. As we think beyond 2021, we are looking forward to being a larger business with more diverse offerings and with more earnings that we had prior to COVID. We will also focus on the potential for higher growth and market share. We continue to believe it will be years and not quarters before travel returns to pre-COVID-19 levels. And when considering the shape of the business at that time, I\u2019d like to draw your attention to two factors. The first is a mix shift within the business. The continued growth of payments and the growth of flights and other connected verticals will add revenue and EBITDA but at much lower margin rates than traditional accommodations. Payments will add to revenue with offsetting expenses in sales and other plus some additional personnel and other expenses. Flights and other connected verticals will add to bookings and revenue but at lower take rates on accommodations and will also require added personnel and other expenses as these business scales. The second is personnel. The restructuring actions we took in 2020 were mainly in volume related functions including customer service and credit collection. This means that as volumes grow beyond the levels we expect in 2021, we will need to add expenses back to business. As we mentioned before, we look to do this in cost efficient ways but the work will come back. We think it\u2019s important to include this consideration when thinking about the future shape of the business. As Glenn said, we expect to continue to have industry leading EBITDA margin rates, albeit most likely at levels below those in 2019. In conclusion, we remain focused on what we can control and continue to execute against our strategic priorities. We are now more confident than ever that through these actions we will emerge from this crisis in a stronger position. We will now take your questions, and Grace, I will turn it over to you to open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Lloyd Walmsley : Thanks for the questions. I guess a couple, first, just following up on those last comments you made, David on margins. I guess, obviously, a lot of the reductions you have seen as you said, been kind of variable related to business. Are there -- is there anything that you are kind of just learning to do better or more efficiently that might result in kind of better cost line items as a percent of revenue coming out of this on the other side? And then, I guess, the second one, curious if you guys expect any impact to your performance marketing spend efficacy from kind of upcoming changes in Apple\u2019s iOS 14 that may impact retargeting, anything you guys expect there? Thanks. David Goulden : Yeah. Why don\u2019t I take the first one and then Glenn will -- see if you want to take a start on the second one. So, on the efficiency side, we are always looking for ways to become more efficient within the business. As I mentioned, we have reduced these variable cost to the tune of about $370 million. As they come back, we will look at more efficient ways of getting that work done. The work will come back. It won\u2019t come back this year. We basically right-sized ourselves to what we think will be through 2021, but as volumes extend beyond what we think 2021 is likely to bring those costs will come back. So we will look more efficient ways to do some of those variable activities in terms of location, technology, where we do them inside or where we deploy more partner resources, et cetera. And we also Lloyd, continue to look at how we can drive efficiencies in our fixed cost part of the business. That\u2019s not been the major focus for the last 12 months. The major focus being surviving COVID, I think, we have done a good job with that. But we do continue to kind of look at our costs across our personnel base, across our real estate, across our technology portfolios, across things like procurement, where we can continue to drive efficiencies within the business. So when we get to a more normalized environment that\u2019s something else we can also take a look at driving as well. Glenn Fogel : And Lloyd. Lloyd Walmsley : Thanks a lot. Glenn Fogel : Your question is good one because we continue to see changes not only by companies like Apple making changes, you just mentioned, but Google doing differences and government certainly talking about laws and regulations about cookies and all sorts of things that impact different ways that people do marketing, in particular performance marketing and different things and that can impact companies, certainly in the short-term and we are all just looking and trying to evaluate what do we think this will mean for any one of these things. But the thing I am really focused on is that change can also be good. We believe that we have some of the best marketing people in the world in terms of digital marketing. So when changes happen we can make adjustments, we can make changes, we can do things faster and better and we have so much data to test with that we believe we can actually come out of these things sometimes better off than we were in the past. So right now, there is nothing I can say in terms of impact or not. It took us so far as to say we have been adapting and changing as the world of digital marketing has been changing for 20 years and we have kept on top of it and so I am so confident that we will be able to make any adjustments we need to make for the future. Lloyd Walmsley : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Justin Post from Bank of America. Your line is open. Justin Post : Great. Thank you. A couple of questions, first, Airbnb success has been hard to miss, but just wondering how you think about your market share within Europe and your position with a larger host maybe than smaller individual host and what that means in a recovery? And then, secondly, Glenn, would love to hear about your thoughts on suppliers, obviously, a lot of pain in the travel industry. How can you help suppliers in the recovery and do you think you will be getting more promotional activity from suppliers, maybe better take rates, anything we could think about on that front? Thank you. Glenn Fogel : Sure. So in regards to the whole alternative accommodations, we would like to call it in Europe. I don\u2019t think we talk much about regional exact share and I am not going to here. But I certainly, we talked a little bit how Europe is our stronghold in that area. We are better there in the home area, other areas. But throughout the world I think I can say to you that we are better in things that are less single property. We always want to increase the single property, because we know that\u2019s an area where we can improve upon. So that is an issue right now and with the pandemic there certainly was a bit of a shift for some people that they wanted to be isolated away from other people. So certainly, there was more demand than the past for the single home area. That showed much more in the U.S. for us than Europe because Europe we do have a greater amount of our home supply is single property than say in the U.S. Look, it\u2019s an area where we to continue to focus on and I do believe right now in the environment there is, that is a great product to have up on the shelf. That being said, in the future, we will see how much that maintains or things go back more towards they used to be where there is a different split between homes and hotels. In regard to your second question about relationship with hotel suppliers, obviously, we are doing everything we can to help our partners. The next come up with new ways to come up with promotions that they want to do, telling them what we think their spots of demand that they can come up with give and take a closed user group prices they can help get the more demand, coming out with ways they can put together things in content in terms of safety and health so that a traveler who looks on our sites, sees their hotel and sees that is a safe place to go, do all different things with them to try and improve their business. It\u2019s very difficult right now, as you know because let\u2019s face it, unless we see a demand, if you can have the greatest content in the world where people don\u2019t trying to travel, they are not going to travel. But we are going to continue to do that. I do believe in terms of relationships, certainly, as a distributor, when there is less demand we are more valuable as a partner to them. And the time when there is very, very high occupancy rates, any hotels I don\u2019t need the distributor nearly as much, but when they don\u2019t have as much occupancy rate then they start looking for demand and we have the benefit of being the largest platform for hotel demand in the world. So we are in a place for them to come and get some more of that incremental demand and we are continuing to work with them to make sure they do their best to get it. Justin Post : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Kevin Kopelman from Cowen. Your line is open. Kevin Kopelman : Great. Thanks a lot. I just had some follow-ups on your comments about gaining market share in the U.S. Can you talk more about your focus there? Do you consider it an increasing priority for the company compared to the past year or two and on the marketing side of that that you mentioned do you anticipate being focused more on brand or performance marketing? Glenn Fogel : Well, let me start with the first one, Kevin. We absolutely have begun to focus more on the U.S. It\u2019s always been a priority. So don\u2019t get me wrong in that area. But certainly we have made a couple of changes. We are focusing more specifically in the U.S. As we scale the company over many, many years we had a very global presence and we try not to make changes solely for any particular market, really believing that scaling the business we have it and the same was the best way to achieve a very, very large global share of the business. That being said, we have come to a state where we recognize that we continue to be under indexed in the U.S. and maybe we need to make some changes there, which we are doing and I think that we will make some progress in that. In terms of whether we are going to do a brand or in terms of performance marketing, I am not going to give away the playbook here. I will say though, we are absolutely doing the things I talked about in my prepared remarks in terms of obviously we do want to increase awareness, we obviously want to increase the total amount of supply, increase our alternative accommodation, doing all the things that are necessary to make sure we are getting the share of the business that we believe we should be getting. Kevin Kopelman : Got it. That\u2019s great. And then just a quick clarification on the statistic you gave about the past week being down 50%. Is that a year-over-year numbers and if you are looking at 2020 were those numbers affected by the initial COVID waves at all? David Goulden : Kevin, as I said, everything is over two years number. We do\u2026 Kevin Kopelman : Okay. Perfect. David Goulden : \u2026 everything I gave you because that way you can you make a direct comparison with how things are doing relative to how they are doing in Q4 continues with this trend line. You can do the math yourself to figure what you meant on a year-on-year basis\u2026 Kevin Kopelman : Okay. David Goulden : \u2026 your number. Kevin Kopelman : Perfect. And the regional numbers that you gave was that based on where the accommodation is located or where the customer is located? David Goulden : We gave you regional flavor not color. That is typically based upon where the customer is located. It\u2019s a book region view. Kevin Kopelman : Perfect. Okay. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Next up we have Eric Sheridan from UBS. Your line is open. Eric Sheridan : Thank you so much. Maybe two if I can. Following up on the comments you have made around brand and maybe some of the changes we will see in digital advertising, whether it be first-party data or third-party data. How important do you see the concept of sort of aligning your brand with consumer maybe even build greater depth and loyalty and rewards programs going forward, especially if you are aiming again sort of a wider revenue pool and a wider product set, love to get your thoughts there Glenn? And where the world has begun to open up a little bit where you have some exposure. Can you give us a little bit of sense of how you sort of the pace of leaning back in to marketing channels and that deleverage that maybe you guys are calling out as things get better. Just so we can better understand a little bit of a timing mismatch there? Thanks so much. Glenn Fogel : Yeah. So, Eric, loyalty is an important thing because it really talks about something that we talk about a lot is bringing people home direct to us and we have talked about this numerous times of how we believe getting people to come back to us directly is a critical part of the strategy going forward. And certainly one of the ways we do that is by providing our loyalty version, which is our genius plan at Booking.com which really does we believe give some real value to consumers and that\u2019s something that we are going to continue on. Because in the end it costs an awful lot of money as we hope to get a new customer. It\u2019s cheaper to keep them. So we are going to keep on doing all the things we can to keep people coming back direct. And you are right about first-party, it could be third-party and all these different ways that we worry about how we are going to get through to the come in the future, certainly important to get new customers, but also real important to keep them coming back. In regards to your second question, one of the things I mentioned how uncertain the world is right now and one of the things you are trying always to do is make sure you are spending money that that could create revenue. The only issue is you pay the money upfront, person books, but because so much of the business nowadays is being done on things that are cancellable. You don\u2019t know when change happens all of a sudden money you spent it doesn\u2019t end up in the increased revenue you thought it was and your ROI is very different. So we have to look at this very carefully and we are approaching it in a cautious way. But on the other hand, we don\u2019t want to be slow to the increase in demand. That why we look at all the data very, very closely and that\u2019s about the best I can say is that, that\u2019s how we are handling it right now. We can\u2019t say anything more than because we don\u2019t know what the future is going to be quite yet. David Goulden : And then, Glenn, just to build on that\u2026 Eric Sheridan : Okay. David Goulden : Eric, just to give you a little bit more color to the answer. The deleverage you mentioned in 2021 on performance marketing is not us calling ROIs per se. It\u2019s to do with the timing that I talked about or the fact we expect to basically spend money in 2021 for lower revenue that will revenue in 2022 and that\u2019s normal is what will drive the deleverage in 2021 we talked about for performance marketing just to clarify. Eric Sheridan : Yeah. Understood. Thanks. Thanks for all the color. Operator : Thank you. Next up we have Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Doug Anmuth : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Glenn, just as travelers are coming back to the platform and some of them for the first time perhaps in several months or a year. I am just curious what you think you will see that\u2019s most significant in terms of how the product has changed or the experience has changed, is it Connected Trip or something else? And then, secondly, just wanted to get your view on some of the subscription-based programs that we are seeing across the space for travelers? Thanks. Glenn Fogel : Sure. So one of things that somebody may not have seen before and we talked about last quarter is Booking.com selling flights, for example. That\u2019s a great thing in the past we did do, now they have come back and look, they sell flights, which is a great thing. Another thing that we continue to build out our attractions area, now our people are actually buying attractions right now. We haven\u2019t stopped creating more and more places and more and more content so that when people do come back we will have attraction they can buy from us. And what they obviously would see the way we are combining things and putting things together in the way we are trying to create value for our consumers. So I think that\u2019s part of it and we are really still in the very, very early parts of this journey. But it\u2019s something that is pretty excited to be. We are going see it build out and seeing those people are buying flights and such. In regards to the subscriptions model that people are still beginning to explore as such. I don\u2019t really have a lot of comments on that. It\u2019s something that different people are doing. We will see how it plays out. David, do you, if you want to say on that? David Goulden : No. No. No further comments. We will see how they play out. I think our model the way we have it is that, is a model we think is certainly very attractive and has been successful for us, and as you say, well watch what happens in these other spaces. Doug Anmuth : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next up we have Naved Khan from Truist Securities. Your line is open. Naved Khan : Yeah. Hi. Thanks a lot. I just wanted to ask a question on air booking. So your air tickets sold number was positive and that in this kind of environment I think it\u2019s pretty impressive. Maybe are there any insights you can share with in terms of the early results you might be seeing on integrating air tickets on your booking account side in Europe? And then the other question I had is just on the attractions and experiences. With the increases in selection that you are driving, is it mostly through partnerships or are you signing up your own direct relationships? How should we think about that? Glenn Fogel : So, in terms of air bookings and question on lower model at the end, so I don\u2019t cover completely. David you heard it better and fill out there. But, yes, we were pleased to see that cause number there. One of the things to point out is I just talked about little bit though in the past we didn\u2019t have air tickets coming from Booking.com and from \u2014 and also by the way our Agoda brand also sells air tickets too. KAYAK of course has been selling air ticket since the start of the company more than two decades ago. So it\u2019s easier when you add two more of our brands selling air tickets hadn\u2019t done it in the past, have a positive number. And I want to point out this is very early and these are very, very, very small numbers. So it\u2019s pleasant to see, but I wouldn\u2019t take too much except that we are on our journey. In regards to attractions for Booking.com, yes, these are coming from third-party suppliers. We are partnering with them. They give us the inventory. So we sell it. We have a commercial relationship. We are pleased that\u2019s the way to go forward. Again, one can be anything or scale and you decide which ones you want to do first, but it\u2019s a lot, you can\u2019t be everything. So it\u2019s a lot easier when you want to do a lot more things to partner with other people for things for people already set up the things you need to get. So, I am pretty pleased about that. Again, I will be more pleased when people actually are back to traveling and start buying attractions. David, I don\u2019t know if I missed anything on the air ticket [inaudible]. David Goulden : I think you got it, Glenn. Naved Khan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next up we have Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Stephen Ju : Okay. Thank you. So, Glenn, 20% of bookings running through your own payment rails suggests that is now 70% of your merchant bookings, so it seems like you are pretty close to full adoption there. So is this primarily for alternative accommodations or flights or are you seeing that higher platform usage because of other use cases whether it\u2019s non-credit card users or otherwise? And I guess, over the coming months as you start more formally entering a recovery phase, it -- how we are going to feel like you are working at a hyper growth start up. So with that in mind, I mean you spent the last year restructuring and reducing headcount. So I wanted to get your latest thinking on whether you feel like you are properly resourced at this time or do you feel like you can spin up hiring and bump resources very quickly? Thanks. Glenn Fogel : So let me start with the second one and I will turn it over to David in terms of payments in case you want to add anything more related to that. In terms of people and we talked about this, we have been through restructuring and I think we both said in our prepared remarks how we are satisfied from where we are right now. But we also made the very important point, how much of the restructuring dealt with jobs that related to volume and that as volume comes back, we need to bring people into help cover the hopefully in a much more efficient way over time. So in terms of being a hyper start up, yeah, we -- look, we are always going incredibly hard in trying to get as much progress we count on our strategic vision, because we know that the travelers are going to come back and we want to get ahead of it as fast as we can so we can give the greatest value, the greatest -- different types of way to travel as soon as we can. I don\u2019t see any major change in 2021, but we will see how fast business comes back and we will see what happens in 2022 and we will see the rate of progress in all our strategic different things we are working on. And I will let David talk about the payments platform. David Goulden : Yeah. Payments, let me clarify, because I wasn\u2019t quite sure what you said. But let me try and clarify where we are in payments in the evolution of our payment at Booking.com. So as we said in prepared remarks, the percentage of our gross bookings process on the payment platform at Booking.com was 23% last year. That\u2019s up meaningfully from the 15% in 2019. That will mean that the vast majority of our bookings are not being processed via our payment transaction. They are still in the agency model. So we expect that payment adoption to continue to increase above the 22% this year and beyond. Payments is really super important for us for a number of reasons, because we think we can deliver benefits to our customers and our partners across all the different channels, hotels accommodations flights attractions, et cetera. It\u2019s also very important to enable merchandise usually use select honest like based in certain markets and it\u2019s also fundamental to enabling the Connected Trip where we want to have everything be able to be paid in one place. I think an update on where we all from an income statement point of view relative to the evolution of payments. I am pleased to say that the payment of Booking.com was approximately breakeven in 2020. We said in prior years we are still making some of the investment in the platform and we are focused upon still scale it out, but expect to stay in that breakeven level as we scale out and grow the payments platform from here. Obviously, with some potential minor differences year-in, year-out, we are now our breakeven situation on our payment platform should update from where we were before. Stephen Ju : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Mario Lu from Barclays. Your line is open. Mario Lu : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. I have two on alternate accommodations. So I believe you mentioned the segment had a healthy profit margin throughout 2019. So as we look forward to 2021 and beyond, how should we think about how quickly you can close the gap between the alternative accommodation margins compared to hotels? And secondly, you guys that you are trying to pick the single home supply in the U.S. How would you describe the strategy there, mostly investing kind of your own sales force or is it through acquisitions? Thanks. Glenn Fogel : So they actually go a little together those two questions, because one of the things I believe why we didn\u2019t have a healthy profit as you pointed out, was perhaps because we didn\u2019t have as much of it makes of the single home property, because single home does cost more for the company because you do end up with more contacts. It is just by nature. It is not as professionally run and you end up with more costs. So we do though, now that it is a product that people want and we need to have and we need to have more of it. That\u2019s absolutely correct. The briefing about this though it is a trend towards more professionalization of that single home property where the person who in the past made down onto our platform and just signed up on their own and try to orchestrate it all by themselves. What you are seeing in the industry is more and more people who want to rent out their single properties going to different people who will do it for them, who will handle all the elements of it and those people who are running these kind of we will call it channel managers, but they are like a channel managers as they are able to bring these different single property owners and put amount of this site that is able to direct debt to provide that supply to us or to somebody else. The briefing about it is these people are much more professionalized and they are more easy to deal with. They are able to understand the right things you need to do. So because of that professionalization of the industry, I believe we will be able to pick up more of the single home properties faster than we had to in the past. In regards to M&A since you know we don\u2019t comment on future M&A activity. Mario Lu : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet from Citi. Your line is open. Jason Bazinet : Yeah. I just had two questions. If I positive COVID is going to cause alternative to be larger than otherwise would be and cause business travel will be structurally lower than otherwise would be what is the implication for your business as we move to Connected Trip and payments in a more forceful way? Can you just, you mind just expanding on that a bit? Glenn Fogel : So we will go with the hypothetical, as somebody out there listen to say what I really think is happening here. So people hoops perhaps in the past never would have thought of using alternative accommodations perhaps last summer they didn\u2019t use it or they looked at it or something and now it is in a consideration set. So going forward, what has happened is now there is a much larger amount of supply for any travelers going look at and what that means is any individual supplier in the marketplace is now facing more competition. Now a distributor talked about earlier why there has been official to the distributor now. In our business which is so great because we have both a great amount of the home product that alternative accommodations and one of the largest people have the hotels. So we have this great saying where the consumer when they come, they can come to one place us and able to compare and contrast all different types, all the different prices. Understand all the different continents review is being left by previously stated. That give us a great, great benefit. So I am pleased with the way it is happening. And I -- we will go back what will have and how much will the mix be of home in the future versus hotel. I don\u2019t know any can really guess. I think over many years we have seen the trend going more and more people interested in alternative accommodations the pandemic step function up higher. I know that\u2019s not going to be a pause, maybe a dip down or continue upward, I don\u2019t know. But from my point of view, it\u2019s not that relevant in the sense that we provide both and we are going to keep getting both. So for me, I am feeling pretty good about it. Jason Bazinet : And on the enterprise side, B2B travel? Glenn Fogel : Well, the -- B2B travel, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lot of talk about that. David, I didn\u2019t hear exactly what the question was, maybe you did. David Goulden : I didn\u2019t hear it either, so why don\u2019t you clarify the question. Glenn Fogel : Yeah. B2B question -- B2b question, yeah, just repeat it. Jason Bazinet : Yeah. The question was, if COVID causes a structural shift in B2B travel, how does that influence sort of your focus on payments and focus on the Connected Trip? Is it good, is it bad, does it have no bearing sort of on your level of investment and enthusiasm around those two long-term initiatives? Glenn Fogel : When you say B2B travel\u2026 Jason Bazinet : Business travel. Business travel. Glenn Fogel : Business travel, got it. Okay. Okay. Got it. Look, I have been saying for a long time. I think that it\u2019s going to be a while before corporate travel picks up the same way leisure will pick up. It\u2019s going to be\u2026 Jason Bazinet : Yeah. Glenn Fogel : It\u2019s going to take longer and as a share of total travel it may never get back. Jason Bazinet : Okay. Glenn Fogel : In which case, yes, eventually because businesses will continue to grow and the industry obviously people travel, eventually business travel will be larger in an absolute measure than in the past, but it may always be a smaller share. We don\u2019t really know yet, but certainly the trends are going to go that way. What that does to certain our high ADR hotels that catered to the business traveler. Do they have to make some shifts? Jason Bazinet : Yeah. Glenn Fogel : Because they are not going to get those as many of those high ADR customers anymore and they need to get more leisure travelers. Well, we have a higher percentage of leisure travelers and business travelers. We are again that point where people can come and get that leisure demand. So again it\u2019s another thing what I feel good about our long future. Jason Bazinet : Super helpful. Thank you. Glenn Fogel : Okay. Operator : Thank you. And that is all the time that we have for today. I will turn the call over back to our CEO, Mr. Glenn Fogel for any closing remarks. Glenn Fogel : Thank you. So, in closing, I want to note, there it\u2019s been a little more than a year since the pandemic began and we have said we lost 500,000 mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters, grandparents and so tragically children in the United States alone and globally more than 4 million lives have been lost, our hearts go out to all of them. I also want to reiterate my deepest condolences to the family and friends of Arne Sorenson, as well as to the entire Marriott organization. He left a profound mark on the travel industry and will be greatly missed. And it is so sad he will not see the recovery in the industry that he dedicated his life to and the travel industry will recover, and we are working so very hard to bring travel back as fast as we can. So I want to end by giving one last thank you to our partners, our customers and most of all to our dedicated employees who throughout the horrible year of 2020 rose to the challenge, met it and got us to where we are today, well positioned for a better tomorrow. Thank you. Please be safe. Good night. Operator : Thank you so much ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you all for joining. You may now all disconnect.",

And now, I would like to introduce Booking Holdings speakers for this afternoon, Glenn Fogel and David Goulden. Go ahead, gentlemen. Glenn Fogel : Thank you. And welcome to Booking Holdings first quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden.  I am pleased to start by reporting further improvement in our accommodations business, with first quarter room nights declining 54% versus Q1 2019, which was 6 percentage points better than our fourth quarter 2020 decline. This improvement was driven by solid signs of increasing travel demand in certain countries and by our team's strong execution. David will provide the details on our first quarter results in his remarks.  As we have said before, we believe that the rate of recovery for travel will depend heavily on the rate and severity of new COVID-19 cases, the timing of effective and broad-based vaccine distribution, and hopefully, even more effective treatments in the future.  While the pace of vaccine distribution remains frustratingly slow in most places around the world, Israel, the UK and the US are benefiting from successful vaccine distribution programs. In each of these countries, we have seen encouraging booking trends. We support our view that vaccine distribution is a key to unlocking pent up travel demand. In our own survey work earlier in the year, we found that over 70% of Americans said that the early distribution stage of COVID-19 vaccines made them feel more hopeful and optimistic about traveling in 2021.  As countries ramp up vaccine distribution, which we are now starting to see in more European countries, we believe that we will start to see booking strength expand to more parts of the world.  While there are encouraging signs of recovery in some countries right now, the current situation in other countries such as India, where we are seeing staggering increases in COVID-19 cases and an enormous human tragedy happening reminds us that recovery is not underway everywhere. And unfortunately, in some countries, the situation is getting worse.  Last week, the World Health Organization warned that the pace of the pandemic is accelerating. We're mindful that governments may continue to take actions such as general area lockdowns or reintroducing travel restrictions, including barring people from high infection locations from entering the country. Any of these actions can have an impact on our performance, and it's difficult to predict when and to what extent such actions may be taken in the future.  Furthermore, international travel must recover for there to be a complete global travel recovery, and many governments may be cautious in fully opening international travel for some time.  Focusing on the US where the vaccination program is going well, I am very pleased with our first quarter results in the US and there's strong rebound in US travel demand. For Q1 in the US, we had positive room night growth versus Q1 2019 and it was our strongest performing major country. These results were driven by domestic bookings as our international business is still very slow.  We were pleased to see improvements in our US room night trends each month in Q1, and these improvements continued into April. The strength in the market benefited all of our travel products and helped drive the highest number of air tickets ever booked in a single quarter for our company. And we know that both Priceline and Booking.com had good US results during the first quarter.  In this improving environment, we continue to press ahead with one of our most important strategic strategies, strengthening the Booking.com brand in the US. You may have seen Booking.com US Back to Travel promotional campaign that we launched in April, which offered a $50 post-stay promotional travel credit for US travelers who activated the promotion in the Booking.com app and booked travel by the end of May.  This is just one example of the marketing methods that we will be employing to increase awareness of the Booking.com brand in the US. And in this case, drive further consumer engagement with our app.  We also remain focused on expanding the supply of Booking.com's alternative accommodation offering in the US and we targeted and signed new properties to the platform in the quarter. However, we recognize there's more work to be done to improve the breadth of this product in the US. During the first quarter, we continued to execute against other key strategic priorities, such as expanding Booking.com's payment platform and building the Connected Trip vision.  Regarding our integrated payment platform at Booking.com, we've made recent progress primarily through increased adoption by our supply partners in the US. As I have mentioned previously, this platform provides payment options favored by both travelers and our supplier partners across hotels, alternative accommodations, cars, flights and attractions, and is foundational for enabling our Connected Trip strategy.  The Connected Trip is our vision of a multi-product offering including combinations, flight, ground transportation, attractions and dining, connected by our payment network, and ultimately supported by personalized intelligence to provide a frictionless, seamless experience for our bookers, all the way from first thinking about the initial booking to experiencing their trip to arriving back home.  Building out our full Connected Trips vision will be a multi-year endeavor. However, we expect that our business will benefit from the steps we are taking to achieve this vision long before reaching the ultimate end state.  For example, developing a robust flight product at Booking.com gives us the ability to engage with flight bookers early in their travel journey and allows us an opportunity to cross sell our accommodation and other services to these bookers. We have not had these opportunities historically at Booking.com, given its accommodation only focus in the past.  As we think about the journey for building the Connected Trip, this year, we'll be focused on enabling travelers to book the major elements of their trip in one place on Booking.com. This means we will be working to build up our economic combination products like flights, ground transportation and attractions by increasing supply, as well as exposing more of our customers to these products. And Booking.com's flight offering, we are now live in 18 countries with the most recent launch in the UK. We can now expose a large segment of customers to flights as these 18 countries collectively represented more than half of Booking.com's room nights booked in 2019. Booking.com's flight offering is now fully native in the app. And while early, we are in the process of beginning to utilize marketing channels to bring potential customers to the product.  On attractions, we have continued to expand the breadth of supply available to our travelers through our recent partnership with Viator along with our ongoing partnership with Musement that was announced last year. We see real benefits of a strong attractions offering given the potential bundling opportunities, as well as the ability to increase traveler engagement with the app while travelers are in destination.  Of course, many of our key strategic priorities \u2013 I mentioned the app, which indicates the importance of the app for our business. We've been investing in the app platform for some time, and will continue to invest as the app becomes the center of our connected trip experience.  In addition, we see better customer loyalty, lower customer acquisition costs, and more opportunities to engage directly with travelers through our app. Booking.com was the most downloaded travel app globally in the first quarter, according to a leading third party research firm. We now see over two-thirds of our bookings come through the mobile devices, a majority of which are on the app. One of Booking Holdings' goals is to do well in the area of sustainability. I was very pleased to recently make public our 2020 sustainability report. And one achievement that I am particularly proud of is Booking Holdings becoming operationally carbon neutral in 2020. This is a significant milestone for our business, and one we were working towards even prior to the pandemic. We intend to remain carbon neutral in our operations in the future and look forward to making progress on our sustainability strategy, including diversity and inclusion and sustainable travel. In conclusion, the exact shape and timing of the full recovery for travel remains uncertain. However, I am encouraged by the signs of recovery we are seeing in some countries, and I'm confident that we will eventually see a strong recovery in travel demand globally.  That being said, we are likely to experience volatility between now and then, with some countries recovering well, others beginning to recover, and unfortunately, some getting worse.  I'm proud of the actions that our teams across Booking Holdings continue to take to strengthen our company's position and execute against our strategic priorities. We are thinking about our business beyond just getting back to 2019 levels of demand. We are focused on building a larger and faster growing business that generates more earnings into the recovery and for the long run.  I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden. David Goulden : Thank you, Glenn. And good afternoon. I'll review our operating results for the first quarter and provide some color on the trends we've seen so far in the second quarter. To avoid the comparison to the initial spread of the pandemic in 2020, all growth rates are relative to the comparable period in 2019, unless otherwise indicated.  Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release.  I also want to remind you that, during the period of bookings recovering, revenue will recover more slowly than bookings due to timing differences and this will impact our booking to revenue take rates.  Now on to our results for the first quarter. On our February earnings call, we discussed the improvements in trends we saw starting the middle of January and continuing into February, driven by domestic travel in most parts of the world.  The improvement in trends continued into March, resulting in our Q1 reported room night declining 54% versus Q1 2019, which was a 6% improvement versus the decline we reported in Q4. As a reminder, reported room night include the impact of cancellations.  The improvements in the Q1 room night decline rate versus Q4 is driven by the US and Europe, while Asia and rest of world declines were about the same in Q1 as they were in Q4.  The US was the strongest performing major country in Q1 and had a positive room night growth versus 2019 for the full quarter. The trends in the US improved through Q1, with very strong room night growth versus 2019 for the month of March. Spring Break was a contributor to growth in March. US domestic room night growth was positive for each month of the quarter, with very strong growth for the full quarter.  In Q1, other countries also experienced very strong domestic room night growth, including Russia and Australia. And we saw continued strengthening in domestic bookings in Israel. While Europe improved for the full quarter compared with Q4, we did see trends soften towards the end of March, driven by rising COVID case counts and new impositions of travel restrictions. Europe was the least recovered region in terms of room nights booked in Q4 and it remained the least recovered region in Q1.  Mobile bookings, particularly through our apps, continue to represent over two-thirds of our total room nights. Our direct channel gained share both sequentially and year-on-year.  Domestic room nights represented about 85% of our reported room nights in Q1, in line with our Q4 2020 mix of room nights and up significantly versus 2019. Our cancellation rates continue to be elevated versus 2019 in the quarter, but improved from levels we saw in Q4.  The booking window of Booking.com remained shorter than it was in the first quarter 2019 as we continue to see a higher mix of near-term bookings. However, the booking window contracted less than it did in the fourth quarter.  As we noted on the last call in January in February, we saw expansion of the booking window versus 2019 in Western Europe. And this expansion continued into March as the share of further out bookings, including those of summer travel, increased versus the same time in 2019. Due to the situation in Europe with new COVID cases, vaccination rates and travel restrictions, bookings are generally either very near term or for the summer period. The overall mix of customers booking alternative accommodations on Booking.com in Q1 was about the same as Q1 last year. As we noted last quarter, Europe is where we have our highest mix of alternative accommodations and Europe was the slowest growing region in the first quarter, which negatively impacted our alternative accommodation mix on a global basis. The mix of alternative accommodation in bookings in Europe increased by several percentage points year-over-year.  Gross bookings declined 53% in Q1, which is less than the decline in reported room nights, primarily due to strong performance in our flights business and partially offset by a 1% decline in average daily rates for accommodations versus 2019. Airline tickets booked in the first quarter were up 49% versus 2019, driven by strong growth of Priceline and by flight bookings of Booking.com and Agoda, both of which did not have flight products in Q1 2019.  Our accommodations' average day rates only declined 1% versus 2019, benefiting from a higher mix of North America, which is a higher ADR region. Excluding regional mix effects, ADRs were down approximately mid-single digits. ADRs in the quarter were helped by the higher mix of summer bookings in Western Europe, which typically have higher ADRs. Consolidated revenue for the first quarter was $1.1 billion and decreased 61% versus 2019. Revenue in the quarter declined more than gross bookings due to bookings made in the quarter that are expected to check in in future quarters, at which points in time to revenue will be recognized.  Take rates in Q1 were a little less than 10%, largely driven by these timing differences. As you'll recall, we discussed the impact of timing on take rates in 2020 and 2021 during our last call. We expect timing to impact take rates all year, assuming the booking growth continues to improve during the year.  The 61% reduction in revenue resulted in an adjusted EBITDA loss of $195 million in the quarter. We significantly reduced our variable expense lines, like marketing, sales and other, and while fixed expenses in Q1 were broadly in line with the commentary we provide our last call.  Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line, decreased 61% versus 2019. Marketing expenses declined more than gross bookings due to an increase in our direct mix and slightly higher ROIs in paid channels.  Sales and other expenses in Q1 will lower than they were in Q4 on a dollar basis, which was slightly better than our expectations. Personnel expenses were in line with our expectations. Q1 expenses were higher than they were in Q4 on a dollar basis due primarily to increased stock-based compensation expenses and seasonal increases in benefit costs, partially offset by a higher amount of savings in Q1 related to restriction actions we have taken.  G&A expenses were lower in Q1 than they were in Q4 on a dollar basis versus our expectation for them to be about in line due to lower-than-expected personnel-related costs and professional fees.  Information technology expenses were higher in Q1 than they were in Q4 on a dollar basis, but were lower than our expectations due to timing of spend.  Finally, we recorded $8 million restructuring charges in Q1, which was lower than our prior expectations primarily due to timing of real estate restructuring charges. I note, these restructuring charges are included in our non-GAAP results. We recorded a non-GAAP net loss of $215 million in the quarter. Our Q1 non-GAAP tax rate of 38% was meaningfully higher than our 2019 tax rate of 19% due to the greater impacts of non-tax deductible expenses on a lower base of earnings.  On a GAAP basis, we had an operating loss of $311 million in Q1. We recorded a GAAP net loss of $55 million in the quarter, helped by an income tax benefit of $223 million. Our Q1 tax rate of 80% was meaningfully higher than our 2019 tax rate of 21% due to the impact of non-tax deductible expenses on a lower base of earnings and the impact of the discrete items recorded in the quarter. Now, on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q1 ending cash and investment balance of $16.4 billion benefited from the $2 billion raised in our euro bond offering completed in March.  In April, we used all the proceeds from the euro bond offering to redeem to higher coupon senior notes that we issued earlier in the pandemic last year. These refinancing actions we took will result in approximately $70 million in annualized interest rate expense savings and were NPV positive transactions. Adjusting our Q1 ending cash investments for the redemption of the two senior notes that happened in April will result in a balance of $14.4 billion, which is down from our December ending balance of $14.8 billion. We had a $207 million operating cash outflow in the quarter, driven primarily by change in working capital, which represented the use of cash about $216 million in the quarter.  We will continue to focus on maintaining a strong liquidity position, given the high level of uncertainty created by the COVID pandemic. And consistent with our clients over the last year, we halted our repurchases of our stock and will not initiate repurchases until we have better visibility into the shape and timing of a recovery.  Now on to our thoughts for the second quarter. There continues to be considerable uncertainty about the shape and timing of recovery for travel, which means that we're unable to provide detailed guidance at this time. April room night declined about 43% versus 2019 which is better than the decline in March. Domestic room night growth was about flat versus 2019 for the month of April, the best monthly result for domestic room nights since last summer.  On a regional basis, the US continued to have very strong room night growth in April and was above March levels. Europe room nights declines were better in April than in March, recovering from a softening of trends we saw at the end of March and the first week of April. Room night declines in Europe were down over 50% in April. Asia room night declines worsened in April versus March as outbreaks in new cases increased, vaccination progress has been slow, and governments continued to impose restrictions on travel. Asia was the least recovered region in April.  The rest of the world declines were about the same in April as we were in Q1 and Q4.  While difficult to predict with accuracy, if current trends continue, Q2 room night declines could be a few percentage points better than in April. To give you a snapshot of what we're seeing recently, room night declines over the last seven days of April were about 38%. As I noted earlier, in Western Europe, the booking window expanded in Q1. This expansion continues into April, and we continue to see positive summer booking trends in Western Europe. Across all of Western Europe, gross bookings for the summer period are now within 30% of where we were at the same time in 2019. And for the UK, they're now at about the same level as we were at the same time in 2019. We remind you that the significant majority of summer bookings are cancelable. Turning to the income statements, as I said, we expect Q2 room night declines could be a few percentage points better than the decline in April. We expect Q2 gross bookings decline slightly less than room nights, driven by the same trends we saw in the first quarter.  We expect Q2 revenue to decline more than gross bookings due to timing factors we have discuss. As a result, we expect our Q2 revenue, as a percentage of gross bookings, will improve from Q1, but will be a few percentage points lower than in Q2 of 2019.  We expect marketing expenses in Q2 will decline a little more than gross bookings, but less than revenue. We expect sales and other expenses in Q2 to be up significantly versus Q1 on a dollar basis and will be a higher percentage of revenue due to higher gross booking volumes in the second quarter, as well as an increase in the mix of gross bookings processed on a merchant basis.  We expect personnel expenses in Q2 will be about the same as they were in Q1 on a dollar basis. Compared with Q1, SBC and benefit expenses are expected to be less, but this is offset by an increase in bonus accruals, which are recorded proportional to revenue.  We expect G&A expenses in Q2 will be higher than Q1 on a dollar basis, driven by a higher personnel related costs such as recruiting and T&E as well as higher professional fees and digital service taxes.  We expect IT expenses in Q2 will be higher than Q1 on a dollar basis due to increased investments in security, data privacy, and some operational systems enhancements, including some deferred expenses from Q1. We currently estimate the full year restructuring charges related to our actions of Booking.com will be approximately $30 million and we expect to record about half of these charges in the second quarter.  Given what we just explained, especially the timing difference between recovery of bookings and revenue, we expect recording an EBITDA loss in Q2, albeit less than the loss we reported in Q1. Depending upon how demand develops during the quarter, this could potentially be a small EBITDA loss in Q2.  For full-year 2021, we continue to expect that the overall environment for travel will improve during the year, but the shape and timing of that improvement remains uncertain.  As Glenn mentioned in his remarks, while we're seeing recovery and other encouraging signs in some countries, other countries and regions are struggling with a rapidly growing COVID wave. Globally, the number of new cases reported is increasing, with a record 5.7 million new cases recorded the week of April 19. This is directly impacting our business across much of Asia.  As a reminder about the [indiscernible] of our model during the recovery, we continue to expect that if we see continued recovery in 2021, there'll be more bookings made in 2021 that will check in in 2022 than there were bookings made in 2020 that checked in in 2021. This timing factor could have a meaningfully negative impact on our revenue as a percentage of gross bookings, and also drive de-leverage in our marketing expenses in 2021 as we incur the majority of our marketing expenses at the time of booking. To remind you, in 2018 and 2019, our revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was approximately 15.6%. This increased to 19.2% in 2020. We expect this percentage will be well below 15.6% in 2021. And the faster the recovery occurs, the lower this percentage will be.  Before closing, there's been a lot of interest in our commentary in February about the longer-term model for our business. I want to reiterate what we said previously and also provide some more color. We continue to believe it will be years, not quarters, before we see a full recovery of the travel market, especially international travel. Looking beyond 2021, we continue to look forward to being a larger business with more diverse offerings and with more earnings than we had prior to COVID. We also remain focused on the potential for higher growth and market share.  We expect to continue to have industry-leading EBITDA margin rates, albeit most likely levels below those in 2019, driven by mix shifts within the business that I discussed on the last call. As a reminder, these mix shifts include the continued growth of payments and the growth of flights and other Connected Trip verticals, which will add revenue and EBITDA, but at much lower margin rates than traditional accommodations. As we think about the future shape of our accommodation business, there are a few factors to consider. As discussed on the last call, we expect our personnel expenses in 2021 to be about the same as in 2019 as the savings from restructuring actions taken in 2020 are expected to be offset by personnel run rate investments made pre-COVID and personnel investments expected in 2021. Of course, some of these investments are to support payments and the Connected Trip.  As we look beyond 2021, the $370 million in savings from restructuring actions were mainly involving related functions, meaning that as volumes grow back to levels which we expect \u2013 which means as volumes go beyond levels we expect in 2021, we'll need to add expenses back to business.  As we mentioned before, we'll look to do this in cost effective ways. But the work will come back. And when added to our 2021 personnel cost base will put pressure on our accommodation business EBITDA margins relative to 2019 at the same level of volumes we had in 2019 and at the same growth rates.  Of course, there are offsetting factors that could improve margins, including variable cost efficiencies for additional scale, as we build well beyond 2019 volumes from fixed cost efficiencies and from increased direct mix.  The last thought I'd like to leave you with on this topic is that we believe that the recovery of the travel market will create opportunities to invest, to gain share in accommodations, which could put pressure on margins during a period of share gains.  In conclusion, we are pleased to see the recovery discussed in February continued into March and April in some parts of the world, leading to improvement in our top line metrics. We're also watching the spread of COVID and the distribution of effective vaccines very carefully and realize this may lead to continued volatility ahead. We remain confident that we can emerge from this crisis in a stronger position.  With that, we'll take your questions. And, Grace, we'll hand over to you to open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Justin Post from Bank of America. Justin Post : I think a couple of things would help. Can you give us any updates or your thoughts on mix between US, Europe and Asia, just so we can think about the recovery? And then, can you remind us what happened in Europe last summer when cases came down? Did you see a rapid increase? And are you seeing bookings pick up as people are vaccinated right now in Europe? David Goulden : David, why don't you take the\u2026? David Goulden : Justin, let me take that. So, just to remind you of our historic mix, we have basically said that Europe is, of course, our largest region historically. If you think kind of roughly 50% or maybe a little bit more, you wouldn't be far off being correct. Asia, we said, historically, again pre-COVID, was about 20% with no single country being more than low-single digits. And that means that you've really got 30% left for US and rest of world combined. So, that is our pre-COVID mix. Obviously, that mix changed a little bit with the dynamic of what's happened recently. Obviously, the US has gone up as that's been the most recovered marketplace. So, that's the historic reference points.  In terms of last summer, we saw a couple of things. We, of course, did see, after the first wave came down, we saw people getting more confident with traveling. Of course, vaccines were still not available at that point in time. So, people were kind of traveling quite carefully and traveling locally. What we have seen and we saw in several places, what we've seen so far is a very consistent trend, that when cases come down, when vaccination rates go up, when government restrictions start to lift, good things happen. We see that happening in the US right now. We see that happening in Israel. We mentioned a couple of other areas that are doing better than the average. So, our expectation is that we'll see those positive trends start to occur in other parts of the world, particularly in Europe as things are starting to improve. As we mentioned, we are seeing things improving on April versus March and Europe is now no longer the least recovered region. Justin Post : Maybe one follow-up. You mentioned share gains. Maybe for Glenn, the opportunities. Maybe you can give us a little more color on that. And do you think your US bookings are trending above kind of industry averages right now. Glenn Fogel : As I said, I'm very pleased with the Q1 results in the US. I mentioned both Priceline.com and Booking.com doing well. So, we are very happy about that. I don't have \u2013 we're not done with the quarter yet. So, we don't have industrywide numbers to go against. So, I'm just going to say that I'm pleased with what we're producing and we'll see everybody's reported how we did. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Kopelman from Cowen. Kevin Kopelman : I have a couple of follow-ups on the US growth. Can you give us any more of a sense of how much Q1 improved versus Q4. And obviously, the overall industry improved in the US in the first quarter quite a bit, but was Booking.Com or bookings growth in the US also a product of any specific decisions you made in the first quarter along the lines of your new strategic \u2013 increasing strategic focus on US share gains, for example, changing the way you're doing marketing or anything like that? Glenn Fogel : Why don't I talk generally about strategy and then, David, if he wants \u2013 I'm not sure he wants to disclose anything more about specific numbers and gains. I will say this. I've said this in several calls in the past, actually many, about increasing our performance in the US is a strategic priority. And we have said that we under index in the US. So, we are doing many, many things to try and improve that. And everything from the basics of making sure we have the right selections of properties that people want to making sure it's the right price, making sure we're competitive. I talked about how we had to have the US payments platform up and running for Booking.com, so we can do creative, new things such as our back to travel promo, which of course wasn't in Q1, but just another example of things that we're doing.  And there's a lot of just blocking and tackling done by both teams, Priceline.com and the people at Booking.com, working with our suppliers, coming up with ways that we can help them get more customers. So, it's so many different things. There's no one thing to say that was the silver bullet. And I expect that we will be able to continue to do this. I hope to be able to continue to do this in the future. It will remain a priority for us. And, David, if you want to talk about numbers. David Goulden : I will just, Kevin, reiterate what we said and give you a little flavor, make sure you understand where the emphasis was. So, things did improve significantly sequentially in the US during the quarter, and we have positive room night growth in the US year-on-year, which is great, because, obviously, international business was still down a fair amount. When we got into March, that room night growth in the US was very strong, which I characterize that as above any of our normal growth rates. That strengthened further into April. So, very strong plus. And then if you just kind of double click down and look at just the domestic, recognizing there is some substitution effect in there, the growth rates in the US was very strong for the entire quarter, positive for each month of the quarter and getting stronger, was again stronger in April than it was in March. Kevin Kopelman : If I could, just one follow-up on, you did the $50 travel credit promo in April. You see that as kind of an ongoing tactic or strategy that you might use? How much would this shift be a shift in costs from marketing spend to contra-revenue? Glenn Fogel : Well, we just put it out. Still an opportunity still to book on that one. It goes till the end of May for US people. They can still do a book, but they had to do the \u2013 in April, they had to actually activate it. So, we don't have a lot of [indiscernible] to tell you what we think that's going to be. It certainly is something that \u2013 it's one different thing that I pointed out, not because a huge driver, but just an example of things that we haven't done in the past that we will do in the future. And in fact, you may have noticed it, we started a very similar, but not exactly the same program in the UK yesterday. Or maybe it's two days ago.  The point being that we're trying to be more creative and going forward coming up with different ways to bring those customers to us, show them what a great product we have, great service we have and make sure they come back to us in the future, albeit not with the promotion. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from Evercore. Mark Mahaney : I've got two questions. I want to first start off, I think, Glenn, you made some comments about the mix of alternative accommodations, and being I think relatively similar in the March quarter versus a year ago. And I guess, I would have thought that it would have been kind of structurally higher, that somehow because of \u2013 during the COVID crisis. I know you talked about that mix increasing. Did you expect it to recover back? Would you expect it to revert back to where it was before? That is alternative accommodations as a percentage of your lodging mix. Or would you expect it to be somewhat elevated post COVID just because of the greater exposure that a lot of consumers had to that during the crisis? Glenn Fogel : Mark, I'll answer your question first about the general, what I expect in the future, and I'll let \u2013 it was Dave that talked about the mix and he can talk about \u2013 because we have more in Europe and it's the US, and I'll let him go through that [indiscernible] why we are where we are.  In terms of the future, here's the situation. We've been seeing for many, many years \u2013 and everyone's aware of this \u2013 that people have been more interested in the alternative accommodation. This is a global phenomenon. It's been going up at a steady rate for some time. COVID created a step functional change where people who may never have thought about an alternative accommodations, now they're thinking I want to go to a home that's not near people, maybe near the beach or near the mountains and I feel safer there. Now, having tried that, in the future, the question is you just asked is, will people go back to their former habits of some people going to hotels, some people homes and it will be a more gradual increase and will be a drop back first and then back up? I don't think anybody really knows.  But I would make the guess that people having tried the alternative accommodations during the pandemic will forever have it in their consideration set. And they may not always use it, they will choose what type of property fits their needs. But now, because it is part of their consideration set, I think there is a functional change in increased mix in the long run. That being said, for us, we do both. We have the greatest selection of both hotels and non-hotel accommodations together combined. So, we feel we are very well positioned globally for that. Though I have spoken in the past, in some regions, we are definitely in sufficient supply that we need to build up. And David, do you want to explain again about the issue because of mix in terms of geographies and the mix in properties? David Goulden : Mark, let me just explain that maybe in a slightly different way. So, starting with Europe, if you just look at our business within Europe, you only looked at it with that lens, you would see alternative accommodation mix in Q1 this last year up a fair amount compared to Q1 2020 and also versus Q1 of 2019. So within Europe, where we have our largest mix of alternative accommodation, we see an increase in mix. But you also remember, I said that Europe in Q1 was our lowest performing region. And of course, the highest performing region was the US where we have a much larger mix of alternative accommodation. So, that's mix effect means that, in total, our alternative accommodation mix did not increase. But in Europe, for example, where it's the largest, it did increase a fair amount. So mix effect is really the biggest region. In total, in Q1, the mix of alternative accommodations was very similar to the 30% number we gave out for all of FY 2020. But again, within different regions, there are shifts occurring. Mark Mahaney : If I can ask one follow-on question, I think you talked about a better ROI in paid marketing channels. And just your guess as to whether that's sustainable or not. Thanks a lot. David Goulden : That's a good question. There are many things going on in ROI. So, yes, we did see slightly improved ROI on the paid channels. We also saw an increase in direct mix. And those two together let us have marketing grow less than bookings in the quarter. But there are many factors that go into accounting ROI, including your cost per click, conversion rate, cancellation rates, and we're still in a period of, I'd say, high volatility across all of those. So, it's not reasonable to point to any one factor as to why ROIs were up, but they were up slightly [indiscernible]. And it's only just one quarter. So, given the volatility of things happening, we wanted to point it out, but too early to call a trend. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche Bank. Christopher Kuntarich : This is Chris on for Lloyd. Can you just talk a little bit about, I guess, booking frequency associated. It sounds like there has been meaningful pickup in share with you guys' app. Just kind of talk to us a little bit about booking frequency on app and how that compares to non-app users. Thanks. Glenn Fogel : David, I don't know if you ever disclosed anything in terms of frequency on the app? David Goulden : No. Chris, let me tell you about what we have talked about and see if that answers the question and then maybe we haven't got your question completely right. But just to kind of remind us where we are right now, over two thirds of our bookings are mobile, majority of those are on app. Our app booking customers are our most frequent bookers relative to other direct channels. Because always we can have a direct booking through a mobile web direct booking or through a desktop booking. And the app bookers are the most loyal and the most returning. But we really haven't gone into frequency. And also, I'd say right now, in the current environment where we're still very much recovering, frequency metrics are not the most critical ones that we focus on right now. It's more the overall top line growth rates.  But we are pleased what we're seeing with a trend towards app usage, the increase in the mix and the repeat behavior of app users. Those are all positive things for us. Christopher Kuntarich : Just want to make sure, more of a housekeeping question. I saw a little bit of repurchase activity that was not related to you guys starting up your buyback again, is that correct? David Goulden : No, that was related to employee stock purchases. That was not buyback related. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Alaxandar Wang : This is Alax Wang on for Brian. Thanks for taking our question. First, just on flights, I appreciate the update on the rollout to 18 countries. Maybe any early learnings you could share with us, particularly in the US and potentially attach rates that you could share and sort of what do you foresee as the key two or three incremental investments to sort of execute on flights as we progress through the year? Glenn Fogel : We don't give away \u2013 I don't believe we ever talked about the actual attach rates. But I will say that that is an important reason we do flights and that getting that booker upfront is important, so that we can then get them to buy something that will have a higher margin.  The 18 countries in the Booking.com is now working in, we are getting initial \u2013 and we've been doing it for some time now, obviously, I guess a year now approximately. We are getting some learnings, how can we improve it, how can we make it better? We really haven't marketed this at all in terms of the way we market our hotels offering because we want to get it right before we start spending a lot of money. We don't want to waste money as you know.  I am very pleased, though, with the very limited effort that we've done that people are using it and we are getting feedback that people are coming back. So, that's good. It's something that's important for the long run. And I want to emphasize how much this is a long game we're playing here because, as you know, the number is still very, very, very small and this is very early. But we hope in the long run that this connected trip, which is not just the flights, but it's also the ground transportation and the attractions and the dining, all the things that people do when they are traveling, to create something that makes them want to always use our app more than anything else. When they think of travel, they come back to us. So, it's critical that we have that first thing, which is important to a lot of people, flights. And we're going to continue to make investments into it to make sure that is absolutely a great, great service. Alaxandar Wang : Just one follow-up. I think a couple quarters ago, you guys had tested a digital brand campaign. I'm not sure if there's anything you can share on that. But maybe bigger picture, as we look at the performance channels ex search, do you see any opportunities to sort of lean into more of the non-search performance channels with online video as we're seeing increasing sort of digital transformation as a result of the pandemic? Glenn Fogel : We recognize that's where the eyeballs are going. So, we need to make sure that we are putting our name appropriately in front. So, people when they think of travel, they think of us. So we are cognizant of that fact and we are we are working on that. So yes, we will continue to work with that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mario Lu from Barclays. Mario Lu : I have one on agency versus merchant bookings and one on payments. So, the one on agency versus a merchant, it looks like the merchant bookings recovered to a level much quicker in 1Q compared to agency. Is there anything to kind of call out there to explain the quicker recovery?  And then on payments, you guys mentioned you guys are north of 20% of bookings. Is there a specific target you guys plan to reach in the long term? And how should that flow through to say revenue and operating margins over time? Glenn Fogel : Dave, why don't you talk to about agency/merchant question and I'll talk about the long vision on payments. David Goulden : Actually, we saw a slightly lower mix of merchants in Q1 this year than in Q1 last year, both in total and at Booking.com. Because bear in mind, you're kind of comparing essentially an almost a non-crisis quarter \u2013 last year, of course, Q1, in March, things got worse, but most of the quarter was not crisis. And now you're talking about \u2013 comparing with a quarter that is very much still in the crisis with recovery mode. So, people in the short term, looking at the more flexible agency, pay the hotel model because that has just an attractive proposition in times like this when flexibility becomes very, very important. We do expect the merchant business to actually increase during the year at Booking.com where we have obviously the big mix shift happening. And we still think that the merchants business in total in 2021 will be a slightly higher mix than it was in 2020. But of course, flexibility is one of the factors that is important as people are looking at the bookings in this environment. So that's what's going on this year. Glenn Fogel : In the long view, we'd like to get as much business as possible on payments because we believe we'll create a better service for both our customers for traveling and our supplier partners to be able to do all sorts of things you can't do when it's just a straight agency play. And we believe we can provide value to everyone in that way. And I gave that example earlier about \u2013 we couldn't do a back to trial promotion if we didn't have a payment product to do that. And there are many ways we're going to be able to merchandise people's \u2013 our supplier partners, different ways to merchandise their offerings in ways that you can really only do well with a payment platform. And, of course, putting things together, bundling, all different things. So obviously, we would like to get as many people in because it's good for everybody who comes into it, both the customer and the supplier. That being said, we know that we'll never get to 100%. There will be \u2013 still be lots of people who will say, all I need is hotel, I like this agency thing, I pay the desk, it's all fine, we'll see if that happens, whatever. But even in that situation, we may actually do the payment for the hotel in a way that we can save them money. So it's a great opportunity for us. But it's the long view and it's going to take some time to get there. David Goulden : Just to kind of reiterate what we said before about how it plays out in the income statements, we get additional revenue from providing the payment service. We have a variable cost related to that sitting in sales and other, which is where you see the biggest offsetting a cost element to offset \u2013 to match the revenue. There are some incremental expenses, obviously, in our other lines as well related to running the payments program, but the biggest variable cost is sitting in sales and other. As we mentioned, in 2020, the payments business operated very close to breakeven when factoring particularly variable costs into account, which is an improvement from what it was before. And it's obviously an enabler for business, as Glenn just articulated. So, we want to continue to grow the mix and maintain that breakeven profile as we're growing it out, recognizing that, in the future, we recognize there are monetization opportunities that can lead to incremental EBITDA from the payments business, which we expect, albeit at lower margin rates than core accommodations. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth from J.P. Morgan. Dae Lee : This is Dae on for Doug. Thanks for taking the questions. My first one is on your alternative accommodation product. You've talked about works needed to improve the product in the US. Is that just inventory and awareness that you've talked about in the past? Or are there other areas where you see opportunities to improve?  And then, just on the room night growth and booking growth, it seems like there's been a sizable divergence in trajectory. Kind of feel [indiscernible] anything else notable that's driving that and how should we think about the relationship between the two going forward? Glenn Fogel : I'll take the first and, Dave, why don't you take the second? So, in terms of the alternative accommodations in the States, the things you mentioned are very, very important. We've got to have the right properties for the customer. And I've talked about this in the past that we under-index with the private homes, the single homes in the States. And that has been a popular product in the States because of the pandemic. And that's something that we are continuing to work on in the future. It's also just the process in general, how we get people on board, who we're dealing with to get them to come in. And we currently are using the multi-product property managers more than, say, some of our competitors who go out and get individual properties. So, there's a difference in how we're doing it right now.  I do believe this is a very, very achievable goal to be as competitive as anybody else. As David mentioned earlier about mix, we do a great business in Europe in the alternative accommodations area. A very good business. And there's no reason we shouldn't be able to do the exact same thing here in the States, though it is taking time. David Goulden : On what's going on between the dynamic between room night growth and booking growth, a couple of factors going on here. One, I mentioned the fact that we're doing \u2013 that we're seeing better booking growth performance from flights because of volume. And also, we are doing \u2013 even though the units are down for 4% to 6% in car, there's actually fairly good increase in rates for cars. So total bookings, the TGV, has done better for both flights and cars than it did for accommodations. But the biggest factor is really what's going on with ADRs. And there has been a bit of a shift in what we've seen even in the last couple of months. And we are \u2013 saw that ADRs in the quarter were only down 1%. Now, I would say a couple of things. Now, the like-for-like ADRs are absolutely still under pressure due to lower occupancy rates. But there are some mix benefits that really impact the year-on-year comparison. The first mix benefit was the mix shift towards the US as the US really started to accelerate, particularly in March. You saw a really fast pickup in growth rates in March that we were not forecasting when we last met you. So, that was a positive for room night growth, but also for ADRs.  And also in Europe, what's happening is, right now, because there are still a lot of restrictions, people booking today are booking generally more often for the summer holiday and the summer holiday period in Europe has higher ADRs than most short-term stays. So, those two mix effects are really helping the ADR picture. And we expect this \u2013 both the phenomena that I talked about in terms of air and car and ADRs are likely to go through to Q2 as well.  But we do think the ADRs will start to be driven down again in the second half due to a couple of reasons. Again, the like-for-like ADRs are under pressure. As an example, our stay ADRs in the first quarter were down mid-teens if you exclude regional mix. That's more of a kind of like-for-like comparison. So, that like-for-like comparison is more likely to kind of be exposed in the second half. Regional mix may continue to help. But then, we do think that this earlier booking of the summer \u2013 benefit of the summer bookings will fade and the reported ADRs will become more comparable with the underlying stay ADRs and those will converge back together more in the second half than they did in the first half. So, some interesting phenomena going on with mix and with booking window in Europe driving what we're going to see in Q1 and Q2. Operator : And your last question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan from Wolfe Research. Deepak Mathivanan : Just a couple ones. So, first, wanted to go back to your comment about investing to gain share with the margin opportunity? How should we think about your approach strategically? Is it on variable marketing channels? Obviously, there's a few products that you have talked about before, but are there any other initiatives that you would know that's something that could be impactful during this recovery period?  And then the second question is on the labor market situation here in the US. Obviously, it is very tight. And some of the hotel operators have called out the challenges there as well. How do you think this affects your business, if at all? Maybe broadly, talk about how supply side is evolving during the recovery. Glenn Fogel : I'll start with the second part, labor. And I'll let David go back to margins and how things can look as we continue to go for the future. So, certainly, we've all read news articles about shortages right now popping up in different areas of the hospitality industry. And some of the leaders in the industry, particularly some of the hotels and restaurants saying just can't get workers. But I don't believe that's going to impact where people aren't going to be able to find a place to stay at all. Right now, there is no shortage in my mind of great places for people to go to. And I don't see that happening. Yes, some property types may be short at certain times during high season, particularly, some of the very popular areas in the summer as leisure comes back in some parts of the world. But overall for the business, I don't see this as a significant or even a small risk to the business at all. And Dave, you can talk a little bit about margin. David Goulden : Clearly, in a business like ours, there's always a trade-off between growth and profitability or growth and margins, particularly in the short term. And the areas that we would expect to be leaning into, there are a number of initiatives that we can drive to \u2013 lean into to drive further growth. Obviously, we need to be smart and we need to be nimble, we need to look at where the pockets of opportunity are. But we continue to be, I think, a very good marketeer in the pay channels and look at those demand opportunities and really have the opportunity to lean into those where we think we can and where we think we can actually gain incremental traffic. We can do things with merchandising, and we can also do things with things like promotions, like back to travel. Also, there are areas like brands. So, there are multiple levers we can pull to drive growth above market where we believe there are opportunities to do so. We believe that the recovery obviously presents a very dynamic environment for everybody. And we want to make sure that we are taking advantage of opportunities that we can either make or made for us. And those are the things that would, in the short term, impact margins. Bear in mind, as we talked about what's happening this year, during periods of time when bookings are growing faster than revenue, that impacts the business because, generally, our expenses are associated upfront with capturing the booking and the revenue comes later. So those are all things that go into the dynamics around growth versus margin in the accommodation business. Operator : Thank you, everyone. And that's all the questions that we have for today. I'll turn the call over back to our CEO, Glenn Fogel, for any closing remarks. Glenn Fogel : Thank you. So, in closing, I want to thank our partners, our customers, our dedicated employees and our shareholders. We appreciate your support as we continue to navigate through these better, though still difficult times, and we want to continue to build on the long-term vision for our company. Thank you. Thank you, everyone, and please be safe. Good night. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for joining. You may now all disconnect.",

And now, I would like to introduce Booking Holdings first speaker for this afternoon, Mr. Glenn Fogel. You may begin your conference. Glenn Fogel : Thank you and welcome to Booking Holdings second quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. I\u2019m encouraged by another quarter of meaningful improvement in our accommodations business with Q2 room nights up sequentially 59% versus Q1. This compares very favorably to our pre-pandemic historical pattern of a slight decline in Q2 room nights versus Q1. Compared with 2019, Q2 room nights were down 26%, which was significantly better than the 43% decline we previously reported for the month of April and a 54% decline in Q1. The acceleration in the second quarter was primarily driven by domestic and international booking trends in Europe, following a ramp up in vaccination rates and the relaxation of many travel restrictions in the region. Good growth of international bookings in Europe was mainly from bookings within the European region. The very strong room night growth in the United States that we saw in April and highlighted on our last earnings call continued in May and June, resulting in very strong US room night growth for the full quarter versus Q2 2019. David will provide additional details on our second quarter results in his remarks. We are, of course, closely monitoring the impact of the Delta variant on the rising COVID case counts around the world as well as some newly imposed travel restrictions, which have led to a modest pullback in our booking trends in the month of July relative to June. However, the July booking trends were improved from our full Q2 results. While the rise of the Delta variant demonstrates the volatility and uncertainty around the exact timing and shape of the recovery for travel, we remain confident that we will eventually see a strong recovery in travel demand globally. The sharp return to growth initially in the U.S and then in the European markets that we have witnessed this year shows us clearly that leisure travelers are eager to get back to booking trips on our platform when restrictions are lifted and customers are able to travel. We expect to be much closer to our 2019 revenue levels in Q3 than we were in Q2, driven by the strong booking improvements we have seen in the last few months. As we\u2019ve done throughout the pandemic, we will continue to build on the strengths of our poor accommodation business and support its long-term growth. The strength of our core business comes from the flywheel effect we get from our two sided marketplace where we drive benefits to our traveler customers and our supply partners alike. For our customers, we strive to deliver the best choice of accommodations offer the most value and provide the easiest booking experience, all backed by excellent customer service and support. By addressing these critical needs of choice, value and ease, we create a superior booking experience and strengthen the relationships with our customers. I'm pleased to report that at Booking.com we are seeing pre-pandemic customers coming back to us to book their trips, while also attracting new customers. And the current mix of prior and new customers is not significantly different than prior to the pandemic. One of the ways we drive value to our large customer base at Booking.com is through our Genius Loyalty program. This program provides discounts for Genius members at hundreds of thousands of properties on our platform, and also offers value and other benefits like complimentary breakfast, free room upgrades, and more recently, discounted airport taxes just to name a few. We will continue innovating and adding to the ways we provide value to our Genius customers who have historically had a higher repeat rate and a higher mix of direct bookings when compared to non-Genius customers. Our app is an important way we deliver an easier booking experience to our customers. Globally, in Q2, Booking.com was the number one downloaded OTA app according to a third-party research firm. In the U.S., in Q2, we were the most downloaded major OTA app as downloads of Booking.com app in the second quarter significantly increased sequentially. We also saw U.S app user in Q2 meaningfully surpassed the prior peak observed before the COVID pandemic. In the second quarter, we again saw a higher mix of our customers booking directly with us than in the comparable period in 2019. It is encouraging to see these gains even as we look for opportunities to lean into performance marketing channels, where we see attractive ROIs. We have a long history of effectively managing our performance marketing channels to bring bookers to our platform profitably. We plan to continue with this proven approach in the future. In addition, we're leveraging our marketing expertise and ROI focus as we test into other channels like social and digital media, as well as when we deploy promotional campaigns like our Back to Travel campaign, which we ran first in the U.S and then launched in the U.K and across Europe. We will continue to expand the diversity of our marketing and customer acquisition channels as we aim to drive incremental traffic to our platform and increase consumer awareness of our brands. While we will remain focused on our efforts to grow and retain our customer base, we believe we will continue to benefit from the secular tailwind of more people booking their trips online instead of offline. Historically, the accommodation industry has seen a steady increase in online share each year. And looking ahead, we believe this trend will continue for the foreseeable future. In April, McKinsey published a 24 country survey with results showing that across 11 major consumer facing industries, travel had the greatest percentage of customers that plan to increase their usage of digital channels after the pandemic. On the other side of our marketplace, we are focused on helping our supply partners reach a broader audience of potential customers. Our scale and global reach allows us to connect our supply partners with a significant amount of demand from around the world, demonstrated by the 845 million room nights booked across our platforms in 2019. In addition to being a large demand channel for our partners, we add value to our accommodation partners in other ways by providing customer service support for travelers in over 40 languages, localized partner service support teams, market intelligence and data, product innovations in response to new traveler trends and fraud liability shift and access to alternative payment methods for payment enabled transactions. With an alternative accommodation or independent hotel, or a large global hotel chain, we strive to be a valuable partner to all types of accommodations on our platform. In the second quarter, we saw the first sequential increase in the number of properties on Booking.com and the lowest number of properties coming off of our platform in the quarter since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of June 30, we had over 28 million reported listings on Booking.com, of which 6.6 million were for alternative accommodation properties. Within alternative accommodations in the U.S., Booking.com continue to add targeted new properties in the corner, and also saw encouraging share gains with some of our larger professional managers. While these are positive early developments, we recognize there is much work ahead to improve and grow our alternative accommodations product in the U.S market. Our alternative accommodations business in Europe was strong in the quarter and represented an increasing share of our European accommodations business. I want to move to our key strategic priorities of expanding Booking.com's payment platform and building the Connected Trip vision, both of which we believe will further enhance the strength of our core accommodation business and support its continued growth. On our integrated payment platform at Booking.com, we have made continued progress with increasing the adoption of payments by our supply partners in the U.S., including adding some major hotel chains in the second quarter. Around 24% of Booking.com's total gross bookings in Q2 were processed through its payment platform, which is up from about 22% for the full year 2020. We recently announced the organization of all of our payments initiatives and efforts into a new fintech unit at Booking.com. First, the fintech unit will be focused on enabling bookings core business to run better, faster and more efficiently for both customers and our supply partners. In addition, we recognize that we have opportunities to better monetize our overall transaction flows. In 2019, we did almost $100 billion of transaction value, and we believe setting up a separate fintech unit to better capitalize on these flows will benefit us in the long run. On our Connected Trip vision, I mentioned on our last earnings call that the development of the Connected Trip this year will be focused on enabling travelers to book the major elements of their trip in one place on Booking.com. The top priority of this -- on this front has been to scale up a robust flight platform on Booking.com, which will give us the ability to engage with flight bookers early in their travel journey, and allow us an opportunity to cross-sell our accommodation and other services to these bookers. Since our last earnings call, we have launched our flight product in six new markets, and now alive in 24 countries. In air tickets booked through bookings flight offering have continued to meaningfully exceed our expectations. However, these still represented a small portion of our total reported air tickets, which were up 120% in Q2 versus Q2 2019, primarily this is driven by Priceline. While it remains early days for Booking's flight product, we are seeing positive data indicating we are getting entirely new customers for Booking.com. In addition, we are seeing an encouraging attach rate of a combination bookings from these new customers. These early data points help demonstrate that our flight offering creates a new funnel to bring incremental customers to the platform, and then cross-sell an accommodation to these new customers. We expect to continue to build on the early success we are seeing with flight at Booking.com. In conclusion, I am encouraged by the signs of recovery we are seeing in some parts of the world. And I'm confident that we will eventually see a strong recovery in travel demand globally. We continue with our most important work to strengthen our company's position and execute against our strategic priorities. And our teams are working hard to support the strong summer travel season this year in North America and Europe. As I said before, we are thinking about our business beyond just getting back to 2019 levels of demand. And we are focused on building a larger and faster growing business to generate more earnings after the full recovery and for the long run. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden. David? David Goulden : Thank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I'll review our operating results for the second quarter and provide some color on trends we've seen so far in the third quarter. To avoid comparison to pandemic impacted periods in 2020, all growth rates will be relative to comparable period in 2019 unless otherwise indicated. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. Now on to our results for the second quarter. On our last earnings call, we discussed the improvement in trends in Q1 which continued into April, driven by strong results in the U.S and improvements in Europe. On the earnings call, we saw the overall improvements in our trends accelerate in May and continue to get better in June, which resulted in our Q2 reported room nights declining 26% versus Q2 2019, which was significantly ahead of the 54% decline in Q1, a 43% decline we saw in April and our expectations in May. The improvement in Q2 room nights growth rate versus Q1 was driven by Europe and the U.S as well as better results in rest of world. Europe showed the greatest level of recovery in the quarter and actually achieved slight room night growth versus 2019 in June. Booking trends in Europe clearly benefited from a notable improvement in vaccination rates, as well as loosening travel restrictions. The U.S was again the strongest performing major country in Q2, and have very strong room night growth versus 2019 for the full quarter. Asia partially offset improvements in other regions with greater room night declines in Q2 than in Q1, due to the increase in COVID outbreaks with related travel restrictions. In the month of June, our room nights were down 13% and our monthly active unique customer accounts at Booking.com reached about 90% of the level we saw in June 2019. As Glenn mentioned, we are pleased to see the solid rebound in our customer base of Booking.com as well as a healthy mix of new customers, which is only a little lower than the mix of new customers in Q2 2019. Mobile bookings, particularly through our apps, represented over 60% of our total room nights. Our app continues to represent an increased percentage of our mobile bookings. Our direct channel increased as a percentage of room nights year-on-year and relative to Q2 2019. Domestic room nights grew in the mid teens in Q2, while international room nights remained down significantly versus 2019, we saw a sequential improvement in our international bookings resulting in the international mix of our room nights increasing to about 25% in Q2 from about 15% in Q1. Our cancellation rates improved from Q1 and were in line with Q2 2019 levels in the quarter. The percentage of our Q2 2021 bookings made with flexible cancellation policies remain significant higher than in Q2 2019. The booking window Booking.com remained shorter than it was in the second quarter of 2019 as we continue to see a higher mix of near-term bookings. However, the booking window contract is less than it did in the prior three quarters. The mix of alternative accommodation room nights on Booking.com in Q2 was 32%, which is three points higher than Q1. In June, our alternative accommodation room night growth was flat versus June 2019, the first time we've reached 2019 levels for this segment since the start of COVID. The sequential improvement from Q1 to Q2 was due primarily to the overall improvements in room night growth in Europe in the quarter. As we noted, last quarter, Europe is where we have our highest mix of alternative accommodations. Within Europe, our mix of alternative accommodation remained about the same as Q1, this represents a continued increase from 2019 to 2020 and in to2021. Gross bookings declined 12% in Q2, which is less than the decline in reported room nights, due to an increase in average day rates for accommodations of a 11% versus 2019 on a constant currency basis, and also due to a few points of changes in FX rates and strong performance in our flights business. Our accommodation constant currency ADR benefited by about 7% from an increased mix of business in North America, which is the high ADR region and a decrease of mix of business in Asia, which is a lower ADR region. Excluding regional mix effects, constant currency ADR was up approximately 4%, driven mainly by rate increases in North America and in Europe. The increase in North America were driven by high levels of demand for beach oriented leisure destinations. And in Europe were driven by a higher mix of summer bookings which have higher ADRs. Airline tickets booked in the second quarter were up 120% versus 2019, driven by strong growth of Priceline and by flight bookings of Booking.com and Agoda, neither of which have flight products in Q2 2019. We are encouraged to see another record breaking quarter for air tickets booked for our flights business, which is a key component of a multiproduct Connected Trip strategy. Consolidated revenue for the second quarter was $2.2 billion and decreased 44% versus 2019, which is better than our expectations. Revenue in the quarter declined meaningfully more than gross bookings due to bookings made in the quarter that are expected to check-in in future quarters at which point the revenue will be recognized. Take rates in Q2 were about 10%, largely driven by these timing differences. As you will recall, we discussed the impact of timing on take rates in Q1, Q2 and for the full year during our last call. We continue to expect these timing factors to impact full year take rates, although the second half of the year will be less notably impacted than the first half of the year. Removing the impact of timing, our take rates on accommodation bookings in Q2 were stable versus Q2 2019. The better-than-expected top line performance resulted in adjusted EBITDA of $48 million in the second quarter, which came in better than our expectations. With the exception of Q3 last year, this is the first EBITDA positive quarter since the first wave of COVID. Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line decreased 29% versus 2019. Marketing expense declined more than gross bookings due to higher ROIs in the paid channels and the increase in our direct mix. Sales and other expenses in Q2 were significantly higher than they were in Q1 on a dollar basis. Sales and other expenses has a percentage of revenue in Q2 with better than our expectations due to lower-than-expected by debt and customer service related expenses. Personnel expenses in Q2 were higher than they were in Q1 on a dollar basis, primarily due to the $136 million expenses related to our decision to repay the government aid in the second quarter. Excluding this repayments, personnel expenses in Q2 would have been in line with our expectations. G&A and IT expenses were both higher in Q2 than it were in Q1 on a dollar basis, and we're in line with our expectations. We recorded a non-GAAP loss of $105 million in the quarter. On a GAAP basis, we have an operating loss of $56 million in Q2. We recorded a GAAP net loss of $167 million in the quarter, which includes income tax expense of $146 million. On a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, in Q2, we recorded a tax expense on a pre-tax loss due to higher earnings expectations for the full year relative to our expectations for Q1. For the full year, we expect on GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be slightly higher than in 2019. Now onto our cash and liquidity position. Our Q2 ending cash and investment balance of $16.1 billion was down versus our Q1 ending balance of $16.4 billion. However, our Q1 ending balance benefited from the timing of the $2 billion raised in our euro bond offering which we completed in March and the subsequent redemption of the two higher coupon senior notes occurring in April. Adjusting our Q1 ending cash balance for the redemption of the two notes that happened in April would have resulted in an adjusted Q1 cash balance of $14.4 billion. Our Q2 ending balance was higher than this adjusted Q1 balance primarily due to operating cash flow of $1.2 billion and a $0.5 billion unrealized gain on long-term investments. $0.2 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter was driven almost entirely by change in working capital. Change in working capital represented source of cash of $1.2 billion in the quarter due to the increase in our deferred merchant bookings and other current liabilities, partially offset by the increase in our accounts receivable. We will continue to focus on maintaining a strong liquidity position given the continued uncertainty created by the COVID pandemic. Of the $16.1 billion of cash and investments at the end of Q2, $4.3 billion was related to our long-term strategic investments, and $11.7 billion was cash and short-term investments. We ended the quarter with about $12.3 billion in debt, which is about $3.6 billion higher than our pre-pandemic levels. We have a 1 billion convertible note maturing in Q3. While return of capital to shareholders will be an important component of our value creation strategy in the future, we remain on pause and we will wait to reinitiate and so we believe each of our three major regions is beyond the risk of a significant reversal in trends due to COVID. We're not there yet, given the current trends we're seeing in Asia and with our current close watch on how things are developing in Europe. Now on to our thoughts for the third quarter. With the recent rising case counts driven by Delta -- by the Delta variant in many countries, some governments around the world have responded with new travel and leisure restrictions as well as some stricter vaccination and testing requirements for tourists. However, there are indications that hospitalization rates are lagging the recent increases in case counts, particularly in countries with high vaccination rates, which could be an important factor in how governments plan their responses to the recent increase in COVID cases. We're closely watching the U.K where the vaccination rate is high, and the government's move forward with relaxing travel restrictions despite rising case counts in the country, which are among the highest in Europe. We are encouraged by the recent decline in new case counts and by the continued low level of hospitalizations in the U.K compared with other outbreaks. We saw booking trends improved in the U.K in July, leading up to an after travel restrictions lifted on July 8 -- on July 19.  Our July room nights declined about 22% versus 2019, which was a modest pullback from the 13% decline in June, family just softening booking trends in Europe. Looking within Europe, we saw a reduction to room nights in July across several of our key countries including Germany, France and Italy. But despite the recent pullback in these countries at the end of July, we had a high amount of gross bookings on the books for the remaining summer period in Europe than we did this same point in time in 2019. Outside of Europe, the U.S continued to have very strong room night growth in July, although modestly below Q2 levels. While Asia and rest of world room night declined for about the same in July as it were in June. Asia continues to be the least recovered region in July and continues to be down significantly from 2019 levels. The changing growth rates from June to July were similar for domestic and international room nights with domestic remaining positive and international room nights remaining down significantly versus 2019. Given the recent additional uncertainty around COVID, driven primarily by the Delta variant, it's difficult to predict exactly how room nights in August and September will compare with a 22% reduction we saw in July. Turning to the income statement. We expect Q3 gross bookings to decline several points less than room nights, driven by expected improvements in reported areas and my flight bookings. We expect that the Q3 revenue decline will significantly improve from Q2 reflecting the strong improvement in bookings in the last few months. I just mentioned we have more gross bookings for the summer than at this time in 2019 for Europe. The same is also true for North America. We expect our Q3 revenue as a percentage of gross bookings will increase meaningfully from Q2 due to the high concentration of checkings expected in the third quarter and will be about in line with Q3 2019. As a reminder, the exact relationship between revenue and gross bookings in Q3 will be impacted by how our bookings trend in August and September. We expect marketing expenses in Q3 will decline several points less than gross bookings, as we expect to invest in capturing demand and increasing awareness during the peak travel season and ahead of the continued global recovery of travel demand. We expect sales and other expenses in Q3 to be up significantly versus Q2 on dollar basis due to higher gross booking volumes in the third quarter as well as a mix -- as well as an increase in the mix of gross bookings process on a merchant basis. However, we expect sales and other as a percentage of revenue in Q3 will be a bit lower than in future. We expect our more fixed expense categories in Q3 in aggregate to be about in line with Q2 on a $1 basis. We expect Q3 EBITDA will be the highest since Q3 2019. In conclusion, we have pleased with our better-than-expected results in Q2, which benefited from a recurring travel demand, and also reflects the strong fundamentals of our business, a good execution by our teams. We remain confidence in the eventual full recovery of travel demand globally, and we're looking forward to a strong summer travel season this year in North America and Europe. We will continue to respond to invest in our business to ensure we're well-positioned for the full recovery of travel, and for building a larger and faster growing business generates more earnings than prior to the pandemic. We'll now take your questions. Maria, if you could open the lines for questions, please. Operator : Okay. [Operator Instructions] And your first question will come from the line of Kevin Kopelman from Cowen. Your line is open. Kevin Kopelman : Great. Thanks a lot. Could you talk more about key drivers of your competitive share gains that look like you're seeing in the U.S. And would you say growth in U.S over the past few months has been driven more by traditional hotel or more by alternative accommodation? Thanks. Glenn Fogel : So Kevin, why don't I take a little of this and let David add anything that he thinks I didn't put in that I should have said. So we are very pleased with the strong results that we're seeing in the U.S and that is a result of a lot of hard work by our team. A lot of it is just the blocking and tackling and making sure that we're getting the right inventory, the right price to the right marketing, presenting the right offer to the customer at the right time. And doing a bunch of things that we've been doing for so long in terms of improving conversion, a lot of AB testing, all the things we've always done, blocking and tackling. There's no silver bullet. There's no sense oh, this is the magic key to unlock extra demand in the U.S. It's just a lot of very good work. Now in terms of alternative accommodations, talked a little bit about how we're pleased to getting more inventory there. We're faced with gaining some share with some of our professional managers that's going well. But overall, it's everything that we do to improve our business provide a better service to both sides of that marketplace, both the customers given a paid offer and working with all of our suppliers from the biggest international chains to the small alternative accommodation and everything in between to make sure we're providing them with the demand they need to make their business successful. David anything specific you want to answer that? David Goulden : Oh, Glenn, I think you said it well, Just in response to your last part of the question, Kevin, as we said, our business in the U.S is more heavily mix to hotels alternatives than our global average. So therefore the growth rate has to be driven by both. We don't have levels of growth that we're seeing without seeing strong growth in the hotel business. Kevin Kopelman : Yes, understood. Thanks, Glenn and thanks, David. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Mario Lu from Barclays. Your line is open. Mario Lu : Great, thanks for taking the question. As to on alternative accommodation, so I believe you mentioned you're gaining share on the manage properties globally. So can you provide some color onto what drove this share gain? Whether it was just mostly geo based, or specific actions that you guys made on your end? And then really, if you could share what percentage at the 6.6 million listings are actually managed properties versus by individual? Thanks. Glenn Fogel : I got a little backwards on that. So we don't disclose the breakdown of all the different categories of our alternative accommodations, how many are professionally managed, how many are single property owners and everything in between. I have said in the past and I'll repeat it that one of the areas that we do need to add more to is these single property owners. So we know that is an area that we need to focus on. In regards to your other questions about how we're doing adding care, I think we spoke a little bit about that. When I did the prepared remarks and when I just said now is a lot of this is just working hard with people are the property owners or the managers, people who have inventory that want to get it filled. It's a wonderful thing in this business that everybody knows an empty bed at night at zero revenue, you fill that bed, and you get an incredible margin on and they want to fill up their property. So we're there to make sure that they know we're there to help fill that into all things I mentioned before making sure that we can bring in that demand. I'll leave David, anything you want to disclose to them that is any different, I'm not sure if there's anything further to that. David Goulden : No, no additional data points on the mix of 6.6 million. What I just clarify, Mario, is that the comment that Glenn made about gaining share gains with a larger professional manager that's really related to how we're doing in the U.S. Now the specific U.S., like he point I'm not saying that's not the case worldwide. I'm just saying that if you remember, Australia's really get a lot of additional properties in the U.S with the target, more of the pressure managers where there's a lot of high quality supply available through those managers again, single property owner own properties that are available via managers. So the content we were making was there relative to what we're doing in the U.S. Mario Lu : That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : And your next question will come from Naved Khan from Truist Securities. Your line is open. Naved Khan : Yes. Thanks a lot. A couple of questions. I think -- David, I think I heard you say marketing efficiency was higher versus 2019, and I did some rough math off of the bookings number. It does look -- it was higher in the last quarters. Can you just maybe talk about what are the drivers of efficiency in marketing? And then maybe one for Glenn. Maybe -- can you just talk about some reports of maybe flash deals being tested on the site maybe later this year? And what kind of interest you might be seeing from hotels in terms of participation? Glenn Fogel : So, David, do you want to take that first one? David Goulden : Yes, let me talk a little bit about marketing, what was going on. I think I understood the question. But basically what you see was in Q2 our marketing expense as a decline of our gross bookings, which is the way to look at it. Because if you look at it versus revenue, you\u2019ve got all the different books to say timing things in there. So look at some potential of our gross bookings. That ratio improved in the second quarter. So definitely, our marketing expenses declined more than our gross bookings did. Two factors, we do see higher ROIs across many of our paid channels that we store a couple years ago, but we also saw a nice increase in mixed awards direct as well. So the more you have direct mix analysis, then the less we're paying for marketing to attract those new customers. So I'd say, nothing particularly unique to fall out and that\u2019s the marketing environment that\u2019s still, I would say, isn't fully stable yet clearly. We are still going through a stage of recovery in the industry. So not all factors are directly comparable with where we were with 2019. But we were pleased to see that the ROI improved. Now bear in mind what I said about the Q3 implies that the opposite is likely to happen in Q3. Obviously, we're only a month into Q3. But we asked if we got a marketing spend in Q3 it is, historically the core, where we spend the most is the peak season. We want to recap the demand, the customers that are out there will also be increasing our spend -- brand spend in Q3 relative to Q2. So that's one of the contributors to essentially what will be some deleveraging marketing spend relative to gross bookings in Q3. So we'll see how the quarter develops, because that's what we expect to happen in the third quarter. But in the first two quarters, we did see that there is an ROI, helping us create some leverage on the marketing line. Glenn Fogel : And regarding your question about flash deals, if you read the same article that I did, I think there was something in there about there was no official response from Booking. So let me say that I have nothing to say specifically about this, but let me reemphasize that we are putting a lot of effort into working cooperatively with our supply partners to get the incremental demand through all different ways. Being a better merchandiser and providing more value to both sides of the marketplace, is where we're going. Naved Khan : Understood. Thank you, both. Operator : And your next question will come from Deepak Mathivanan from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Deepak Mathivanan : Great. Thanks, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask a little bit about your experimentation with a more diversified marketing strategy. Historically, performance marketing has been the one that worked the best for the space. How should we think about your approach with some of the other channels? Are there specific kind of objectives that you look for kind of gravel comes back to leverage into those channels. And then the second question, kind of related to that, but how should we think about your market share during this time? I know it's sort of still early and there's not a lot of data points yet, but any color that you can provide on how your market share is trending in some of the markets where travel is recovering, that'd be great. Thank you. Glenn Fogel : So regarding diversifying our marketing efforts, you are absolutely correctly, we built this company on doing a great, great job with performance marketing channels. So we know that. But what a lot of people don't know is that Priceline.com was very, very successful in its early days in brand marketing. And of course, we Booking.com, we brought the U.S., we have lots of brand marketing. The key thing in any type of marketing program is making sure that you're getting the ROI that you want to get. And we are going to continue to do that. I mentioned in my prepared remarks about how we are looking at new channels, like social channels, you've seen, I hope, some of the things that we've been putting out, we're going to continue to experiment and do all different ways to make sure we are reaching out for every pocket of demand. But we always do it with the knowledge that it's going to be cost effective. It's going to produce in the long run, because it takes longer for brand to actually produce results. So we recognize that, but in the long run, it's got to produce the results that we want. And we're going to keep on doing that. And I believe -- I really believe that in the long run, we will have many different ways that we're going to bring in marketing. One of the key things though, before you start spending a huge amount on a brand marketing campaign is making sure that you have the product the way you want it. And that's one of the things that we are keen to do and perhaps the alternative accommodations area is really working to make sure in the U.S., for example, that we've got that product the way we wanted. In regards to market shares, we're very pleased with how we're doing right now. I haven't seen results from some of our competitors. And I'm not really going to go down country by country in terms of what our shares are. But I am pleased with the results that we're achieving. I will let David say, if he wants to give any specificity. David Goulden : Glenn, I think you said well. We are pleased, we'll have to wait and see when the dust settles. I think market shares, better measure over the course of a year than a quarter or two quarters we're only two quarters into the year. But we're pleased with things with how things are going. Our growth rates relative to what we see happening out there. But we'll count that -- we will count that and talk about if we can more at the end of the year when we got some more concrete data on how the market actually developed. Deepak Mathivanan : Okay, thank you so much. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Justin Post from Bank of America. Your line is open. Justin Post : Great. A couple questions, I guess first, David, can you revisit your comment about July traveler bookings being better than summer of '19? And what that means for revenues in the third quarter? Any thoughts on that? And maybe, Glenn, you -- I think you said June was back to 13% from 2019. How does that make you feel about the confidence of a full travel recovery? And then when we do recover, maybe any high level thoughts on, could your market share be higher? Could your margins be higher than '19? Any new thoughts you have on either of those items would be really helpful? Thanks a lot. Glenn Fogel : All right [indiscernible]. David Goulden : Yes, well, I'll start with just to kind of make sure that what we're saying. So to recalibrate or restate what we said, we have more gross bookings for the summer, for the remaining summer, then at the same time, in 2019, same time, I enjoyed 2019. Now we have that same time for Europe and North America. So assuming that cancellation rate stays the same, then that would potentially result in more revenue in those markets for the summer months for the remaining summer month. I did notice -- I did also point out that we will have -- that we have a high percentage of cancelable bookings out there or refundable bookings out there that we had at the same time in 2019 as well. So there's obviously some risks that more of those bookings cancelled than they were done in the same period of time. So it means basically that potential revenue base for the summer is higher now in those two markets than it was in 2019. Now, obviously, to offset that is what's happening in Europe -- sorry in Asia and what's happening in rest of world. We don't have a situation, the revenue or the bookings on the books, which will be potential revenue in those markets are substantially below where they were at the same time at the end of July in 2019. Glenn Fogel : Just I would say that nobody knows when this full recovery is going to happen. And I think everybody is able to throw a dart, but it's really throwing darts. Given all the variations that are happening, these new variants come out, we've seen the impact, there. The thing that I continue to say is how much we are very confident, I think everybody is that this will end at some point and we will come out of it strongly. Now, we've talked about this a bit in the past about how we want to come out of this, we want to have a bigger business, making more EBITDA, growing faster. But we've also talked a bit about margins, where we have a committee and we want to be a leader in the industry -- the leader in the industry. In terms of our margin, or EBITDA margin, but we recognize that a lot of things that we're doing nowadays can actually end up with a lower margin, obviously, air for example. I mean, it's wonderful when we say 120% increase over 2019 in air tickets, that\u2019s wonderful. But we all know, those margins are nowhere near what they are in the accommodation business, and I can go on at different examples. The key thing for us and for our shareholders, I believe, is coming back with more EBITDA doubts and contain to grow that fit our business, so there's more of that. That's the way we're looking at it. Justin Post : Great, thank you. Operator : And your next question will come from Doug Anmuth from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Dae Lee : Hi, this is Dae Lee on for Doug. Thanks for taking the questions. One for Glenn. In your prepared remark you talked about better monetize the transaction flow and that's one of the drivers that led to the creation of this fintech. So just curious what\u2019s the opportunity that you're seeing there? Is this something that will affect user experience as well or more focused on the back end? And then second one for David, a follow-up question, on the sales and marketing ROI. You guys had called out higher ROIs last quarter and again this quarter. So I was curious if this is a result of something that you're doing differently, or is this just more on the outcome due to the competitive dynamic on the performance advertising channels? Glenn Fogel : So in terms of the fintech unit, there are many opportunities for us with a flow in 2019 a $100 billion worth of transaction flowing through there. We know that there are ways that we can save money for the consumers and the suppliers on both sides. And we can make good money on it too in the long run. So it's coming up with things like providing better FX tool. It's things for example, making sure that if somebody wants to pay an alternative payment method that we're able to provide that. It means making sure that we can do a better job with different types of regulations in terms of making sure that any type of transaction is not fraudulent. It's all sorts of things as a player in --- at scale, we can do things that many, many, many other partners with our partners could not do. And it's also providing conveniences to our customers who want it. But our suppliers can't do it on their own. And there are lots of different things that we can do. Even things as simple as our fintech unit setting something up, like our E-wallet, electronic wallet, that enables us to easily provide value to that customer, which can come from a supplier or it can be something that we're promoting ourselves, all different things. So what I see is not only the basics that we need to make our Connecting Trip work, which of course you have to have that if you want to create a Connected Trip with a single price point that one person pays one amount, but it's all the other types of things that we can provide that others really can't do on their own right now. David Goulden : Yes, and then on the second quarter ROIs, our playbook really has not changed. And our strategy and performance marketing channels have not changed. We continue to seek high quality traffic at the right price. And to us, high quality means high converting traffic, lower probability cancellation, which was recalculate a high probability of those coming back to us on a daily basis. And those are things that kind of go into our bidding strategy plus all the damage that occurred in each of those marketplaces. So we expect there'll be ROI volatility throughout the recovery. Of course, we also look at what the developer demand is and when there are time to get leading versus leading more. We are certainly looking at this as an opportunity to win customers onto our platform and get new customers and we mentioned a very healthy mix of new customers on -- in the business quite similar to nature as it was in feature '19. So we're pleased with how things are going. We like the way that we're bringing back existing customers. We like the way we're winning new customers. We are pleased to see the existing customers come back generally much more directly than the new customers, which you expect as part of the playbook. So I'd say many factors go into those ROI calculations, including cost per click conversion rates, cancellation rates, and we're still in a period of relatively high volatility in each of those compared to where we were in 2019. Dae Lee : Got it. Thank you both. Operator : And your next question will come from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Alaxandar Wang : Hi, this is Alex Wong on for Brian. Thanks for taking the question. Two questions. One, I think you mentioned that your monthly traffic on Booking.com is backed about 90% of pre-pandemic, which is encouraging, particularly some of the headwinds, you're calling out in Asia. Just curious if we're able to segment out any differences in behavior on that new versus existing cohort and going forward any strategies to sort of grow those bases separately? Second question around air, like sounds like there's a lot of momentum there. Just curious on your views on some of the remaining execution hurdles you see for that initiative, and any plans to sort of grow consumer awareness for the new air product. Glenn Fogel : So I'll take the air first and we'll see what David wants to say or not say about breakup of our customer base. So, air, obviously, Priceline has been doing it forever, since the company started, but in the U.S only. And Booking.com only got going this very, very recently and I mentioned 24 countries nice, but that's a lot of countries that we haven't touched yet that has to be done. And there's so many things that need to be done to really prove the air part of it Booking.com, I'm not going to list them all. But I see a lot of ways we can make that even better than it is. And that's a little bit while we haven't done any real large marketing effort on the air side yet. We got to have to talk a little bit before we start really marketing. So make sure you got the product the way you want it. So it's so encouraging that we're doing well with it right now, even though I see a lot of things that still need to be done to improve that product. It's something that we're really pleased with is seeing the attachment rate again, and something that we obviously the reason they want to do this is not just to sell a flight ticket is to actually get some of those higher margin those accommodations and build out that Connected Trip. So it's nice to see at a very early stage. And I urge you to say, listen, Kevin, I think very early stage, we're seeing good results. So I do see a lot of opportunity here in the future. But we won't be bringing out any sort of marketing on it until I feel that we have the product where we want it to be. And David, I don\u2019t know if you want to talk about the other one. David Goulden : Yes, there's a lot more to say. I think we wanted to help, we will give you some data points to understand how our active customers by people are actually actively booking on the site have recovered. And the mix -- a healthy mix of new customers only slightly below what we saw in Q2 '19. I think those are good signs. So I don't want to get into the segmentation with our customers. Obviously, there are some customers who book very often, some customers took book wise much and we love them all. But we will make sure we can treat them differently. And I say that's part of the reason why we have a Genius program. Of course, the more often you work with us or book for us on Booking.com I move up the Genius ladder and you get more benefits from the Genius program, which is I think a nice way of driving loyalty. So other than the data points we've given out before, which we thought would just be helpful, stating the grounds people understand what's going on within the business. I don't want to get into a further details. Alaxandar Wang : Got it. Thank you. Operator : And your next question will come from Mark Mahaney from Evercore. Your line is open. Mark Mahaney : Hey, thanks. I guess, I'll just follow-up on the -- keep sticking with the air and I guess learnings to date and talk about this is -- is this a new customer acquisition tool? Is this a cross-sell product? You notice greater engagement with the people in those 24 markets were you brought to that with booking. This has increased the overall spend, frequency of purchase. Well, what have you seen so far, and maybe it's all too early. So I guess if you're going to respond that way, then I'll ask when do you think you'll have a decent read and to what impact if any permanent -- if it's had a permanent impact on your Booking com customer base? Thanks. Glenn Fogel : Hi, Mark. So [indiscernible] just on what you said like too early, but I will add a little bit more -- I will add a little more to that. In a sense, I'm very pleased because we haven't been out really marking this yet. new customers are coming to the site, and then we're seeing them get a attractive cross-sell that I really like seeing that as a sign that this is the right direction that we're going in now. I had a good sense that was going to happen anyway, because we've been seeing that happen in Priceline for two decades where that's been happening. So I had good confidence that this would happen. But it's something that I believe we want to have a lot more data before we start coming back, U.S start showing you, here's what attachment rates are heroes, it compares to price lines, here's what we see versus industry and how many new people are coming from the air funnel versus the others, I would just leave everyone with the sense that we're very pleased. This is bringing us new customers, new customers who are buying not just flight tickets, but some of them are buying hotels, too. This is proving out a little bit of our long-term vision on this Connected Trip. Now, do I expect that to happen with something like activities? No, I'm not really think a lot of people are going to come for an activity first, then they're going to buy a flight or then they're going to buy a hotel. It's -- that's going to be a lot more the other way and helping produce the loyalty and the repeat business that we talked about. And then goes into all the things I was talking about in terms of using a wallet so we can get credits. Now, different suppliers, be able to promote different offerings in different ways to different customers, all that spins together, increasing that flywheel. And that's what we're trying to achieve, and it's just so great to see it start happening right now, even though it's very early. Mark Mahaney : Okay, thanks, Glenn. Operator : And your next question will come from Vince Ciepiel from Cleveland Research. Your line is open. Vince Ciepiel : Great. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to talk a little bit about your perspective on leisure versus corporate. I believe you historically see about 80% of the business in leisure. So first there, some markets are running 15%, 20% ahead of '19 levels. And I'm curious your perspective on the long-term trend line within leisure and how COVID has changed that maybe people's ability to work remote. You mentioned more leisure business shifting online with that McKinsey study. But just curious how you think about leisure over the long run. And then the second part is on the corporate side, any early indications of recovery there and how you think that evolved through the second half of this year? Glenn Fogel : Yes, let me give a generalities about what I think about leader versus business and the purpose general what I think is going to be happening in the future. And David, go back and talk about what we've disclosed in the past about the mix. So I think you're right, in the sense that we are much more leisure oriented, and much of our business travel is small business people, these are people who are doing their own travel, this is not part of the big travel management company operation. So it's a little bit differently when we have business travelers and they act somewhat similar to leisure sometimes. The fact is, we've all seen is that leisure is out of the gate much faster than any business travel, which makes perfect sense. Because on the one hand, you have business people who say there's a risk factor when you put people in travel, etcetera. There's also the issue of costs. Why have people travel? You don't have to,. That second part, I think is very key for the future of the business. I believe that there's still going to be resistance by CFOs, now the people who are cost conscious in their businesses about do we really have to have all the travel we did in the past? Maybe not. Because with these new technologies, what we seem to be pretty effective without having to send somebody from New York to London and $15,000 for a one day meeting. I think that's going to somewhat change how the business of travel is done. There'll be fewer people up front in the plane, and spending a lot of money in those very high cost five star hotels, etcetera, which will change things a little bit. For us, we're leisure so it's not going to impact us negatively so much. In fact, they help us because there's more availability that needs to get filled up. The other thing you mentioned, though, was the NCR plays out though, with more people being able to work-from-home and deciding [indiscernible], I think Friday, I'm going to work from somewhere else and have a Friday, Saturday, Sunday or Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, mini holiday somewhere working Thursday, Friday, but at different location. How much is that going to actually build more travel? Uncertain at this time since everybody is still shifting around? What the way to work in the future? How many days are we in offices? How many days are we not in office? Nobody knows the answer to that yet. It's going to take a long time to play out. But I do hope that we'll hopefully build out more travel, we like more travel. So there's a lot of uncertainty about this and nobody really knows And even as much as I've heard the encouraging signs from some of the suppliers to some of the airlines, I saw a Deloitte report came out a couple of days ago, maybe yesterday in which the expectation of corporate travel was not as optimistic in the near-term. So I think we'd have to say, we don't know, we'll find out as it rolls out. And David, I don\u2019t know if you want to give anything more than that in terms of the numbers for us in business trial, because I heard a now where he quoted, I'm not sure those are right or not. David Goulden : No the number. First of all we have given recently, but we're over 88% leisure. And as we said, our business, first of all, it's a self declared metric when you make a booking, so it's hard to be precise about it. But the type of business travel we do have is much more unknown business travelers, Glenn explained. So we're heavily biased towards that larger segments. Vince Ciepiel : Thank you. Operator : And our last question will come from Jed Kelly from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Jed Kelly : Great, great. Thanks for taking my question. Two, if I may. Just as you sort of you mentioned earlier in your prepared remarks that you're gaining share with professional property managers. Can you sort of talk about like your supply strategy, heading into this winter in the U.S., trying to increase that single unit inventory? And then, can you give us an update just on how APAC is trending, particularly with the Gouda. Thank you. Glenn Fogel : So I will let David talk what you say about Asia in general. And regarding this year, I just want to be a little careful. We said we were pleased with that we are doing better, we're gaining. We're gaining share with the professional managers. And I like what we're seeing there. It's going to be a long haul in terms of building out the U.S inventory for all types of alternative accommodations, whether it be professionally managed, getting as many as you want there or single property is going to be a while to get to where we want to be in that. I understand that this is a goal that we're working on hard by having boots on the ground, talking to managers, sending out the right information, getting people to understand why we have a great proposition for them. And I'm confident we're going to do that. When you look at what we've achieved in Europe, you look at the share of our alternative accommodations in Europe, you say, boy, that's a goal to have in the U.S., too. We should be pushing for that. There's no reason we should. Customers are similar. The proposition is similar. There's nothing that we shouldn't be -- the reason we shouldn't be able to achieve that over time. But it's going to take time. David, I don\u2019t know if you want to talk about Asia a little bit there? David Goulden : Yes, so Asia, APAC, I mentioned that the room night growth was worse in Q2 than it was in Q1. So that really deteriorated to counteract some of the benefits and frankly, saw in the Europe and North America, of course, both puffy and Agoda cyber businesses in APAC, although clearly that's the majority of Agoda's. So the whole region is very depressed as you know. Vaccination rates are lagging in most parts of Asia. Also, response to COVID outbreaks tend to be more aggressive. And restrictions are put in place more quickly, based upon outbreaks in the Asia region across almost all countries. So travel level is very low, particularly in international travel levels exceptionally low, and still a long way to go. No recovery in Q2, in fact, worse in Q2, this Q1. Jed Kelly : Thank you. Operator : And that concludes our Q&A. I will turn the call over back to Glenn Fogel for closing remarks. Glenn Fogel : Thank you. So in closing, I want to reiterate our strong belief that our industry's full recovery will be hastened by everyone who can get a vaccine going out and getting it. We urge all people who are approved for a medically able to be vaccinated, to do their part to make our society safer and go out and get a vaccine. And as always, I want to thank our partners, our customers, our dedicated employees and our shareholders, we appreciate your support as we continue to build on the long-term vision for our company. Thank you and please be safe. Good night. Operator : And that concludes our conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

And now I'd like to introduce Booking Holdings speakers for this afternoon, Glenn Fogel and David Goulden. And I will turn the call over to Glenn Fogel your CEO. Please go ahead, sir. Glenn Fogel : Thank you and welcome to Booking Holdings ' Third Quarter Conference Call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. I am pleased to be reporting strong results today for our peak travel season. Compared with 2019, Q3 room nights were down 18% which was an improvement from the 22% decline we previously reported for the month of July, and the 26% decline in Q2. The improvement since July was primarily driven by stronger room night trends in Europe. In the United States, room night growth in Q3 was strong, but lower than Q2.  Asia room night declines in Q3, were about an online with Q2 and remain down significantly versus 2019. International travel, which is important to our business, drove the overall sequential improvement in room night trends from Q2 to Q3. Nevertheless, our international room nights remain significantly depressed versus 2019. Q3 consolidated revenue of $4.7 billion, was more than double the amount of revenue in Q2.  The third quarter was also our most profitable quarter since Q3, 2019, with $2.1 billion of adjusted EBITDA and a 45% adjusted EBITDA margin. Moving into the fourth quarter, we have seen a further improvement in our room night trends in October, including early signs of a pickup in room night trends in Asia. Now, well, recently rising COVID case counts in many countries, including several important European countries, adds to the uncertainty around how November and December trends will progress.  David will provide additional details on our third quarter results in what we are seeing so far in the fourth quarter, in his remarks. The improvement in trends we saw in the third quarter. And so far in the fourth quarter following the negative impact for the Delta variant in July and August, once again, demonstrates the resilience of leisure travelers, who are looking to travel, when it is safe to do so, and restrictions are lifted. We are confident that we are on the path to the eventual strong recovery in travel demand globally. As the global recovery continues, we are making progress, strengthening our core accommodation businesses support its long-term growth. As I said before, the strength of our core business comes from driving benefits to our traveler customers and our supply partners alike. For our customers, we are aiming to create a superior booking experience and build stronger relationships, which we believe is accomplished by addressing our customers critical needs of value, choice, and ease-of-use.  We continue to see Booking.com's pre-pandemic customers coming back and booking with us, while we're also attracting new customers. Importantly, we see our top customers from before the pandemic were turning to us at a meaningfully higher frequency than other customers. Providing attractive prices on accommodations is a key component of offerings value for our customers.  We work closely with our supply partners to increase participation in our targeted rate programs to ensure that compelling prices are available to our customers. Our Genius loyalty program at booking.com is a great example of a program where hundreds of thousands of our property partners are participating to offer lower rates and other benefits such as complementary practice, room upgrades, and discounted airport taxi to our large customer base.  In addition to offering lower rates on accommodations, we have recently extended lower rates on rental cars to our Genius customers. This is just 1 example of the way we continue to innovate and add value for our Genius members. With about 2/3 of our room nights booked on mobile devices, and the majority of those booked through the app, it's critical that we provide our customers with a positive booking experience on our app.  The app is an important platform as it allows us more opportunities to engage directly with travelers and ultimately, we see it as the center of our Connected Trip experience. In the third quarter, booking.com was once again the number one downloaded OTT app globally, according to a third-party research firm. Also, in the third quarter, we surpassed 100 million monthly active app users for the first time. The recent growth of Booking.com's app is encouraging, and we are working hard to continue to build on this success. In the third quarter, we saw a higher mix of our customers booking directly with us than in the third quarter of 2019.  A direct mix improved even as we leaned into performance marketing channels during our peak travel season. While we will continue to invest in performance marketing, we will also look to expand the diversity of our marketing and customer acquisition channels, as we aim to drive incremental traffic to our platform and increase consumer awareness of our brands. For example, with our ambition to acquire more customers in the medium intense space, we've made progress in strengthening our foundations for digital marketing, including social channels.  Though us spend so far has been small. However, we're increasingly confident in the potential for these channels. And as we see positive results, we expect to raise our level of participation there. Remaining active in investing effectively across marketing channels, is made even more important by the opportunity to acquire focus for new to online booking channels. Travel, like many industries during pandemic, has seen a meaningful shift from offline to online according to third-party data.  And this has increased our addressable market. For our support partners, we are focused on bringing incremental demand to their properties from a broad audience of potential customers on our platform. In a certainty of 600 small and medium hoteliers in Europe conducted earlier this year, 85% percent of respondents agreed that online platforms are a cost-efficient way to increase the reach to their hotel and source more diverse, yes. We agree with this statement and believe it applies more broadly.  Whether we are working with a small and medium hotel in Europe, or an alternative accommodation, or a large global hotel chain, we strive to be a valuable partner to all accommodation types on our platform. With our chain hotel partners, we are continuing to see increased engagement relative to 2019 levels, which shows up in higher levels of participation in our programs that enable them to differentiate and promote themselves on our platform. For our alternative accommodations, the global mix of room nights in Q3 of about 30% was up slightly from Q3, 2019.  This increase in [Indiscernible] recombination share of our business in the quarter was less than it was in Q2 as we saw a greater sequential improvement in demand for hotel room nights in Europe from Q2 to Q3. Our property counts of about 2.4 million and reported listings of over 28 million on booking.com remains stable relative to the prior quarter. Let me talk more about some of our key strategic priorities. Payments, and the Connected Trip, both of which we believe will further enhance the strength of our core accommodations business, and support its continued growth. Turning to payments of Booking.com. Last quarter, we spoke about the organization of all of our payments, initiatives and efforts within a new Fintech unit at booking.com The recently established Fintech nearly enables booking.com to have a dedicated focus on enhancing payments in our core business to both customers and partners, as well as monetizing our overall transaction flows, be a new payments, related products, and services. Adoption of our payment solutions by our supply partners in both the U.S. and Europe continues to grow. Adoption in the U.S. has seen significant increases recently, driven by the additions of some major hotel chains in the second and third quarters, which we will look to build on in the fourth quarter.  In Europe, more customers are choosing to pay using booking.com 's payment platform when finalizing their booking as an attractive and localized options are provided. This will result in nearly a third of booking.com 's total gross bookings in Q3 being processed through our payment platform, which is up from about 22% for the full-year 2020. The Fintech unit is also driving continued payments innovation to ensure that growth is sustained into the future.  This includes offering a low-cost payout choice to our suppliers, as well as partnering with third-parties to provide payment solutions to our buckets, such as, buy now pay later. We believe these efforts help position booking.com as near transit and trusted payment intermediary for all parties on our platform. On our Connected Trip vision, we've been focused this year on enabling travelers to book the major elements of their attributing one place on Booking.com.  We continue to work on scaling up our robust flight platform on booking.com which will give us the ability to engage with flight bookers early in their travel generally, and allow us an opportunity to across LOR accommodation and other services to these bookers. Booking.com's for the product is now live in 27 countries. Total Company air tickets in the third quarter was up 131% versus Q3 2019, primarily driven by strength in Priceline's, but also helped by Booking.com slight offering, which continues to meaningfully exceed our expectations. Wallet remains early days for Booking slight product.  We're seeing that over 25% of Booking's flight bookers, are entirely new customers. With these new customers, we are seeing an encouraging attach rate of accommodation bookings. However, there is more work to be done to further optimize the cross-sell opportunity. The early signals helped demonstrate though, that our flight offering can drive incremental new customers to the platform to which we can cross-sell our combination product. We are beginning to test initiatives targeting these new flight customers, including, for example, encouraging account creation to activate Genius status, and in some cases, offering additional incentives for them to book accommodations. We remain focused on continuing to test and innovate in order to build on the early successes, we're seeing with flight at Booking.com. We're also continuing to run test using offerings from our verticals like rental cars and taxis.  Before closing, I do want to note that as world leaders assemble this week in Glasgow for the cop26 Summit discussing the urgency of tackling the global climate crisis. I cannot overstate the importance for our industry to come together to work for the goal of carbon neutrality by 2050. De - carbonization is a major challenge for the entire industry. Excelling this challenge requires the commitment of all stakeholders. I am proud to say that our Company, Booking Holdings, is committed to addressing this challenge.  We recently released a report that we commissioned with EY-Parthenon that looks into what will it take to get the accommodations industry specifically to a carbon-neutral future. While a big task, data shows it is achievable. At booking.com, we are working on making it easier for travelers to find and choose sustainable accommodation options with booking their travel. In addition, we're working with our accommodation supply partners by sharing guidance, insights, and best practices to enhance sustainability initiatives at the property level.  Of course, there is much more that must be done, but we believe that we are taking important steps to contribute to a more sustainable future for our industry. And finally, we plan on publishing a Booking Holdings, climate transition plan in early 2022, which we'll speak more about at that time. In conclusion, we executed well and produced strong results in our peak travel season, which is a credit to the hard work and support provided by the many teams across our Company. I'm encouraged by the signs of recovery we are seeing in many parts of the world.  And I'm confident that we are on the path to an eventual strong recovery in travel demand globally. We continue with our important work to strengthen our Company's position and execute against our strategic priorities. As I said before, we were thinking about our business beyond just getting back to 2019 levels of demand, and we are focused on building a larger and faster growing business that generates more earnings after the full recovery, and for the long run. And now turn the call over to our CFO, A - David Goulden, David [Indiscernible] David is dialing back in, I think. David Goulden : Yeah, I'm calling back in Glenn. Sorry, have you just finished? Glenn Fogel : Yes. I just finished. David Goulden : All right. Perfect timing, thank you. I was cut off and I'm back in again. Thank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I will review our results for the third quarter, provide some color on the trends we've seen so far in the fourth quarter. To avoid comparisons to the pandemic impacted periods in 2020, all growth rates are relative to comparable periods in 2019, unless otherwise indicated. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results, can be found in our earnings release. Now onto our results for the third quarter.  On our last earnings call, we discussed the improvement in trends that that we saw throughout the second quarter driven by the U.S. and Europe, followed by loss pullback in July. After our earnings call, we saw our overall trends improve in August and continue to get better in September, which resulted in Q3 reported remise declining 18% versus Q3 2019, which was ahead of the 26% decline in Q2 and the 22% decline in July.  September was the strongest month in the third quarter, we remise declining for 14%, about the same level as June. The improvements in the Q3 room night decline versus Q2 was driven primarily by Europe, which benefited from strong cross-border travel with a duration. In Q3, room night in Europe, were down mid-single-digits versus 2019 with room night trends improving in August versus July, September was similar to August.  You will recall the room night growth pulled back from June to July in Europe due to concerns over the Delta variance. Rest-of-world also improved from Q2 to Q3. In the U.S we --, Q2 to Q3. However, the U.S. still have strong growth in the quarter and remained our strongest performing major country in Q3. Within the U.S. we saw a meaningful slowdown in August from the very strong growth we experienced in July, followed by a recovery to strong growth in September. The slowdown in the U.S. in August with due to concerns about the Delta variance.  Asia room night declined in Q3, or about in line with Q2. Room nights in Asia was still down significantly from 2019 levels. Mobile bookings primarily through our apps, represented about 2/3 of our total room nights are. Our apps continue to represent an increasing percentage of our mobile bookings. In Q3, as Glenn mentioned, we achieved an important milestone in use of our app at Booking.com, surpassing 100 million monthly active users.  We are also pleased to see the number of unique customers booking via our app in the quarter, grow strongly compared with Q3 2019. Our direct channel as a percentage of our room nights, year-on-year, and relative to Q3 2019, increased. While international room nights remain down versus 2019, we saw no sequential improvements in our international trends, with international mix of our room nights increasing to about 33% in Q3 from about 25% in Q2, and about 15% in Q1. Most of this improvement in international room nights came from bookings for travel within Europe. We continued to see double-digit growth in domestic room nights in Q3, but at a slightly lower level than in Q2. The pickup in international travel in the quarter was a driver of the improvement in overall room night trends from Q2 to Q3. However, international room nights were down almost 50% compared with Q3 2019 levels. Our Q3 cancellation rate was slightly above Q3 2019 levels. However, cancellation rates improved in the quarter and September was slightly better than 2019 for the month. Percentage of our 2,000 -- of our Q3 2021 bookings, made with flexible cancellation policies, remains significantly higher than in Q3, 2019.  The booking window of Booking.com remains shorter than it was in the third quarter of 2019 and contracted more they did in Q2, as we saw a high mix of near-term bookings during our peak summer season. All regions had a shorter booking window in Q3 than in Q3, 2019. alternative accommodations that the global mix of room nights in Q3 of about 30% was up slightly from Q3, 2019. The increase mix alternative accommodations in the quarter was less than it was in Q2, as we saw, a great sequential improvement in demand for hotel room nights in Europe from Q2 to Q3. I will turn into Cornish room nights in Europe grew slightly in August and September versus 2019 down for the quarter were about in line with Q3 2019. We believe we benefited from the strength of our portfolio Europe where we could respond to solid demand for alternative accommodations and an improving demand for hotels. Gross bookings declined 6% in Q3, which is less than the decline in room nights due to the increase in average day rates for accommodations of about 10% versus 2019 on a constant-currency basis.  And also due to a couple of points of benefit from changes in FX rates and strong performance in our flight business. Our accommodations constant currency ADR benefited by just over 5% points for an increased mix of business in North America, which is a high ADR region, and a decrease of mix in Asia, which is a low ADR region. Excluding regional mix effects, constant currency ADRs were up just about 4%, driven mainly by rate increases in Europe and North America across many destination-types with notable strength in beach-oriented leisure destinations.  [Indiscernible] figures booked in the third quarter were up 131% versus 2019, driven by very strong growth of Priceline. [Indiscernible] flight bookings at Booking.com We're encouraged to see another quarter of triple-digit growth from a [Indiscernible], which are key components of our multi-product Connected Trip strategy. [Indiscernible] revenue for third quarter was 4.7 billion, which was 7% below Q3, 2019, and was more than double the amount of revenue in Q2, 2021, a far greater sequential improvement in 2019. Our Q3 revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was about in line with Q3 2019, which was in line with our expectations. We experienced even more revenue seasonality in Q3 2021 than normal due to the concentration stays in Q3 from bookings made in the quarter and also for bookings [Indiscernible] when customers could book accommodations, but could not stay due to restrictions and other COVID related concerns. The strong top-line performance for performance resulted in adjusted EBITDA of $2.1 billion in the third quarter, which is 15% below Q3, 2019. Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense item, decreased 3% versus Q3, 2019.  Marketing expense declined by few points less than gross bookings, due to slightly up low ROI in paid channels of the invested into capturing demand during the peak travel season. Sales to our expenses in Q3 were significantly higher than they were in Q2 on a dollar basis, due to higher volume of merchant gross bookings, which increased as a percentage of our total gross bookings in the third quarter. Our Booking.com announced a gross bookings process to our payment. Payment platform in Q3 was over $6 billion, which was almost 1/3 of Booking.com's business, up from about a quarter in Q2.  Our more fixed expense categories in Q3, in aggregate, came in 3% lower than Q2, after $136 million of personnel expense in the second quarter related to our decision to repay the government aid was mostly offset by an increase from Q2 to Q3 in our bonus accruals and digital service tax expense, both of which are crude proportional to revenue. Our non-GAAP EPS was $37.70, down 17% versus Q3 2019. non-GAAP net income of $1.6 billion reflects a non-GAAP tax rate of 21%, which is higher than the 19% in Q3 2019 due to a high proportion of non-tax-deductible expenses in relation to lower pre -tax income versus 2019. On a GAAP basis, we had operating income of $2 billion in Q3. We recorded GAAP net income of $769 million in the quarter, which includes a $1 billion pre -tax realized loss on our equity investments primarily relates to our [Indiscernible], as well as income tax expense of a $199 million. Now onto our cash and liquidity position, our Q3 ending cash investments balance of $15.4 billion was down versus our Q2 ending balance of $16.1 billion at the $1.5 billion of free cash flow was more than offset by the repayments for $1 billion convertible note matured in Q3 and the $1 billion unrealized loss on our equity investments.  The return of capital to shareholders, has and will be an important component of our value creation strategy. Throughout the COVID pandemic, we said that we will start returning capital to shareholders when we saw that our 3 largest regions, we're no longer a meaningful risk of [Indiscernible] reversal due to COVID, and also become more predictable. Assuming that travel recovery continues, we plan to restart returning capital in early 2022 under our remaining authorization.  Assuming continued recovery, we'd expect to complete this organization within 3 years from restarting. Now onto our thoughts for the fourth quarter. Our total room nights declined 10% versus 2019, which is better than the 14% decline in September. The improvements in October were driven mainly by Asia. Although the region comes -- a lot of the region remains down from suitably visiting. 2019. The improvement in Asia was led by domestic travel with the many countries and was driven by an improving vaccination progress and governments easing restrictions on travel.  Room night growth in the U.S. improved little from September to October and remains strong in October. Rest of the world also improved little in October, and was back close to 2019 levels. We were declines in Europe were about the same in October as they were in September, but weaken towards the end of the month. This resulted in overall room night declines being higher in the last week of October than the average for the month.  The slowdown at the end of October in Europe was driven by a number of countries that have seen recent increases in COVID infections, including Germany, Russia, and Italy. Given the ongoing uncertainty around COVID, it's difficult to predict how room nights in November-December will compare with the 10% reduction we saw in October. Looking forward to November-December, the rising case counts across many important Western European countries and across much of Eastern Europe, as well as the start of the winter season in the Northern Hemisphere, which in 2020 contributed to an increase in COVID cases, creates unpredictability.  Also, pre -pandemic contribution of Asia to total room nights was highest in November and December, and Asia is still our least recovered region. On a more positive note, since the U.S. announced in late September the plans to ease travel restrictions in November for international travelers who are vaccinated, we've seen a significant improvement in room nights booked by Europeans to travel to the U.S. as well as the reverse. Also, we're pleased to see more gross bookings on the books for the Christmas, New Year periods, that we saw at this time in 2019 in the U.S. and Western European. Change to the Income statement, we expect Q4 gross bookings to decline by a few points, less the room nights, driven by higher reported ADRs and flight bookings versus 2019. We expect less of an increase in our ADRs in Q4 than Q3 due to less of benefit from regional mix of the Asia region continues to recover, but also due to low occupancy rates after the peak travel season. We expect Q4 revenue to decline more than gross bookings due to a couple of factors. The first, is due to short booking window in Q3. A low percentage of Q3 bookings [Indiscernible] normal will stay in Q4. The second, is due to our expectation that the booking window will contract less in Q4 than it did in Q3, resulting in more bookings made in the quarter that are expected to check-in in future quarters. As a result, we expect our revenue as a percentage of gross bookings to be more than 1% below Q4, 2019. This also means we expect Q4 revenue to have a greater sequential decrease from Q3, that we saw in 2019, and we expect Q4 revenue to decline more than it did in Q3. We expect Q4 marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings increased slightly versus 2019, as we expect to invest in capturing demand and increasing awareness during the continued global recovery of travel demand. We expect Q4 sales or expenses to be lower than they were in Q3 due to lower merchant transaction volumes. However, we expect sales or expenses in the fourth quarter to be higher than in Q4 2019 due to higher merchant, volumes, and mix.  We expect our more fixed expense categories in Q4 in aggregate to be about in line with Q3 on a dollar basis. We expect Q4 EBITDA to be positive but driven largely by the higher, the normal seasonal decrease in revenue, we expect a much greater seasonal sequential decrease in EBITDA from Q3 to Q4, the normal. In conclusion, we're pleased with our recovery and the top-line in Q3, which led to strong finance results for the quarter. The financial strength we saw in Q3 was [Indiscernible] by the concentration of stage in the quarter, which will lead to some differences in the comparison of Q4 to Q3 relative to what we've seen in prior years.  October room night trends improve relative to September, driven by some encouraging trends at Asia. However, recently, the rising case counts across Europe increases in certainty about how trends will progress in November and December. In closing with confidence in our ability to capture demand as the global recovery continues and execute against our strategic projects. With that, I will now take your questions and Eli, I'll turn over to you to open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. Reminder to our audio attendees [Operator Instructions] Please stand-by while we can open the Q&A line. The first question is from the line of Justin Post of the Bank of America. Your line is now open. Justin Post : Great. Thank you for taking my questions. Great to see Europe recovering. With room nights down 10% versus '19, Glenn, maybe you could go through what needs to happen from here to get above '19. What areas still need to come back strong and not just Asia, but your thoughts on that. And then David, maybe you could talk about core business margins versus '19. Let's ignore payments and take your trip for now. But how are you thinking of the puts and takes on the core business versus '19. Thank you. Glenn Fogel : Hi, Justin. I don't think it's a very hard answer really what we need. What we need is, obviously, more of a recovery against this pandemic, because that's clearly what's driving the problem than in many industries, ours particularly. For us, we've talked about this a few times. We talked about, our business has done well with international, and international generally has been hard hit, albeit we are seeing some better things. But that the long haul is still a problem. Yes, we're seeing some numbers coming up in Asia, great. I love it. The fact that people are getting more vaccinated in Asia, that's great. The fact that vaccines are being distributed more broadly and getting around, that's great.  The fact that the pharmaceutical Companies are coming out with new ways to combat against this terrible virus with pills now, that can help people who have caught it, end up being hopefully healthier quicker, all good things. But what we need really, is for everyone who can get a vaccine, to please go out and get that vaccine. If you're medically able to and you're capable getting it, please get. That will help hasten the recovery for not only the travel industry, but the entire world. And that's what we hope will happen.  Obviously, we're doing everything we can, so we're prepared when that day comes, which it will, we can't say when, but we know will come. And we're preparing by doing all the things that Dave and I have been talking about. Preparing with our partners, and getting our marketing prepared, and doing all the steps that you know we've been doing to make sure that when travel comes back to above 2019, we're getting the share we want to be getting. And David, you want to [Indiscernible] -- you're going to answer the second question and answer mine too. David Goulden : Yeah. So now, I [Indiscernible] as great, we\u2019d actually be [Indiscernible] relatively quick on the puts and takes in the core combination business. Our underlying take rates have been solid, and obviously, the reported take rates are a function of timing, so that continues to go well for us. As we get to -- back to 2019 levels, there will be some inflation refresher on the personnel line. Everybody knows there's a war for tech talents out there, and we've had two for years whether the merit increases in other expenses in -- other increases in our cost base.  Of course, we did take expenses out, but there are variable expenses. So, they will come back with some efficiency over time, but there will be some pressure on the personnel line. But there are other things that are in the model that we can use to offset that pressure. We can get extra economy to scale as the business growth is beyond 2019 levels on both the fixed costs and on the variable cost side as well. There are opportunities in our direct mix, which of course is very important. And of course, a key element.  And this will grow happens to off over ROIs. And on the front marketing side where we saw some increase in the first half of the year, we saw some small compression in the second-half of this year, but those markets are very variable and very dynamic, and we're pleased with how we're doing in those markets. The last thing I want to leave you with on that topic is that within our core business, there's always a trade-off between growth market share, and profitability.  So, to the extent we see opportunities, we leaning in. We want to try and drive market share increases where we think that we can, that will pressure the business in the short-term as we lean into making those investments. And also, as the investment in marketing and other areas were basically be a leading indicated relative to revenue. So, there will -- we do believe that we're -- there are opportunities for us to gain share in accommodations through this -- the recovery and beyond. So that would be an additional factor in the mix and how we think about the long-term business margin in accommodations. Justin Post : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Kevin Kopelman of Cowen and Company. Your line is now open. Kevin Kopelman : Great. Thanks so much. Hoping to dig into ad spend trends a little bit. So, spend is going up a little. How much of that is Booking getting more aggressive as demand picks up versus a more competitive overall ad environment? And then compared to 2019 as distribution in brand and performance changed meaningfully. And lastly, can you give us an update on the kind of merchandising and promotion -- some of the merchandising promotion tests that you've done over the past couple of quarters? Thanks. Glenn Fogel : David, why don't you take the first 2, about the aired competitiveness, and I think some brand question? And I will talk a bit about some of the merchandising. David Goulden : Exactly. Thank you. Let us do that. So, Kevin, if you remember we -- on the last call, we said that we expect to see some reduction in our rise in Q3 versus 2019 and actually, our rise came out very much where we expected them to. Actually, our direct mix was slightly better than we expected in Q3. And that's why those less of a compression in the difference between gross bookings and marketing that we actually expected in Q3.  So that's positive. If it really -- something that we -- I say that was more what we did because we expect that to be the outcome. Of course, these markets are dynamic and as recovery continues, more, more play will come back into the marketplace. But basically, what happened in Q3 was very much in line with what we've told you a quarter ago would happen. The mix in between brands and the performance has not materially changed. If you recall, back in 2019, around 9% of all marketing spend was in imports, marketing. We are looking to move up -- to move the brand spend up a little bit over time. But of course, brand has been very much shut down in 2020. It's not going back on in 2021. So, we're not in a very different position than where we were in 2019, but we do see the opportunity to continue to trend a little bit more towards brands, some of which might go on at the mid-funnel (ph.) market opportunities that Glenn talked about. And then Glenn, I'll turn -- hand over to you to talk about the 3rd one. Glenn Fogel : Yeah. So, Kevin, obviously, merchandising is a very important reason why we built out, and are continuing to build-out, our payments platform in booking.com. Just making sure that we're able to compete and provide great value to our customers. And what's really important is not doing just out of our own pocket, but working with our partners, coming up with the right time to the right consumer, the right offer and helping them.  Our supply partners, also provide some of that, let's say, added value. For example, we may do flash sales. You may hope or you've seen some. Hope you've gotten some, hope you actually booked some of them. That's an example. One of the things, for example, when somebody is getting in accommodation and we are able to offer them either lower cost or even free sometimes, right from the airport to the hotel. In a [Indiscernible], different variations that we can do with the different verticals in coming up with the best combination, trying to do as much as we can with our suppliers\u2019 money, but sometimes using our own too to come up what really is an attractive offer. So, the consumer knows that when it come to our site, they're getting the best value, because value really is one of the key strategic objectives for us, always through providing that. Kevin Kopelman : Thanks Glenn. Thanks David. Really helpful. Operator : Your next question is from Deepak Mathivanan from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Deepak Mathivanan : Thanks. This is Zack on for Deepak. Thanks for taking the questions. First on pent-up demand. Obviously, it's been a nice tailwind for your business so far and general travel demand over the last few quarters. But just curious how you're thinking about whether there's another leg to run on the level of pent-up demand.  Asia is still depressed, as you noted, and across border restrictions are easing. So, as we look into next year, how are you guys thinking about the level of pent-up demand? And then second, when we dig a little further into the current trends, is there any reversal in terms of urban versus suburban or shorter versus longer-term [Indiscernible] you could call out? Thanks. Glenn Fogel : Zach, so just to make sure I understood your first part of your question. You're just asking a little bit about how we're going to get the demand that's coming in the future, do I have that correct? Deepak Mathivanan : Just -- I guess like understanding whether the level of pent-up demand that you guys\u2019 kind of expecting as we move into next year given there's still current travel restrictions, especially on the cross-border side -- Glenn Fogel : Right. Deepak Mathivanan : You just -- Glenn Fogel : Okay. Deepak Mathivanan : Remain depressed. Glenn Fogel : Yeah. Deepak Mathivanan : So, as we look into next year, should we see another -- Glenn Fogel : Right. Deepak Mathivanan : Kind of books. Glenn Fogel : I got it. Glenn Fogel : Okay. Why don't you about first half, but I'll let David say wherever we are -- what we feel, we can disclose regarding any of the trends regarding different parts of the business. So, we absolutely know there's huge pent-up demand by of course any time, any government, let's go restriction. We see immediate, immediate demand. So, for example, the announcement of the November 8th opening for people to come to the U.S. Immediately, we saw demand. In the U.K. when they changed restriction, immediate demand. So, we know it's there.  Absolutely. Now, how much have we don't have a way to quantify it, but we do note if you look at particularly in the U.S., when you look at what people savings rates are right now, you have been able to save a lot of money during this pandemic and they want to spend it. And one thing people have not been able to do as much they want to, is go travel. So, I believe there is a significant amount of demand there, just waiting to come out. But of course, you'd have to -- we have to have these restrictions for the long-haul international travel open up. And we also -- we know that it's important that we always provide the best value so that when they do travel, they come to us and David what you can say about suburban and local far what you can say. David Goulden : Yeah, Zach (ph.). Q3 saw strong recovery across the geographies that we talked about. So, I'd say there's still a bias towards more leisure outdoor-oriented activity, particularly beach-oriented properties did very well in the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere.  But we do see some recovery into the cities as well, and I think this -- we all know that anecdotally, if you want to book a hotel room night in a city, it's becoming increasingly hard. So, we are seeing recovery across the board, although still more entry (ph.) towards the outdoor beach-oriented leisure locations. Deepak Mathivanan : Great. Thank you. Operator : All right. Your next question is from Mark Mahaney on the Evercore ISI, your line is now open. Mark Mahaney : Thanks. Three quick ones, please. Any impact at all from IDFA. Secondly, those 100 million mobile app, MAUs, do you have enough history to know if those are actually materially different? Are they more or less profitable? They more or less loyal than, more or less likely to convert than the users that you had coming at you from other platforms.  And then third, please, the rolling out of the air products to more market. you have it in 21 markets, you rolled out some good statistics here about how 25% of the customers are new. And there was something you said about add-on sales. If you could just repeat what that was. But it all sounds like that's a really good product addition. So, I guess the action question is, why aren't you out -- how long will it take you to roll it out fully across our markets, given how positive it's been so far? Glenn Fogel : Thanks Mark. Why don't I take -- let me do the air question first, then I'll talk a little bit about IDFA, and I'll let David what he wants to say about our app and I'm not sure how -- I'll let him be streets if you wanted to be or not about what we see ensuring profitability, etc. You're absolutely right about the air business very exciting for us, of course, and we've been working on it. And it's interesting because I happen to have noticed that in the first quarter call in 2020, just as things started going very bad for the whole world. We're talking about the -- just starting out the air business at Booking.com in the fourth quarter of 2019. And I mentioned about we're striving to get to that 50% coverage of Booking.com customers. I was looking forward to hopefully doing that for 2020. And of course, that didn't quite happen exactly we wanted, but the question and it wasn't from you, Mark, who is another analyst to ask that why not a 100%. And I said, well, the 15% was just don't want to get to that year. [Indiscernible] of course, we want to get to a 100% and that still is the same thing. Yes, we're 27 countries, of course, we want to get to every single country, to anybody we currently deal with.  We want to be able to provide them with an air ticket, but it takes time. It's not something you just flip a switch. You have to actually go to regulation is to get licensing and all sorts of things. So, we're enrolling out as we can, as we should, and we will get to a 100% at some point, I do want to point out though we are at that over that 50% number right now. So, I am pleased to where we are with that. I also want to say though it's still so early, we're not doing big marketing yet, real big marketing. There are a lot of opportunities to get a much higher number of people come into this air product.  And the reason that we like it, is not only the 25% new customers, of course fantastic, but it\u2019s that attachment rate, which I haven't given a number. But I'm pleased with where we are with that right now. And again, that's something we have not optimized yet. There's a lot of opportunity there to optimize that and get an even higher attachment rate. And that's part of the overall vision of being able to bring new customers in from different verticals, different ways than we've done in the past, which is primarily pay for performance marketing and delivering a lot more customer. And as we talked a little bit earlier in a previous answer about being able to provide them with a lot more value. Your first question about IDFA, but these privacy related changes, they only impact a small part of our marketing, and it's obviously not unique to our Company. We know that very confident, we can manage through this. And as we know -- as you know, most of our marketing primarily paid marketing channels like PPC and [Indiscernible] and that's not going to be directly impacted by any of these kinds of changes. Our focus has always first-party data. We want to leverage the data into marketing, any of these changes to privacy, like the IDFA -- thing is this does not really impact us. And I think you would know, we chose not to show us the app -- track and opt-in back in April 20 -- April 21 this year, April, while the IDFA specifically decided not to do that. And of course, you've seen our results since then, so I really don't think this is a big deal for us. Very proud of the team in our whole marketing. They will be able to work and come up with, I would say, privacy-oriented ways to continue to be able to market with good tracking and ROIs. And David, I think you had number 2, which is about the monthly active users through mobile. David Goulden : Yeah, I got number 2. And Mark, what I can tell you is we kind of watch very carefully how different types of direct user response. And obviously, the more direct we can get, the better. And the more those direct customers returned and there are three types of direct customers. The direct customers using the app, the direct customers that come to us on the mobile web, the direct customers who comes to us on desktop. And perhaps not too surprisingly, the direct customers on the app measured by the [Indiscernible] you just talked about, are most [Indiscernible] of their customers. It's a good thing. We will get more of that. And a lot of our marketing that we do these days [Indiscernible] oriented. I'd getting people to download and use the app because it's sticky. Mark Mahaney : Thank you, Glenn. Thank you, David. Operator : Next, we have Eric Sheridan from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Eric Sheridan : Thanks so much for taking the question. Want to come back to the comments you talked about a little bit earlier around the dynamics around hotel room night growth with traditional hotel supply room night growth versus alternative accommodations.  Curious what your view is on how the landscape on both the supply and the demand side might evolve as we move into a post-pandemic world and aim towards summer of 2022, and how you think about making investments on supply to match up the way in which there might be a more normalized travel environment in '22. Thanks so much. Glenn Fogel : Thank you. I'll give my first comments and I'll let -- David can always add if he'd like. So, we saw before the pandemic an increase in the alternative accommodations business as they became a larger and larger share of the total combinations business. And we're just going on a pretty steady rate going up. And pandemic happens and you get a step change. As people desire safety, being away from crowds and they go there. And now we've seen for ourselves, we've seen people liking hotels in that. I think the long-term trend that will continue.  And I think if you look five years in the future, I think alternative combinations will be a higher share. That means of course for us. We talked about this in the past how important is that we go out, make sure we get the best supply we can get. And that means working hard on that and making sure that the people own these properties, see us as a platform that they want to use, and it's first in their mind that this is a great way to fill up their properties, and that's something that we are working on absolutely. The demand side similar. Go to Europe, and we've talked about in the past, and says, where can I get a villa? In the south of France, people will say, I think booking.com 's a great place. You went to the U.S. and we said, hey, I need a vacation place to ski. They may not think of booking.com first. We got to get that awareness up and I've talked about that in the past and that's what we have to do also. But one of the truly great things about booking.com is we offer more of both. Nobody offers -- you put together hotels and alternative accommodations, you put that together, were the ones that have both of those.  And I really believe that's a superior way for somebody to decide what they're going to choose in terms of accommodation. And we see this in our data. We see people come, they look -- first, start looking at one type and then they end up booking another type. And they're able to compare and contrast both. They'll see the reviews on both. Look at the prices on both. What are they going to get from one, what are they going to get from the other? That's why we believe we have a superior offering to the consumer. And I do believe though that is something that absolutely, it's going to continue. But on the other side, you all see the hotels they're making some moves themselves. And they're coming up with ways to offer a better wall frame, providing some of the benefits of an alternative accommodation. Two of this silver, particularly so they are prepared as people work in a new way in the future and want to have both the benefits of the hotel but perhaps more room or more services that you can get in terms of making sure you have good WiFi or a place you can do your work at. And that's some nice, see also hotels are definitely be getting to that space. David, I don't know if you want to say anything more to that. David Goulden : That was good. I just point out that to your point, that does strengthen that balance in both clearly contributed to us having a strong Q3 because we saw strong demand in [Indiscernible] to continue that we saw sequentially, a much bigger increase from Q2 to Q3 in hotels that we could off the book. Eric Sheridan : Thanks so much for the color. Operator : Next, we have Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Stephen Ju : Okay. Thank you so much. Glenn, I think in the past we've talked about your payment\u2019s product helping to expand your term by their on-boarding those users who may not necessarily be using credit cards and instead online payment services. Given the overall, I guess, depressed state of travel in Asia, maybe much of that value of lock is still in front of us, but are you seeing evidence in other regions of the world that this is helping to bring in that incremental user? And also, just the rising ability for you guys to merchandise as you do more the Connected Trip, but -- opens up a greater opportunity for you guys to run promos and change prices, enhance -- flex your gross margins up and down to drive growth on top of what has always been a more of a performance marketing-driven growth. So, is there still a pretty material gap in ROI from doing one versus the other at this point in terms of what you perceive? Glenn Fogel : So, I'll talk about the first one about our payments. I'll let David talk about ROIs on our merchandising approach and how we're doing that. So, you're absolutely right. If somebody doesn't have the ability to pay for something because they don't have the appropriate payment method then they're not going to be able to buy from that person or in that Company like us. So, we always have to do that. So, if you are in Southeast Asia and let's say somebody is using most of the Grab, who is a partner of ours and they're using GrabPay.  Well, we're not able to use GrabPay for the hotel, taking the money in from the consumer, that person is not going to use us, they're going to use somebody else. We have obviously GrabPay our partner working on that. Or if you look at other ways, people who say they go and look, it's not their favorite, they could use it another way, they still decided not to use us. There's something else we've seen which is really interesting, is that just having more ways to accept payments seems to increase conversion sometimes. I don't know why, I can give you a science, I just see data. This is a lot interesting. The other side is making sure we're paying the supplier the way they want to get the money. Because sometimes they say, you know I don't want to get it the way you're doing it with virtual credit card or I don't want to get it in terms of a bank transfer, I want to get it some other way. So, we've got to be able to do that, and that improves our relationship with the suppliers. If it particularly approves with the supplier when the method that we can get the money to them is cheaper than the method they are currently using.  That's a great thing when we can do that, that's another value add to that hotel or any other types of suppliers, lots of ways that we're going to do that and there are all other things we're working at, the ThinTec part of our business that we're just starting out. We talked last time about saving up that unit. There are a lot of opportunities there and we talked about how in 2019 we did over a $100 billion with a gross booking. And our idea is to -- let's find ways that we can monetize that better. And let's find ways we can provide value to both consumers and suppliers. And David, I don't know if you want to add a little ROIs and how we're doing merchandise. David Goulden : Sure, as Glenn said, payments is increasingly becoming heart of the core value proposition that we offer at booking.com in particular to both customers and partners. It's no longer just kind of we think as add-on, it really is solving problems for both all of them in cost-effective ways and risk reduction ways, they couldn't do as efficiently themselves. So as much as ROI is growing so rapidly, changing all that mix. Now, you're right, Steve. Once we're on payments, we can participate in merchandising.  Of course, with the most efficient way to get rates, is to source great rates, which Glenn talked about, frame out additional lines. But if we need to participate over and above sourcing and driving promotional targeting particular users. and particular markets, we can with payments platform. And we now have enough experience under our belt, enough instrumentation around that, that we can treat that as you mentioned, as a marketing investment.  And look at it in a very similar way to the way we look at spend in the performance channels for example, count, compare ROI s one versus the other, and decide what the right mix is. So correct, with payments becoming a bigger piece of all proposition, where we can, where we need to, where we think it makes sense. We can look our merchandising through a strong ROI [Indiscernible]. We can be quite proactive in that area and compare it directly with other forms of spending and marketing. Stephen Ju : Thank you. Operator : Next, we have Doug Anmuth, of the JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Doug Anmuth : Thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to ask about social advertising and if the dollars there are still small, but just curious what gives you the confidence and that working to the point of potentially adding some real dollars there? It's an area you've tried before, so just curious kind of what's different now? And then secondly, David, if you could just walk through those 4Q sequential revenue dynamics again, and if there's something that's particularly different, as opposed to just the normal seasonality? Thanks. Glenn Fogel : Hi, Doug. Yes. So absolutely small numbers right now, and I think I said that in my prepared remarks. These are small, small numbers right now. But obviously, there are a huge number of potential customers who are in those areas where we want to reach out, make sure they're aware of us, they're coming to us. So, it's a place that we're not going to ignore.  Now, we onset to come up with the right method, the right way to present and offer it, the way we are going to present our brand and be able to get them to come to us, and that means we've got to be able to measure, are we getting a good return or not. And I don't want to give too much in terms of sales, how we're doing what we're doing, but I'm feeling good about how we're building it up. And if we see the right returns, the right ROIs, because we are always very conscious of spending that advertising money the right way, then we will scale up and spend more money.  And then as I said in the prepared remarks, I feel good about where we are now because a great thing about our business, our Company, the way we think is, we're not dogmatic. We don't think just because we thought it first this would be great but then we absolutely do it. We're going to do it experiment, put money to work, see the results, test, and then we'll learn, and if it's great, we're going to put more money. If not, we'll come up with another way. That's how we built this Company, that's what we're doing in the future. And David, I think there's a question for you there. David Goulden : Yeah. Doug, let me explain that -- re-explain that whole seasonality thing because this is quite important than we can explain it high level. So Q3 was very strong. It was always artificially strong from a revenue for me because you've got two things naturally healthy it. First of all, remember a lot of bookings in Q1, Q2 that we're always stay in Q1, Q2 stayed in Q3. So, we got that benefit compared to the normal Q3.  On top of that, in the quarter, more bookings in Q3, the normal stayed in Q3. So, because of what you window while so short, so Q3 got topped up two ways from Q1, Q2 and in Q3. So now when you think of Q4 and you are now comparing it against a very top up Q3, Q3, and some of that top of in Q3 directly impacts Q4. So Q4 gets impacted by comparing against a strong Q3. But I think some those Q3 bookings that normally would stay in Q4 stay in Q3, to now book, if you like a double factor driving the comparison between Q3 and Q4.  Also, we believe the booking window will start expanding Q4 so more than bookings in Q4 will actually leak out of Q4 than did in Q3 relatively. So, you've got these two factors kind of driving a very unusual comparison between Q3 and Q4. So, a fair amount more sequential revenue decline. It's all timing and all mechanics. But think of it as a Q4 comparing a Q3 on steroids. And some of the reason why Q3 was in steroids will directly impact Q4 because that's what's going on. Doug Anmuth : Got it. Very helpful. Thanks for the clarity there. Operator : And that concludes the Q&A session. I will now turn the call back to A - Glenn Fogel for closing remarks. Glenn Fogel : Thank you. So, in closing, I want to repeat what I said at the close of last quarter's earnings call, and reiterate our strong belief that our industry's full recovery will be hastened by everyone who can get a vaccine, going out and getting it.

And now I'd like to introduce Booking Holdings speakers for this afternoon, Glenn Fogel and David Goulden. Go ahead, gentlemen. Glenn Fogel : Thank you and welcome to Booking Holdings' fourth quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. Despite the appearance of the Omicron variant in late November and its rapid spread throughout Europe, the U.S. and other parts of the world, we closed out 2021 by delivering fourth quarter revenue and adjusted EBITDA of $3 billion and $940 million, respectively which were better than we expected. Room nights decelerated from down 10% in October compared to 2019 to down 35% in December. However, I am pleased to say that since December, we have seen a meaningful improvement in top line trends, with room nights in the first half of February reaching 2019 levels and with gross bookings higher than 2019. At Booking.com, I'm encouraged to see strong gross bookings on our books for the summer period in Western Europe and North America, both of which are now ahead of where we were at this time in 2019. Although I note that a high percentage of these bookings are cancelable. 2021 was a year in which our hopes for a return to normalcy were set back several times, first with the Delta variant and then Omicron. However, we witnessed proof that people have a deep desire to travel. When leisure travelers believe it is safe to travel and restrictions are lifted, people book travel and we are currently seeing this starting to happen in many parts of the world. While this is a potentially favorable backdrop for 2022, we do expect there will still be periods when COVID negatively impacts travel trends as we move through the current year. David will provide additional details on our fourth quarter results and what we are seeing so far in the first quarter in his remarks. As I look back over the last year, I am proud of the work we have done under still difficult times to strengthen our core accommodation business by driving benefits to our traveler customers and to our supplier partners. For our customers, we remain focused on addressing our customers' critical needs of value, choice and convenience. One of the many ways we provide value for our customers and partners on Booking.com is through our Genius loyalty program. For our customers, our Genius loyalty program offers lower prices and other benefits like complimentary breakfast, room upgrades and discounted airport taxis. For our partners, our Genius program delivers incremental room nights to properties from our most loyal customers. Over the last year, we have meaningfully expanded our Genius loyalty program at Booking.com by opening the lowest level of Genius benefits to any customer who creates an account and is logged in on Booking.com. At the beginning of 2022, we fully launched a third tier of Genius for our top customers that made at least 15 bookings in the last two years. These Genius Level 3 members have access to even lower prices and priority customer service support in addition to all the benefits available to Genius Levels 1 and 2. These improvements to our Genius program are indicative of our efforts to move beyond just the transaction and increase our focus on value for the customer. With a higher degree of customer focus, we aim to increase loyalty, frequency, spend and our direct relationships with our customers over time. Over the last year, we have enhanced Booking.com's mobile app, making it more user-friendly and easier to use. As I said before, the app is a critical platform as it allows us more opportunities to engage directly with travelers. It is also where an increasing number of bookings are happening and ultimately, we see it as the center of our connected trip experience. In 2021, Booking.com was the number one downloaded OTA app globally according to a third-party research firm. For 2022, we are increasing our efforts to enhance the app in order to build on the success we saw over the last year. In the fourth quarter and for the full year, we saw a consistently higher mix of our customers booking directly with us than in 2019 and our direct mix improved even as we leaned into performance marketing channels during the year. We will continue to lean into performance marketing channels at appropriate ROIs as we look to bring more customer demand to our platform during the recovery. In addition to performance marketing, we will be utilizing brand marketing, particularly in markets where we are looking to raise consumer awareness of our customer-facing brands. A timely example of that which I hope all of you saw two weeks ago or so, was Booking.com's first Super Bowl ad in which we reintroduced the Booking slogan to our U.S. audience. We had a great year in the U.S. in 2021 with strong growth in room night and very strong growth in gross bookings versus 2019, even though Booking.com was relatively quiet from a brand marketing perspective. We are looking to accelerate the momentum of last year's performance by layering in brand marketing that extends beyond the Super Bowl ad through the rest of the year in order to introduce Booking.com to an even broader audience. As I mentioned last quarter, we have an ambition to acquire more customers in the medium intent space. We continue to work on strengthening our foundations for digital marketing, including in social channels. However, our spend so far remains relatively small. For our supply partners, we strive to be a valuable partner to all accommodation types on our platform which means focusing on bringing incremental demand to properties from the broad audience of potential customers on our platform. For alternative accommodations, our global mix of room nights in 2021 of about 29% was in line with 2019 levels. In Europe, where our alternative accommodation offering is more competitive, our mix of room nights increased in 2021 by a few percentage points relative to 2019. We continue to work on improving the competitiveness of our alternative accommodation offering in the U.S. market, where we have added targeted supply over the last year and have plans for more additions and improvements to come in 2022. We closed out the year with 2.4 million hotel and alternative accommodation properties and over 28 million total reported listings on Booking.com, both of which were stable relative to the prior year. Let me now talk about the progress we have made over the last year in some of our key strategic priorities around payments and the connected trip. These strategic priorities are interrelated and we believe both will further enhance the strength of our core accommodations business and support its continued growth. On payments at Booking.com, we saw a further increase in adoption by our property partners in the U.S. in the fourth quarter, now with over half of U.S. gross bookings booked at properties that have adopted payments. Globally, about 60% of gross bookings are booked at properties that have adopted payments. About 30% of Booking.com's total gross bookings in Q4 were processed through our payment platform which brings the full year 2021 mix to about 27% compared to about 22% for the full year 2020 and about 15% in 2019. We will continue our work on positioning Booking.com as an attractive and trusted payment intermediary by providing payment options favored by both travelers and our supplier partners across hotels, alternative accommodations, cars, flight and attractions. Furthermore, we see Booking.com's payment platform as a key component of our larger connected trip vision. On our connected trip vision, we made progress in 2021 as we work to build a robust flight platform on Booking.com. This flight platform gives us the ability to engage with potential customers who choose their flight options early in their discovery process and allows us an opportunity to cross-sell our accommodation and other services to these flight bookers. Flights also enables us to provide a more complete travel offering to our accommodation of customers. Booking.com's flight platform is now live in 34 countries which collectively represented about 70% of Booking.com's room nights booked in 2019. We continue to see that over 25% of Bookings flight bookers are entirely new customers to the platform. And of those new customers, an encouraging percentage are attaching an accommodation to their flight booking. These are positive early signals which help demonstrate that our flight offering can drive incremental new customers to us and we can cross-sell our accommodations product to them. We will continue our work to further optimize the cross-sell opportunity and build on the early positive signals we are seeing in flights. In November, we announced our intention to acquire Etraveli for \u20ac1.6 billion and we expect to close the transaction later this year pending regulatory approvals. Etraveli is one of the largest flight-centric online travel agencies and is a leader in flight booking technology. They've developed a comprehensive technology platform sourcing complex flight content from a variety of supply providers which is then distributed to consumer-facing sites. Booking.com and Etraveli have been successfully partnering over the last two years with Etraveli powering Bookings flight product. Given the strategic importance of flights to our connected trip offering, we believe it is critical to bring Etraveli flight expertise and technology in-house while also unlocking some of the limitations that exist in our current commercial agreement. When the deal closes, Etraveli will continue to operate as an independent company within Booking Holdings while further supporting the development of booking.com's flight platform. Outside of flights, Booking.com has significantly improved the coverage of its attractions product over the last year, in part due to the successful integration of third-party supply from Viator and Musement. We now have bookable attractions available in cities that represent about half of Booking.com's accommodation transactions which is up from about 10% coverage a year ago. While the volume of attractions bookings is still modest, we believe that developing a compelling, easy-to-use attractions product will help keep travelers engaged with our platform through the trip and build loyalty. We had a very busy end to 2021 and start to 2022, so I'd like to address a few other important recent updates. First, I am very excited to welcome the Getaroom team to Booking Holdings. We closed our $1.2 billion acquisition of Getaroom at the end of December and we are well underway with integrating Getaroom into Priceline, where it will help expand Priceline's current strategic partnerships business. Getaroom is a B2B-focused distributor of hotel rooms, primarily servicing leisure demand through about 150 affiliate partners primarily in the North American market. The B2B business is an important component and channel in our expansion efforts to reach new customers and partners, particularly in key markets such as the U.S. We believe B2B business can generate attractive returns by providing inventory to affiliate partners without the B2B business needing to invest significant dollars in brand marketing or online performance channels to generate customer demand. I am confident that the combined strategic partnership business of Priceline and Getaroom will improve B2B distribution for hotel partners while offering a robust accommodations technology stack for affiliate partners to help further enhance our offerings in North America. Second, some of you may have seen the news two weeks ago that Booking.com plans to enter into an expanded strategic partnership with Majorelle, one of our most trusted long-term external customer support partners. As part of this partnership which is still subject to consultation with works councils and regulatory approvals, Majorelle will begin employing most of the customer service representatives that previously worked for Booking.com outside The Netherlands and the U.K. We have been successfully working with Majorelle for six years in order to help meet the evolving seasonal demands of our business and we believe that this expanded partnership will help increase the flexibility and efficiency of our customer service offering going forward. Finally, on our last earnings call in early November, I discussed the urgency of tackling the global climate crisis and the importance of our industry coming together to work towards the goal of carbon neutrality by 2050. Shortly after that earnings call, Booking.com launched its Travel Sustainable Program. This is a first-of-its-kind program that features a travel-sustainable badge for any property on our platform that has implemented a combination of sustainable practices. When searching for accommodations, travelers can see whether or not a property has been given a travel-sustainable badge and can filter search results based on the badge. We believe our greatest influence on sustainable travel is through enabling our accommodation partners to showcase their sustainable practices to travelers who are looking for ways to travel more sustainably. We are looking forward to talking more about this program and other efforts and commitments related to sustainability when we publish our 2021 sustainability report and our first climate action plan in March. In conclusion, we executed well and produced strong results in 2021. As we look ahead to 2022, I am encouraged by the quick rebound in bookings we have seen so far this year and the level of summer travel on our books. While we expect to see some volatility in trends as a result of the ongoing effects of COVID, I am confident in the continued recovery in travel demand globally as there is clearly a very strong desire to travel among our leisure bookers. Of course, we are concerned and are monitoring the situation in Eastern Europe which we recognize could be disruptive to travelers who may be going to that region. Overall, we believe we are well positioned to continue capturing travel demand and we'll continue our work executing against our strategic priorities. As I have said before, we are thinking about our business beyond just getting back to 2019 levels of demand. And we are focused on building a larger and faster-growing business with more products that generate some more earnings after the full recovery and for the long run. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden. David? David Goulden : Thank you, Glenn and good afternoon. I'll review our results for the fourth quarter; provide some color on the trends we've seen so far in the first quarter and our thoughts on 2022. All growth rates for 2021 and 2022 are relative to the comparable period in 2019 unless otherwise indicated. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. Now on to our results for the fourth quarter. On our November earnings call, we discussed the improvement in trends that we saw throughout the third quarter driven by Europe, followed by a further improvement in October driven by Asia. You will recall the trends weakened in Europe towards the end of October driven by a number of countries that have seen recent increases in the Delta variant infections at that time. In November, we saw a slowdown from October in our overall trends driven mainly by Europe and this slowdown continued to worsen in December across all regions with future Omicron variant concerns. This resulted in Q4 reported room nights declining 21% versus Q4 2019 which was 11% worse than the 10% decline in October but only a few points worse than the 18% decline in Q3. December room nights were 35% below 2019. Looking across the full quarter; the slowdown in Q4 versus Q3 was driven primarily by Europe which declined about 20% versus Q4 2019, while our other regions improved in Q4 versus Q3. Compared with Q4 2019, the U.S. continued to have strong growth in the fourth quarter, while Asia was still down considerably and rest of the world was down modestly. However, as I mentioned, we saw a slowdown across all of our regions in December, most meaningfully in Europe and in the U.S. Mobile bookings primarily through our apps represented 2/3 of our total room nights in the fourth quarter and for the full year. Our apps continue to represent an increasing majority of our mobile bookings. We all continue to see greater than 50% of our total room nights coming to us through the direct channel. Our direct channel increased as a percentage of our room nights in the fourth quarter and for the full year relative to 2020 and 2019. The international mix of our total room nights in Q4 was about 33%, in line with Q3. Q4 international room nights were down almost 50% compared to Q4 2019 levels, a few points worse than the decline in Q3. We continue to see growth in our domestic room nights in the fourth quarter, also a level slightly below Q3. The December slowdown was more severe for international than for domestic. Our cancellation rates were up a few percentage points versus 2019 in Q4 and for the full year and increased meaningfully in December due to concerns about the Omicron variant. The booking window in Q4 of Booking.com was much shorter than it was in the fourth quarter of 2019 and contracted further in December as customers focused mainly on short-term travel needs. Alternative accommodation of Booking.com, the global mix of room nights is about 27% in Q4 and about 29% for the full year was in line with 2019 levels. The global mix was impacted by the underperformance of Europe relative to North America. Within Europe, our mix of alternative accommodations increased in Q4 by a couple of percentage points and for the full year, by a few percentage points relative to 2019. Gross fee declined 8% in Q4 which is less than the 21% decline in room nights due to an increase in average daily rates for accommodations on a constant currency basis of about 13% versus 2019 and very strong performance in our flights business. Our accommodation constant currency ADR benefited by about 4 percentage points from an increased mix of business in North America which is a higher-ADR region; and a decrease of mix in business in Asia which is a lower-ADR region. Excluding regional mix effects, constant currency ADRs were up about 9% driven by rate increases in most of our regions, most notably in Europe and North America and especially in higher-demand, leisure-oriented destinations. Constant currency ADRs were higher than expected due in part to continued higher rates for flexible bookings plus generally higher pricing in North America and in Europe. Airline tickets booked in the fourth quarter were up 116% and for the full year, were up 104% versus 2019 driven by very strong growth of Priceline and by-flight bookings at Booking.com. We're encouraged to see a full year of triple-digit growth from our flights business which is a key component of our multiproduct connected trip strategy. Consolidated revenue for the fourth quarter was almost $3 billion, down sequentially 36% from Q3 2021 and 11% below Q4 2019. Q4 2021 revenue was more than double the $1.2 billion of revenue we recognized in the fourth quarter of 2020. Q4 revenue was stronger than our expectation due to higher ADRs and a shorter booking window. Revenue was less impacted than bookings from Omicron in Q4. Revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was about 40 basis points below Q4 2019 which was better than our expectations as the deceleration within Q4 more negatively impacted our gross bookings than revenue in the quarter. Excluding timing impacts, our underlying accommodation take rates were about in line with Q4 2019 levels. Our full year revenue was almost $11 billion which is 27% below 2019 but improved 61% versus 2020. Full year revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was 14.3% which was lower than 15.6% in 2019, primarily due to the timing differences between gross bookings and revenue recognition. The strong revenue results in the fourth quarter helped drive adjusted EBITDA of $940 million which was 27% below Q4 2019. Sequentially, Q4 EBITDA was down 55% which is better than we expected. This was driven primarily by the higher-than-expected revenue and lower-than-expected OpEx in our more fixed expense categories. Marketing expense which is a highly variable expense line, decreased 2% versus Q4 2019. Marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings increased slightly versus 2019, in line with our expectations. The marketing ROIs were a little lower than our expectations due to the negative impact of cancellations late in the quarter and this was offset by a higher-than-expected mix of direct business. Sales and other expenses were 21% higher than Q4 2019 due to a higher volume of merchant gross bookings and higher outsourced call center costs. About 30% of Booking.com's gross bookings were processed through our payments platform in Q4 and about 27% for the full year, up from 22% in 2020. We expected our more fixed expense categories in aggregate to be about in line with Q3 due to lower personnel costs offset by higher IT and G&A costs. They came in 10% lower than Q3 due to year-end finalization of our bonus expense accruals as well as lower-than-expected IT costs. This means our Q4 personnel expenses do not reflect our run rates going into 2022. Non-GAAP net income of $554 million results in non-GAAP EPS of $15.83 which were down 32% versus Q4 2019. Our non-GAAP tax rate of 20% was higher than 18% in Q4 2019. Our full year non-GAAP tax rate of 20% was 1% higher than in 2019 due to a high proportion of nondeductible tax expenses -- nontax-deductible expenses in relation to a lower pretax income versus 2019. On a GAAP basis, we had operating income of $848 million in Q4. We recorded GAAP net income of $618 million in the quarter which included income tax expense of $198 million. Now, on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q4 ending cash and investment balance of $14.3 billion was down versus our Q3 ending balance of $15.4 billion primarily driven by the $1.2 billion Getaroom acquisition, partially offset by positive free cash flow of about $178 million. Two housekeeping notes about Getaroom. The first is that it closed at the end of Q4 and was not meaningful to Q4 results. The second is that we did not include the incremental room nights from Getaroom in our commentary about January and February. These incremental room nights will be included when we release our Q1 actual results. In early January, we started returning capital to shareholders under our remaining authorization and have to date purchased about $500 million. Assuming that travel recovery continues, we still expect to complete our remaining organization within the next three years. Now on to our thoughts for the first quarter. And to remind you, we'll make comparisons with 2019 unless otherwise indicated. January room nights declined about 22%, an improvement from the 35% decline in December as concerns around the Omicron variant eased. This improvement was driven primarily by a recovery in cross-border travel within the European region and domestic travel in Europe. We saw room nights trends improving throughout January and continuing into February. Our room nights in the first half of February were about in line with 2019 levels and gross bookings were higher. In the first half of February, we saw a meaningful improvement across all of our regions compared to January. The U.S. has strong room night growth versus 2019 in the first half of February, while Europe had about 10% growth. Rest of the world was up slightly and Asia was down about 35%. Our mix of international room night recovered from about 23% in December to over 40% in the first half of February which is the highest international mix we've seen since the start of COVID. As a reminder, our pre-COVID international mix was just over 50%. As I mentioned, the improvements we see in the first half of February are broad-based with large countries in Europe and international travel routes within Europe driving the largest impact. The new cross-border bookings we're seeing in Q1 in Europe on average have a longer length of stay and a shorter booking window than comparable bookings in 2019. As we've seen throughout the pandemic, when travel restrictions are lifted and traveler confidence increases, bookings improve quite quickly. Given the rapid changes during the first half of Q1, it's difficult to predict how room nights for the remainder of the quarter will develop. While it's encouraging to see the recent improvements, we are still in a potentially volatile environment with high COVID infection rates in some part of the world and geopolitical uncertainty that could impact our business, especially in Europe. So far in Q1, the overall booking window of Booking.com has contracted less versus 2019 than it did in Q4. We've seen recent strength in our summer booking trends and our gross bookings for the summer are higher than they were at this time in 2019. The summer booking trends are stronger in Western Europe, where gross bookings for the same period are up double digits versus 2019 and gross bookings for the U.S. are also higher for the summer than they were at this time in 2019. Of course, a very high percentage of all bookings for summer are cancelable, so things could change rapidly. Turning to the income statements; we expect the change in gross bookings in Q1 versus 2019 to be several percentage points better than the change in room nights due to an increase in ADRs and very strong flight bookings. Constant currency ADRs in Q1 so far have increased versus 2019 at a similar rate to Q4. We expect Q1 revenue as a percentage of gross bookings to be about 1.5 percentage points lower than in Q1 2019 as the booking deceleration in Q4 negatively impacts revenue -- negatively impact on revenue and the booking recovery in Q1 benefits revenue in future quarters. This 1.5 percentage points of difference in revenue as percentage gross bookings could be higher if booking trends increased meaningfully from the first half of February, especially if a high percentage of these bookings offer stays in future quarters. We expect margin expenses in Q1 will trend about in line with gross bookings compared to Q1 2019. We expect sales and other expense in Q1 as a percentage of gross bookings to be about the same as it was in Q4. We expect our more fixed expenses in aggregate will be about 15% higher in Q1 than in Q4 on a dollar basis due to the impact of seasonal increase in benefit costs, the 2021 year-end personnel-related accrual finalizations and the impact of planned hiring as well as increases in IT expenses, including some deferral from Q4. In my just explained and reminding you that Q1 is our seasonally lowest quarter, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be positive but down sequentially from Q4 significantly more than the sequential declines we saw pre-COVID primarily due to the impact of Omicron on Q1 revenues. As we think about the full year ahead, we're encouraged about the strong summer bookings we're seeing so far and we're optimistic about the continued recovery of later travel. However, we do expect continued volatility in our top line trends driven by COVID. There are other uncertainties on the horizon, including the current geopolitical situation which could impact travel. If we look at Russia and Ukraine combined as destination markets, they represent a very low single-digit percentage of our total gross bookings. All this makes it very difficult to predict how the top line will progress during the year and how the full year will turn out. As we think about the recovery of travel in 2022 and the opportunity in front of us, we plan to invest in marketing other incentives and improvements and expansion of our products to attract existing and new customers to our platforms and to drive additional loyalty in the future. This also requires investments in people and technology. We're excited about the opportunity to expand our business and we believe we can strengthen our position in accommodations and build a much more complete travel solution for our customers and partners. We believe this is the right thing to do for higher longer-term returns from our business. With this in mind, there are a few factors to consider when thinking about shape of the P&L for the full year. These fall into four buckets; revenue, marketing, sales and other expenses and our more fixed operating expenses. Starting with revenue as a percentage of gross bookings, we expect this to be higher in 2022 than it was in 2021 but lower than in 2019. In 2021, our revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was about 130 basis points lower than 2019, mainly due to timing differences between the recovery of gross bookings and revenue. In 2022, we expect this timing to be less of an impact than it was in 2021. Moving to marketing; there are a number of factors that come into play. We expect the environment to remain competitive, especially as the leisure travel market moves closer towards full recovery. We intend to remain disciplined in our performance marketing ROIs and we'll continue to invest in developing the medium intent social media channels and you'll see us active in branding in the U.S. and other major markets. Our goal continues to be to use our marketing strength to gain share in markets where we can with reasonable returns. We expect to run initiatives and programs during the year to attract both existing and new customers to our platforms. It's difficult to know exactly how these factors will play out across the year but we expect marketing as a percentage of gross bookings to be a little higher than it was in 2019 and also in 2021. Of course, an increasing direct mix helps our marketing efficiency and we believe the investments we're making will result in a higher direct mix over time. Turning to sales not expenses; we expect these to be up 50 basis points higher than in 2021 as a percentage of gross bookings. This is mainly from additional payment processing costs but also impacted by anticipated higher third-party customer service expenses. The additional expenses related to payments are offset by a higher payment-related revenue. The last area is our more fixed operating expenses which include personnel, G&A and IT. We expect our personnel expenses to be impacted by higher-than-average annual wage increases, especially in the product and technology areas; and by planned headcount increasing in key areas, including product and technology and bond-related functions. We expect personnel expenses to be about 10% higher than in 2021. We expect that G&A and IT will both grow faster than personnel driven by a number of factors, including digital services taxes, returning to a hybrid work environment and the investments to enhance our customer and partner-facing and internal systems. The comments we made for 2022 do not include the anticipated reduction to personnel expense and increases to sale and other expense from the enhanced strategic partnership with Majorelle that Glenn spoke about. We do not anticipate much of an impact on adjusted EBITDA in 2022 from this initiative and we'll update you again in May. Also, we expect our acquisition of Getaroom to have a small positive impact on our P&L in 2022. As Glenn noted, we expect that the Etraveli acquisition will close later this year which will result in a minor impact to the P&L in 2022. So when thinking about the shape of the P&L in 2022, these factors mean that revenue recovery will lag the gross bookings recovery and EBITDA recovery will lag revenue recovery. Some of the lag in EBITDA versus revenue is timing, i.e. the marketing we spend on bookings we expect to recover ahead of revenue. On top of this, we plan to make investments in customer acquisition and in expanding our product offerings we mentioned earlier. Taken together, we expect our EBITDA margins in 2022 to be a few points higher than we were in 2021. Looking beyond 2022, we continue to remain focused on investing to build a larger and faster-growing business with more products than we had pre-COVID that delivers more EBITDA dollars and more earnings per share with industry-leading EBITDA margins. In closing, we're confident in our ability to capture demand as the global travel market recovers and to execute against our strategic priorities. With that, we'll take your questions. And Chris, I'll turn the call over to you for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Justin Post of Bank of America. Justin Post : Great to see your bookings back to '19 levels. I know there's a lot of thought about what booking looks like post-travel recovery. So I'm wondering if we could revisit some of the things you're thinking about, what the business could look like as far as booking levels and margins when we get back to normal. And I know you've made a couple of acquisitions. I'm sure you're excited about those. And obviously, your connected vision trip seems to be in the right direction. So maybe we could revisit how you're thinking about the absolute number -- the absolute value of bookings and also what the absolute level of EBITDA could look like once we get to a full recovery. Glenn Fogel : Why don't I let David handle the margin. Though he did -- he just said it in his prepared remarks. I'll let him say it again. David Goulden : Justin, let me give you a little bit more color. And I appreciate the question. So we are focused upon, as I said, growing a business that is larger than it was in 2019. It's more diverse in terms of product offerings. It's growing faster than it was in 2019. It has more absolute EBITDA dollars and EPS dollars. That's our focus. We've given you obviously some color where things go in 2022. We expect that we can expand our volume beyond 2022. And we expect that once we are kind of to normal in that final state, we'll have industry-leading EBITDA margins. But beyond that, we don't want to get too specific about exactly what they're going to be other than our goal is to give more EBITDA dollars, more EPS dollars that are growing faster than they were pre-COVID. Justin Post : Great. And then the two acquisitions you made, one you closed and one is still open. How are you thinking about those? Are those areas that are really going to help you save costs? Or do you think those are actually booking drivers? Glenn Fogel : Well, they're really two different acquisitions, Justin. Why don't I take them separately. So the Getaroom one, as I described in my prepared remarks, is very much adding to what we already have at Priceline in a B2B business that helps bring in customers that we wouldn't have gotten through our other marketing programs, whether it be pay-for-performance or brand. These customers are coming from affiliates. And there are contracts that Getaroom had and different technologies they have that by bringing them in is going to get us additional business that we wouldn't have gotten otherwise. On Etraveli, that was a different situation where, as I pointed out many times, how important it is for us to have this connected trip vision fulfilled. And one of the critical parts of it is our flight business. And we absolutely are very pleased to see not only the growth in our number of flight bookings but also the fact the number of new customers getting coming and the number who are then buying an accommodation. Now Etraveli has been powering the Booking.com product for two years. Great technology. They do a lot of things that could we recreate on our own? Probably it would take a long time, would require us to use resources that we want to use elsewhere. So by acquiring Etraveli, we're going to bring that technology in-house and be able to do things that we couldn't do when we were just a commercial partner. So I'm looking very forward to having that close and hopefully, as we said, in the future and then really began to develop a great, great combination. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Lloyd Wamsley of UBS. Lloyd Walmsley : Two, if I can. First, can you give us just an update around how you're thinking about timing for adding some of the value-added features to payments that could drive positive contribution to the P&L? And is it safe to say that even if you pass some of that cost, some of that margin along to consumers, it would likely drive faster growth and therefore, revenue, even if it wasn't directly revenue margin-accretive? And then the second question would be, can you maybe give us some color around the benefits of connected trip beyond incremental revenue from adding new products? So what do you see with repeat rates or direct rates among users who adopt multiple products? Anything you could share there would be great. Glenn Fogel : Sure, Lloyd. Two separate questions. Let me talk a little bit about the payments product and what we're developing and how it's going and I'll let David add a little more to it. I'm sure he want to add some more specifics. Clearly, we've talked about this in the past that one of the critical things is enabling a customer to be able to pay in the way they want to pay and enabling the supplier to get paid in the way they want to get paid. So right way, getting that out in the market enables us to have more business. Then you go beyond that and you see do it cheaper for our suppliers, do it in a way is cheaper than they're doing it right now the way they're doing their payments the way they're getting it through our old agency model Booking.com and finding a way that we can do that in a way that not only improves their business because they'll not to pay as much but obviously, we'll make a little out of that, too. But then it goes much more beyond and that is the connected trip. The connected trip doesn't work if you don't have payments because we need to put it all together in one payment that we can then handle on our own. And particularly, if there's anything goes wrong, we don't have to undo it, too. That's really going to be helpful to us. And then it's not just payments but it's our fintech unit which is the payments people but doing more things; it's coming in and helping out in flexible-type products. People want a flexible product. They can cancel us. Creating that on our own is something we'll be doing more so in the future. There are a number of different things we can do that will absolutely increase both the ease of use, the convenience and enable us to make more money out of it. And I'll pause there and let David, if he wants to add anything more to that. David Goulden : I think, Glenn, you did a great summary of the interconnectivity between those two and the new areas. A lot on timing. Nothing major in terms of market impact in 2022. We're still in building mode for some of those value-added products that you mentioned. And market entry where you might see any impact will be more into the 2023-2024 time frame. Glenn Fogel : Then to the second thing, Lloyd, in terms of the connected trip, step one is build out the verticals. We didn't have flights a couple of years ago on Booking.com at all. And as you can tell by the numbers I put out, we still don't have 100% coverage for all the areas that we do accommodations. Have to build that out. Also just some of the technologies at Etraveli, we have a lot of things we can do to just improve that product. I talked a little bit about the attractions product where we had only 10% coverage last year. Now we made a lot of good progress to 50%. We had to put that all out. And then there are other areas, ground transportation, other parts of the trip. So we're building out all the verticals first to make sure we have the supply, make sure it works well, et cetera. At the same time, we are beginning, as I pointed out, about the people who get flights and then buy in a combination, we are doing some of that cross-selling and bringing that out. We'll do more and more. The goal, of course, is to make it so that it is so seamless, so frictionless that people when they're using Booking.com or any kind of trials we're doing, they're finding easier and offering more value. And that value comes from suppliers being willing to chime in to our platform and be able to offer different things that we can then very, very scientifically target at different customers in a way that gets an incremental customer to that supplier. The customer is happy, the supplier is happy and we, of course, make money. That will develop the loyalty, that will develop the direct business and that's where we're going for. And it's the same way in other parts of e-commerce where people don't shop around, they don't look around. They go to one player because they know that's the place where they're going to get the most value easiest to you, et cetera. And that's what we're going for. It's going to take some time but I love the progress that we're making. David Goulden : And Glenn, I'd just add to that as well that when we kind of look at our customer base and not too surprisingly, our top customers, the ones who can spend the most with us, uses most often are more likely to use multiple things, more likely to use the app and a much more likely to interest directly. So that's the model that we're trying to build upon to build the loyalty that Glenn mentioned. And we do have good evidence that, that is a trend that we can build on. And the more we build value, complete travel offering, frequency, direct linkage via the app, the more loyal those customers become. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Kevin Kopelman of Cowen & Company. Kevin Kopelman : I had a follow-up on the latest recovery trends. Based on all the data that you have, do you have a sense of to what extent the strong booking numbers you saw in the first half of February reflect sustainable levels that you could see going forward in the coming months as opposed to kind of a short-term catch-up after the Omicron pressure that you saw in December and the start of the year? And as a follow-up to that, to what extent are travel restrictions that are still in place in many European countries still hurting booking activity based on the data that you've got? Glenn Fogel : Kevin, so I think it's very difficult for anybody to have a perfect crystal ball into exactly what is driving the good numbers that David talked about for the first half of February. However, I think we can all feel fairly certain that there's a tremendous amount of pent-up demand for travel. For several years, people have not been able to travel the way they wanted to travel. Savings are up so people have cash. And I hear it anecdotally. I hear it when I talk to CEOs in the industry, what they're seeing, what they're hearing. I think everybody feels that people want to travel. And I don't think I would just see this as just a little bit of an Omicron rebound is what we're seeing. I think what we're seeing is people being able to travel, restrictions are going down, people are feeling safer. There are some new things coming out that will reduce the frictions in -- further in Europe. There's an announcement by the EU counsel about wanting to suggest getting rid of some of the restrictions. Those things all help people feel better about travel. And of course, though, there are parts of the world that are still having problems. And eventually, those are going to go down, too. So I feel good about the demand. I feel good about the future of travel. That being said, David made -- mentioned it several times, there are a lot of uncertainty still about how linear this is going to be. And I think we have to all look back at the past one. Many times, we thought things were out of the woods and then we weren't out of the woods. And of course, David also mentioned and I mentioned there are some macro events happening in different parts of the world that can also impact travel. So I think we all have to be cautious but optimistic. Here's the thing I absolutely do know, though, the long run. I know in the long run, we're going to do well in travel. People are going to come back. You can't stop that demand in the human being that wants to travel. How fast? We can't be certain but I am confident in our future. Kevin Kopelman : Could you comment on the travel restriction piece in Europe? To what extent are you still seeing restrictions in Europe still limiting some of the activity? Or is that pretty much up already? Glenn Fogel : No, it's not completely done. The different countries -- you had different counties and I look at the list all the time. Some places are letting them up completely. U.K., you're probably aware; other places, still some. And the question is, do you need to take a test before you show up or not? If you're vaccinated but you're not vaccinated with an EU-approved vaccination here with the WHO vaccination approval, what's the difference there, all these things. But I think a lot of this stuff is going to be going away. And I hope, I hope in other parts of the world also, that these restrictions around the world can go down as quickly as possible. Australia, for example, was letting tourists back in and you maybe you saw some of those happy, happy photographs. Look, the fact is that I do not believe and I've seen a lot of data on this, that the restrictions on travel and this comes from the WHO and other authoritative sources, that travel restrictions do not have a significant impact on reducing the amount of infections in countries. And therefore, given the social costs, financial costs, et cetera, a lot of these restrictions should be lifted. Operator : Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth of JPMorgan. Douglas Anmuth : One for Glenn and one for David. Glenn, was just hoping you could talk about the elevated brand strategy in the U.S. and just how the approach differs here versus in previous years. And then also any comments just framing the broader marketing landscape as you go into stronger recovery. And then, David, unless I missed it, I was just curious on any financial implications from expanding the customer service partnership with Majorelle. Glenn Fogel : So Doug, I heard the second part a little bit about the brand marketing but I didn't hear the first part. Let me answer the brand and our general marketing approach in the U.S. going forward and then maybe give me -- say again the beginning part there. Clearly, you saw that we didn't do a lot of brand marketing at the worst of the pandemic. And obviously, there's no reason to spend that money. And now with the recovery coming, we're coming back. And I'm very pleased with what we saw with our sub add-on. It's very, very early but I'm pleased with the numbers and what I've seen so far. And so we are stepping back into a more normal marketing approach as we did in 2019. That being said, we're always going to do what we've already done which is, look, where do we think we're going to get the best return for our marketing dollars. And we continue to evaluate what's going to give us the greatest return. But one thing that we have been changing over time and that is not looking just for the immediate transaction seeing what are we doing in terms of building out the long term, the loyalty, the repeat business, the coming back direct and being able to measure where that person came from and what they do after that. So we're a little more scientific in it than perhaps we were in the past for the long run but I'm pleased with that because I think that's what we need to do to really build the franchise and increase the value of the company. The first part -- what's the first part, Doug, you asked about? Douglas Anmuth : I think you hit the brand strategy pretty well. The second part I wanted to ask about the customer service partnership expansion and just financial implication. Glenn Fogel : Sure. David, still there? David Goulden : So let me take that. So first of all, let's put this into context. We -- this is to do with Booking.com. So Booking.com, we've been working with external service providers for a long period of time. And you may or may not know that when we get to our peak periods, the majority of our customer contacts actually handled by our XL partners. So for example, typically, last summer, we had about 75% of the CS contacts were handled by EXLP. So this is not something new. It's just something have a little bit more accelerated. Financial impacts, do not expect much in 2022. We're still working through, as Glenn said, through approvals and the close process, then there will be a transition period. Going forward, 2023 and 2024, this is more about potentially having the ability to have -- let the cost increase than in the past but the cost driver is not really the driver for doing this. It's really about ability. We have incredible variability in our workload from peak periods to low periods. And to run an in-house CS team is quite inefficient and also isn't the best employee experience for our workers because -- so they are experiencing peaks and troughs and the Korea development is also restricted because it's a very in-house group. So the bigger factor is really our flexibility, giving a bigger pool of opportunity for our employees and then with that comes some cost -- potential cost benefits in the form of lower increases as we ramp up the volumes. Glenn Fogel : And I would just add one other thing is we still believe absolutely the importance of great customer service. This has nothing to do with changing that. We're still going to be doing the technology that goes into the customer service process, our policies, all those things we're doing that. Also, it's looking to the future but we hope to build a very big company. The idea of then having to build a very big internal customer service operation is just not the best use of our resources, our managerial capabilities. This is something that is better done by people who are experts in that and can really do it better than we can do it but we can still provide all the great things in the actual customer service to the customer. It's definitely a win-win. Operator : Our next question from Mark Mahaney of Evercore. Mark Mahaney : Two questions, please. That 9% constant currency ADR growth, I think that's the highest I've ever heard you talk about. And I guess that's -- and if I'm right, maybe that's not surprising given what's happened to overall inflation rates being at decade-highs. So when you think about this year, what are you assuming in terms of the sustainability of that? Maybe I'm even asking whether inflation is temporary or permanent. So just your thoughts on what do you expect to happen with ADR. Like when you -- when you're running your business, what are your assumptions? And then the second thing I want to ask is, David, when you talk about the ability of Booking to grow post the recovery, to grow faster than it did in 2019. And if that were to actually happen, what would be the biggest drivers of that? Like what would be the greatest things I would cause on the top line, the business, to grow faster post-COVID than it did pre-COVID? David Goulden : Sure, Mark. Let me take both of those. So yes, the 9% constant currency ADR growth was actually adjusted for basically geo mix, right, so same country. And that is a strong number. We experienced 9% ADR growth last year, again, versus 2019. So it's quite possible ADR is going to be at or higher than they were in 2021. I mentioned what the factors were. I mentioned the fact it was higher than our expectations. Do you think that the rates would start to tail off a little bit when we got into the -- got the high season where obviously, there was more supply relative to demand but the rates continue to hold up. And as I mentioned, flexible rates are still at a premium. But just underneath that, there was basically just higher prices, particularly in the left-oriented, high-demand areas remain strong. So we think that ADR is likely to be as high in '22 as we were in '21 compared to 2019. And then in terms of faster growth, I mean there are a number of factors there. We do believe that it can take together. We believe that there's further growth for us in the accommodation business, both on a geographic point of view, expanding our offering into alternative accommodations and adding on to that all the benefits from the connected trip, what we can do on top of that because of payments because of the fact we offer a more complete offering, thinking about more targeted ways to customize a complete solution for our customers, our pricing, payments, customer service. We think that we are solving today a relatively small part of the total travel equation and the potential for us to solve more of that is what's going to drive more growth, basically create a better product, a better service, have customers coming to us more frequently, increasing loyalty. They all work together to provide what we think is a great growth opportunity for us. Operator : At this time, I would now like to turn the conference back to Glenn Fogel for his concluding remarks. You may proceed. Glenn Fogel : Thank you. We are very pleased with 2021. It was a volatile and difficult year but it showed progress. And as always, I want to thank our partners, our customers, our dedicated employees and our shareholders. We appreciate your support as we continue to build on the long-term vision for our company. Thank you and good night. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes today's conference. Thank you, everyone for participating. You may now all disconnect.",

And now I'd like to introduce Booking Holdings speakers for this afternoon, Glenn Fogel and David Goulden. Go ahead, gentlemen. Glenn Fogel : Thank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings\u2019 first quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. I am pleased to begin by reporting that our first quarter was a record. Our customers booked $27 billion in gross bookings, the highest quarterly amount ever. The continued improvement in our room night trends, increased accommodation ADRs and significant growth in our global flights product all contributed to achieving this gross bookings record. In our accommodations business, we saw meaningful improvement from last year, with first quarter room nights declining only 9% versus Q1 2019 which was an improvement of 12 percentage points from our fourth quarter 2021 results. Our bookings continued to strengthen in April, with roommates increasing 10% and gross bookings up over 30% versus 2019, making April a record month for gross bookings and our first month that global room nights exceeded 2019 levels. @Booking.com, I'm encouraged by the strong gross bookings already recorded for the summer period, which are over 15% higher than at this same point in 2019. In Western Europe and North America, gross bookings for the summer period are now over 30% ahead of where we were at this point in 2019. Though, I know that a high percentage of these bookings are cancelable. Of course, our brands or other brands, we are seeing the benefits of a global recovery from the pandemic with strong travel demand in the US for Priceline, a rapid recent improvement and trends in Asia for Agoda and uptick in international flight searches at KAYAK and the return of diners to restaurants for OpenTable. In many countries, especially across Europe and Asia, travel restrictions were eased in the first quarter, which we believe has contributed to the strengthening of travel demand trends. As we have said before, with leisure travelers believe it is safe to travel and restrictions are lifted, people booked travel. With that being said, there are still restrictions and inconveniences imposed on travelers today by some countries, though we believe that the industry is moving in the right direction and progressing back to normalcy. While we are pleased with the trends we're seeing right now across our brands, as we look towards the rest of the year, we are cognizant of the potential for macro uncertainty, and are aware that inflation or other macro factors may have an impact on consumer demand. And before providing further updates on our business, I want to address the devastating war in Ukraine. Since first hearing the terrible news of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, our first priority was the safety of our colleagues and supporting them through this time. We worked closely with our employees and their families in Ukraine to provide them with safe refuge, and we have continued to support humanitarian efforts in the region. As we previously disclosed in early March, we suspended travel services in Russia and Belarus. By mid-March Booking.com Booking.com, developed and launched a no commission initiative that enabled properties in select European countries to offer free or heavily discounted accommodations to refugees fleeing Ukraine. We believe that about 30,000 refugees have been provided with places to stay through this initiative so far. We continue to work closely with our hotel and home partners, and expect to expand this program to more properties in the region. As an example, Booking.com has partnered with Hilton and the UN Refugee Agency to make it easy for NGOs to book temporary accommodations on behalf of refugees fleeing the war in Ukraine. These rooms have been made available for free by Hilton at hundreds of their properties across Europe, which we in turn are providing through our platform. I am very proud of our team's quick actions to help our employees, customers, partners and the many people impacted by these tragic events. And, of course, we all hope this barbaric violence end soon. Let's now turn to the progress we're making in our business. We continue our work strengthening our core accommodation business by driving benefits to our traveler customers and to our supply partners. For our customers, we are focused on their critical needs of value, choice and convenience. With this high degree of customer focus, we aim to increase loyalty, frequency, spend, and direct relationships with our customers over time. In March, our unique active Booking.com customers at Booking.com were within 95% of 2019 levels, driven by strong growth in returning customers who had not made a previous booking in over a year. In the first quarter, we saw a higher mix of customers booking directly with us than any of the last three quarters first quarters, three years first quarters. We see the strongest direct repeat customer behavior in our mobile app than when compared to other platforms like desktop or mobile web. We continue to see more of our business shift to the app with over 40% of our room nights booked through our apps in the first quarter. Booking.com\u2019s app hit a new record in terms of monthly active users in Q1 and continue to be the number one downloaded OTA app globally, according to a third-party research firm. As I said before, the app is a critical platform, as it allows us more opportunities to engage directly with travelers. And ultimately, we see it as the center of our connected trip experience. We will continue our efforts to enhance the app to build on the recent success we have seen here. For our supply partners, we strive to be a valuable partner to all accommodation types on our platform, which primarily means bringing incremental demand to properties from the broad audience of potential customers on our platform. For alternative accommodations, our global mix of room nights in the first quarter increased to about 31%, a couple of points higher than in Q1 2021. We continue to work on improving our alternative accommodation product globally with an additional focus on the US market. We've been working closely with property partners to identify opportunities to improve our platform to better fit their needs. Related to these efforts, we launched partner liability insurance for our alternative accommodation supply partners with global coverage in the first quarter. In addition, we are making progress on an enhanced payment solution for professional property managers that we're rolling out in the US. In the first quarter, we saw the largest sequential net increase in alternative accommodation properties on Booking.com since the start of the pandemic. While the net increase in Q1 was still a modest number of properties, we\u2019re aiming to build on this growth throughout 2022 by continuing to improve our alternative accommodation offering and attracting more partners to our platform. In this week, we launched a new campaign in the US to promote Booking.com to alternative accommodation owners and managers who want to grow their business with us. Let me now talk about the progress we've made in our interrelated strategic priorities of payments and the connected trend. We believe both of these priorities will further enhance the strength of our core accommodations business and support its continued growth. On payments, 34% of Booking.com\u2019s gross bookings were processed through our payment platform in the first quarter, which is our highest quarterly level ever. This year, we are focused on continuing to increase supplier adoption of payments, while introducing new products and features that over time will improve the customer and partner experience and bring new revenue streams to our platform. We will continue to position Booking.com as an attractive and trusted payment service for both travelers and our supplier partners across hotels, alternative accommodations, cars, flight and attractions. Furthermore, Booking.com\u2019s payment platform helps deliver a more seamless and frictionless booking experience, which are important elements of our larger Connected Trip Vision. On our Connected Trip Vision, we continue to make progress as we work on the foundations such as developing a flight offering on Booking.com, which is now live in 40 countries. This flight offering gives us the ability to engage with potential customers who choose their flight options early in their discovery process, and allows us an opportunity to core sell our accommodation and other services to these flight bookers. We have seen that in over 70% of our flight bookings on Booking.com, the flight was the first or only product that was booked. This helps confirm the value of flights as the starting point in many people's booking journey, and is an anchor part that we can utilize to cross-sell accommodations and other products, a meaningful percentage of bookers who first book a flight, then book an accommodation. We'll continue our work to further optimize the cross-sell opportunity, and build on the early positive signals that we're seeing so far. Flights continues to be a source for new customers, with about one quarter of all flight bookers in Q1 being new customers for Booking.com. We've also seen recent success driving incremental room nights and experiments where discounts are applied to non-accommodation products that were attached to the transaction. To put it simply, we believe having more products on the shelf, increases our merchandising opportunities, and helps us sell more room nights. Finally, as I previewed on our last earnings call, we published our 2021 sustainability report and our Climate Action Plan in March. In our Climate Action Plan, we highlighted the significant emission reductions we've already achieved, in part driven by sourcing 100% renewable energy for our office by the end of last year. And we are committed to more than halving our emissions by 2030 and achieving net zero emissions by 2040. We are proud of the emissions reduction achieved and ambitious target set for our business. But as I said before, we believe our greatest influence on sustainable travel is through making it easier for travelers to find and book sustainable options. We are addressing this opportunity through our work with our Travel Still Badging program, which now includes over 100,000 properties that can highlight their sustainable practices to customers on Booking.com. In conclusion, I am encouraged by the strength we are seeing in bookings, the level of summer travel on our books and the potential for a very busy travel year ahead. As we discussed last quarter, in this recovery environment, we will continue to lean into performance marketing channels and appropriate ROIs as we look to bring more customer demand to our platform. Overall, we believe we are well positioned to continue capturing this returning travel demand. And we will continue our work executing against our strategic priorities. As I said before, we are focusing on building a larger and faster growing business with more products that is sustainable, and generates more earnings dollars for the long run. Now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden. David Goulden : Thank you, Glenn and good afternoon. I'll review our results for the first quarter and provide some color on trends we've seen so far in the second quarter. All growth rates for \u201822 relative to the comparable period in 2019 unless otherwise indicated. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. Now on to our results for the first quarter. On our February earnings call we discussed the improved in trends we've seen so far in 2022. With room nights getting back to about flat versus 2019 in the first half of February after declining 21% in January just hours after our earnings call on February 23, the terrible news broke the Russia invaded Ukraine. As a result, we saw an immediate negative impact on room night trends, particularly in Eastern Europe. Despite this impact towards end of the month, room nights for the full month of February came in about in line with 2019 levels. In early March, we suspended the booking of travel services in Russia and Belarus. This led to a loss of new bookings, as well as significantly elevated levels of cancellations of reservations for these countries. Additionally, we saw some slowdown in booking trends within Europe, as travelers took in the news of the invasion. We disclosed that total room nights for the week ending March 6, were down about 10%. And that slowdown was driven by Eastern Europe, primarily Russia, and to a lesser extent by Western Europe, which remained mostly above 2019 levels. I'm pleased to say that compared with the first week in March, we saw our overall trend improve during March driven mainly by Europe, resulting in room nights been down about 4% for the month, which is only a modest pullback from where we were in February. For the first quarter, room nights were down 9%, an improvement from down 21% in Q4. And our best quarter results since the onset of the pandemic. Excluding Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, our room nights were down about 2% in March and down about 6% for the first full quarter. But Q1 on a regional level room nights in Europe and the rest of the world were both down mid-single digits. Asia was down about 35% with all three improving from Q4 levels. The US has strong growth versus Q1 2019 similar to what we saw in Q4. Mobile bookings primarily through our apps represented about 6% of our total room nights in the first quarter. Our apps were over two thirds of our mobile bookings and over 40% of total room nights. In the first quarter, we continue to see an increase mix of our total room nights coming through as the direct channel versus Q1 2019 and Q1 2022. The International mix of our total room nights in Q1 was about 40%, an encouraged increased from about 33% in Q4. Q1 International room nights were down about 30% compared to Q1 2019 levels, an improvement from the almost 40% -- for the almost 50% decline in Q4. The improvements in international bookings we saw continue to be driven mainly by travel plans within Europe. And these cross border bookings continue to have on average, longer length of stay and a shorter booking window and comparable bookings in 2019. We saw strong growth in our domestic room nights for the first quarter also an improvement from Q4. Our cancellation rates were about in line with 2019 levels in Q1 despite the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The booking window in Q1 of Booking.com contrasted less versus 2019 than it did in Q4. And this booking window expanded versus the first quarter of 2021. For our alternative accommodations at Booking.com, the global mix of room nights increased to about 31% in Q1, a couple points higher than 2021. Within Europe, our mixed alternative accommodation continuously, meaningfully higher than the global average. Gross bookings increased to 7% in Q1 versus 2019 and were up 10%, excluding Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. This 7% increase in gross bookings were 16 percentage points better than 9% room night due to 18% higher accommodation constant currency ADRs and also due to strong flight bookings across the group, partially offset by about four percentage points of negative FX movements. As Glenn mentioned in his remarks, the $27 billion of gross bookings in Q1 is a new record for us higher than the previous record at $25 billion in Q1 2019. On March 2022 was the first month our gross bookings exceeded $10 billion in a single month. This was up 17% versus March 2019 and compared to up 18% in February and down 11% in January. Our accommodation constant currency ADRs benefited by about three percentage points from regional mix and about 15 percentage points from rate increases in most of our regions. Notably, most notably Europe and North America, and especially in higher demand leisure oriented destinations. Constant currency ADR growth versus 2019, accelerated from 13% in Q4 to 18% in Q1, primarily due to higher rates in New York. Airline tickets booked in the first quarter were up 152% versus 2019 and up 69% versus 2021, driven by continued expansion of Booking.com site platform, as well as continued flight ticket growth at Priceline. Consolidated revenue for the first quarter was $2.7 billion, which was down 7% versus 2019 and down about 2% on a constant currency basis, revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was about 150 basis points below Q1 2019 in line with our expectations, due primarily to differences between gross bookings, the timing differences between gross bookings and revenue recognition. Our underlying accommodation take rates were about in line with Q1 2019 levels. Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line decreased to 4% versus Q1 2019. Marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings decreased about 50 basis points versus Q1 2019, which is better than our expectations, mainly due to unexpected marketing ROIs. Sales and other expenses were up 58% versus Q1 2019 due to a higher volume of merchant gross bookings and higher third party call center costs. About 34% of Booking.com\u2019s gross bookings were processed through our payments platform in Q1, up from 13% in Q1 2019 compared to Q1 2021, sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings were about 30 basis points higher. Our more fixed expenses in aggregates were about in line with our expectations, up 12% versus Q4 and up 17% versus Q1 2021. Adjusted EBITDA was $310 million for the quarter, which was better than our expectations due to unexpected ADRs. And the better than expected leverage of our variable expenses. However, sequentially EBITDA was down 67%, which is significantly more than the seasonal decline you saw pre-COVID and aligns with our commentary in February. Non-GAAP net income of $161 million results in non-GAAP EPS of $3.90 which was down 65% versus Q1 2019. Our Q1 non-GAAP tax rate of 16% was lower than 19% in Q1 2019 due to a great impact from a discrete tax benefit on a lower base earnings. On a GAAP basis, we had operating income of $174 million in Q1. We recorded GAAP net loss of $700 million in the quarter, which included an unrealized loss on our strategic investments of about $987 million and a $36 million loss on assets held for sale related to the Majorelle strategic partnership we discussed last quarter. Now on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q1 ending cash and investment balance of about $12.8 billion was down versus our Q4 ending balance of $14.3 billion, primarily driven by the payments of $1.1 billion for a margin debt maturity, about $950 million in share repurchases in Q1 and the declining value of our strategic investments. These factors which reduce our cash investment balance were partially offset by positive free cash flow of about $1.6 billion, which was driven almost entirely by change in working capital, resulting from an increase in our deferred merchant bookings balance. As we disclosed, on last quarter we started returning capital to shareholders in early January. And in addition to share purchases in Q1, we repurchased about $325 million of shares in April, which brings our outstanding authorization to just over $9 million. As we said before, we expect to complete our remaining authorization within the next three years. Now moving on to our thoughts for the second quarter, April room nights increased about 10% versus 2019, an improvement from the 4% decline in March, driven primarily by Europe, excluding Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, April room nights increased about 16% versus 2019. All regions show improving room nights growth in April. Europe was up high teens percent in April and up about 30% excluding Russia, Belarus and Ukraine. Growth in the US was very strong, rest of world had doubled digit growth, and Asia recovers to down high teens percent all versus 2019. The international mix of our room nights in April was over 45% and encouraging increase from the 40% in Q1. April international room nights were down slightly compared to 2019 levels, an improvement from down 30% in Q1. International demand driven mainly by travel plans in Europe accounted for most of the improvements in room nights in April versus Q1. Domestic room nights also improved in April to very strong growth versus 2019. April gross bookings increased over 30% versus 2019, driven by growth in room nights continued accommodation ADR strength, as well as continued strength in flight bookings. April gross bookings increased to almost $11 billion, which was a new monthly record. April gross bookings typically declined from March pre-COVID. While it's encouraging to see continued improvements in trends into April, the environment is still uncertain and difficult to predict with confidence how room nights for the remainder of the quarter will develop. While many countries are lifting their list of travel restrictions, COVID is still a factor which can impact travel and of course, the war in Ukraine continues to create volatility and macro uncertainty. We do expect the recent strength in ADRs to continue for the remainder of the quarter. And as a result, we expect the difference between the level of room nights growth and gross bookings growth for the full second quarter to be around 20 points, which is similar to what it was in April. In April, the overall booking window Booking.com continue to move back closer to 2019 levels. We continue to see strength in our summer booking trends, and our gross bookings for summer are now more than 15% higher than they were at this time in 2019. And within Western Europe and North America both of over 30% albeit with a higher mix of cancelable bookings. If the current trends continue, we could see a record summer travel season and we're gearing up to prepare for that across all parts of our business. Turning back to Q2, given recent booking trends combined with lengthening booking window, we expect Q2 revenue as percentage of gross bookings to be about 200 basis points lower than it was in Q2 2019. This 200 basis points of difference in revenue as a percentage of gross bookings is mainly timing related, and the impact could be greater if booking trends accelerate from April, especially if a high percentage of these bookings were staged in future quarters. The timing impact on take rates in Q2 is driven by a combination of the acceleration in gross bookings from up 7% in Q1 to up over 30% so far in Q2 coupled with the lengthening booking window from Q1 to Q2, we expect our underlying accommodation take rates to remain stable. We expect marketing expense percentage of gross bookings to be slightly higher than in Q2 2019, which is consistent with our prior commentary about the opportunities for us to lean into recovering travel market in 2022. We expect Q2 sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings to be about 60 basis points higher than it was in Q2, 2021 due to higher virtual booking mix and higher third party call center costs. We expect our more fixed expenses in aggregate to be about 15% higher than in Q2 2021. With personnel down slightly on both G&A and IT up meaningfully versus Q2 last year. The overall year-on-year increase in G&A is driven by higher digital sales taxes, which is tied to revenue as well as increased office expenses due to return to hybrid work environments. We expect IT to increase year-over-year at similar rates to what we saw in Q1. If we were to see similar top line growth rates for the rest of the quarter we saw in April, we'd expect adjusted EBITDA to be over $900 million for the quarter. The expected timing difference between gross bookings and revenue which is the primary driver are expected 200 basis points lower take rate than Q1 2019 will have a significant negative impact on EBITDA in Q2 as our more variable expense lines are linked to bookings. If we normalize the timing impact on our take rates in Q2 2022 to be the same as it was in Q2 2019, adjusted EBITDA in Q2 2022 will be slightly higher than it was in Q2 2019. Now turning to the enhanced strategic partnership with Majorelle we discussed last quarter. As a reminder, Majorelle one of our most trusted long term external customer support partners will begin employing most of the customer service representatives and previous work for Booking.com outside of the Netherlands and the UK. We currently anticipate finalizing sponsorship around the middle of the year. And following the anticipated closing on a quarterly basis in the second half of 2022, we expect the personnel expenses will be lowered by about $25 million a quarter, but G&A expenses will be lower by $6 million a quarter. And our external expenses will increase to offset the lower personnel and G&A expenses. As we said last quarter, we did not anticipate much of an impact on adjusted EBITDA in 2022 from this initiative beyond 2022. We believe this partnership will help reduce further expense growth and enable a more efficient ramp up of our customer service function. Outside of the P&L geography changes to the personnel G&A and sales and other expense line from Majorelle, we are maintaining the full year P&L commentary we provided last quarter. As a reminder, the expected timing, we expect timing to know the impact take rates. The precise impact timing on our take rates for the year is difficult to predict as it is impacted by the rate of recovery of bookings coming into and during the year. And also by the length of booking windows during the year. We do know the relative to 2021 there was a negative impact on our take rates due to timing in Q1 2022. Our current best estimates of take rates in 2022 is just below 15%, which is lower than 2019 primarily due to timing. We expect the underlying accommodation take rates will remain stable. Timing also negatively impacted adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA margins for the year. If not impacted timing our expectations for full year EBITDA margins will be a few points higher than our guidance for the year. We're encouraged by our better than expected Q1 results and the strengthening trends we've seen in April, and we are confident that our focus on customer acquisition and expanding our product offerings is the right approach for 2022. We\u2019ll now take the questions. Shawn, over to you, please for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with UBS. Lloyd Walmsley : Alright, thanks for taking the question, two, if I can, first, on the April trends in bookings in room nights, those sound nicely ahead of where street estimates are for the whole quarter. So is there any reason to think that you won't continue to build from April in terms of kind of thinking about monthly comps or anything else we should keep in mind, pull forward or pent-up demand. And then secondly, helpful color on the revenue take rates and the EBITDA impact from timing, I guess, how do we think about that as we work into next year. Should take rates at least kind of like for like accommodation normalized to 2019 levels next year? And does that EBITDA headwind of few points on timing does all of that unwind you think as we get into 2023, any help you can give us on the kind of margins and how they progress further would be great. Thanks. Glenn Fogel : Hi, Lloyd. While I\u2019ll take that first one, I'll let David go back over the timing issues that you just asked about. So your question really is trying to predict the future, which is always an interesting adventure, particularly over the last couple of years that we've all gone through. As I've said, David was saying, we're very pleased with where we are. And we're happy with what's happening. I think everybody around the world is happy about travel coming back. And we've mentioned how some of the trends that we're like -- that we like seeing in Asia where things are getting better, we know they're not as good as they are in Europe or in the US. That's a good positive sign. Hopefully that will continue. We're also pleased with the things that we've been saying that throughout Europe and Western Europe and Eastern Europe coming back that so we're all very happy where we are, but we never know. We never know what's going to happen. You know that we've done this. We had a call, our last call. And then there was a terrible, terrible news shortly thereafter, what happened in Ukraine and if you recall going back a quarter before that, COVIND omicron came out of nowhere. So we all know that the world is, let's say volatile right now. But I will say I am happy where we are. And I'm pleased with the incredible good job of execution our team has done. And, David, I'm not sure you want to add any more than that. David Goulden : Maybe, Glenn, just maybe a couple extra points on what we're seeing in April and March, we did see a steady progression from that first week in March where things were minus 10, up through March and April on a fairly steady basis, week on week. But as Glenn said, there's still a lot out there and the environment it\u2019s hard to predict. I would call it this Easter happened in April in both periods. So there's no Easter effect there relative to the growth rates versus 2019 August 2021 for that matter, either. Relative to longer term take rates. And I explained on the call, take rates are the impact timing on take rates is a mathematical impact of the difference between the amounts that you spill into the year from the prior year, and the amount you still out in the current year into the next year. And of course, that can be variable based upon effects. We saw this year, we said that there was a hurting Q1 on timing effects on take rates, because that's when Omicron basically came up with into Q4, and that results in less booking still into Q1 than we would expect. So it's really going to be a function of how the recovery develops in total in terms of how rapidly things recover, and also just the timing of that recovery. So as growth rate starts to normalize, and get back to more normal level, you expect the impact upon the take rea, the timing impact on take rates to come down. But then there could be some additional factors that could impact those specific things relative to what happens about the prior Q4 going into Q1, and the next Q4 going into the future Q1. So normally, and as the growth rates start to normalize the roles of revenue growth rates and booking growth rates start to align more, there will be less effect. But there could still be unusual effects they have, like what we've seen before that could impact the specific timing of Q1 and Q4, and the relative difference between those quarters across the years. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak : Great. Thanks for taking my questions, guys. I have two, first one, David, I think last quarter, you talked about some like shape of the year comments, you talked about marketing as a percentage of gross bookings be a little higher than was in \u201819, et cetera. And sales and other expenses and sort of thoughts about that as far as your bookings? Yes, I know there was a lot of pieces with ADRs, moving around and et cetera. But can you just sort of maybe tell us your latest thoughts about some of those metrics on marketing spend for the year and sales and other for the year, however, you want to kind of help us think about it a little bit. And then Glenn, good to hear about traction you're making on payments and flights, et cetera. I guess, talk to us about on the connected trip front, which of the initiatives you think is most likely to really have a meaningful impact on the P&L as soon as maybe 2023 from an incremental dollar perspective. Thanks. Glenn Fogel : David, you want to do that first one? David Goulden : Yes, Brian, let me go first. So with the exception of the mechanical movements, I'll talk about how they impact things little bit, the mechanical moves relative to Majorelle, which are basically just P&L geography movements. We're not, I'm not changing what we said last time. We do expect some deleverage in marketing to gross bookings for the year. We said we expected in Q1 to be relatively flat, we were a little bit better that we were actually 50 points \u2013 50 bps leveraging in Q1 due to a higher ROI, but we did say we'd be leaning into the busy travel season more in Q2 and Q3. So we're still expecting to see some level of deleverage during the year and also increased spending on merchandising, sales and others, we still expect that to be about 50 bps for the year that\u2019s tied to payments, the mechanics of the Majorelle adjustment with moving those additional expenses into [Indiscernible] would be less than 10 bps although that are adjustments again as to TGV. So essentially, with the exception of the mechanical movements, what we talked about for the last, what we talked about quarter go for how we see the year shaping up, we still expect to see the shaping up the same way. And of course, I've given you some additional color on take rates we didn't provide last quarter so that gives you a little bit more color than we gave you on quarter because we now know what happened in Q1 so we can give you a bit more guidance around that. Glenn Fogel : And, Brian, talking about connected trip. So connected trip is a long term vision. And it's going to take some time before we get to where I believe we need to be in terms of a truly step functional change in the way people are currently, by exploring going through travel, I think we all know how difficult it is. And we all know that it should be better. So that's the goal down the road. In 2023, we're still going to be pretty early in this, I think I would think it's, we're still in the base level of just getting great verticals up and running, so that they by themselves are fantastic, good product for people to use. And then just the basic-cross selling things that we think is a first step to get towards that connected trip. And if you ask me one of the biggest things for 2023. Well, the things I just talked about right now flights right now, I really liked the fact again, the new customers coming in, and they're coming in, they're buying a meaningful number of buyer combinations. And we haven't optimized this yet. That's something important. Then on top of that, I mentioned in my prepared remarks about just beginning small experiments with other types of verticals, and how putting these things together can give a better experience to a customer. The great thing about these things is trying to build a belief that coming to us to Booking.com is the best way to go. So getting more repeat business and getting this do it on the app, so that we don't pay for that person to come and increase that loyalty. So there's a lot of ways trying to increase this flywheel. So people know the products better and coming to us. And as we continue to do that, get more information, be able to provide a better proposal to them a better offer to them that they can work more easily. And it continues to build on its own. It's going to take time, though. And in 2023, I don't think you're going to see huge numbers from all things I just talked about. But you will see incremental improvement. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin Kopelman from Cowen. Kevin Kopelman : Great, thanks a lot. I was hoping to just dig in a little bit more on the April trends. The improvements is nice there to plus 10% is obviously a big acceleration. Could you -- what exactly are you seeing there in terms of changes? And if we relate that back to your ad spend, you had some leverage versus GBB in Q1, but you're spending more in Q2, how much of that is a reaction to what you're seeing versus strategically pulling on a lever in the start of Q2? Thanks. Glenn Fogel : So let me tell you in general, and David, I'm not sure you want to talk in terms of any sort of numbers and levers or whatever. But yes, we are very pleased with what we're seeing. But I believe it's a combination of many things that we're working on is really is a game of execution in the small details, means you're working with partners and getting the right price, the right inventory. And then it's making sure we're showing it to the customer at the right time in the right way. And it means also doing things we're talking about with alternative accommodations, bring in a few, bringing in some incremental more supply there, making sure we're working to come up with ways that works better, so that the customers having a better experience and their payments are more smooth, et cetera. I can go through a lot of little things that we're working on. And each one builds on its own. It makes it a better experience. Now, yes, we have a brand effort in the US, as you hopefully remember back from our Super Bowl, we, I believe a very good ad and we're continuing this is not just a one and done. It's a campaign. And we tie that with some efforts in social and we're doing a lot of different things to try to increase our awareness getting that top of mind awareness in the US, for example, helping build that. But this is a global effort really, in terms of trying to build our business by doing all the little things that make it a better product, because in the long run, the better product is what's going to win. And David, I don\u2019t know, if you want to speak anything specific in terms of ROIs or levers right there and nature. David Goulden : I think, Glenn, let we go where you went, because this is just not one geography. We're seeing all geographies improve in April, which for us is very encouraging. So we mentioned that Europe is now April back into high teen growth versus 2019. That is really encouraging and really the first time we've been able to talk about growth over 2019 in Europe, this is for room nights, US back to very strong growth versus 2019, which we think is well ahead of the market. And Glenn mentioned some of the factors, the APAC recovering nicely, down, still down but down IT is not, again the best result we've seen since the start of pandemic, and the rest of world backup to double digits, so all nice improvements from Q1, all nice improves to March, so it's not just one reason we're seeing it across the world, which I think is a positive sign, I mentioned that we will be leaning a little bit more, expect to leaning in more in Q2 than in we did in Q1, relative to the amount of spending and the ROI. But as we said, that is really in response to the opportunity to capture demand. When we see demand, and we see traffic on this site, that's when we can start increasing our marketing spend. So we're really responding to the opportunity of recovering travel. And whereas we see travel for that's when we can lead in sort of leaning in, particularly in Q3 of last year, you saw us do that in prior quarters. So it's early during the quarter, but that's why we said we expect it to be at a small level of deleveraging this quarter in marketing, but the impact we're seeing and the change we're seeing from March to April is very positive. Kevin Kopelman : Great and could you touch on currency with the 30% GBV figure for April? Is that reported or constant currency and the dollar has strengthened since the last call. So I wanted to ask about that. David Goulden : Yes, that's a reported number. And currency is an impact for what it is worth when we did our guidance, and we did our calculations here we had your [Indiscernible] come down a little bit doesn't make a huge amount of difference. But the numbers we gave you or reported unless we call some out specifically as constant currency, for example, we call our constant currency ADRs. For example, everything else is reporting. Operator : Our next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of America. Justin Post : Great, thank you. I guess I'm just trying to think about market share. Can you give us any indication of how much share US nights were back in \u201819? And what that looks like now? And then one question on take rates, I know your merchant, sorry, your payments platform is handling 34% versus 13%. I would think that would be increasing your overall take rates. But you said take rates about flat. So just talk, maybe you can help us understand how the merchant business is affecting take rates? Thank you. Glenn Fogel : Dave, why don\u2019t you take that? And I\u2019ll just turn my [indiscernible]\u2026 David Goulden : Yes, I talked about, so when we talk about the underlying take rates, we're talking about the basic take rate on the -- or the commission on the room. We're not factoring in payments to that at all, or motion the next. As I said, the biggest impact on timing is, sorry, these impact on take rate is timing. And we talked about it being raised significantly, but you're right, we are getting an increase in the overall take rate from our mix towards payments and from the fact that we gain additional revenue from payments. As I mentioned in 2021, for example, that was somewhat offset by the merchandising that we cannot do, because we couldn't merchandise and participate in pricing actions ourselves. And so we have on the payments platform, and in 2022, that again, will be largely offset by the merchandising activities. Now bear in mind, merchandising is also like marketing, we can turn up and turn it down. We think that this year in a recovering travel marketplace, there's a potentially once in a generation opportunity to really lean into both marketing and merchandising. But we are seeing improvements in take rates from the payment platform. And again, the number of, when I talked about the underlying accommodation take rate being a very constant that does not include the additions for things like payments or things that go on top payments, nor does it impact anything that we do on top of that, or does include anything we do on top of that with our merchandising activities. So hopefully, that clarifies the movements there. Justin Post : Great. And then on US share of nights, any help there? Glenn Fogel : David, I think we don't reveal that granularity. David Goulden : I think our view just as being that shared data, and we should look at share medium term basis, single quarter, very difficult to predict. We certainly believe that last year with our growth in the US being strong versus 2019. We certainly covered a lot faster than the market did in 2021.We were strong again in Q1 in the US market versus 2019. And very strong here in April so difficult to give you an individual share points. But when we look at the overall accommodations markets, which is a way to think about things, we know we picked up some share points in 2021. And we know -- we continuing to stay above where the market is in 2022, from a recovery point of view. Glenn Fogel : Yes, and I'd just say, look, I'm very pleased with what we've done over the last 2.5 years since this pandemic started. What we've been doing in building out our business in the US, and I made the point of how important was strategically to do better in the US because we had been under indexed in the US. And we've been doing a lot of blocking tackling over these 2.5 years in the midst of this pandemic. And we're beginning to see it come through, and I'm very pleased with the results up through Q1. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from Evercore ISI. Mark Mahaney : I am here. Sorry about that. David, a question for you. And then one for Glenn. David, you'd set talked about take rates this year being I think, just below 15%, or something like that. And you said that'd be a few points higher, if not for timing. So I want to ask you is does that mean that once we get beyond these unusual timing issues for a variety of factors this year, that kind of the normalized take rate is a couple of points higher like 17%, you haven't done that, your booking has done that in the past, but that's going back 5, 6, 7 years. But is that the implication of your -- of that statement? And then Glenn, about the connected trip? I wondered if you think that there's something that's structurally changed, that makes connected trip more attractive, more viable, or more impactful than it has been historically, I think about the history of online travel, and there was a connected trip company, but they never would large package business, but they never generated as many room nights as you did. And you were solo lodging company. Is there something that's changed now maybe it's much greater use of mobile or mobile apps that just makes the connected trip a greater, needle mover today than it was historically? Thanks a lot. David Goulden : Glenn, why don\u2019t you go first? Glenn Fogel : Do you want me to go first? So, Mark, here's the thing. I have seen over two decades, people have been talking about a connecting trip, because travel in this problem since we started buying travel online, and no human being do it for us. Certainly, the technological landscape has changed significantly, since we first started doing this when I first joined this company in 2000. And now we have so many new things that we can use to make this better, the idea of mobile apps, but even more so all the machine learning, AI to be able to do better types of predictability. What's happening, what can be better for a person, how we can see is there a potential problem in the future, we can fix it before it happens. So many things, I believe this can be done will be done, and we are the ones we're going to do. Okay, but we're not there yet. So to say it hasn't happened, it hasn't happened yet. Because we've been built all this yet. I believe it will happen. And I do believe it's necessary, because I don't believe that people should have to suffer the way they do right now in trying to do a simple family trip. That being said, though, it is going to take time, we're going to get there. But we're not going to show up next quarter or the next year to say here's the incredible increase in our business, it is going to be incremental. It's going to take time, but I absolutely believe this is where it's going to be. And David, I\u2019ll let you take yours. David Goulden : Yes, right. Thank you, Mark. So yes, let's not confuse the difference between impact on EBITDA margin and actual take rates, take rate percentages, what we talked about is the fact that let's go back to numbers so in 2019, and take rates blended across the year was 15.6%. In 2021, we said it was 14.3%. We said last quarter, it was somewhere between those two, this quarter, we gave you a bit more guidance, because we know more about the timing impact in Q1. So we said just below 15%. We said that impacts on the timing impact on take rates was causing a few points of EBITDA margin compression, so it will take a few so we said last quarter, and we still maintain that our EBITDA margin rates for the year will be a few points higher than it was in 2021. And what we said at the last call we clarify again today. If it wasn't for the impacts of timing the EBITDA margin would be a few points higher again on a normalized basis. So the fact that take rates are being hurt for the full year is causing us to have a few points of compression on our EBITDA margin this year, which is timing related. We did not say the take rates [Indiscernible] seen, we said that they were, would be below 15. And if you normalize from just below 15%, back to 15.6%, something like that, then that will give you those few points EBITDA margin that we talked about. Mark Mahaney : Okay, yes, sorry, that was my mistake, and it can confuse you. Thanks, David. And thank you, Glenn. Operator : We will now take our next question comes from Eric Sheridan of Goldman Sachs. Eric Sheridan : Thank you for taking the questions. So I want to come back to the comment you made in the prepared remarks on investing in supply as we go deeper into 2022. Can we talk about what kind of investments you feel you need to make? And also, as you look at the base of gross bookings in the booking window, you have now deeper into the year? Where do you find yourself with elements of supply demand imbalance on either the shared accommodation side or the hotel side that you're trying to sort of unlock or think about not only just for summer of \u201822, but beyond it to 2023? Thank you. Glenn Fogel : Sure. So may be talk a little bit about trying to build our supply areas where we think we need it. And I've talked about this in the past in the alternative accommodations area, where we think we are not as well positioned as some of our competitors, stating the fact particularly in the US, so we absolutely need to go out. And firstly, sure we got a product that people own properties want to put on our platform. That's kind of the new things I talked about in terms of the liability insurance, in terms of payment system that is actually workable and works well even that. But then we have to make people aware of this. And that's going out, we mentioned we have a new campaign out, we're spending money. And it's more than just marketing out there. It's actually individuals talking with the big owners of multiple, multiple properties, make sure they understand what we can bring to them. That's how we start to bring in more of that because we don't have the supply. You've never becoming business. So we do that. And then we obviously have the second the other side of this two sided marketplace, make sure that consumers are aware of this too and make sure they're coming to it. That's how we're going to do this over time. And it's obviously something that I've been talking about for a long time, I'm sure people will get a little tired of me saying it. But it's this is where we're going. I mentioned how we are, we did have a net increase in alternative accommodations, very pleased about that. And we are going to keep on building this. And it builds on itself. This is again, it's one of those things where it's like a snowball, and you need to get it rolling. And then it will build more and more faster and faster. It's going to take some time. I'm pleased with where it is, in terms of the window and may repeat that part of the question. Mark Mahaney : I'm just kind of curious, like where you do see supply demand imbalances based on what you've seen in the forward booking window going into the summer and other elements of this, where maybe there are disconnects in supply versus demand by product type looking out deeper into the year. Glenn Fogel : Yes, so right now, we're not seeing any shortage of supply from demand, people come in, and it's not, so they're not -- they can't find anything [Indiscernible] or the rates right now. That doesn't mean and peak summer that there won't be some shortages of inventory. But that happens every normal year when there's peak summer travel in the northern hemisphere. The most popular places will fill up and most popular low key -- and most low key properties in most popular locations are going to fill up. One of the great things that we've been doing for some time is being very flexible in offering customers when they come in, and we're not having enough inventory, we think because things are filled up there. We're offering an alternative place that they could go and stay or different locations to your property all different ways. We are doing so working more different experiments to do that. But we're not the only one to do that. That's important. You have a customer in your store, you want to sell them you don't have enough of what they want you show them something else that probably he is just like, that's what we're doing. Clearly over time what I want to do, though, is not have to have this conversation about the US that we don't have enough of the single properties on the beach and XYZ. And that's something that really what we're working on, but right now I don't see an issue right now we're having insufficient supply. Operator : And now we will now take our last question comes from Doug Anmuth from J.P. Morgan. Doug Anmuth : Great. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask about international recovery. It seems like you're suggesting it's coming more from short haul. Just curious what you're seeing in terms of long haul and how you're thinking about none of that coming back. Thanks. David Goulden : Sure. I\u2019ll start -- Glenn Fogel : You got, Dave, start. David Goulden : Go on Glenn. I\u2019ll stop. Glenn Fogel : You start. David Goulden : So yes, so you're right. International recovery in total international bookings in total across borders, we define it in April is down a little bit short haul report or within Europe actually up decently, but long haul, still down, not too surprisingly, I mean total to see the international booking number close to flat for April, I think is a great step forward, not surprisingly, inter region is going to recover fast, fastest, most European countries and now relax all restrictions for travelers within Europe, which is great. And long haul still down, but also rapidly improving and we see strong growth from travelers from the US, for example, obviously travel into and from Asia is still down. And that's an important destination for both US and European people when you look at long haul routes. Glenn Fogel : And David you basically said what I was going to say, basically, we have a situation that is very tied somewhat to restrictions and is countries that are typical long haul destinations, some of them in Asia, for example, as they'll begin to lighten up and feel more confident they can go without having to do a lot of different things don't have to quarantine before, don't have to go to get a test they have done test before as these things go away, then people will travel more and more of these long haul trips. So I definitely and positive on the continued trend in this area. Doug Anmuth : Good, thank you both. Glenn Fogel : Okay. Was that the final question? Operator : Yes, that is our final question. So I will now turn the call back to Glenn Fogel for the closing remarks. Please go ahead. Glenn Fogel : Okay, thank you. As always, I want to thank our partners, but I really want to thank all of our partners who have generously contributed to our refugee platform. Also, of course, want back to customers, our dedicated employees and our shareholders. We appreciate your support as we continue to build on the long term vision for our company. Thank you all and good night. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes today's conference call. Thank you, everyone for participating. You may now disconnect.",

And now, I would like to introduce Booking Holdings\u2019 speakers for this afternoon, Mr. Glenn Fogel, CEO and Mr. David Goulden, CFO. Go ahead, gentlemen. Glenn Fogel : Thank you and welcome to Booking Holdings\u2019 second quarter conference call. I am joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. I am pleased to announce that we reached another milestone in our company\u2019s recovery with room nights for Q2 being the first quarter in which we have surpassed 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Our customers booked 246 million room nights in the second quarter, so just shy of 0.25 billion room nights, which represented an increase of 16% versus Q2 2019 and a significant improvement from the 9% decline in Q1. We continue to see very strong accommodation ADR growth, which helped drive an even higher 38% increase in gross bookings in the second quarter or 48% growth on a constant currency basis. Both our room nights and gross bookings in Q2 were our company\u2019s highest quarterly amounts ever for these metrics. While we continue to see bookings growth in July versus 2019, the pace of growth moderated to about 4% for room nights and just over 20% for gross bookings or about 35% growth on a constant currency basis with room night and gross bookings growth slightly improving in the back half of the month versus the comparable weeks in 2019. For the remainder of the summer period through the end of Q3, we see higher gross bookings on the books than at this point in 2019, which we believe will result in a record revenue for the third quarter, which is our seasonally largest revenue quarter. Looking towards the rest of the year, Booking.com, we see solid gross bookings for the fourth quarter, which are about 15% higher than at this same point in 2019 on a euro basis. Though I note that a high percentage of these bookings are cancelable and current FX rates will negatively impact that growth rate in dollars by about 10 percentage points. The booking window remains shorter than it was at this point in 2019, which somewhat limits our visibility into how Q4 will continue to develop. And although conditions could change rapidly, we are cautiously optimistic on the data we are seeing so far. David will provide further details on the recent trends we have been seeing. Now, we recognize that there is uncertainty around the macroeconomic environment and questions about the strength of consumer demand through the end of this year and into next year. And while it is extremely difficult to accurately predict the near-term economic environment, I am as confident as ever in consumers\u2019 strong desire to travel, the attractive long-term growth profile of the travel industry and our improving longer term competitive position. With our industry leading margins, high-quality earnings, strong free cash flow and liquidity position and solid balance sheet, we believe we are well-positioned to navigate any potential near-term economic uncertainty and continue our work attracting customers and partners to our platform, while making progress on our key strategic priorities of payments and the connected trip vision. In terms of attracting customers to our platform, our unique active customers at Booking.com surpassed 2019 levels in the second quarter, driven by very strong growth in returning customers who have not made a previous booking over a year as well as growth in repeat customers. Our mix of customers booking directly on our platforms reached its highest second quarter level ever. We aim to build on increasing our direct mix through several initiatives, including by continuing to enhance the benefits of our Genius loyalty program, further building out our connected trip vision to increase engagement with our customers and driving more of our customers to download and utilize the mobile app. In our mobile app, we see the strongest direct repeat customer behavior when compared to our other platforms like desktop or mobile web. Consistent with the first quarter, over 40% of our room nights were booked through our apps in the second quarter which is about 10 percentage points higher than in 2019. Booking.com\u2019s app continue to set new records in terms of monthly active users in Q2 and remains the number one downloaded OTA app globally according to a third-party research firm. As I said before, the app is a critical platform as it allows us more opportunities to engage directly with travelers and ultimately, we see it as the center of our connected trip vision. We will continue our efforts to enhance the app experience to build on the recent success we have seen here. For our supply partners, we strive to be a valuable partner to all the combination types on our platform by delivering incremental demand and developing products and features to help support their businesses. Alternative accommodation in room nights, Booking.com grew about 25% versus 2019 and representing about a third of Booking.com\u2019s total room nights in Q2. We continue improving our alternative accommodation product globally with an additional focus on the U.S. market. In the first quarter, we launched partner liability insurance for our alternative accommodation supply partners with global coverage. In the second quarter, we launched enhanced payment solution for professional property managers in the U.S. and have made progress increasing adoption by our partners. Finally, we started rolling out the damage policy option for partners in the second quarter and have continued expanding this option to more countries in the third quarter. Each of these initiatives helps add important features to our alternative accommodation offering, which we believe strengthens our efforts to attract more properties and partners onto our platform. In the second quarter, we saw the largest sequential net increase in alternative accommodation properties since 2019 and we now have 6.6 million alternative accommodation listings on Booking.com. We are encouraged by the increase in alternative accommodation supply that we have seen so far this year and we aim to further build on this growth as we move through the second half of the year. Let me now talk about the progress we have made in our interrelated strategic priorities of payments and the connected trip vision. Of this, 38% of Booking.com\u2019s gross bookings were processed through our payment platform in the second quarter, which is our highest quarterly level ever. We continue to increase adoption of payments by our property partners, with over 60% of our total Q2 gross bookings coming from properties that have adopted payments. So, this means that about two-thirds of the bookings at payment-enabled properties are being processed via payments. We believe Booking.com\u2019s payment services drive benefits for both our travelers and our supplier partners across hotels, alternative accommodations, cars, flights and attractions. Furthermore, we believe that Booking.com\u2019s payment platform helps deliver a more seamless and frictionless booking experience, which are important elements of our larger connected trip vision. On the connected trip, I think it\u2019s a helpful reminder to talk to what we are hoping to achieve with this vision. Our vision for the connected trip strives to make booking and experiencing travel easier, more personal and more enjoyable while delivering better value to our customers and a way to provide marketing opportunities to our supplier partners. And as a result, we believe over time we will drive increase in customer engagement, share spend and loyalty. First, we are looking to increase the engagement of customers on our platform by solving more of our customers\u2019 travel problems than just finding the right accommodation of Booking.com as we have done in the past. A simple example of solving a problem and driving additional engagement would be proactively suggesting options for top attractions that can be booked seamlessly in our app while our travelers a destination and looking for something to do. Another example is our testing discounted transportation from the airport to the hotel for say a high-value accommodation customer. And the ground transportation supplier might in the future be providing a discounted price that is specific for our customer, because we are able to provide incremental business. Second, we see the opportunity to increase our share of customers\u2019 travel spend. We estimate that pre-pandemic, our customers\u2019 annual spend on Booking.com represented only about 25% of their total travel spend on average. We believe that by making it easier to book multiple elements of the trip in one place, we can take more part of that travel spend onto our platform. Even in core accommodations and even with top customers, we believe there are opportunities to improve our share of spend over time. And we want to increase customer loyalty and drive a higher direct mix through our app over time. We believe by addressing our customers\u2019 critical needs of value, choice and convenience through our connected trip vision we will deliver an improved experience and increase the likelihood that our customers come back to us again on a direct basis. This year, we continue to make progress as we work on building the foundation of the connected trip, including developing a flight offering of Booking.com. This flight offering gives us the ability to engage with potential customers who choose their flight options early in their discovery process and allows us an opportunity to suggest other services to these flight bookers. Flights continues to be a source for new customers with about one quarter or 4 of our flight bookers globally being new to Booking.com with an even higher share of new customers in the U.S. In conclusion, I am encouraged by our strong second quarter results and the record level of summer travel we are seeing now. Our teams are working hard to continue making progress in several key areas, including the app, the Genius program, our alternative accommodation offering, payments at Booking.com and building towards our connected trip vision. Through this work, we believe we are building a better offering for our customers and partners while strengthening our long-term competitive position. While there is uncertainty around the near-term macroeconomic environment, we are as confident as ever in the long-term growth of travel and in the opportunities ahead for our company. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden. David Goulden : Thank you, Glenn and good afternoon. I will review our results for the second quarter and provide some color on trends we have seen so far in the third quarter. All growth rates for 2022 are relative to the comparable period in 2019 unless otherwise indicated. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. Now, on to our results for the second quarter. Room nights in the second quarter were up 16%, a 25 point improvement from Q1 and our first full quarter of room night growth versus 2019. On our May earnings call, we discussed how we started off the quarter with a 10% increase in room nights for the month of April, which was a 14 point improvement from March. As we move into May, we saw further strength in room nights resulting in 22% growth for the month. June room night growth of 14% landed between April and May. For Q2 on a regional basis, room nights in Europe were up over 20%. The U.S. was up about 30%. Rest of world was up in the mid-teens, and Asia was down high single-digits with all regions improving from Q1 levels. The improvement from Q1 was helped by all regions with Europe and Asia contributing the most. Mobile bookings, particularly through our apps, represents about 60% of our total room nights in the second quarter. Our apps were over two-thirds of our mobile bookings and over 40% of total room nights, which was in line with the first quarter. In the second quarter, we continued to see an increasing mix of our total room nights coming to us through the direct channel versus Q2 2019 and versus Q2 2021. The international mix of our room nights in Q2 was about 45%, an increase from about 40% in Q1. Q2 international room nights were up mid single-digits compared to Q2 2019 levels, which was the first quarter of growth versus 2019 for international. And these international room nights drove most of the overall improvements in room night growth from Q1 to Q2. The improvement in international room nights we saw continue to be driven by travel within Europe and these cross-border room night bookings continue to have on average longer length of stay and a shorter booking window than comparable bookings in 2019. In Q2, we also saw an encouraging improvement in long-haul international room nights, which almost recovered to 2019 levels. We saw very strong growth in our domestic room nights in the second quarter, also an improvement from Q1. We were pleased to see our cancellation rates below 2019 levels in Q2. You will recall our Q1 cancellation rates were about in line with 2019. In Q2, the booking window of Booking.com moved closer to 2019 levels than it was in Q1, but remained shorter than 2019 across all major regions. The booking window expanded versus the second quarter of 2021. Our alternative accommodations of Booking.com, our room night growth rate was 25% in Q2 versus Q2 2019 and the global mix of alternative accommodation room nights was about 32%, which was about in line with Q2 2021 and a couple of percentage points higher than Q2 2019. Within Europe, our mix of alternative accommodations continues to be meaningfully higher than the global average. In North America, our mix of alternative accommodations remains low relative to global average. However, we did see an encouraging increase in mix versus Q2 2021 in that region. Q2 gross bookings of about $35 billion increased 38% versus Q2 2019 or 48% on a constant currency basis. The 38% increase in gross bookings was 22 percentage points better than the 16% room night increase due to 25% higher accommodation constant currency ADRs and also due to a few points from strong flight booking growth across the group partially offset by the 10 percentage points of negative impact from FX improvement \u2013 from FX movements. Our accommodation constant currency ADRs benefited by about 2 percentage points from regional mix and about 23 percentage points from rate increases across all of our regions, most notably in Europe and North America, especially in high-demand, leisure-oriented destinations. Constant currency ADR growth versus 2019 accelerated from 18% in Q1 to 25% in Q2 due primarily to higher rates in Europe. Despite the higher ADRs in the second quarter, we have not seen a change in the mix of hotel start rate levels being booked or changes in length of stay that could indicate that consumers are trading down. We will continue to watch these dynamics closely. Airline tickets booked in the second quarter were up about 190% versus a small base in 2019 and up 31% versus 2021 driven by the continued expansion of Booking.com\u2019s Fly platform. Consolidated revenue for the second quarter was $4.3 billion, which was up 13% versus 2019, up about 20% on a constant currency basis. Revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was about 275 basis points below Q2 2019, down more than our expectations due primarily to the timing differences between gross bookings and revenue recognition driven by stronger bookings than we expected in Q2. Our underlying accommodation take rates were about in line with Q2 2019 levels. Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense item, increased 27% versus Q2 2019. Marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings decreased by about 40 basis points versus Q2 2019, which is better than our expectations, mainly due to higher than expected marketing ROIs in a high-intent travel environment. Additionally, our direct mix was a little higher than we expected. Sales and other expenses were up 87% versus Q2 2019 due to a higher volume of merchant gross bookings and higher third-party call center costs. 38% of Booking.com\u2019s gross bookings were processed through our payments platform in Q2, up from 16% in Q2 2019. Compared with Q2 2021, sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings were up about 40 basis points, slightly better than our expectations of up 60 basis points. Our more fixed expenses in aggregate were better than our expectations, up 7% versus Q2 2021 primarily due to a slower-than-expected ramp-up in terms of our G&A and IT expenses. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.1 billion in the second quarter, which is better than our expectations. If we were to normalize for negative timing impact on revenue in the second quarter, our adjusted EBITDA would have been meaningfully higher than in Q2 2019. In addition, the changes in FX rates are negatively impacting the translation of our EBITDA to U.S. dollars. Our Q2 EBITDA would have been about 10% higher if FX were in line with Q2 2019. Non-GAAP net income of $776 million results in non-GAAP EPS of about $19 a share, which is down 19% versus Q2 2019. On a GAAP basis, we had operating income of $1 billion and net income of $857 million in Q2. Now, on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q2 ending cash investment balance of $14.2 billion was up versus our Q1 ending balance of $12.8 billion, primarily driven by $2.6 billion of free cash flow, partially offset by about $1.3 billion in share repurchases in Q2. The increase in free cash flow included a $2.1 billion benefit from change in working capital due to the increase in our deferred merchant bookings and other current liabilities, partially offset by the increase in our accounts receivable. We continue to return capital to shareholders and more recently have increased the pace of our repurchase given the pullback in our share price. In addition to the $1.3 billion of share repurchase in Q2, we repurchased another $840 million of our shares in the month of July, which brings our year-to-date repurchases to just over $3 billion and our outstanding authorization to about $7.4 billion. Given our recent increased pace of share repurchases, we now believe we will complete our current authorization in about 2 years from when we started the repurchasing back in January. Now on the recent trends occurred for the third quarter. Juliet room nights increased about 4% versus 2019 or about 7%, excluding Russia, Belarus and Ukraine. Growth fluctuated a bit in July and were strong in the second half of the month versus the comp we reached in 2019. ADR growth remained at Q2 levels, and gross bookings were up just over 20% in July, including some help from flights, partly offset by negative impacts of FX pressure. In July, constant currency gross bookings were up about 35%. Compared with June, growth rates in July moderated in all regions with North America showing the smallest change. In July, Europe room night growth was up mid-single digits and up low double-digits, excluding Russia, Belarus and Ukraine. Growth in the U.S. was up 25%. Rest of world was up low single digits, and Asia was down about 10%, all versus 2019. When thinking about the rest of Q3, we realized there continues to be volatility in the environment, and our commentary assumes that room night growth for the fourth quarter will be at the same level we saw in July. We do expect the strength in ADRs restore in July to continue for the remainder of the third quarter as well as continued strength in price and flight bookings. We expect the difference between the level of room night growth and gross booking growth for the fourth quarter to be a few percentage points less than the 22% it was in Q2 due to factors, including more FX pressure in Q3. We expect FX pressure gross bookings by about 12% in Q3. In July, the overall booking window Booking.com remained strong than it was in 2019, similar to Q2. We expect Q3 revenue as a percentage of gross bookings to be about 70 basis points lower than in Q3 2019 due to investments in merchandising, consistent with our prior commentary about the opportunity for us to lean into a recovering travel market in 2022 and due to an increase in the mix of flights and some impact from FX rates. We expect our underlying accommodation take rates to remain stable. We expect Q3 marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings will be slightly above Q3 2019 as we expect to invest in capturing demand and increasing awareness during the peak travel season. We expect Q3 sales and other expense as a percentage of gross bookings to be about 40 basis points higher than it was in Q3 2021 due to higher gross booking mix and higher third-party call center costs, including the impact of our partnership with Majorelle. We expect our more fixed expenses in aggregate will be about 20% higher than Q3 2021 with personnel up about 10% and both G&A and IT up meaningfully versus Q3 of last year. The year-on-year increase in G&A is driven by higher dual sales taxes, which are tied to revenue as well as increased personnel-related expenses due to return to a hybrid work environment. We expect IT expenses to increase year-over-year at a similar rate to what we saw in Q2. Taking all this into account, we would expect Q3 adjusted EBITDA to be slightly above Q3 2019. As I noted for Q2, the comparison of our Q3 EBITDA expectations to Q3 2019 is negatively impacted by changes in FX rates. At current exchange rates, we expect that our FX-neutral Q3 EBITDA growth versus 2019 will be about 15 percentage points higher than our expectation on a reported basis. We know there is a lot of interest in what will happen beyond the summer. Booking.com\u2019s gross bookings for the Q4 travel period are over 15% higher than they were at this time in 2019 but with a high percentage of cancelable bookings. The booking window is still shorter than it was in 2019, which reduces the amount of gross bookings that we expect on the books for Q4 at this time. The shorter booking window limits our visibility into Q4, and we recognize that conditions could change rapidly. Please note these Booking.com gross booking trends for Q4 period are on a euro basis. On a dollar basis, these growth rates would be about 10 percentage points lower. We are maintaining the full year EBITDA margin commentary we provided in February and May, and we still expect EBITDA margin for 2022 to be a few points higher than in 2021. As a reminder, timing mainly impacts adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA margins for the year. If it were not for the impact of timing, our expectations for the full year EBITDA margins would be a few points higher than our guidance for the year. As the year has progressed, we revised our allocation of our growth investments between marketing and merchandising. We now expect marketing spend as we\u2019re saying to gross bookings to be about the same as it was in 2019 and expect to spend more on merchandising. This higher merchandising, along with a higher-than-anticipated mix of flights and some negative FX impact, means we expect our take rates for the year will now be in the mid 14% range. Our underlying accommodation take rates remain about the same as we were in 2019. In conclusion, we\u2019re encouraged by our strong Q2 results and by the continued growth above 2019 levels we have seen in July. We remain confident that our focus on customer acquisition and our strategic priorities is the right approach for 2019 \u2013 sorry, for 2022. We will now take your questions. Michelle? Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Mark Mahaney of Evercore. Please go ahead. Mark Mahaney : Let me ask two questions, please: one long-term, one short-term. Long-term, how do you increase, Glenn, that your share of annual spend per customer? If it was 25% in the past, what do you think the best way to increase that is? And what\u2019s a reasonable number? Is it 50%? And then secondly, just near-term on the room night, so this deceleration from May to June and then continuing into Q3, could \u2013 is this \u2013 it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re seeing macro issues. So is that a comps issue? Or is it just that you\u2019ve had this really material recovery in travel and now that\u2019s starting to fade and become more \u2013 is starting to become more of a normal growth environment? So just what\u2019s your interpretation of why we\u2019re seeing that deceleration in the room night growth? Thank you. Glenn Fogel : Thank you, Mark. And question actually has some interrelated themes. So let\u2019s start a little bit with, I\u2019m going to repeat how happy I am. When we spoke last time, and I talked about April being the first month that we were able to say were recovered beyond 2019. And now we have a full quarter where we\u2019ve done very, very well. As you point out, very strong there. And yes, we see that there is been some moderation, but I will repeat, July gross bookings, 35% on a constant currency basis. That\u2019s pretty strong. And yet we know that the recovery is not fully done yet. We know there are countries around the world that are still somewhat inhibiting travel, making it more difficult. And we know we hear about people saying how hard it\u2019s been in some airports. We read about some of the travelers with cancellations and the crowds and you have to come 5 hours before on the airport, all these things. So, why the deceleration? Hard to say and we can all hypothesize about what that is and why and all that. But I do believe there is tremendous opportunity still in this recovery. And then going into your first question about what share we can get, that is something that we will get even more of because I believe in our future, the idea is that we know travel is going to continue to increase in the long run. We don\u2019t know how steady it will be. We know the volatility we see the last 2 years. This recovery is not a linear straight line up. They are ups and downs, up and downs. And now we have some economic things people are talking about and certainly what the mill pandemic. There is a war, as David pointed out, what things would have been without Russia, Belarus. Look, there is a lot of uncertainty in the short run that\u2019s understood, but the long run is fairly certain that travel will continue to increase. Our job is to continue to improve our products and our services so we get that higher share of our current customers get more customers and get a lot of their share to. How do we do that? All the things I talked about. I talk about building out that connected trip. I talk about making the app better. We talk about payments. We talk all things we\u2019re doing. And we\u2019re seeing us gain think that share and we see it has improved. Now what is the ultimate \u2013 what we talk 25 should that go? Somebody individual look, this is the average. Some customers, I\u2019m certain, were getting a huge amount of it, some customers less so. And it certainly depends on what kind of product our customers are looking for. And we\u2019ve mentioned in the past that we know in some parts of the world, our alternative accommodations, is not where I want to be yet. We\u2019re working on that to make that better. So sometimes uncertain customers say, I\u2019m going to use Booking.com this type of stay, and I\u2019m going to use some competitor for this other type of stay. That\u2019s an area we can do better and get more share. So I\u2019m not going to come back and say, my goal is x percentage but will come back and say, I absolutely we\u2019re on the right path, and we are growing that share, and we\u2019re going to continue to do that in the long run. David, anything you want to add to that? David Goulden : No. Mark Mahaney : Thank you, Glenn. Operator : Your next question comes from Justin Post of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Justin Post : Great. Thank you. It looks like your bookings-to-ad spend ratio was about 19.9% in Q2. That\u2019s up from 18.3%. So it looks like getting progress there, but maybe investing more in merchandising and that\u2019s impacting your take rate. Can you explain why you think this is the right strategy for the company shifting a little bit to merchandising? And then second, it does appear you could be gaining some share of room nights in the U.S. And just trying to think about how you think about those customers repeating. Do you have confidence that spending and getting market share is going to result in better repeat rates next year and you\u2019ll be able to keep those customers? Thank you. Glenn Fogel : Yes. So actually, your last question actually applies to the earlier part, which is part of our decision how we spend our money, whether it be dollars, euro again, whatever, how do we spend it? To point people to our platform and get them to buy something is factored by what do we think we\u2019re going to get in terms of the return. And when they return is, are they going to come back? Or else they going to come back? Are they coming back direct or not? Do they now make want to pay from the cannot? All of these types of things go into our calculations around our machine learning, all the science we bring in to try and decide what is the best use of the money? And we\u2019re looking, obviously, the markets are dynamic. I haven\u2019t used that word in a while, but we\u2019re going to use it today right now. These markets are dynamic. And whether it\u2019s a performance marketing market you\u2019re looking at or any other type of market in terms of what is the best way to put that money to work to get the best long-term value for our company. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing right now. And clearly, David pointed out that we\u2019re leaning more toward some merchandising right now because we believe that is the appropriate use of our money right now to get the best return in the long run for the company. And obviously, one factor is getting to come back again and again, and that\u2019s the important point in trying to make sure that we use the money correctly. Justin Post : Great, thank you. And maybe a follow-up, are you seeing higher repeat rates? I know it\u2019s early in the transition, but are you seeing higher repeat rates? Glenn Fogel : Well, I\u2019m going to say that we believe the repeat rates are appropriate for the money we\u2019re spending, and we\u2019re comfortable with how we\u2019re spending it. How about that? Justin Post : Great. Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley of UBS. Please go ahead. Lloyd Walmsley : Thanks. So you guys have talked in the past about looking to grow room nights in 2023 faster than what you were doing in \u201819. I guess, is that still your ambition? Does the macro make it harder to kind of expect that? And any kind of medium-term outlook you can share? And then secondly, recognizing there is a balance with using the margin for merchandising, but what is the latest update around payments margin, turning that to profitability maybe with FX translation or other value-added services? Are you guys starting to roll those out, thinking about it? What\u2019s the latest thought process and timing there? Thanks. David Goulden : Yes. Lloyd, let me take both of those. So our goal is absolutely to when we have a fully recovered marketplace, whenever that is, and that gets back to your question about 2023, will that be the case? We don\u2019t know yet. But our view is that when we get back to a more stabilized market growth level, at that point in time, we would expect to be growing fast than we were in 2019. That\u2019s still very much our strategy, our statement based upon the things that Glenn talked about moving forward with the product, building out the connected trip, having a more comprehensive offering and also doing more with payments, which gets back to the second part of your question. So that goal is absolutely out there. Our goal is to be growing on the top line and the bottom line faster than we were in 2019 when we\u2019re into a fully normalized recurrent market environment. So we believe that we can do that. In terms of where are we on the payments platform, we continue to be pleased with the progress that we\u2019re making. We expect to run our payments platform very close to breakeven this year. And we expect to start seeing some positive returns to the payments platform in aggregate in 2023. Some of that will just come through better economics in the core processing of payments, and some of that would be from starting to introduce in a bit more scale. Some of the payment-oriented products that we\u2019re currently experimenting rolling out, we\u2019re currently working on FX options for our customers, paying your own currency-type solutions, buy now, pay later type offerings. Those are the first two we\u2019re experimenting with in different markets right now. We expect to roll it out a little bit more fully in 2023. And the combination of that and some things will also add in 2023 on top of that will move us into a positive position relative to getting a return from payments platform next year. Lloyd Walmsley : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Kevin Kopelman of Cowen. Please go ahead. Kevin Kopelman : Great. Thanks a lot. Just follow-up on the marketing question, you talked about in the second quarter the kind of high-intent environment. Can you dig into that? Exactly you were seeing there that allows that add ROIs to outperform in Q2 and how has that trended into Q3? And then I have a quick follow-up. Glenn Fogel : Did you guys \u2013 he kind of broke up. David Goulden : No. I missed the last part, Kevin. How does that turn into and then you cut out? Kevin Kopelman : Sorry, so if you could dig into the high-intent environment that you described in the second quarter and how \u2013 what the drivers were and how that has looked into the third quarter. David Goulden : Thank you. Let me take that, Glenn, add some color. So we would please see the ROIs better than our expectation in the second quarter and to get some leverage on that marketing spend. It\u2019s obviously the biggest single line in our income statement. And we characterize it as a high-intent environment in Q2 because there is no single factor that kind of led to that. It\u2019s a multiplicity of things. As you know, the calculation of ROI is based upon many, many different variables. Some of the ones that made a difference to the positive in the second quarter, having a lower cancellation rate helped with ROIs. We saw some strengthening length of stays versus what we were expecting and also versus 2019. And some of the ADR trends also helped us. There are other factors as well. But I\u2019d point out those three as ones that certainly had a meaningful impact on the overall ROI environment. And just to a lot of people, a lot of volume in environment. And as we said, people were booking and they weren\u2019t canceling. That\u2019s going to be part of what we mean by high intent. In the third quarter, we still expect that to be the biggest travel season from a room state point of view. It always is. The market is still recovering. As Glenn said, it\u2019s not linear. But the trend line is certainly going up positively, which is what we like to see. And like last quarter, we think there\u2019ll be an opportunity to attract bookers to the platform. Bear in mind for a number of people still be a couple of years since they have made their last booking, and they may not automatically come back. So we\u2019ve got a regain some existing customers. There is the opportunity to win new customers in the peak travel season. So our plan is still to lean in as we said we would do at the start of the season. We expect, in total, that leaning in on marketing to be a little less impactful on the P&L than we did for the full year and been on our merchandising to be a little more, but we will still have both of them turn up pretty high in the third quarter. Kevin Kopelman : Great. And then a quick follow-up on the merchandising in the mix, how should we be thinking about that as a percentage of the mix? What is the kind of level you\u2019re looking at? And would you \u2013 as it\u2019s gotten more important, is this something you consider disclosing? David Goulden : Again, I missed the first part of the question. I think Glenn, did as well. I apologize. Kevin Kopelman : Apologies. So, could you give us a sense of merchandising, how big it could be in the mix or what you are envisioning? And then as it\u2019s become more \u2013 is it something you would consider disclosing? Thanks. David Goulden : Yes. Thank you. I got the question, merchandising. Obviously, it\u2019s something that we use selectively. We will think about further disclosure as it grows. Obviously, this year is something that we will \u2013 but think of it as something we are leaning into this year in a recovering marketplace, just like marketing. As and when things have recovered, we may not have to lead in quite heavily. So, we kind of see this may also fluctuate. We have not broken it out. Yes, it does obviously have a bit of an impact upon take rates. And probably the way to give you some flavor on it in the future is to give you a bit more flavor as to how it\u2019s impacting take rate, but nothing more to disclose at this point in time. Glenn Fogel : I would say one thing in turn generally in merchandise. But in general, when we talk about one of the values in the connected trip, and I mentioned in my prepared remarks about providing a marketing platform for suppliers to be able to do what they feel is appropriate in terms of maximizing their value and us providing them an opportunity to do their own way to merchandise and offer up different types of offers to our customers. And we will use all sorts of important scientific analysis of where it\u2019s really incremental for them. And that I believe is something that\u2019s going to be very helpful going and run, particularly if we are in a less of a hot market where everybody feels we can sell at maximum price. When things start getting a little more interesting, that will be another opportunity for us to provide value to our supplier partners. David Goulden : And just final, as we build out the elements of the connected trip, that gives us more ways to merchandise. At the moment, a lot of our merchandises through pricing type activity, but as Glenn mentioned, we are looking at providing incentives or other benefits to our high-value accommodation customers, if they are buying more elements of the total trip. So, the mix of how we merchandise on our side will also change over time as well. Kevin Kopelman : Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my questions. Good evening guys. So, just a couple I wanted to follow-up on. Pretty strong U.S. numbers and you are talking about the 30% growth and even the 25% growth in July. Maybe just talk to us about what are sort of some of the unique drivers around that U.S. business at this point. Are you seeing outsized Genius adoption? Is the merchandising having an impact there? Is air a disproportionate driver? Like what is sort of one or two of the key funnel drivers you are seeing in the U.S. for that type of growth is the first one. And then the second one, and maybe you said it, I know you guys gave so many helpful numbers. Can you just sort of talk to us about the growth rates you are seeing on cross-border travel versus intra-continental travel across the entire company? Thanks. Glenn Fogel : Sure. So, let me take the first one, and David can do the second one. I know he talked a little bit in what sort of details you want to give on that second one. On the first one, I will make the point that several years ago, I said that it was just hard for us to do better in the U.S. That would be a strategic priority for us to get more share we are under-indexed in the U.S. We felt we have a very good product, but now improve upon it. And that is something that we should be doing better we would. And now we are beginning to see some of that. We are seeing these kind of growth rates that you just mentioned, and that is something that I am very happy that the team has executed well. Now what is the silver bullet, there is no silver bullet. It\u2019s a lot of things. There is a tremendous number of different things being worked out by so many different teams. And I can \u2013 we can spend all through the rest of this call talking about all the things that have been done by the different people to improve so we can get higher share. And you have seen some of it yourself. You see our brand marketing. You see the things that we are doing in terms of app. You see us in terms of being payments out. We have Booking.com and have payments in the space, and we have that. And assuming those things is the blocking and tackling every day, working with the suppliers, achieving better relationships so that we work together so we can offer up to travelers something that really fits what their needs are. And I can\u2019t come out and help you in terms of \u2013 this is the biggest part, the next part and the next part. What I can say is that this is something that has been something that\u2019s been important to us, but I am glad to see the results starting to come through. It\u2019s not done by any way, shape or form. There is a lot more to be done, and I continue to repeat myself about we got to do better in the alternative accommodations in the states. Not enough people know about it, and we have enough supply and all those areas we want to improve upon there. And obviously, flights started up for Booking.com in the States and is doing well, but a lot more to do there. And all those things that connected trips. So, lots more to be done there, but that is an area where we are going to continue. As I said, it\u2019s one of our priorities, one of the things we are working hard on it. And I am happy to see to be able to show people, here is what the growth \u2013 the progress that we have made so far. David Goulden : Yes. Thanks, Glenn. Brian, yes, on international travel, Q2 is probably the best place to come look because we have got the full quarter numbers to talk about. International, that was the first quarter that we saw growth in international travel in total vis-\u00e0-vis 2019. So, in Q2, international travel in total was a mid-single digit growth. Of course, the room nights in aggregate were up 16 points. Obviously, domestic was still strong, very strong, but it was the first quarter we saw return to growth of international travel in aggregate. And to your point, within international travel, we saw better-than-average growth in the \u2013 within regional travel, so travel within Europe and Asia, etcetera. And the long-haul international travel was still down mid-single digits, but was \u2013 still was almost recovered back to 2019 levels. So, I think it\u2019s an encouraging trends as we move through the quarter. As I mentioned, in terms of the overall improvement from Q1 to Q2, international travel drove most of that improvement. Brian Nowak : Thank you both. Operator : Your next question comes from Doug Anmuth of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Doug Anmuth : Thanks for taking my questions. Glenn, can you just elaborate a little bit around your thoughts on ADR strength and the sustainability and just kind of how things get a little bit more interesting? I think as you said, in a potentially less hot market. And then, David, I just want to ask about payments. I think you said kind of close to breakeven this year, some positive returns in \u201823. Can you just talk about how you are kind of working through the initial dilutive nature there from a margin perspective? Thanks. Glenn Fogel : So, a couple of thoughts about ADR. Obviously, we talked about ADR, a very global average-type thing. But it\u2019s interesting, when you look around the world, it\u2019s not the same everywhere. In Asia, very different than what\u2019s happened in States, let\u2019s say, differences in Europe, too. It is interesting that in almost all the time I have been in the travel industry, when you had lower occupancy rates, that would usually end up with lower ADRs. People try to fill up those last rooms because the margin that would drop to the bottom line was huge. Yet, that is not what\u2019s happening here. You see occupancy rates, for example, in the States, still not at historical highs, yet we all know ADRs certainly are. And that\u2019s an interesting change from how they have been in the past. And now your question is a good one. Well, what\u2019s going to happen in the future? Are these things going to come back \u2013 are these ADRs going to come back down now at some point, if demand does drop, are we going to see that come back down, or are the hoteliers going to continue what they have been doing with us saying, look, I can\u2019t even service for all of my rooms. So, I am not going to try and fill them. But I don\u2019t want to know on labor or labor cost. It\u2019s better or doing better by doing this higher ADRs and not trying to fill everything. That\u2019s happening in some of the places. The truth is, nobody knows what\u2019s going to happen in the future. I do know, though, that we have flexibility ourselves, that we work well when there is \u2013 ADRs are high, as you have seen with the numbers we just printed, which is great. And also when ADRs are dropping because the suppliers need more demand, we are there to help them. We did better than most of the people in the industry coming straight out of the depth of the pandemic because we worked really hard with these suppliers to find a way to get the demand, and we did that. And that\u2019s really our role with them is to make sure we are putting heads and beds for them at the price that they think is right. And that\u2019s what we are going to continue to do. So, I can\u2019t tell you what\u2019s going to happen in the future. I can tell you, we will continue to execute well under either scenario. David Goulden : And Doug, on payments, I think that is not a new story. The fact that we are going to have some revenue streams that are going to be growing faster than the current average because they are newer and they will be less profitable from a profit margin point of view. We talked about payments of flights earlier during the year that are both going to be significant contributors to the business in the future will result in incremental EBITDA dollars \u2013 incremental EBITDA dollar growth, but will be dilutive to margin rates. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s anything new. And I think that\u2019s a good thing for the business. It means we will have faster EPS growth for having those businesses than we would without. So, I think it\u2019s a conversation we had a few times in the early part of the year and hopefully nothing new. We are making progress and getting payments into the position we talked we thought we might be able to go into 2023. So, I view that as encouraging. Doug Anmuth : Great. Thank you, both. Operator : Your next question comes from Naved Khan of Truist. Please go ahead. Naved Khan : Yes. Hi. Thanks a lot. Glenn, in the past, heat waves have hurt bookings. I go back to 2018, 2019, I think that has happened. And this year, do you think there is any impact on the heat wave or maybe flight cancellations in the July trends that you just shared? And just give us your thoughts on that. And then if we just look at the U.S. room night growth, how should I think about the contribution from get it room? Is that \u2013 how much of a factor is that? Glenn Fogel : So, I can answer the second one first because I heard that one well, and I want to go back and get that first question again. Again, we are very pleased with how it\u2019s working, very nice, but that is not a big driver at all in these numbers. So \u2013 and I will let David work sort of specificity, but I would say do not \u2013 that is not the \u2013 it\u2019s nice. It\u2019s good. I am very happy how we are doing. I am pleased. I love the guys, doing great. It is very helpful in our B2B strategic partnership area. Helping us build out that part of our business to be a very competitive part of the business with others too, it\u2019s one element. We had that part of the business for a long time before. This is just one addition to our overall B2B area. So, that\u2019s something I am there. I will let \u2013 David, do you want to say on that and get\u2026? David Goulden : Sorry. Fine. It\u2019s only a few points of incremental growth in the U.S. Glenn Fogel : Yes. So, if we can, can you say the first question because I think I heard flight cancellations. I am not sure what you said. Could you go back to? Naved Khan : Yes. It\u2019s really about if there is any impact from either the heat wave in Europe or flight cancellations that we are seeing in the July numbers, just give us some color. Glenn Fogel : Oh, I have got it now. Okay. So, it goes back to me trying to explain and talk about the non-linearity of the heats [ph] in January because yes, we see the change, and I talked at the beginning about that. And one hypothesis, certainly, somebody in the past, people have definitely talked about, well, when it\u2019s hot, people don\u2019t travel as much. That\u2019s true. There is definitely there that in there. And there certainly is the cancellation of the Air Force Macassar, and that probably played a factor too. There are a lot of things that are probably played \u2013 and we want to look at how strong May was. And did that take some bookings from July we ended up in May because people were just \u2013 as soon as the pandemic levels went down, and so I am calling it down. People say I am going right away and won they would have waited. There is so many potential hypothesis. I can\u2019t tease them all out. And in fact, I would say it\u2019s actually not that \u2013 it\u2019s not that important because we are talking for the long run, one month versus another month. In my mind, yes, I know there was going to be volatility in these things, variability. But we are looking at the long run. Are we achieving what we want to continue to open the long run, build this business? And we are doing that. And I see that. So I can\u2019t really help you on whatever guess is you would like yourself, but what\u2019s more important in my mind is are we executing, creating a better product, a better service that we will get more share as the travel recovery continues, which it is. And again, I emphasize this recovery from the pandemic is nowhere near done yet. When you look at countries like, in Japan, there are a lot of places where it\u2019s not where everybody isn\u2019t just traveling as they used to at all. In Asia, we mentioned Asia. It\u2019s not a full recovery yet. Look at China, lots of places where the pandemic has not totally disappeared. Everybody is living like they did in 2019 at all, but there is a lot of room to come back just from recovery, and we are looking forward to that. Naved Khan : Great. Thank you for your thoughts. Operator : Your next question comes from Deepak Mathivanan of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks for taking my question. This is Jack Halpert on for Deepak. I just wanted to ask, can you guys talk about any shifts in the consumer demand you are seeing between your alternative accommodations and hotels booking as things sort of normalized a bit from COVID? Thanks. Glenn Fogel : Well, I think we talked a little bit about what share of our business in the alternative accommodations now and how we saw a couple of percentage points better than 2019 to more accommodations versus hotels. That\u2019s steady improvement that we are pleased we are seeing. We talked a little bit about the U.S. and the mix there. It\u2019s still low in terms of the share that\u2019s going to internal accommodations, but we are pleased with the mix is improving. It\u2019s on the right path. I am not sure in terms of general, though I think I know your question is, is this going to be \u2013 are people going back to where they formerly had done a lot more hotels and are they going to switch back there? I don\u2019t think anybody knows or not. But what I emphasize is how important it is to offer both. And that\u2019s why we think we have an advantage because we know, and I mentioned this in previous calls, we know people come to our site thinking they want one type of accommodation, yet we see by the way they search and the way they look at different potential places to stay, that there is actually a lot of uncertainty. And by offering both a hotel and a home or apartment or avail, whatever it is, we are providing better information to the travelers to be able to make the right choice and have a higher opportunity that they will buy from us because we are offering these different types of services. So, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen in terms of people\u2019s behavior going back. I can guess. I think that people who have enjoyed a home they never get before, they are going to continue to look at that home. And I am fine with that because we offer it. So, it\u2019s okay by me if that\u2019s what\u2019s happening. What I would like to do, of course, is make our home products be top brand \u2013 be as good as anybody else\u2019s and make sure that nobody ever says, I gave you all of that, here are some things you don\u2019t have yet. That\u2019s something I want to get rid of. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from Lee Horowitz of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Lee Horowitz : Thanks for the questions. Two, if I could. Can you comment at all on how hotel attach rates are pacing for your air product relative to your expectations and how you think about continuing to improve those from here? And then just one on costs, if I could. Just given the directional commentary you have given us on fixed costs for this year, looking beyond this year, how do you think about the kind of sustainable level of fixed cost growth into a more normalized demand environment? Thanks so much. Glenn Fogel : Well, I will take the first one. I will let David do the second one. And what we have said, and it hasn\u2019t changed, what we said in the past is that we are a meaningful percentage of bookers who first book a flight then book an accommodation. And we are saying for new customers, we see that an encouraging percentage of them are attaching an accommodation to the flight booking, which is what I said in the past and I will say the same because it\u2019s pretty much the same. And David, on your side? David Goulden : Yes. On my side, obviously, the base element in our fixed cost is personnel. And in recent years, with the current inflation rates and obviously wage inflation, that has been pressured particularly for tech and technology people and product people, the marketing folks, etcetera, engineers. So, that\u2019s been under pressure for a little while. We believe that when we get back to this post-COVID steady state and we get to the situation where we are gaining share, growing top line faster than we used to grow in the bottom line faster than we used to, we believe that we can start looking at the right time of getting leverage from our fixed costs. But at the moment, we are obviously facing some short-term pressures. Lee Horowitz : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, I will now turn the conference back to Mr. Glenn Fogel for closing remarks. Glenn Fogel : Well, thank you. So, after the difficult situation in the last 2.5 years, we are very pleased to arrive at where we are today.

And now I'd like to introduce Booking Holdings speakers for this afternoon, Glenn Fogel and David Goulden. Please go ahead, gentlemen. Glenn Fogel : Thank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings' third quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. I am encouraged by the strong results we are reporting today and by the record level of travel during our peak summer season. In the third quarter, our customers booked 240 million room nights, a little under 0.25 million room nights, which was 8% higher than in Q3 2019. We saw an improvement in room night growth during the third quarter from 4% growth in July to 10% growth in both August and September relative to the comparable months in 2019. We note that sadly, the war in Ukraine continues. And as you know, we suspended our operations in Russia and Belarus shortly after the work we get. If we exclude the suspended areas as well as Ukraine, our room night growth for the quarter would have been 11%. We are pleased that all of our major regions improved in August and September versus July and room nights in Asia surpassed 2019 levels for the first time in September. In the U.S., both our Priceline and Booking.com brands continue to execute well and contributed to room night growth of almost 30% in the third quarter versus the third quarter of 2019. We continue to see very strong accommodation of ADR growth, which helped drive a 27% increase in global gross bookings in the third quarter or 41% on a constant currency basis, both versus Q3 2019. Despite the strong pricing environment, we have not seen evidence of our customers trading down to lower hotel star ratings or reducing the length of their trips. We took another important step in our company's recovery from a profitability perspective with the third quarter being the first time that adjusted EBITDA surpassed pre-pandemic levels. In fact, the third quarter was our highest revenue and adjusted EBITDA quarter ever. Our Q3 revenue and adjusted EBITDA were 20% and 7% higher than Q3 2019 and grew 34% and 25% on a constant currency basis. More recently, we have seen resiliency in the level of demand from travelers with room night growth improving slightly from September levels to about 12% growth estimated for the month of October versus October 2019. Gross bookings in October are estimated to be up about 30% or just over 45% on a constant currency basis. The slight improvement in October was primarily driven by the continued recovery in Asia as well as a slight improvement in Europe. As we take an early look at demand into 2023 at Booking.com, we see strong growth in gross bookings on the books for travel that will take place in the first quarter of next year, though I note that a high percentage of these bookings are cancellable. Interestingly, we have strong numbers on our books for early 2023 despite the booking window being shorter than it was at this point in 2019. David will provide further details on our results and on the recent trends we have been seeing. While there is a rising concern around the macroeconomic environment and uncertainty around the consumer spending, we believe the sustained level of demand we have seen through October helps demonstrate our consumers' strong desire to travel further. We believe our solid operating results, substantial liquidity and strong free cash flow positions us well to navigate potential near-term economic uncertainty while we continue our work attracting customers and partners to our platform and making progress on our key strategic priorities of payments and the connected tradition. Given our confidence in the positioning of our business, the positive long-term outlook for travel and our strong balance sheet, we have stepped up the pace of our share repurchases since we reinitiated the program at the start of the year. With a $4.2 billion in repurchases for the first 3 quarters of this year, we have reduced our share count by 5% relative to our ending share count last year. We remain focused on building a better experience for our customers and addressing their needs of value, choice and convenience. With continued focus on our customers, we aim to increase loyalty, frequency, spend and direct relationships over time. We are encouraged to see our unique active customers at Booking.com above 2019 levels in the third quarter, which was driven by strong growth in reactivated customers who had not made a booking it over a year as well as growth in repeat customers. Our mix of customers booking directly on our platforms reached its highest third quarter level ever. Our goal over time is to further increase our direct mix through several initiatives, including continued efforts to enhance the benefits of our genius loyalty program, further building out our connected vision to increase engagement with our customers and driving more of our customers to download and utilize the mobile app. The mobile app is an important platform as it allows us more opportunities to engage directly with travelers and ultimately, we see it as the center of our connected trip vision. About 45% of our room nights were booked through our apps in the third quarter, which is just over 10 percentage points higher than in 2019. Booking.com app remains the number one downloaded OTA app globally according to a third-party research firm, and we have seen increasing levels of downloads in the U.S. We will continue our efforts to enhance the app experience to build on the recent success we have seen here. We're thinking about addressing our customers' need for value, we believe providing attractive prices on accommodations is very important. As has always been the case, our first priority, as we think about providing attractive prices, is to source competitive rates from our supply partners. We do this by working closely with our supply partners to get the best prices possible and increase participation in our targeted rate programs to ensure that compelling prices are available to our customers. Our Genius loyalty program at Booking.com is a great example of a program where hundreds of thousands of our property partners are participating to offer lower rates and other benefits to travelers in ways that meet our property partners specific revenue needs. In addition to sourcing dependent rates directly from our partners, we have built up our ability to selectively offer discounts and incentives at Booking.com over the last few years. Visibility to merchandise is another lever that we can now pull as we look to deliver value to our customers to more competitive pricing. We believe this competitive tool helps us attract and retain customers and drive improved conversion on our platform. Importantly, we take a disciplined approach to merchandising by very closely monitoring the incremental return on investment on that spend, and we can adjust the level of our spend according to our desired return objectives. We have been pleased with the levels of incremental return we have seen this year for merchandising and we'll continue to selectively utilize this tool going forward. For our supply partners, we strive to be a valuable partner for all accommodation types on our platform by delivering incremental demand and developing products and features to help support their businesses. Alternative accommodations of room night Booking.com grew about 11% versus 2019 and represented about 30% of Booking.com's total room nights in Q3. We have continued to make progress with our alternative accommodation offering by increasing our supply base of properties, which has grown by about 300,000 since the end of 2021 and has increased in each of our major regions around the world over that time period. We aim to build on this growth in our alternative accommodation supply base by improving our product offering to our supply partners globally with a continued focus on the U.S. market. Let me now talk about the progress we have made in our interrelated strategic priorities of payments and the connected trip vision. On payments, 40% of Booking.com's gross bookings were processed through our payment platform in the third quarter, which, once again, is our highest quarterly level ever. We believe Booking.com payment services drive benefits for both our travelers and our supplier partners across hotels, alternative accommodations, cars, flight and attractions. Furthermore, we believe that Booking.com's payment platform helps deliver a more seamless and frictionless booking experience, which are important elements of our larger connected tradition. One the connected trip, our long-term vision is to make booking and experiencing travel easier, more personal and more enjoyable, while delivering better value to our customers and supplier partners. We are expanding our offering into travel verticals other than the combinations, and then we'll work to link relevant travel components together to provide a more seamless, flexible consumer experience. As a result of this initiative, we believe, over time, we will drive increases in customer engagement, share of spend and loyalty to our platform. We continue to make progress on building foundations that we connect provision, including our work to integrate ground transportation options and further develop our flight offering on Booking.com. This flight offering gives us the ability to engage with potential customers who choose their flight options early in their discovery process. And over 20% of all of our flight bookings globally are new to Booking.com. There is much more work to do as we strive to give our customers the best possible trip experience, but we are pleased with the early results we have seen so far. In closure, I'm encouraged by our strong third quarter results and the sustained levels of travel demand we are seeing into the fall and into early next year. We continue to make progress in several key areas, including engagement with our app, the Genius program, our alternative accommodation offerings, payments at Booking.com and building towards our connected tradition. I believe these initiatives will help us deliver a better offering and experience for our customers and our partners. While there continues to be uncertainty around the near-term macroeconomic environment, we are as confident as ever in the long-term growth of travel and in the opportunities ahead for our company. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden. David Goulden : Thank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I'll review our results for the third quarter and provide some color on the trends we've seen supply in the fourth quarter. All growth rates for 2022 are relative to the comparable period in 2019, unless otherwise indicated. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. Now on to our results for the third quarter. In the third quarter, we were encouraged to see room night growth improved to 10% in both August and September, up from the 4% room night growth we previously reported for the month of July. All regions improved in August and September relative to July. For the full third quarter, global room night growth was 8%, with Europe up high single digits, the U.S. up almost 30% and Rest of World up over 10% and Asia down mid-single digits. And September was the first month of room night growth in Asia versus 2019 as the delayed recovery continues in that region. Our mobile apps represented about 45% of our Q3 total room nights, an increase of slightly over 40% in the second quarter. Total mobile bookings represented over 60% of our total room nights in the third quarter, also an increase from the second quarter. In the third quarter, we continue to see increasing mix of our total room nights turning to us to our direct channel versus 2019 and also versus Q3 2019 and also versus Q3 2021. The international mix of our total room nights in Q3 was about 45%, in line with Q2. Our Q3 cancellation rates continue to be below 2019 levels as they were in Q2. In Q3, the booking window of Booking.com remain shorter than in 2019, similar to what we saw in the second quarter of 2022. This booking window expanding meaningfully versus the third quarter of 2021, where we saw a higher mix of near-end bookings due to the COVID-19 Delta variant wave. For our alternative accommodation in a Booking.com, our room night growth rate was 11% in Q3 versus 2019 and the goal mix of alternative accommodations was about 30%, which is slightly higher than Q3 2019. Q3 global mix was about in line with 2021. Q3 gross bookings increased 27% versus 2019 or 41% on a constant currency basis. The 27% increase in gross bookings was 19 percentage points better than the 8% room night increase due to 28% higher accommodation constant currency ADRs and also due to 4 points from strong flight growth bookings across the group, partially offset by the 14% points of negative impact from FX movements. Our accommodation constant currency ADRs benefit by about 2 percentage points from regional mix and about 26 percentage points from rate increases across all of our regions, most notably in Europe and North America. Despite the high ADRs in the third quarter, we have not seen a change in the mix of wholesale star ratings being booked or changes in length of stay that could indicate that consumers are trending down. We'll continue to watch closely. Airline tickets booked in the third quarter were up about 235% versus a smaller base in 2019 and up 45% versus 2021, driven by the continued expansion of Booking.com's flight offering. Revenue for the third quarter was over $6 billion, which was up 20% versus 2019 and up about 34% on a constant currency basis. Revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was about 110 basis points below Q3 2019 due to a number of factors, including investments in merchandising, which are consistent with our prior commentary about the opportunity for us to lead into a recovering travel market in 2022 and also due to an increase in the mix of flights, the slower recovery of our advertising and other revenues, which have no associated gross bookings and some negative impact from FX rates. Q3 take rates were down more than our expectation of being down about 70 basis points, primarily due to timing differences between gross bookings and revenue recognition, driven by the improved bookings in Q3, some of which relate to travel in future quarters. Our underlying accommodation take rates were about in line with Q3 2019 levels. Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense item, increased 27% versus Q3 2019. Marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings was about in line with Q3 2019, which was better than our expectations, mainly due to higher-than-expected direct mix. As expected, our marketing ROIs were lower than in Q3 2019, which was in line with our strategy to lead into a recurring travel market in the Q3 peak season. Sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings were up about 40 basis points compared to Q3 2021, which was in line with our expectations. About 40% of Booking.com's gross bookings are processed through our payments platform in Q3, up from almost 1/3 in Q3 2021. Our more fixed expenses in aggregate were better than our expectations of 17% versus Q3 2021, primarily due to a slower-than-expected ramp into our IT expenses and lower-than-expected personnel expenses. Adjusted EBITDA was $2.7 billion in the third quarter, which is better than our expectations and about 7% above 2019 and would have been about 25% above 2019 on a constant currency basis. Non-GAAP net income of $2.1 billion results in non-GAAP earnings per share of about $53 per share, which was up 17% versus Q3 2019. On a GAAP basis, we had operating income of $2.6 billion in Q3. We recorded GAAP net income of $1.7 million in the quarter, which includes a $336 million unrealized loss on our equity investments, primarily related to Meituan as well as $125 million expense related to an ongoing French tax matter. Now on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q3 ending cash investment balance of $11.8 million was down versus our Q2 ending balance of $14.2 billion, primarily driven by about $2 billion in share repurchases in Q3 as well as the unrealized losses on our equity investments. The $2 billion in share purchases in Q3 was a step-up from the $1.3 billion in Q2 as we increased the pace of our repurchases given the pullback in our share price. In October, we repurchased another $595 million worth of our shares, which brings our year-to-date repurchase up to about $4.8 billion and our remaining outstanding authorization to about $5.6 billion. As Glenn mentioned, we reduced our share count by 5% since the end of last year. And over the last 5 years, we reduced our share count by 20% despite suspending our share buyback activity for 21 months during COVID-19 pandemic. With negative $95 million in free cash flow for the third quarter, our earnings for the quarter were offset by about a $2 billion decrease in our deferred merchant booking balance following the peak travel season in Europe and North America. Now on to recent trends on our fourth quarter. We estimate that October room night increased about 12% versus 2019, a slight improvement from the 10% growth in September, driven primarily by the continued recovery in Asia as well as a slight improvement in Europe. In October, all regions were above 2019 levels. The U.S. was of almost 35%, Rest of World was up high teens, and both Asia and Europe were up high single digits. ADR growth has remained around Q3 levels, and we estimate gross bookings were up about 30% in October, which includes negative impacts from FX pressures. We estimate that constant currency gross bookings were up just over 45% in October. While there continues to be uncertainty in the near term, our comments for the quarter make the assumption that room night growth for the fourth quarter will be about 10% above 2019, which is in line with levels of growth we've seen over the last 3 months. Compared with room night growth in Q4 versus 2019 would also be an acceleration on a year-on-year basis from 31% growth in Q3 2022 versus Q3 2021 to 39% growth in Q4 '22 versus Q4 '21. We expect the strength in ADRs we've seen in recent months to generally continue for the remainder of the fourth quarter as well as continued growth in by bookings. We expect about a 15% difference between the level of room night growth and gross booking growth, less than 19% gap in Q3 due to more FX pressure in Q4. We expect FX to pressure gross bookings growth versus 2019 by about 18% in Q4. We expect Q4 revenue as a percentage of gross bookings to be about 120 basis points lower than Q4 2019 due to investments in merchandising, an increase in mix of clients and negative impact from timing differences between gross bookings and revenue recognition. We expect Q4 marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings to be a bit higher than in Q4 2019 as we expect to continue to invest in capturing demand and increasing awareness due to continued global recovery of travel demand. We expect Q4 sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings to be about 40 basis points higher than Q4 2021 due to higher merchant gross bookings mix and higher third-party call center costs, including the impact of our partnership with Majorelle. We expect our more fixed expenses in aggregate will be about 20% higher than in Q4 2021, with personnel, G&A and IT each up similar percentage year-on-year. Taking all into account, we expect the Q4 adjusted EBITDA to be over $1.1 billion. If it were not for the impact of FX, we expect Q4 adjusted EBITDA to be above Q4 2019. We are maintaining our full year adjusted EBITDA margin commentary and still expect EBITDA margin for 2022 to be a few points higher than in 2021. And if not for the impact of timing, our expectations for the full year adjusted EBITDA margins would be higher by another few points. For the full year, we expect our revenue as a percentage of gross bookings to be just over 14%, lower than our prior expectations for mid-14% range, due primarily to timing differences between gross bookings and revenue recognition, driven by stronger bookings than previously expected, some of which are related to travel expected to occur in 2023. Compared to the 15.6% take rate in 2019, the expected take rate in 2022 includes almost a full point of noted impact from timing, about 40 basis points from a slower recovery in advertising and other revenue, which have no associated gross bookings and about 30 basis points from increased mix of flights. The benefit to take rates in 2022 from increased revenues associated with payments is offset by our increased investments in merchandising, each of which impacts our reported take rates by about 1% in 2022 compared with about 0.5% each in 2019. These changes in payment revenues and merchant costs versus 2019 are mainly on Booking.com. Looking forward into window months, the booking window continues to be shorter than it was in 2019, which means that we would expect lower levels of future stays already on our books. Given this, we are pleased that the gross bookings we've already received at Booking.com for in Q1, up about 25% in euros versus the same time in 2019. Of course, we note that high percentage of these bookings are cancellable. While this represents a relatively small percentage of the total revenue we record in Q1, we think it's a helpful early data points to share. In closing, we're pleased with our Q3 results and the trends that we're seeing into Q4 and early into 2023. We remain confident that our strategic priority is the right ones and will enable us to provide better travel services for our customers and partners. We'll now move to Q&A. And Sylvie, can you please open the lines? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question will be from Lloyd Walmsley at UBS. Please go ahead. Lloyd Walmsley : All right. Two, if I can. First, it sounds like you're not seeing any consumer weakness right now, but are there any actions you're thinking about taking or approaches to the cost to batten down the hatches ahead of what could be a tough year from a macro standpoint? And maybe help us think about fixed cost growth and marketing posture for next year? And then second one would just be, can you give us an update on payments monetization and profitability? I appreciate some of the added disclosure you gave us this quarter. But maybe where are we in the rollout of FX translation? And how should we think about impact of that on take rates and profitability maybe over the next year or so? Glenn Fogel : Lloyd, why don't I take the first one. I'll let David talk about payments, then add anything he wants in terms of fixed cost going forward. So obviously, we are very pleased with third quarter and we are very pleased with what we're seeing, albeit it's small numbers into the first quarter. David just talked about that 25% on the books in Europe in euros, I'd like to see that. Your question is, is there anything we're seeing from consumer sentiment or on expanding some macro that may be inhibiting growth or be hurt in the future? And something that's very hard to know is what's the counter factual. And we're doing well measure would be if all these terrible things that we read in the newspapers have not been happening, how much better would it be? I can't measure that? I don't know. What I do know, though, is that we are seeing good numbers, and we're pleased with where we are. We know that we've been through bad times in the past and were able to do very well. We've made adjustments where we've had to. I've been now in this company for 23 years almost. We've had some recessions and we have some real disasters. And we have managed this company extremely well steering it through some very stormy weather and being able to adjust. So many of our expenses are variable, so we can adjust very quickly and we adjust automatically almost as volumes change. But I'm feeling good right now, albeit the world can change any time, and I'll let David now talk to you want to say about specifically fixed expenses and also about payments. David Goulden : Yes. Thank you, Glenn. I just point that about two-thirds of our expenses are variable, which is caused a very important starting point. We, of course, do look at the fixed payments costs very carefully, but just put that into context. And then also just to clarify, the 25% is actually a Booking.com global number, not just Europe, it's around the whole business. So I think Glenn said what we need to say about the expense side. We will -- we have an agenda to move forward, we really want to continue enhancing our products and services and obviously, that requires continued investments and movement towards further important payments that the connected trip. Relative to the payment platform, of course, we are pleased with the progress. We did give you some additional delay, as you mentioned. So you get a feel for what the revenues are for payments now, also you get a feel of what the corresponding expenses are in sales and others that offset those revenues. Because as we said, this year, we're running the payments platform at about breakeven when you look at revenues and you subtract the sales and other expenses. What I'll also tell you is that relative to 2019, payments is having about 0.5 basis points or about 0.5 point impact on our EBITDA margins as that mix of revenue has increased our breakeven or at mix revenue has increased. Now of course, back in 2019, we actually weren't a breakeven, but the combined impact of where we were to where we are now is about 0.5 point of headwind on our margin, but of course, is giving us additional capabilities. Going forward, room night has not changed. So we do expect to turn to profitability in that combination of payments platform, a combination of revenues, less sales and expenses in 2023. We are rolling out FX and other services on a market-by-market basis. And of course, testing levels we always do before we continue to push them further. We have an exciting road map. It's a multiyear road map for payments. I don't expect anything to change very rapidly in the course of 12 months, it will be a course of multiple years. But if you look at the sources we can provide for our business today in terms of reducing friction for customers and bookers and then we can look at how payments can really help underpin the factor in the future, we're very encouraged and excited about it. I think with the additional disclosure we give you today will be help have a more constructive dialogue upon how it's doing going forward against those benchmarks. Operator : Next question will be from Brian Nowak at Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Brian Nowak : I have two. I appreciate the color on the U.S. almost growing 30%. I guess -- the question on the U.S. as you're sort of looking at the different regions of the globe from a profitability perspective, can you just help us understand where you are at this point from the U.S. from a profit contribution perspective? Or is it still sort of very much in investment mode to drive growth? And how do you think about the path to making that a more -- a more profitable region for the company? And the second one, I'm going to mispronounce it. It's a Majorelle and Majorelle, I apologize. David, can you just talk us again about how do we think about the puts and takes or potential tailwinds of that arrangement into 2023 to the P&L? David Goulden : Okay. Brian, we can take in reverse order. So Majorelle, you're very close, is basically, from a P&L point of view, this year is just moving around geography because always going through a transition phase, I think we mentioned that about $25 million of personnel expense quarter and about $6 million of G&A expense a quarter move out of those lines respectively and into sales and other. And that started in June 1. Essentially, starting in Q3 and Q4, you see the full impact of that. As we mentioned, the policy Majorelle does have some cost benefits to it, but really most about flexibility. It's about our ability to flexible down quickly, respond to different market needs, different pictures of languages. So over the longer term, compared to continuing to build out ourselves, there are some cost benefits and it'll start occurring in 2023. We haven't quantified yet. We'll think about whether it makes sense to try and quantify the middleware for you next year. But again, it's not the primary driver. So I'm not saying there are no cost managers. That's not why we entered into that partnership. What we sell says the partnership is working exceptionally well. We just completed the summer period, and our customer service results were also solid under the new regime because we did keep some folks ourselves. On the U.S., well, of course, we are growing. So we're investing. I mean it's no big surprise. We haven't broken out contribution margin dollars in different regions. We don't plan to do that. But obviously, we're investing in the U.S. to grow a position, which is continued to increase. And as that increases over time, we'll be able to deliver higher profitability for it. But we're not -- we're not any way this leaves with what we're doing in the U.S. And obviously, it's a market where people do make money, and we do too, just maybe not the same rate as the market we're not investing in price heavily. Operator : Next question will be from Kevin Kopelman at Cowen. Please go ahead. Kevin Kopelman : Just a follow-up on the marketing spend. Could you characterize how you see the competitive environment right now on advertising channels over Q3 and quarter-to-date? How that compared to earlier in the year and maybe also compared to 2019? Glenn Fogel : One, I just mentioned in general and then if David want to state specific. Look, marketing for travel is always extraordinarily competitive. It's never not competitive. No matter what channel you're spending your money, it's competitive. And we're always trying to make the right judgment and how much money to spend, what we think the ROI is going to be and looking into it for the long view in terms of what this does in terms of our overall building the franchise. I can't give any specifics in terms of up and down. David can talk about percentages of the amount of marketing spend we've been doing versus gross bookings over the last couple of years. But again, the market is never less competitive. It's always competitive, and I think we have performed very, very well regardless. Glenn Fogel : Go ahead, Kevin, please. Do you have the second question? Kevin Kopelman : Just a kind of a separate follow-up on investment levels. Can you talk about just how headcount has been trending? Kind of what you're doing now in terms of hiring? And any color on how that looks over the next year? David Goulden : Sure. Just to finish up on Glenn's point on the market environment. Remember that we did say that our ROIs were a little lower this last point in Q3, as we expected. We targeted lower ROIs obviously that we chose to drive ourselves to continue to lean into the recovery. Also remember, our ROIs were actually, in fact, higher in the first half than they were in 2019. So you have a little bit in that context. Investment levels, we continue to be -- I'd say, we continue to want to invest in the business. But of course, we do recognize some of the backlog factor. We're not going to pull back anything strategic from what we want to do if we have a short-term slowdown. But of course, we are looking at how many people we add and where we are to make sure we are them against the things that really matter most for the business, as you would expect us to do. Operator : Next question will be from Mark Mahaney at Evercore. Please go ahead. Mark Mahaney : Two questions, please. Can you talk about how you have been able to drive up that mobile app usage? There's obviously got great benefits for the business model. But how have you been able to do it? And just -- I know you'd like to get it higher. How much higher? What's realistic for how much higher it could get? And then if you could, please double-click on the flights business? And where are you now in terms of rolling that out and to how many markets, how broadly used is it or how high is the awareness of the product? Just talk about what the growth path is just for those flights product. Glenn Fogel : Mark, so you're very right about the importance of the mobile app, and I say that every single prepared remarks call we do, I always mentioned it's an important part of our platform. How we are doing is by creating a great experience for the people who are using it. That's the same thing we all think you're trying to get somebody uses provide a great experience will come back and they'll tell all the people, et cetera. We're not necessarily doing anything really different than anything anyone else does, but just doing it well. In terms of when do -- what would be the top level for it? That's hard to say because as the people who create these mobile devices continue to prove upon it and people find it more advantageous to use that versus their desktops, it's hard to say, but it could be an extremely high number that people go to the mobile device. Now our job is to make sure people use our app use mobile web search where we have to pay, which is one of the key things. We mentioned, I think, over 60% of our business was going in mobile, but 45% is at the app. So obviously, we want to make anybody using the mobile device. We want them to use the app is how to direct them. Regarding flights, I should have checked countries. I haven't done that recently. It's an awful lot, but some of the areas is a relatively low amount because there's very little awareness. I think, for example, I give you an extreme. I know we brought up Pakistan, not that long ago, not a lot of flights yet in Pakistan, but we are getting out there. The key thing for us again is creating a better experience. And I'll be honest with you. Our flight product is not yet, what I would say, as good as it should be. We continue to improve upon it, make it better than it's been in the past, providing the features that some other of our competitors offer up to consumers that we don't do yet that we want to offer. So there's a lot of upside left in this, I think a tremendous amount of upside. And the numbers are still, while we like the growth rates, it's still relatively small. Operator : Next question will be from Justin Post at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Justin Post : Great. One for Glenn. Obviously, merchandising, I think you all at a one point headwind, payments might be offsetting. But can you explain why you think that's a good thing to do? Is it training the consumer? Is this something you have to comp next year? Why do you like that aspect of the business? And then maybe for David, assuming we don't have a real unusual year for travel. As you think about the unwind of the timing differences and the added marketing spend this year, how do we think about those kind of unwinding next year? And then maybe last, if you want to call anything about 1Q. I remember, I think we had a real COVID slow start to the quarter and then bookings really accelerated in March. If there's anything unusual in Q1 we should be thinking about. Glenn Fogel : So I'll talk a little bit about merchandising. A couple of things. First thing is, so can be an investment that we're making, a way to bring in customers, retain customers or ways that we feel it necessary to be competitive against other OTAs or our suppliers even. The fact is that we're always looking where to spend the money at the best return. And merchandising, if we see somebody else is off in a lower price, we recognize that one of the most important things is to give a competitive price, and we need to make sure that we're offering that up to the customer. Many times, we want to do my talk with our supplier partners and making sure they bring us as I said in the prepared remarks about bringing us the most competitive prices. But if for some reason is not available, and we feel a need, we'll put money in there to make sure that our customers like to at Booking.com and we'll provide them with a great place to do their travel bookings. That's one. Second thing is I want to make sure everybody understands that merchandising doesn't always mean a discount by us. It can mean lots of things. People offering up some other type of benefit, for example. Although it if somebody were to offer up a upgrade in a room, I'll consider that a merchandising technique to do. If somebody offers a free breakfast at the hotel, I'll consider that too. We're not paying for that breakfast, it's the free breakfast. So parts of ways to do lots of levers to play. That's one of the things we think is so important is making sure that we are providing the most competitive offering out in the space and in addition, being able to use all of our investments in the right way at the right time to get the right return. And as a lot of data to see where is it best to be put out. I'll let David go with the other two questions. David Goulden : Yes. Thanks, Glenn. Yes, in terms of -- just as looking forward, on the timing side, I mentioned the timing is costing us about 1 point of take rate this year. We think we have most of that back next year, maybe not 100% of it. There probably be some timing impact. But again, it's really a function of what the growth rates look like going into and going out of the year, but assume we get most of that back. On the marketing and merchandising side combined, that's where we've been leading in this year to really take advantage of a recovering marketplace. We certainly will be deleveraging on those lines further next year. But we want to see really what the market looks like in terms of how much recovery there is left to get it sort of recovering interact travel recovery. There are a few things that have not yet gone back to where they were before. So we'll look at exactly what the right level of investment is. And if we feel that we continue to gain share, we believe we're gaining this year, we believe we gained share last year. We share gains in outlets we have that we may maintain those levels for a while until we get back to a more normal market growth rate. And we'll give you more thinking on where we are on that spectrum when we get together in February we completed our planning process for the year, and we've got a bit more visibility into next year. And then finally, on your Q1 question, yes, Q1 last year was unusual. Omicron was really having an impact. We'll have to see exactly what happens the different variants that are out there this year. We wanted to give you that stats about 25% more gross bookings on the books. For next year, we had the same half of '19 for the first quarter of 2020 as a way to understand the book is building quite nicely for Q1. Obviously, there's a lot of ground to happen between now and their store represents a relatively small percentage of what we'll do in total in Q1 for revenue, but we think it's a -- it's a positive stat. And if a stat we gave out a couple -- actually for the last two quarters and the number was more like 15% forward growth, not 25% and in both cases, the revenue for the quarter wound up being a fair amount higher than our early indicator as those books built. Now again, don't forget -- I'm talking about the euro number, just to be clear, was 25%. Operator : Next question would be from Doug Anmuth at JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Doug Anmuth : I have two. I know you indicated you're not seeing hotel trade down or shortening of trips. I just wanted to clarify, is that the case across all geographies? And do you have any more relative stability in the U.S. versus other regions? And then secondly, how should we think about ADR growth? I know you said it continues to be strong. But as you look into '23, just factors around FX and any relevant mix factors and like-for-like potential pressures as well? Glenn Fogel : So Doug, I'll start with the hotel trading down stars or I have not seen anything in any sort of geographical area that would anything stand out differently. We're seeing people who want to travel to have a significant amount of savings over this COVID period and they want to travel and some are even traveling longer to stay and enjoying it regardless of what the economic situation is. So we -- I have not seen anything and David, you saw I would say anything that where you talk about what we're seeing for ADRs going forward, I'm not sure we've said we were going to say publicly. David Goulden : Yes. On the mix -- on the trade down, Doug, as you mentioned, we're not seeing that in Europe to be perfectly clear because that's where sometimes people are asking the question, but we're not seeing global either. So it's just not factor, but particularly, it's also not a factor in Europe either. On the ADRs that we got some takes into next year, we'll talk in constant currency because it's difficult to know exactly how exchange rates are going to move on us. We're not really -- so the 28 points of constant currency ADR mix we saw in Q3, and we saw continued roughly same level into October was 26 points from rates and only 2 percentage points from mix. So as ADR continues to rebound, we'll lose that 2-point of mix, which is really what's driving right now, the fact that Asia had a lot of mix down it used to be. So that will go away. But obviously, most of what we're seeing is rate driven. And as we talk to our property partners, they continue to be facing the same expense pressure and inflation pressures that made people face you in terms of utility, energy, labor, et cetera. So we'll see how the environment develops and we have no other color on that to give at this point in time. We'll update you again when we get to February, if we see anything differently. Operator : Next question will be from Eric Sheridan at Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Eric Sheridan : Maybe a few, if I can, on the alternative accommodation space where you made some interesting comments there. When you think about supply growth, are there any areas of either geographic focus or mix or types of properties or types of duration stays that are levels of target for supply growth as you look out into '23 and beyond in terms of alternative accommodations? Is there any color also you can give us on, as you have more of that type of supply to show that the consumer what that might do to either a traffic conversion or ROI in the platform as you have a wider array of inventory to show the consumer? And the last piece for you, is there any element of either mix or size of the business you're sort of thinking about in terms of striking the right balance between traditional inventory and alternative accommodation inventory over the long term? Glenn Fogel : So Eric, basic concept for us has always been more is better, more supply is better and it's always the consumer's choice of what they want to stay, where they want to stay. They want to stay in a home or villa, apartment or a hotel, that's it. So in terms of overall, we do need to continue working hard at getting more supply of all types. I've talked many times in the past about our need for the single property, the home specifically that we need to build. I talk geography. I've always talked about we need to build in the U.S. even better. And one of the things is creating a better onboarding experience for people who own these properties, improving the payments for these people, coming up with ways they feel better about having some may stay in their property with an insurance type property. These are something that we have been working on that we brought out, and we're going to continue to roll things out down the road to make it better for the owners and the managers of these properties to be willing to put it up on our platform. Now I believe the -- and this is what we've seen over many, many years is that as we bring more and more supply in, that will help us build the business. And I absolutely think that this is something that is not some is going to require some rocket science or some great thing that can't be invented. People are doing this. We just need to continue to work on it, put people to work, create the things necessary, and we will roll this out on the is taking longer than I would like, but I am very pleased with where we are. And I think some of the numbers that we've talked about are encouraging. Operator : Next question will be from Naved Kahn at Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Naved Khan : Glenn, I think you mentioned you see opportunities to enhance the experience in the mobile app. Can you give an example of what kind of things we could see there? And then I don't know if you guys updated us on the mix of urban and cross-border any stats that would be pretty helpful. Glenn Fogel : I'll let Dave talk about stat you want to revolve about urban or. But in term of the app, I'll give you one right off the bat that I think is a -- and again, I look at it as a traveller, I say, what am I missing? Why am I not getting this? Something is simple as, as you know, we have attraction, so we're building that up right now. But in destination, I need to have things being popping up on my screen from our app, telling me great things to do, maybe the discount or skip a line, things that will make somebody say, \"Gee, using Booking.com for this travel experience is much better because I'm getting so much more.\" And I can go through so many different examples of that. The great thing about the mobile app is in people's hands or in their pocket book or in their pocket, they're carrying it with them. And that gives us the connection to be able to provide better service, better things to do, better value. And that's why it's such an important part of this connected trip vision. David, I don't know if you want to give anything from any steps? David Goulden : No sense on the note to say that historically, is we've had a heavier weight of mix urban not. So as recovery continues, if people go back to cities and other locations that usually is a positive for us, but no stats on mix. On cross-border, we did tell you that we're back up to 45% of our bookings now in the third quarter. For international, that's down from a little over 50% on a pre-pandemic basis. So there's still some decent recovery left there to we had as things continue to normalize back to where they were. Operator : Next question will be from Lee Horowitz at Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Lee Horowitz : Two on margins that -- margin, if I could. When you think about margins beyond this year, how does the strength in direct and applicants impact the way you think about the long-term margin profile of the business, particularly with some of your growth initiatives like flights having lower margin than your core could direct end of offsetting these headwinds in the fullness of time? And then when you think about the shape of margins perhaps next year, how it all should we be thinking about APAC being potentially a source of premium growth impact in the overall margin profile of the business in 2023? David Goulden : Yes, Lee, I really try to talk about 2023 margins today. That's really a conversation for next February, but maybe longer term, is a place to have to kind of recap on what we're thinking and save the 2023 commentary for them. So as we said, the -- our strategy here is to build a better product and service for customers and partners. So they'll come back to us more frequently and more directly. And obviously, our direct mix is super important and direct mix is tied heavily to frequency and to people who do more with. People who bought a buy multiple things from us are much more likely to come back to us directly in the through the pay channel. So yes, of course, there are some headwinds to our volume profile because of our business mix changing and is changing from almost the pure accommodation business, having a higher mix of payments, a high mix of flights and those are of course lower margin businesses, we've had that conversation before. But most important thing we can do to kind of keep our margins in a strong position is to continue to drive that mix of direct up, and that will impact all parts of the business. But as we said before, we'll be industry-leading profitability and margins. Because of the mix factors, we do not have a -- we believe that medium term, the margin will be a little bit lower than they were in 2019, but we'll have a faster growing business with more EBITDA, more earnings per share that's growing faster than the top line and bottom line, we think that's the most important thing. Operator : Next question will be from Mario Lu at Barclays. Please go ahead. Mario Lu : The first one is on the room night guide in the fourth quarter, the 10% for 2019. I guess, can you talk a little bit more about what you saw in October? Did the trends within the month get worse as we exited the month? Just trying to tie that 10% versus 12% in October? . David Goulden : So yes, sure. The 10% room night guide, it's -- it's really a framework what we give you for Q4. There's still a lot of volatility. And obviously, we can't predict exactly what's going to happen to room nights in November and December, given the back were out there. But what we did was say, look, we grew -- we've been growing at 10% increase up to 12%. It's a nice round number to kind of pin our commentary to with Q4 to explain to you what the shape of the P&L might be. It does not indicate that there was a slowdown at the end of October. In fact, room night growth was fairly linear at 12% throughout the entire month of October. So it's more of a framework than it is a hard guy. But of course, we give you a number to kind of think about when building your models, but it's not reflective of anything we're seeing in October, either slowing down or speeding up. It's just a way to think about the shape of the income statement and how things might look in Q4. Mario Lu : And then just one on alternative combinations. You guys mentioned as a percentage of total, it's around 30%, slightly higher than 3Q '19. I guess, are there any low-hanging fruit or opportunities ahead to kind of increase this percentage over the next couple of years? Glenn Fogel : Well, I mean, we could easily increase that if we didn't do so well in hotels. It's one of those things where we think of this holistically, we want to get more bookings, as I mentioned earlier. This is really a case where the consumer makes the decision, not us. We think one of the great advantages of our platform is that we offer all the different types of accommodations. And we have seen the data where people come to our site. And the first thing they're looking at may be one type of combination, let's say, hotel. They end up booking with a home because they saw that in the search results and they were going back and forth looking around. It's really so that we're very pleased to have that ability to offer up all the types of accommodations to the customer. So I don't see anything to try and artificially try and drive more people to the alternative accommodations necessarily a thing that's going to increase the value of the company. I think providing the customer with what they want, what they need, what they think is best for them is really the right way being consumer-centric and really driving that is the best way to build the company. Operator : Your last question will be from Stephen Ju at Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Stephen Ju : So Glenn, your unit growth commentary in the U.S. was actually very interesting. So can you talk about the relative size of your user base for Booking.com in the U.S. versus, say, Priceline? And presumably booking continues to grow, do you think it's necessary to support both brands longer term. And if you were to take one step out and zoom out more globally, there was always a sharper line in the sand between the consumer experience on booking and? Or do you think as you do more merchandising and connected trips, should we be thinking about a unified brand position under Booking.com? Glenn Fogel : Yes. So let me talk in general about why we have different brands. We have different brands because they offer a different user experience to the consumer and the different things that they are aiming to do different strategies. We really -- we totally understand the issue of are we calling excess cost? Are there ways to save money by doing things that are not duplicative? So we are -- we understand that. We are working all the time looking at those things that we can try and improve upon. But at this time, I do not see any reason I'd want to separate out and say, well, we're going to at one of these and just go under one brand. Some of our competitors have done that. And to me, that may be there -- our strategy is to continue with the differentiation among these brands and continue to build them out the way they're doing them. In terms of the actual North U.S. for Priceline versus booking, I don't believe we never disclose anything of that nature. So I think we're going to sit tight with that and keep going the way we are. Operator : At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Fogel. Please go ahead. Glenn Fogel : Thank you. And I want to thank our partners, our customers, our dedicated employees and our shareholders. We appreciate your support as we continue to build on the long-term vision for the company. Thank you, everyone, and good night. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this does indeed conclude your conference call for today. Once again, thank you for attending. And at this time, we do ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

And now I\u2019d like to introduce Booking Holdings\u2019 speakers for this afternoon, Glenn Fogel and David Goulden. Go ahead, gentlemen. Glenn Fogel : Thank you and welcome to Booking Holdings\u2019 fourth quarter conference call. I am joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. I am pleased to report a strong finish to 2022 as we delivered fourth quarter revenue and adjusted EBITDA of approximately $4 billion and $1.2 million respectively, which were both ahead of our previous expectations. Room night growth versus 2019 of 10% in the fourth quarter improved from 8% growth in Q3. And for the first time, we saw room nights across four of our major regions above 2019 levels for the quarter, which was another important milestone for our recovery. Room night growth trends have further strengthened in 2023, with January room nights up 26% compared to 2019 or up about 60% year-over-year. We are very encouraged by the continued strength and resiliency of travel demand last year and into the new year which speaks to consumers\u2019 strong desire to travel. However, as we stated last year, month-on-month trends can be volatile and we recognize that there is uncertainty regarding the future path of the world\u2019s economy. And David will provide further details on our fourth quarter results and on the recent trends we have been seeing in 2023. Looking back at the full year of 2022, I am proud of our company\u2019s performance during what was a challenging and very competitive environment. Our customers booked an all-time high of nearly 900 million room nights on our platforms in 2022, which was an improvement of 52% versus 2021 and 6% higher than in 2019. Gross bookings of $121 billion exceeded the $100 billion mark for the first time in our history and increased 58% versus 2021 and 26% versus 2019 or 73% and 36% on a constant currency basis. These are record levels per room night and gross bookings were achieved despite travel restrictions still in place in many parts of the world at the onset of 2022. And I note that most of Asia did not begin to open until towards the end of the year and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine negatively impacted our business. In terms of our P&L last year, we reached a new revenue record of slightly more than $17 billion, which was 56% higher than 2021 and 13% higher than 2019 or up about 71% and 24% on a constant currency basis, respectively. We achieved this strong top line result while improving our profitability with adjusted EBITDA of $5.3 billion, increasing 82% versus 2021 and margins expanding by 4 percentage points year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was 10% below the 2019 levels. However, on a constant currency basis, it was actually 6% higher after accounting for the FX headwinds we faced in 2022. I believe these results demonstrate that we are making significant progress against our goal to build a larger and faster growing business that generates more earning dollars than it did prior to the pandemic. While there is more work to be done to achieve this long-term goal, I am encouraged by the progress we have seen so far. Regarding our long-term outlook for travel, we are pleased with the positioning of our business and are positive about the future. This, coupled with our strong balance sheet, led us to return $6.5 billion to shareholders during 2022 by purchasing our shares. At year end, our share count was 8% lower versus the prior year and returning capital to shareholders will remain a high priority for the company going forward. David will provide further thoughts on our approach in his remarks. In addition to our strong financial results in 2022, we made meaningful progress against the key strategic priorities that I highlighted on our earnings call 2 years ago. These are expanding payments at Booking.com, building out our connected trip capabilities, and strengthening our position in the U.S. market. Let me address the progress we have made in each of these areas. On payments, in the fourth quarter, we processed 42% of Booking.com\u2019s gross bookings on a merchant basis and are pleased with our progress in this area. As mentioned in the past, moving Booking.com\u2019s model from agent to merchant drives important benefits for both our supplier partners and our travelers. For our supplier partners, offering a payment solution adds value in several key ways, including providing access to additional traveler demand by enabling alternative payment methods, reducing cancellations, decreasing operational workloads and enabling fraud protection. For our travelers, Booking.com\u2019s platform allows many consumers to pay how they want to pay and we believe ultimately helps deliver a more seamless and frictionless booking experience. On the connected trip, on our long-term vision is to make booking and experiencing travel easier, more personal and more enjoyable, while delivering better value to our traveler customers and supplier partners. We have expanded our offering into travel verticals other than accommodations with a focus on flights. And in the future, we will work to link relevant travel components together to provide a more seamless and flexible booking and travel experience. We believe that as a result of this initiative and the improved consumer experience we will drive increases in customer engagement and loyalty to our platform over time. We have continued to make progress on further developing our flight offering on Booking.com, which is now available in over 50 countries. This flight offering gives us the ability to help our consumers book another important component of their travel in one place on our platform and allows us to engage with potential customers who choose their flight options early in their travel discovery process. We continue to see that over 20% of all of our flight bookers globally are new to Booking.com. We will continue this important work to provide our customers the best possible trip experience we can offer. In the U.S., both our Priceline and Booking.com brands continue to execute well and contributed to U.S. room night growth of almost 30% and gross bookings growth of about 60% in 2022 versus 2019. On our volume and consumer spend basis, we have grown our U.S. business to be meaningfully larger than it was prior to the pandemic. And we believe that our growth rate has outpaced the recovery in the broader market for U.S. accommodations, which means we believe we gained market share. At Booking.com, we have taken steps to improve our offering in the U.S. by utilizing marketing to improve awareness of our brand, introducing and ramping up our flight target, scaling adoption of payments and working closely with our combination partners to ensure we are delivering incremental value to them. We are encouraged by our achievements in strengthening our positioning in the U.S., but there is much more work ahead as we continue to execute against this priority over the long-term. In terms of our core accommodation business, we continue to drive benefits for our traveler customers and for our supply partners. For our supply partners, we strive to be a valuable partner for all accommodation types on our platform by delivering incremental demand and developing products and features to help support their businesses. For example, as I mentioned earlier, payments brings an important benefit to our partners. In the area of alternative accommodations, Booking.com alternative accommodation room nights for the full year grew about 56% versus 2021 and about 11% versus 2019 and represented about 30% of Booking.com\u2019s total room nights. During the year, we made progress with our alternative accommodation offering for the full spectrum of property types by rolling out an enhanced payment solution for professionals, launching partner liability insurance, introducing a damage policy and piloting request-to-book functionality, which is an important feature for some individual partners. We have seen improvements in the time to first booking and better retention rates for new partners. At the same time, we are incorporating our alternative accommodation offering in some of our recent brand advertising to help raise awareness, customer awareness of this product. We aim to build on this progress by continuing to improve the product offering to our supply partners and travelers, particularly in the United States. We remain focused on building a better experience for our customers and increasing loyalty, frequency, spend and direct relationships over time. Our mix of customers booking directly on our platforms reached its highest level ever in the fourth quarter. Our goal over time is to further increase our direct mix through several initiatives, including continued efforts to enhance the benefits of our Genius loyalty program, further building out our connected trip vision to increase engagement with our customers and driving more of our customers to download and utilize the mobile app. The mobile app is an important platform as it allows us more opportunities to engage directly with travelers. And ultimately, we see it as the center of our connected trip vision. About 45% of our room nights were booked through apps for the year, which is about 13 percentage points higher than in 2019. For 2022, Booking.com\u2019s app remained the number one downloaded OTA app globally, and for the first time, moved into the number one position in the U.S. according to one of the leading third-party research firms. We will continue our efforts to enhance the app experience to build on the recent success we have seen here. We believe providing attractive prices on accommodations, is very important as we aim to deliver value to our travelers. Our first priority, as we think about providing attractive prices is to work directly with our supply partners to source competitive rates. In addition to sourcing competitive rates directly from our partners, we have built up our ability to selectively offer discounts and incentives at Booking.com over the last few years. This ability to merchandise is another lever that we can now pull as we look to deliver value to our customers when we cannot directly access the most competitive pricing. We have been pleased with the levels of incremental return we have seen in 2022 from merchandising and we will continue to selectively utilize this tool going forward. In conclusion, I am encouraged by the progress our teams have made in delivering strong results in 2022, while executing against our key strategic priorities. These initiatives will help us deliver a better offering and experience for our customers and partners which strengthens both sides of our marketplace. We are as confident as ever in the long-term growth of travel and the opportunity ahead for our company. Now, before I turn the call over to David, I want to share the news that David has let us know that he plans to retire from his role as CFO in early 2024, after which he will be involved with us for up to 2 more years to help initially with the transition and then with other projects and initiatives as needed. As you can see by this timeline, he is not going anywhere for quite some time. So now, let me turn the call over to David. David? David Goulden : Thank you for those comments, Glenn. And as you said, I am not going anywhere for some time over the next year in my CFO role and when involved beyond that, I will remain as focused as ever on continuing to help deliver strong results from the business and creating value for our stakeholders. Now turning to our results. I will review our results for the fourth quarter and provide some color on the trends we have seen so far in the first quarter and our thoughts on 2023. All growth rates for 2022 are relative to the comparable period in 2019, unless otherwise indicated. All growth rates for 2023 are on a year-on-year basis unless otherwise indicated, but we will be making some references to the comparable periods in 2019 where we think these are helpful. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. Now on to the fourth quarter. We are encouraged to see room night growth of 10% in the fourth quarter, up from 8% room night growth in the third quarter, with the improvement driven by Asia and the U.S. For the fourth quarter, the U.S. was up more than 35%, rest of world was at 110%, and Europe and Asia were both up mid single-digits. Q4 was the first quarter of room night growth in Asia versus 2019. Our growth in total room nights on a year-on-year basis increased from 31% in Q3 to 39% in Q4. Our mobile apps represented over 45% of our total room nights in the fourth quarter and about 45% for the full year. We continue to see an increasing mix of our total room nights coming to us through the direct channel. The direct channel increased as a percentage of room nights in the fourth quarter and for the full year relative to 2021 and 2019. The international mix of our total room nights in Q4 was about 48%, which was higher than Q3, but still a few percentage points below Q4 2019. Our cancellation rate was slightly above 2019 levels in Q4, but were slightly below 2019 levels for the full year. In Q4, the booking window of Booking.com remained shorter than in 2019 similar to what we saw in the third quarter of 2022. This booking window expanded meaningfully versus the fourth quarter of 2021 when we saw a higher mix of near-term bookings during the COVID-19 Omicron variant wave. For our alternative accommodations at Booking.com, our room night growth rate was about 15% in Q4 versus 2019 and the global mix of alternative accommodation room nights was about 29%, which was a couple of percentage points higher than Q4 2019 and Q4 2021. Q4 gross bookings increased 32% versus 2019 or 47% on a constant currency basis. The 32% increase in gross bookings was 22 percentage points better than the 10% room night increase due to 29% higher accommodation constant currency ADRs and also due to 5 points from strong flight bookings across the group partially offset by 15 percentage points of negative impact from FX movements. Our accommodation constant currency ADRs benefited by about 1 percentage point from regional mix and about 28 percentage points from rate increase across all our regions. Despite the higher ADRs in the fourth quarter, we have not seen a change in the mix of hotel star ratings being booked or change in length of stay that could indicate that customers are trading down. We continue to watch these dynamics closely. Airline tickets booked in the fourth quarter were up about 2.9% versus a small base in 2019 and up about 61% versus 2021 driven by the continued expansion of Booking.com\u2019s flight products. Revenue for the fourth quarter was up 21% versus 2019 and up about 35% on a constant currency basis. Revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was about 130 basis points below Q4 2019 and was about in line with our expectations. Our underlying accommodation take rates were about in line with Q4 2019 levels. Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line, increased 32% versus Q4 2019. Marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings was about in line with our expectations and with Q4 2019. Sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings were up about 40 basis points compared with Q4 2021 and was in line with our expectations. About 42% of Booking.com\u2019s gross bookings were processed through our payments platform in Q4, up from about 30% in Q4 2021. Our more fixed expenses in aggregate were up 24% versus Q4 2021, which was higher than our expectations primarily due to changes in FX in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was over $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter, which was 3% below 2019 and would have been around 16% above 2019 on a constant currency basis. Non-GAAP net income of $957 million results in non-GAAP EPS of about $25 a share, which was up 6% versus Q4 2019. On a GAAP basis, we had net income of over $1.2 billion in the quarter, which included a $240 million pre-tax gain related to the sale of our office building for Booking.com\u2019s future headquarters in a sale leaseback transaction as well as $179 million unrealized gain in our equity investments, primarily related to Meituan, JD and Grab. When looking at the full year, we are pleased to report that our 2022 room nights were 6% higher than 2019 and our gross bookings were 26% higher and about 36% higher on a constant currency basis. Our full year revenue was over $17 billion, which was 13% above 2019 and up about 24% on a constant currency basis. Full year revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was 14.1% in 2022, which was lower than the 15.6% in 2019 due to almost a full point negative impact from timing, about 40 basis points from the slow recovery in our advertising and other revenues, which have no associated gross bookings and about 30 basis points from an increased mix in flights. The benefit of take rates in 2022 from increased revenue from payments was offset by our increased investments in merchandising, each of which impacted our reported take rates by about 1 percentage point in 2022 compared to about 0.5 percentage point each in 2019. These changes in payments revenue and merchandising costs versus 2019 are mainly at Booking.com. Our full year adjusted EBITDA was about $5.3 billion, which was 10% below 2019 and up about 6% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 31%, which was 4 points higher than our EBITDA margin in 2021 and better than our expectations for a few points higher at the start of the year. Now on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q4 ending cash investment balance of $15.2 billion was up versus our Q3 ending balance of $11.8 billion driven primarily by the $3.6 billion bond offering we completed in Q4, the $2.1 billion of free cash flow generated in the quarter, and about $600 million in proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction I mentioned previously. This increase in our cash balance was partially offset by about $2.3 billion in share repurchases in Q4 and by the payment of about $780 million in November debt maturity. For the full year 2022, we generated almost $6.2 billion in free cash flow, which was 38% higher than in 2019. We repurchased over $6.5 billion of our shares in the year and reducing our year end share count by 8% versus 2021 and by 22% over the last 5 years. We are proud of this accomplishment, because it reflects both our commitment to return capital to shareholders and how carefully we have managed our stock-based compensation expense and its dilutive impact. We continue to see many publicly traded companies pro forma out the very real expense associated with stock-based compensation. We strongly disagree with this approach, and therefore, every profit metric we report includes the negative impact of stock-based compensation expense. We view SBC expense as a very real cost of doing business across every stakeholder should fully count when evaluating the performance and returns of our business or any business. If anything, we view SBC dollars even more valuable than cash dollars because of our long-term expectation that dollars worth of stock to-date will be worth more in the future. It\u2019s the same expectation that serves as the rationale for pursuing our share repurchase program, a program that has meaningfully reduced our share count over time has not just served to offset dilution from SBC. Simply offsetting dilution does not represent a return on capital to shareholders, but actually represents a cash drain on our business that does not get counted in many companies\u2019 pro forma reporting of profits. In 2022, our stock-based compensation resulted in less than 0.7% of shareholder dilution. And during the last 5 years, it resulted in less than 3% of cumulative dilution. As I mentioned, during the same period, we reduced total share count by a net 22%, inclusive of the shares that were added as a result of our stock-based compensation activities. Our future practices will continue to be guided by the same two philosophical approaches that guide us decades, namely, number one, the stock-based compensation counts; and two, that our stock repurchases, first and foremost, are meant \u2013 are actively meant to return capital to shareholders in the form of share count reductions. In January, we started to sell down our investment in Meituan and completed the sale of our position in February. Total proceeds of $1.7 billion from the sale, represents a $1.2 billion or over 250% increase in the value of our regional investments. On an after-tax basis, we expect this to increase our available cash position by about $1.4 billion. Our business partnership with Meituan continues. As we think about our capital structure and allocation framework going forward, we are focused on growing returns for our shareholders whilst appropriately investing in our business and maintaining our strong investment grade credit ratings. We will target maintaining a gross leverage ratio of about 2%, which is about in line with the historic levels. On a net leverage basis, we have started to run the business with negative net leverage. However, we plan on moving gradually through addition our positive net leverage targeting about 1x net leverage over time. We believe managing our capital structure with these targets will allow us to maintain our strong investment grade credit ratings whilst also generating additional capacity for returning capital to shareholders as our EBITDA increases. Given these considerations and our current outlook for the business, we expect our annual total return on capital to shareholders to be at least equal to our free cash flow over the next few years. In 2019, we started the year with $4.5 billion remaining under our share repurchase organization that was approved in the prior year. And in the second quarter 2019, our Board of Directors approved a new $15 billion authorization. Since the start of 2019, we repurchased the full $4.5 billion under prior authorization and have repurchased $11.1 billion under the $15 billion authorization, leaving us with $3.9 billion remaining at the end of last year. We are announcing today that our Board of Directors has approved a new share repurchase authorization of $20 billion that we will begin utilizing after we complete the current authorization. We expect to complete the share repurchases under the cumulative $24 billion authorization within the next 4 years, assuming that travel continues to recover and grow from here. Before I turn to 2023, I\u2019d like to remind you we will primarily compare 2023 with 2022. However, there will be some periods where a comparison to 2019 will be helpful to better understand the trends of the business. For example, comparing January 2023 versus 2019 helps avoid the distortion created by \u2013 from comparing to January \u201822, which was negatively impacted by the Omicron variant. As you recall, our January 2022 room nights were 21% below 2019, but it\u2019s quickly improved and February was in line with February 2019. So, now on to recent trends and our thoughts for the first quarter of 2023, in January, we booked over 95 million room nights, our highest monthly amount ever and about 10 million more room nights than our previous monthly record set last May. January 2023 room nights were up 60% on a year-on-year basis. This compares to Q4 2022 room night growth of 39% on a year-on-year basis. When comparing January 2023 with January 2019, room nights were up 26%, a very nice improvement from the 10% growth in the fourth quarter of 2022. This improvement in growth rates versus 2019 from Q4 January was driven primarily by Europe, rest of world and Asia. January room night growth versus 2019 was about 35% in the U.S., over 25% in Europe and rest of the world and over 20% in Asia. In January, we saw lower cancellation rates versus 2019. Additionally, we have seen the booking window fully normalized back to 2019 levels in January. And in some regions, it has expanded as we see a healthy mix of near-term bookings as well as bookings to stay late in the year. We also continue to see no change in the mix of hotel star rating levels being booked or changes in length of stay that could indicate that customers are trading down despite ADRs continuing to be higher than in 2019. The average length of stay of transaction booked in January continued to be a bit longer than it was in 2019. January likely saw some benefit from bookings that were made in the month \u2013 instead of December last year or potentially later in this year. This may indicate the room night growth could moderate from these levels going forward as some of these booking pattern differences normalize. On a year-on-year basis, January gross bookings were up 74% or up 83% on a constant currency basis. The 74% increase in gross bookings is 14 percentage points higher than 60% room night growth due to 13% higher constant currency ADRs and also due to a few points from flight booking partially offset by 9 percentage points of negative impact from FX movements. Gross bookings in January were up 55% versus 2019 or up 72% on a constant currency basis. While there continues to be uncertainty around the month-to-month trends, our comments for the first quarter made the assumption that room night growth for the fourth quarter will be over 30% year-on-year. Compared to 2019, this will be just over 20%, assuming some moderation in growth from what we have seen over the last few weeks. We expect Q4 gross bookings to grow about 4 percentage points faster than room nights on a year-on-year basis due to about 6% higher constant currency ADRs and a couple of points from continued flight bookings partially offset by about 6 points from FX. We expect Q1 revenue as a percentage of gross bookings to be about 10.3%, a 40 basis point improvement from Q1 2019 due to a less negative impact on timing, partially offset by increased investments in merchandising and a higher mix of clients. We expect Q1 marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings to be slightly lower in Q1 than in Q1 2022 due to increase in direct mix. Marketing and merchandising combined, as a percentage of gross bookings in Q1, will be a little higher than in Q1 2022, but for the full year, we expect them to be about in line with last year. We expect Q1 sales and other expenses as potential gross bookings to be about 30 basis points higher than in Q1 2022 due to higher gross merchant bookings mix and higher third-party core costs, including the impact of our partnership with Majorelle. We expect our more fixed expenses in Q1 to grow just over 20% versus Q1 2022 due to higher personnel and related expenses, indirect taxes and IT expenses. Taking all this into account, we expect Q1 adjusted EBITDA to be over $600 million, which will represent a more than 93% increase versus Q1 2022. As we think about the full year ahead, we\u2019re encouraged by the strong trends we\u2019re seeing in Q1 so far. However, we do expect continued volatility in our top line trends, which makes it very difficult to predict how the top line will progress during the year and how the full year will turn out. Assuming a moderation in growth from current levels and taking into account the more difficult comparisons as we move through the year, our full year commentary assumes low-teens gross booking growth versus 2022. Of course, it\u2019s early in the year, but this is our best estimate at this point in time. For the full year, we expect our 2023 revenue as a percentage of gross bookings to be about 50 basis points higher than in 2022, which will result in year-over-year revenue growth is higher than our year-over-year gross bookings growth. We expect the negative impact on timing to mostly go away in 2023, and we also expect that our payments mix will continue to add to take rates. Partly offsetting these are continued increases in the mix of flights in our business, an increase in merchandising spend versus 2022. We expect marketing and merchandising combined as the percentage of gross bookings will be about the same as in 2022. We expect our more fixed expenses in 2023 to grow about 20%, which is similar to the growth last year. We expect these more fixed expenses to grow more slowly in future years. As a result, we expect to deliver a record level of EBITDA in 2023 while continue to expand our EBITDA margins by a couple of percentage points versus 2022. In closing, we are pleased with our Q4 results and the early trends we\u2019re seeing in 2023. We remain confident that our strategic priorities will enable us to provide better services for our travels and partners. We continue to remain focused on building a larger and faster-growing business than we have pre-COVID that delivers more and faster growing EBITDA dollars and more and faster growing earnings per share with industry-leading EBITDA margins. We will now move to Q&A. So Chris, can you please open the lines? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Brian Nowak, Morgan Stanley. Brian, please go ahead. Brian Nowak : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Congratulations, David. I have two questions, one sort of blocking and tackling and one big picture. Just the first blocking and tackling one, as you\u2019re thinking about the low teens gross bookings for this year, can you just sort of walk us through how you\u2019re thinking about your best guess or your base case on ADRs around that model? Then the second one, kind of more big picture. There is a lot of discussion or speculation about search and potentially travel search becoming more sophisticated because of new AI tools. How do you think about Booking.com\u2019s position in that world and sort of the ability to continue to grow the percentage of business that\u2019s direct if the search model becomes a little more comprehensive? Thanks. David Goulden : Okay, Brian. Thank you. Let me take the first one and then hand over to Glenn for the second one. So Yes, there are a few puts and takes, obviously, as we think about the entire year. To answer your question, we expect that our room night growth will be slightly lower than the low teens gross booking growth. we will get a little bit of help from FX. We will get a little bit of help from flights. But we think that across the year, as the ADR compare gets harder and we got more recovery in Asia that impacts geo mix, we will see a little bit of pressure on constant currency ADRs for the full year. Glenn Fogel : Brian, why don\u2019t I take the second one. Obviously, a lot of hype about AI right now, about generative AI. And I guess hike is a good word when we talk about are we on the Gartner hike cycle right now. I\u2019m not sure \u2013 I don\u2019t think we\u2019re into that froth of dissolution yet. I think we\u2019re still probably in the peak of inflated expectations, but there is no doubt this technology has seems to be accelerating all the time. And I think you may be limiting the question on those because it\u2019s not just how is AI going to impact search down the road, it\u2019s just AI in general. And we have been talking about this for some time always. I happened to be listening to our call from 3 years ago. And I talked about what we are doing \u2013 AI. I talked about our [indiscernible] center, I talked about the things we\u2019re doing, how important it was to develop our machine learning capabilities and all the things that we do and Booking Holding\u2019s using AI to improve the product, improve what we\u2019re presenting to our customers, working with our partners better using AI. So there is a tremendous amount of interest, of course, in all these areas and some of the stuff we see is very interesting. But I think it\u2019s going to take some time \u2013 but something \u2013 there is going to be major changes in your specific question about search, no doubt it\u2019s going to make it better. In terms of your question, how are we going to be positioned for these changes, I think the best thing anybody could do is look back at the past. There is been lots of technology changes since we first started our business over 20 years ago. And as those changes happened, we adapted and developed. We did great when, for example, people went from just desktop to mobile. And we were very good coming out with these new AI machine learning tools to be able to predict what would be best for our customer. I would say that our capabilities are as good as anybody else\u2019s and we will adapt and do very well with these new technologies. So I am confident in the future, and I am not scared, I\u2019m actually encouraged by being able to use all of these new tools to provide a better service for both sides of the marketplace. Brian Nowak : Great. Thank you both. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Mark Mahaney, Evercore. Mark, please go ahead. Mark Mahaney : Okay. Let me ask two questions, please. The China outbound question, Glenn, just \u2013 that will take a while, but that is been a massive market historically. I think it\u2019s the largest outbound travel market. And I know it was a small single-digit percentage, mid single digit percentage, whatever, back in 2019. Your thoughts on how to position the company to maybe better tap into that now than you were able to a couple of years ago? And then is there another U.S. out there? What I mean by that is you\u2019ve talked about leaning into gaining market share gains in the U.S. Is there another region where you think you kind of underpunch your weight, if I said that right, and can also apply the U.S. playbook to also gain better share in that market? Thank you. Glenn Fogel : Thanks, Mark. In regards to China, obviously, there is a lot of excitement about China, too, dropping the restrictions in terms of being able to travel due to COVID, getting everybody very excited about what does that mean. And not just for travel, of course, just reducing those restrictions is increasing GDP in China and what that\u2019s going to do in terms of demand for all sorts of things and what\u2019s that\u2019s going to do to inflation, and how is it going to impact the rest of the world economies. In terms of your specific question, you\u2019re correct. We were a small player in terms of the overall Chinese travel business before the pandemic. In terms of the future, yes, there is an opportunity there, and there are a lot of outbound travelers who definitely are hoping that they can go outbound and travel soon. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen nearly as quickly as I think some deals have been predicting. When you look at some of the numbers out of January in terms of the amount of outbound airlift available was a teens number, I think maybe it was 15% of what it was in 2019 in terms of the actual lift that you can get out of China. So I think it\u2019s going to take some time for that. Now in terms of how we can take advantage of the increase that is going to happen in future, we\u2019re going to use pretty much the same placement we use pretty much everywhere, albeit China is a little different because there is not Google there. But in terms of marketing, meaning people are aware of all the great products that we offer and be able to competitive pricing, all things any consumer cares about, whether you\u2019re in China, Europe, U.S. or wherever in the world, we will keep doing those things. I know it\u2019s not \u2013 China is a very competitive market. And it\u2019s going to take some time. And as we said when we talked about our priorities, you\u2019ll note that we take U.S. I don\u2019t say China, but I would like to be able to say, look, we have been able to be successful in gaining market share in the U.S. over the last few years. I think everybody can see those numbers. So \u2013 yes, we will try and do better than we did in the past in China, but I don\u2019t think anybody should start going to the bank with any expectations of significant improvements anytime in the near-term. What\u2019s your second question or was that \u2013 that was second question? Mark Mahaney : No. No. Is there another U.S.? So is there \u2013 not Europe, but is there another regional market where you think your market share probably isn\u2019t where you want it to be, and you can use U.S. learnings to expand share in that market? Glenn Fogel : Well, we want to increase our market share everywhere, of course. The reason we kept calling out the U.S., the U.S. very similar to Europe in many ways. And we had noticed how underindexed we were there. That\u2019s not quite the same case when we look around the world, albeit in right now, except in China, which we noted. We do fairly well in a lot of parts of the world, but there is nothing that we pull out separately and say, hey, here\u2019s another area where we\u2019re going to really press hard to try and do better at. We\u2019ve kind of do what we\u2019ve been doing throughout the world for a long time, it\u2019s gaining share everywhere. Mark Mahaney : Okay. Thanks, Glenn and congratulations, David. David Goulden : Mark, thank you. Just to add to comments. Relative to what we\u2019re seeing in January, we saw obviously a nice improvement in the Asia region compared to Q4. That is not being driven by China. That\u2019s been driven by the other markets in the Asia region. China is a small contributor to that improvement so far. Mark Mahaney : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley, UBS. Lloyd, please go ahead. Lloyd Walmsley : Thanks, guys. If I heard you right, you talked to, I think, 50 bps of revenue take rate improvement this year. How much of that is kind of the timing headwind unwinding? What are kind of some other puts and takes we should think about impacting revenue take rates this year? And as we think about \u201824 and growth continues to normalize, is that \u2013 is there another 50 bps in take rate just from that kind of timing unwind? You talked about the 1% headwind to \u201822. And then the second one, I guess, you\u2019ve been picking up share in the U.S. for a while now. Can you talk about just how repeat business is coming in and specifically repeat direct is coming in as that kind of cohort of users starts to age in the U.S.? And maybe how that compares to historical levels? Anything you can share there would be great. Thanks. David Goulden : Yes. Lloyd, let me take the first part of that. So I think I kind of went through a little bit of this in the commentary, but there is a lot of numbers in the commentary with all the comparisons of versus last year versus 2019, etcetera. So relative to the 50 bps of improvement this year, essentially, the timing drag on take rates last year has basically gone \u2013 almost entirely gone away. So there was about a point of timing last year that goes away. And also, we get a little bit of an increase from payments as payment mix increases. The offsetting amount to those get you to the plus 50 is that we have continuing this year at the same level of merchandise we exited last year out, broadly speaking. So you get a year-on-year impact of merchandising that\u2019s a negative and flight mix as well. So that\u2019s how you get to the cap plus 50 improvement from last year. So to your question on 2024 though, the timing impact has really gone away at this point in time compared to 2019, a lot less, of course, growth rate change, much more than expected during the year. So essentially, there are puts and takes along the lines. The same thing I talked about, payments, merchandising, flights, etcetera. But we don\u2019t expect major changes in the take rate level from where we are right now. You shouldn\u2019t be modeling big changes in to take rates because we have some things helping and we have some things that are hurting, and they are generally going to offset each of that broadly speaking at this point in time. Glenn Fogel : We don\u2019t go regional in terms of your question there. We are not going to be talking about in the U.S. in terms of steps that you are asking for. Lloyd Walmsley : Okay. Any directional sense of just how you\u2019re feeling about the aging cohorts in the market share gains you\u2019ve had just broadly? Glenn Fogel : No, I\u2019m not going to be specific in terms of that. I just would say how pleased I am. We\u2019ve been talking about it for some time on these calls about what we\u2019re doing in the U.S. and gaining share and the reasons that we\u2019re doing, how we\u2019re doing it, and I\u2019m just I\u2019ll just reiterating how pleased we are to be able to do that, and we\u2019re going to keep on grinding the way to continue to try and gain share. Lloyd Walmsley : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Justin Post, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Justin, please go ahead. Justin Post : Thank you. Maybe one for David and one for Glenn, David, it looks like you\u2019re getting your EBITDA back towards the 33%, maybe 33.5% range this year in guidance. How do you think about where you are now versus pre pandemic? And what are the levers going forward? And then, Glenn, I think you said AA nights were about 29% of total and that\u2019s kind of flattish with last year. How are you thinking about your alternative accommodation business? And to the extent you can talk about it, obviously, competitive concerns, what are your big initiatives for that business this year? Thank you. David Goulden : Alright. Just let me take the EBITDA margin question first. So if we add a couple of points to where we are in \u201822 to \u201823, the drivers between that, the difference between that, the 39 points we were at in 2019, are basically a few things. One, we\u2019re leaning in more relative to marketing and merchandising that we did in 2019, that\u2019s very conscious to continue to gain share in the recovering market. We\u2019ve got the mix of lower-margin business. We said that flights and payments will start to have an impact as they grow and they are making part of the difference. We\u2019ve got some targeted OpEx investments in \u2013 when you look at our total OpEx expense vis-\u00e0-vis 2019, we\u2019ve got DST and we\u2019ve got FX. I mean, I don\u2019t know their impact \u2013 rough order of impact. That\u2019s how you kind of get to the 6 points of difference. So when you think about where we would go going forward from that, we do expect to be able to increase even the margins from this level. We\u2019re not trying to get back to COVID, pre-COVID volume levels, I just want to be super clear, but we do think there is still some growth potential from where we are right now. And the drivers of that, if you think of the things I just mentioned, are the reasons we\u2019re down below versus 2019 now. The drivers of that, that we think we can use to our advantage over time is that as our direct mix increases, we should be able to kind of lean in less in total to our margin spend. We may lean in to the same level in absolute terms on paid marketing, but paid market becomes a smaller part of the business. We do believe that over time, we can get more leverage on our fixed costs. But then we do expect to see continued pressure from the lower mix \u2013 from the higher mix of lower-margin businesses that will continue to grow. We believe that over the kind of medium term, we can still increase margins from where we are today into 2023. But again, not back to the 2019 levels. Glenn Fogel : Regarding the alternative accommodation space, we are very pleased with what we\u2019re doing in growing. And I mentioned in the prepared remarks some of the things that we did last year and I will repeat them all, but those are the things that we\u2019re doing to make sure that partners, that suppliers, they want to put their properties on to our platform. And that\u2019s the first thing. And having done that and doing that right now is that how do we get the awareness. So you noticed, for example, our Super Bowl ad, where we do include the non-hotel accommodation in that and make sure as we grow that branding throughout the year to make sure people are aware. It\u2019s really \u2013 it\u2019s not anything that is magic is making a product that people want to use and making a product that people who own properties want to put on our platform and then putting in the marketing to push it through. It has increased. It has not increased substantially over the years as our hotel product continues to fill rapidly too. We can have a big increase in this year of the trend of accommodations that we start growing [indiscernible] in the hotel area, but we are doing both. So that\u2019s the point. And our thing is we know, and this is really important. We know customers come to our site, come to our app. They start a one type of property. And then they switch and they look at another one, another entirely different one. And then they go back and they come back. We really believe having both types of properties, hotels and non-hotels in the same place that enables a customer to be able to compare and interest, that\u2019s what they cause or look at the reviews makes a better process for consumers over time. Now look, we just got a lot of the stuff out last year. And for example, I mentioned our requested book we\u2019re still trialing that, we\u2019re just piloting that. It\u2019s going to take some more time. I am very encouraged by where we are and where we\u2019re going. So I have no concerns about us continuing in the same direction. Justin Post : Great. Thank you, Glenn. Thank you, David. David Goulden : Thank you, Justin. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Eric Sheridan, Goldman Sachs. Eric, please go ahead. Eric Sheridan : Thanks so much for taking the questions. Glenn, your comments around the competitive intensity that you faced in I\u2019d love to look backwards as the first part of the question and sort of reflecting back on \u201822, how you saw the competitive intensity of the industry broadly evolve against the backdrop where sort of pent-up demand was sort of a bit of a tailwind for the industry from a growth perspective. And as you look forward into \u201823 and beyond as demand somewhat normalizes away from the pent-up dynamic. How should we be thinking about some of those key initiatives you\u2019re most focused on to sort of meet where you see pockets of competitive intensity against a more normalized demand environment? Thanks so much. Glenn Fogel : Sure. Well, the competitiveness was quite clear when you compare \u201822 versus \u201821. We had a very nice recovery in \u201821, and we benefited from the fact that a lot of our competitors just didn\u2019t seem to be out of the gate so fast in terms of their marketing, in terms of what they are doing, whether it be brand performance marketing in terms of trying to get the same demand that we are out getting there. So 2022, also we\u2019re putting a full throttle on to get those customers. So that\u2019s what we saw. We saw it in performance marketing. We saw it significantly increasing the amount of money being put into brand marketing. In lots of different ways that everybody wanted to make sure that they are out trying to get those customers. Tthat was the difference between \u201821 and \u201822. That\u2019s when I speak about what a competitive market really was last year. But look, this industry has always been competitive. The wonderful thing about the way technology has developed is that enables customers with very little friction to be able to look at all the different ways they can be very trial. So we have to always be providing them with a great service, a great price, so they will actually use us. It\u2019s one thing that I think some people will recognize as much perhaps is that this is on every day we go out there and we fight for those customers. Yes, we have loyal customers. They\u2019ll work because we\u2019ve providing them with a great service and price. We got to keep on doing it to maintain their loyalty. And we\u2019re going to keep on doing that. Now in terms of the future, in terms of areas that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to get any less competitive, but I do think that we do have some advantages because of our great technology because of the skill sets that we have to continue to try and advance this service better, so people do use it and then they do say, hey, I\u2019m going to go to Booking because it\u2019s just better. And that\u2019s they going to have to keep on doing, but there is no magic bullet here. We\u2019ve got to do it every day. Eric Sheridan : Great. Thank you, Glenn. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from John Colantuoni, Jefferies. John, please go ahead. John Colantuoni : Great. Thanks for taking my question. So marketing efficiency moved back to 2019 levels in the second half of \u201822 after being much higher in the first half. And I realize \u2013 some of that is just the timing of the recovery and sort of the transition to a more competitive environment that you just talked about in the prior question. But how are you thinking about balancing continued investments in customer acquisition with driving EBITDA dollars in 2023, along with the mix between sort of merchandising and marketing? So any detail there would be helpful. And then if you could give some more detail about how bookings so far in the core summer period have trended, that would be great. Thanks. David Goulden : Alright. John, let me answer both those questions. So as I think you know, we took a conscious decision, especially in 2022 to kind of lean into our marketing channels, the combination of merchandising and marketing. And collectively, they were a fair amount higher than they were in 2019 from expense point of view. And that was a conscious choice, we believe that is reflected in the share gains we\u2019ve made, not just in the U.S., but also globally. We \u2013 obviously, we have recovered the level much more than the travel industry as we talk. When you look at occupancy rates and how they have recovered and you look at our room nights, and obviously, we\u2019re significantly in front of that. So we believe that has been a sensible investment. We \u2013 as I mentioned in my prepared comments, we will keep the combined investments in marketing and merchandising in 2023 at about the same level as it was in 2022. Now during the year, we will kind of look at what we think the right balance of merchandising versus marketing is. From the comments that I made, you would realize we probably on average across the year compared to 2022, spending a bit more on merchandising, a bit less on marketing, but that could change during the year. We can\u2019t really think of a tune based upon the efficiencies we see in each of the cells. And we will stay at that more elevated level because we believe the market is still recovering. There is still potential for share gains for us in our marketplace. So we don\u2019t really think of it together. And if you kind of look at it versus 2019, it\u2019s a fairly sizable step up. But we think that\u2019s been a smart investment and a good investment that makes sense at least this year, we still see recovery in the travel industry. And if you remind me again please, the second part of your question? John Colantuoni : Second part was if you could give any detail around summer bookings so far. David Goulden : Yes. Thank you. So summer bookings, yes. So we have seen, as I mentioned, the travel window \u2013 the booking window recover completely on a global basis. But actually, the booking window has now expanded a little bit in Europe and North America and still slowly was \u2013 or shortly was, I would say, in Asia. So that means that in Europe and North America, we\u2019re seeing strong demand for short-term bookings but also for summer bookings. So we\u2019re seeing the summer booking season shape up quite well. We\u2019re not going to repeat on the book type metrics we talked about last year. We think they perhaps caused a better future, but more appropriate for a recovering environment, but you can see based upon the fact that we have strong growth in rents, we have now in those markets, slightly lengthened booking windows, strong growth in gross bookings, then obviously, that would certainly say subject to, obviously, the fact that things are cancelable and a high degree of our bookings are flexible, but it certainly looks like it\u2019s shaping up to be a strong summer season for us. John Colantuoni : Great. Thanks, David. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Kevin Kopelman, Cowen. Kevin, please go ahead. Kevin Kopelman : Thanks. I want to ask about the flights initiatives. Could you update us there and what the outlook is for flights this year? And then also could you comment on the traveling? Glenn Fogel : Sure, Kevin. So in the prepared remarks, we talked a little bit about the number of countries we have. They are obviously we\u2019re very pleased where we are in terms of the growth of the number of tickets that we\u2019re selling now is very good product. We like it because, as I mentioned, people, some people go to flights first, and we want to make sure they know who we are and then start buying from us. In terms of the acquisitions, I can\u2019t \u2013 you have the world work to regulations, I have nothing to comment on that. We continue to work with the people in the process and continue to work on that. But I would say, just so please, we look where we were \u2013 again, because I listened to that call 3 years ago, the earnings call, and we just 3 years ago, talked we just started in 2019, the flights been up off the ground, so sorry about deployments at Booking.com. And we are just starting to where we are now. I just love the \u2013 what the people have been able to build, and I love the fact that people like it and are coming to us. And we have high hopes for the future in this area. Kevin Kopelman : Okay, Glenn. And a quick \u2013 one other quick one, as we think about year-over-year comps as the year goes on, is it fair to think it\u2019s \u2013 Q2 has a pretty tough comp and then the second half is more normal? Glenn Fogel : I\u2019ll let David talk about that if he wants to or not. David Goulden : Yes, if you look at year-on-year, then obviously, the comps get harder when we get past Q1, right? Q1 is going to be the easiest comp on a year-on-year basis. And the toughest quarter on a year-on-year basis will be Q2. because remember, we had that kind of early peak in travel bookings in the many time frame last year as we have \u2013 went through our non-linear recovery. We always said it would be a non-linear. So Q1 will be just comp. Q2 will be the toughest comp and Q3 and Q4 a little way between. Kevin Kopelman : Great. Thanks, David. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that was your final question. I will now turn it back to Glenn Fogel for closing remarks. Glenn Fogel : Thank you. I want to thank our partners, our customers, our dedicated employees and our shareholders. We appreciate your support as we continue to build on the long-term vision for our company. And I want to close by thanking everyone at Booking Holdings and everyone around the world who are contributing to help the people a bit so terribly hurt by the tragic events in Turkey and Syria. We have employees in Turkey and many more who have family and friends there, along with supply partners in the devastated area. Our hearts go out to all who are suffering there. Thank you, and good night. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for today. We thank you for participating and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

And now, I'd like to introduce Booking Holdings speakers for this afternoon, Glenn Fogel and David Goulden. Go ahead, gentlemen. Glenn Fogel : Thank you and welcome to Booking Holdings' first quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. I am pleased to report that in the first quarter, we reached all-time quarterly highs for both room nights of $274 million and gross bookings of $39.4 billion and achieved year-over-year growth rates of 38% and 44%, respectively. On a constant currency basis, first quarter gross bookings growth was even stronger at 52% year-over-year. Both room night and gross bookings came in ahead of our previous expectations as a result of the continued strength in leisure travel demand and from a lengthening booking window, particularly in Europe and the U.S. The room night and gross bookings outperformance versus our expectations was driven by bookings that will stay in future periods which is when the revenue will be recognized. As a result of this timing difference, revenue was approximately in line with our expectations, while adjusted EBITDA was a bit below given the additional marketing expenses associated with the future states. When we look at room night growth versus 2019, we have seen a slight increase in April compared with what we saw in the first quarter. Though on a year-over-year basis, growth has decelerated since April last year saw an accelerating travel recovery, making the comparison more difficult. Overall, we remain encouraged by the continued strength and resiliency of travel demand so far this year which speaks to consumers' strong desires to travel. We currently see very strong growth of bookings received for travel during our peak summer period in quarter 3. Though we note, these bookings represent a modest percentage of what will likely be booked for total summer travel and most of these bookings are cancelable. While travel booking trends have remained robust, we recognize that there is uncertainty regarding the path of the global economy. However, we believe we are well positioned to navigate any potential near-term economic uncertainty given our highly variable expense structure, solid operating results, substantial liquidity and strong free cash flow. This allows us to remain focused on what's important for the long term which means making the necessary investments to strengthen and grow our business while remaining cost conscious and implementing initiatives across the business to drive cost efficiency. We continue to make progress on our key strategic priorities, including our long-term Connected Trip vision. The Connected Trip is our long-term vision to make booking and experiencing travel easier, more personal, more enjoyable, while delivering better value to our traveller customers and supplier partners. Our payments platform at Booking.com ties into our Connected Trip vision as payments helps deliver a more seamless and frictionless booking experience for our travelers. Those still small today, we are seeing an increase in the mix of transactions that are connected to another book travel component in a trip. We believe continuing to build on this progress will improve the booking experience for more of our customers which we believe will help drive increasing customer engagement with our platform. We continue to focus on further developing our flight offering on Booking.com which provides consumers with another place to book an air ticket. Booking.com's live offering was an important part of our total Q1 73% year-over-year increase in air tickets which was an acceleration from the year-over-year growth in Q4 of 61%. We will continue this important work to provide travelers with the best possible flight booking experience. Though AI has received significant attention recently, we began our investments in AI years ago. We believe then and we continue to believe now that we can build a more compelling and differentiated offering if we can leverage AI technology to deliver a more personalized booking experience, a connected trip that would be more responsive to a booker's needs and help manage different aspects of their trips. We believe we are well positioned in this area, given that we have been using AI extensively for years in order to optimize interactions with our customers who are both travelers and partners. This goes from personalizing interactions and recommendations to machine translation in over 40 languages and dialects to analyze in the content, the pictures provided by customers and partners, to optimizing value for our customers and many, many more. Over the years, we have built a strong team of AI experts across the company and we keep current with the latest AI research through Booking.com's collaborations with universities. This enables us to quickly react, adapt and learn how our traveller customers and supplier partners can benefit from new developments in the field. We are always looking for new ways to make customer interaction smoother and richer, realizing our ambition to make it easier for everyone to experience the world and to deliver our Connected Trip vision. Much of the recent attention has been on large language models or LLM which provide a multitude of interesting possibilities for improving all areas of travel searching, booking and experiencing. Two interesting possibilities are interactive itinerary building and answering travelers questions. Though there are current challenges given current LLM sometimes produce inaccurate outputs. Nevertheless, we are excited to be exploring how we can make use of these technologies for the benefit of our customers. Some of our brands, like KAYAK and OpenTable, are experimenting regenerative AI plug-ins, while others are building ways to integrate the technology into their own offerings. It is, as we all know, very early days but I am confident in our company's ability to benefit from these developments and improve our products for our customers given our experience in AI, our travel-related data and our human and financial capital, our strategic priorities, including the Connected Trip vision and to improve the experience for our customers and drive more value and benefits to them. But it's important to note that when we think about customers, we have 2 equally important customer groups to consider, our supply partners and our travelers. For our supply partners, we strive to be a valuable partner for all accommodation types on our platform, from traditional hotels to the vacation rental on the beach, to everything in between. We believe we can add value to these partners across the spectrum of accommodation types by delivering incremental demand and developing products and features to help support their businesses. In the area of alternative accommodations, we are seeing encouraging progress at Booking.com with alternative combination of room nights in the first quarter, increasing about 45% year-over-year and representing about 33% of Booking.com's total room nights which is 2 percentage points higher than in Q1 2022. In the U.S., our mix of alternative accommodation room nights, while still low relative to our global mix, has increased meaningfully in the first quarter, reaching highest level ever and was also our absolute highest room nights in U.S. alternative accommodations ever. We are seeing continued momentum in terms of supply growth, both globally and in the U.S. for alternative accommodations, with global listings reaching about 6.7 million by the end of the first quarter which is about 2% higher than year-end 2022. We have seen great traction with the adoption of our enhanced payment solution for alternative accommodation partners in the U.S. We believe rolling out this solution along with other product enhancements last year, including partner liability insurance and an enhanced damage policy is helping to bring more professional supply online to our platform. In addition, we are seeing our alternative accommodation properties across our major regions, achieving improvements in productivity and our new partners are receiving their first booking on our platform earlier. We aim to build on this progress by continuing to improve the product offering to our supply partners and travelers, particularly in the U.S. For our travelers, we remain focused on building a better experience that leads to increased loyalty, frequency, spend and direct relationships over time. Our mix of customers booking directly on our platforms in the first quarter continued to increase and reached the highest first quarter level ever. We see a very high level of direct bookings from the mobile app which is an important platform as it allows us more opportunities to engage directly with travelers. Just over 45% of our room nights were booked through our apps in the first quarter which is a few percentage points higher than in Q1 2022. We will continue our efforts to enhance the app experience to build on the recent success we are seeing here. Another way that we build a better experience and deliver value to our travelers is going through our Genius loyalty program at Booking.com. Simplicity is a core principle of Genius where our travelers get the benefits from the program right away. Over time, we've enhanced these benefits, including the creation of a top-tier level of Genius and we will continue to find ways to deliver incremental value to our travelers through this program. Finally, we published our 2022 sustainability report last month which provides an update on the progress we have made against the goals laid out in our climate action plan. We are proud of the emissions reductions achieved and ambitious targets set out for our business. But as I said before, we believe our greatest influence on sustainable travel is through making it easier for travelers to find and book sustainable options. We're addressing this opportunity through our work with our travel sustainable bag program which now includes over 400,000 properties that can highlight their sustainable practices to customers on Booking.com and that program has been expanded to Priceline, Agoda and KAYAK. In conclusion, I am encouraged by the continued strength of travel demand we are seeing so far this year as well as our team's execution against our key strategic priorities. We remain focused on delivering a better offering and experience for our customers, both our supply partners and our travelers alike. We are as confident as ever in the long-term growth of travel and in the opportunities ahead for our company. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden. David Goulden : Thank you, Glenn and good afternoon. I'll review our results for the first quarter as well as our thoughts for Q2 and for the year. All growth rates for 2023 are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise indicated. We will be making some references to the comparable periods in 2019 where we think these are helpful. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. We will be posting our prepared remarks to the Booking Holdings Investor Relations website after the conclusion of the earnings call. Before getting into details for Q1, I want to remind you that our business is quite seasonal. Q1 is typically a strong booking quarter and we incur marketing expenses in Q1 for many bookings that will stay in future quarters which is when the revenue is recognized. Q1 has also historically been our seasonally smaller revenue quarter and adjusted EBITDA quarter. This means that Q1 adjusted EBITDA can be quite sensitive to the level of bookings we get in the quarter. With the increasing mix of payments at Booking.com, Q1 is also becoming a strong cash flow quarter due to high level of bookings. So now let me go on to our numbers for the first quarter. We were encouraged to see strong year-over-year room night growth of 38% in the first quarter which is better than our expectations. For the first quarter, Asia was up 100%. Europe and rest of world were both up more than 30%. We continue to see growth in the U.S. which was up high single digits versus the prior year. Our growth in total room nights versus 2019 increased from 10% in Q4 to 26% in Q1. In the first quarter, U.S. was up more than 30% and all other regions were up about 25% versus 2019. The booking windows -- our Booking.com expanded versus 2019 for the first time since the onset of the pandemic, driven by Europe and the U.S. The booking window in the first quarter was longer than we expected due to strong levels of bookings for travel in the summer period. I note that many of these bookings are cancelable. Our mobile apps represented over 45% of our total room nights in the first quarter, similar to the fourth quarter of 2022. We continue to see an increasing mix of our total room nights coming to us through the direct channel. The direct channel increased as a percentage of our room nights in the first quarter relative to the first quarter of 2022. The international mix of our total room nights in Q1 was about 53% which was the highest quarterly mix since 2019 but still a couple of percentage points below Q1 2019. Our cancellation rates in the first quarter were below Q1 2022 and Q1 2019. For our alternative accommodations of Booking.com, our Q1 room night growth rate was about 45% year-on-year and the global mix alternative accommodation room nights was about 33% which was higher than about 31% in Q1 2022. We are pleased with the progress we made in North America alternative accomodations where growth in the first quarter was much stronger than the global average. Q1 gross bookings increased 44% year-over-year or 52% on a constant currency basis. The 44% increase in gross bookings was 6 percentage points higher than the 38% room night increase due to 9% higher accommodation constant currency ADRs and also due to a couple of points from strong flight booking growth, partially offset by the 8 percentage points of negative impact from FX movements. Accommodation in constant currency ADRs were negatively impacted by about 5 percentage points from regional mix due to Asia room nights growing the fastest of all our regions and U.S. growing the slowest. Excluding regional mix, constant currency ADRs were up about 14 percentage points year-on-year due to rate increases in all of our regions. Despite the higher ADRs in the first quarter, we have not seen a change in the mix of hotel star ratings being booked or changes in length of stay that could indicate that consumers are trading down. We continue to watch these dynamics closely. Airline tickets booked in the first quarter were up about 73% year-over-year, driven by the continued expansion of Booking.com's flight offering. Revenue for the first quarter was up 40% year-on-year or about 47% on a constant currency basis. Although we had stronger-than-expected Q1 from a room night and gross booking point of view, the outperformance versus our expectations was driven by bookings that will stay in future quarters. As a result, we did not see revenue benefit in Q1 from these incremental bookings. The lower-than-expected take rate in Q1 was entirely driven by the timing effects. Our underlying accommodation take rates continue to be in line with 2019 levels. Marketing expense which is a highly variable expense line increased 32% year-over-year. Marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings was about 30 basis points lower than Q1 2022 due to higher ROIs in our paid channels and a higher mix of direct business. Marketing and merchandising combined as a percentage of gross bookings in Q1 was about 20 basis points lower than last year which is better than our expectations of being slightly higher. Relative to our expectations, this was due to better ROIs in our paid channels as well as phasing of merchandising spend which is tied to revenues. Sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings were up about 15 basis points compared with last year which was better than our expectations. About 45% of Booking.com's gross bookings were processed through our payments platform in Q1, up from about 34% in Q1 2022. Our more fixed expenses in aggregate were up 25% year-on-year which was higher than our expectations due to a few factors that impacted personnel and indirect taxes. The 25% year-over-year growth excludes $39 million in accruals related to potential settlements of indirect tax [indiscernible] recorded in G&A. We continue to manage our more fixed expenses very carefully. Adjusted EBITDA was $586 million in the quarter which was up 89% year-over-year and would have been up 111% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA was lower than our expectations, impacted by marketing expenses incurred for the higher-than-expected gross bookings stage in future quarters. February and March bookings came in stronger than we expected at the time of our prior guidance. These extra bookings also negatively impacted our take rate more than expected for the quarter. If we look at marketing and merchandising as a percentage of gross bookings in Q1 to eliminate the timing difference, this was lower than our expectations and lower than both Q1 2022 and Q1 2019. Non-GAAP net income of $440 million resulted in non-GAAP earnings per share of $11.60 per share which was up 197% year-on-year. Our average share count in the first quarter was 8% below Q1 2022 and 16% below Q1 2019. On a GAAP basis, we had net income of $266 million in the quarter. As a reminder, every profit metric we highlighted in these quarterly earnings report includes the negative impact of stock-based compensation expense because we view SBC expense at a very real cost of doing business. We continue to manage SBC very carefully and it continues to be a very low percentage of our operating cash flow. Now, on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q1 ending cash and investment balance of $15.3 billion was up slightly versus our Q4 ending balance of $15.2 billion. Our operating cash flow for the quarter was $2.9 billion, up 70% year-on-year. And our free cash flow was $2.8 billion, up 77% year-on-year. The operating and free cash flow generated in the quarter benefited from $2.3 billion in change in working capital due to an increase in our deferred merchant booking balance as well as the $586 million in adjusted EBITDA. The $2.8 billion of free cash flow was mostly offset by about $2 billion in share repurchase in Q1 and the payment of about $500 million for debt to mature in March. Now, on to our thoughts for the second quarter of 2023. In April, we continued to see strong demand with room night growth versus 2019 that was slightly higher than the 26% growth saw in the first quarter, with all of our major regions growing at similar rates. The booking window in April at Booking.com continues to be long as it was in 2019. On a year-on-year basis, April room night growth was in the mid-teens which is lower than Q1 due to a more difficult prior year comparison. You will recall that last year, Q1 room nights were 9% below 2019 and April was up 10%. April 2022 was our first month of growth versus 2019 since the onset of the pandemic. Our comments on the second quarter make the assumption that room night growth will be up mid-single digits year-over-year. As you'll recall, Q1 last year was impacted by Omicron. And in Q2, we saw a strong recovery which resulted in Q2 2022 being our highest growth quarter versus 2019, especially May and June which were our highest growth months last year. Compared with 2019, we'd expect future room night growth in 2023 to be just over 20%, assuming some moderation from growth from the first quarter in April when room nights were helped by more bookings we expected for the summer. We expect Q2 gross bookings to grow about 4 points faster room nights on a year-on-year basis due to a few points from continued flight bookings growth and slightly higher constant currency ADRs. We expect Q2 revenue as a percentage of gross bookings to be approximately 120 basis points above last year due to a less negative impact from timing and increased revenue from payments, partially offset by an increased investment in merchandising and a higher mix of flights. We may see less of an increase in our take rate if booking trends exceed our expectations, especially in the high percentage of these bookings [indiscernible] stays in future quarters. This could also result in higher-than-expected marketing expense in the quarter. We expect Q2 marketing expenses as a percentage of gross bookings to be lower than last year due to an increase in direct mix. We expect marketing and merchandising combined as a percentage of gross bookings in Q2 to be about in line with last year. We expect Q2 sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings to be about 40 basis points higher than last year due to higher merchant gross bookings mix and higher third-party call center costs, including the impact of our partnership with Majorelle. We expect our more fixed expenses in Q2 to grow about 25% year-over-year due to higher personnel and related expenses, indirect taxes and IT expenses. Taking all this into account, we'd expect future adjusted EBITDA to be around 35% higher than last year. In terms of our outlook for the year, we are not updating our previous full year commentary at this time. Our strong bookings in the first 4 months of the year created the potential for some upside but we want to see how the next few months develop before considering any updated commentary. We continue to expect that our adjusted EBITDA margin will expand by a couple of percentage points versus 2022. In closing, we're pleased with our Q1 results and the very strong growth in bookings for the summer. We'll now move to Q&A and Rob, could you please open the lines? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Justin Post from Bank of America. Justin Post : I guess 2 things. First, when you look at ROI in the marketing channels, how do you feel about that going into the summer? Are you seeing some advantages based on changes from some of your competitors? And then secondly, as you think about your overall use of cash, any reason why you can't just put buybacks to work for the next 5 years? Are there anything we should be thinking about on the debt side? Glenn Fogel : Well, Justin, why don't I take the second and then I'll let David talk specifically about ROIs and marketing and thoughts on that going forward. So I think we've been fairly clear in the past about how we view the company and how we believe our free cash flow should be used. And the first thing we always want to see is how can we invest that money appropriately in the company, build out services in ways that we can make the way we work with our partners and our traveller customers in a better way to help build this franchise. That's the first thing absolutely important. And after that, we say, well, we can't build it organically. Is there something outside the company, we think that could add value make things better for both, again, our traveller customers and our partner customers. And the last thing is, okay, if we don't see a good use of that, then we should be somehow returning that capital to our shareholders which is what we laid out the last quarter, we laid out our buyback program, where we had $4 million left in the previous authorization, $20 billion in the next one, that made $24 billion total. And then we said that over the next 4 years, we expect to be able to complete the full authorization. And I believe we've given out some numbers about our buyback now. And I am thrilled with the way we're doing this. But for long term, 5 years, this is what we laid out. Things can always change but that's the way we've laid it out. And I'll leave it up to David, in terms of ROIs, anything you're seeing differently about the summer, I have myself, maybe you see something. David Goulden : Yes. Justin, I think it's hard to predict what's going to happen to ROIs that far out. So what I will say is that you can see that we saw some encouraging ROI trends compared to expectations in the first quarter. Those were a little bit related to what happened to our bookings profile. So as we mentioned, we got a lot of extra bookings for the summer in the first quarter, more than we would have expected. The ROIs in the pay channels were better than expected due to basically 3 things : higher ADR, a lower cancellation rate and longer-than-expected average length of stay. So we were bidding -- so basically, that was tied to the expansion of the booking window. So the expansion -- the booking window is quite close to correlate to what we saw in terms of good ROI performance in the first quarter. I've just always maintain the point these are highly competitive channels, many players in them and relative to your question on competitive dynamic and nothing really to talk about is different. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from Evercore. Mark Mahaney : I just want to ask about the Asia Pacific travel and China travel. Are you already seeing the impact of China outbound travel? And then within Asia Pacific, it sounds like that's the strongest region. Are there any particular markets that are performing well for you? Glenn Fogel : Mark, sorry about that. Let me take that part 2 ways because I know last time, I believe you asked about China outbound then too, if I recall correctly. And so China is not a significant part at all of our very strong Asia growth in the first quarter. And I want to make it clear that China is still not anywhere near it was in 2019 and outbound. It is coming back in terms of overall market coming back but there's still shortages of lift there. It is getting better than it was in January when there was a think mid-teens number of available airlift out of China outbound is coming back. I'll be probably honest with you, we are seeing more growth, obviously, in other parts of Asia. We're very pleased with the very strong growth we're seeing. I don't believe that we're going to break down individual countries but I do see that this is an area of growth for us that I'm very pleased about. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley from UBS. Lloyd Walmsley : Two, if I can. First, just going back to the higher marketing ROI. Like how much of that is you all proactively managing to higher targets versus just the competitive market, maybe softening up in marketing channels and like do you think this is durable? And do you think we should think of this as a reflection of kind of normalizing consumer demand? And then the second one is just anything you're seeing in terms of just price consciousness among consumers either trading down at all or taking shorter trips to compensate for higher ADRs. Anything you'd call out there in any of your big markets. Glenn Fogel : Let me take the second one because I do look at that very carefully to see are there any smoke signals coming out of the market, giving us any indication of any changes. And I have not seen any decline in the star ratings that people are going for nor are we seeing a decrease in the length of stays, either one of which could increase that potential softening in the market and we have not seen that yet. And I think we made the remark about the booking window has gone out further indicating confidence, I believe, that's one hypothesis I want to point out, confidence about the future willing to put your money down and be willing to book for further out. That can be seen upon [indiscernible] is that people are concerned there's not going to be enough availability or they could be considered that prices are going to continue to rise, they will lock it in now, that's another way to look at too but none of those hypotheses to say anything about a weakness at all. And in terms of I think your first question, I'll leave it to David. David Goulden : In terms of -- Lloyd, let me just remind you that this is a year that we still expect to be leaning into marketing and merchandising because we believe there's recovery in the travel market available to us. And I think that our growth rates relative to the market demonstrates that we're making progress there. If you remember, we started off the year by saying we expect our marketing and merchandising investment to be roughly the same as it was as a percentage of gross bookings, same as it was in 2022, we still expect that to be the case. Remember, we said that 2022 was a year which we look out of leaning in and making more investment relative to gross bookings that we did in 2019. And that story for us hasn't changed. We believe that we want to continue to lean in this year to continue to gain share in a recovery marketplace. And the fact that we saw some improvement in Q1, as I mentioned in my -- in the answer to my question to Justin, what to do with the kind of shape of our booking profile and the booking window and getting more summer bookings with higher transaction values than we would expect it to get from a mix point of view in Q1 and actually why the ROIs came in better. But we still plan to believe in the industry. And as I said in Q2 and for the full year, we still expect that investment in marketing and merchandising to be as it was in 2022. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak : I have two. The first one is on the direct mix of traffic, the percentage of the business is direct. You've made a lot of progress on that over the last year or so, a couple of years, Glenn. If you break it down by region, where have you made the most progress in increasing the percentage of the business that's direct? And how should we think about how high that is? And what are the regions that you have the most runway to sort of drive that percentage of the business that's direct up longer? And then, the second one on your forecasting. You guys have a lot of data and you're very good at forecasting. It seems like demand really came through better than you thought throughout the quarter. Which regions sort of drove that outsized demand versus your forecasting? Glenn Fogel : So we don't break down the direct mix by region at all. But I can repeat things I've said in the past about how important direct mix is to the long-term increase the value of the franchise because of things we talk about with our connected trip. They're getting people in through the app primarily, having them understand all the different things we'll be able to offer to them, give them a real personalized thing that will make them want to always come back to us. The more we learn about them, the more they come back to us. So it's a flywheel effect happening there. Again, I won't break it down by region but my goal is to have every region have as many people as possible using the app and coming directly. That's the first thing. In terms of how we varied against our forecast, I don't know how much. David, why don't you get into that? David Goulden : You can see that -- obviously, we did significantly better on the top line. And I think the place to go to -- I'd say it was fairly balanced across all regions. Obviously, the price we sold on booking window expand the most was in U.S. and Europe. So that's where we got a higher share of summer bookings than we expected to get in Q1. But you see also Asia did very well. And in general, also exceeded our expectations but we didn't have the booking window phenomena there. So I wouldn't call out any particular region but I will call out some of the differences in what we saw across the regions that contributed to the overachievement. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan. Doug Anmuth : Glenn, I just wanted to revisit on AI. Can you just talk about some of the advantages that booking would have in leveraging generative AI versus what other external or potentially new travel services might provide? And do you feel the need to protect the data on your platform to keep it from being used for training broadly across many large language models? Glenn Fogel : Thanks, Doug and very interesting questions about that and I'll break it out into -- you start off with AI, then we went to a specific subset of degenerative AI. Let's just talk in general about AI first and how important this is into our business for many, many, many years, more than a decade perhaps, a machine learning model that really helped us do a better job making sure that what we're presenting to consumer, for example, is really something that they have a higher percentage chance they're going to convert on that. All sorts of ways that we use, very sophisticated machine learning models in many parts of the business that have helped us get us where we are today. Then of course, we come out in the fold, something that is -- the somewhat a lot of people were not that aware of this generative AI, large language models and see what could be done with them. And clearly, anytime there's a major shift in technology, everyone thinks like, well, is this going to be disruptive to the players who are already doing well? Is it not? And I said in my prepared remarks, how I feel very confident of where we are in this because of the work we've done in AI in the past, the number of people we've had working on, the amount of capital we have, our collaborations with universities. I believe that we are going to be benefiting greatly from this new type of technology in many different areas and some we haven't any thought of them yet and some things are going to be easy, perhaps increasing the productivity of our developers which we believe is hopefully going to achieve some very good results in the hopefully not so distant future, to things that perhaps are further away but ways that people interact with us in that connected trip vision, a way that you really do are able to recreate that human travel agent into something that's actually an automated player but is that does so much better than the human being did in the past? Now in terms of your very important question about the data and how do we protect it and not litigate it out and be used by others, that is a very important thing. And everyone from our attorneys to people in our development departments, people who are really working with some of these large language model foundational model people, we are looking very closely. Have they already been using our data and should they be -- and I think there's going to be a lot of interesting regulations in this area that nobody knows the answer yet, too but how will people become and say -- if they're data has been used in the past for training purposes or not. And I think it's a very open question that nobody knows the answer to yet but we will be very interested in the results. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Kopelman from TD Cowen. Kevin Kopelman : Yes. First question, I wanted to ask about ADR's big area of interest. With all the strength you're seeing in Q1, could you just -- and quarter to date, can you touch on how ADRs have trended generally compared to what you're seeing as of the last call. David Goulden : Yes. So when we gave you some data on the call, I mean ADRs are still trending positively. They're up on a year-on-year basis and they're up in -- across all regions on a year-on-year basis. So we're not seeing any slowdown in ADRs. And when we -- we've been looking at some of the things, I'm sure, behind your question but we're not seeing a reduction in ADRs in any region on a year-on-year basis or on a year-on-year basis. So we see ADRs continue to hold very strongly. Kevin Kopelman : Great. And then, one other question. Could you talk about a little bit about the dynamics in the U.S. market. What are you seeing in the U.S. that's causing your growth to be a little bit slower there? And how do you feel about your market share in the U.S. David Goulden : We feel that obviously, our U.S. business is still growing very, very strongly compared to 2019. And we have -- seeing that growth relative to 2019 come down a little bit. But we feel that a part -- we still feel it's -- when you look at how our business is vis-\u00e0-vis 2019 is significantly bigger than it was before and it's still growing at a very healthy rate vis-\u00e0-vis 2019. So we don't really worry about that. Glenn Fogel : And I would just add, my conversations with our partner, some of our biggest partners and with their senior management, the critical thing for me is, are we providing them with what they need? Are we providing incremental business to them that helps them do better in their business? And do you feel that we are valuable to what you need. And I only heard positive things from all the people that I speak to in regards to where we are today versus where we were in the past. And it's a much more complementary relationship and I believe that will help us in the future to continue to build on that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lee Horowitz from Deutsche Bank. Lee Horowitz : Great. Maybe sticking with some of the comments around direct. You guys continue to post impressive direct booking results and app growth. Maybe looking beyond this year, how does this price of execution within the direct channel inform the way you see margin progression beyond 2023? And then, maybe one on VR. [Indiscernible] continue to indicate that you guys seem to be picking up some share in the U.S. vacation rental market, an area where you've been perhaps underrepresented. I guess what do you owe maybe some of the improvements you're seeing within the U.S. VR industry? And then looking forward, what are the things you think you can you need to continue to do in order to really scale up that business in line with some of your competitors? Glenn Fogel : So why don't I start Lee -- going to start with -- as you put it up VR, vacation rental -- I'd like to use alternative accommodation. Neither one is a great customer-friendly term, of course. Let me talk about that and then I'll let David talk about the direct business of what that may or may not indicate when you go into the share in terms of margins down the road. And I talked a little bit about in my prepared remarks about some of the things we are doing in terms of the alternative accommodations area in the U.S. to build that business and you were very polite to say that maybe -- that we may under index where we said, it's very nice to say because I continue to admit that in the past, we have not been hitting that as well as we showed that we were behind where I thought we should be, especially since we do fairly well in that in other parts world, particularly in Europe. Things that we've been doing are things that I talk about, first of all, is you got to make sure you're providing a good service to the people who own the home, who own the apartments. Are we doing things like liability insurance. Well, now we have something like that. Damage waiver type stuff. So we have that. Yes, we do. Last time I talked about how we were testing out an ability to request to book because some people or properties, they don't want to have automatic booking. They want to have a request to book system, so we are developing out back. Once you start getting that in, you had start saying, well, are people aware of your product? Because as I said, there wasn't a lot of -- people didn't have a lot of knowledge that we had such a product. And I was just to joke that if you went down in New York City and you said something on the street and said, I need a place in the Hamptons, where shall I go, I could almost guarantee you they weren't going to say Booking.com. Well, we need to get that supplies once we have it, then we got to make people aware that we have the supplies. We have to build all that. So there's nothing miracle about this. This is [indiscernible] tackling business 101. Get your supply out there, make it attractive and then make sure people know about it and that's what we've been doing, cranking away at it. And I'm pleased and I said it's really nice to see us starting to hit it. It can come up with their mix in the U.S. at all-time high in terms of alternative accommodation in part of our total mix, along with having absolute number of alternative accommodation room night bookings. So I am pleased with the progress that we're making and I know that we had to continue that because I know customers like this product and this is an area where we have growth possibilities. And David, regarding direct only, do you want to? David Goulden : Sure. Direct mix obviously is very tied to our strategy. Our strategy is to build a better product, provide better service for our customers and partners and get those customers to come back to us more frequently and more directly after we've acquired them in the first place to which shall we bring them into the portfolio the first time around. So it really does tie to executing against our strategy and lots of things that we do, many things that we do contribute to that better products. I could talk about alternative accommodation, I can talk about payments, we can talk about adding flights to all these things just create a better service for our customer and therefore, we're more likely to get them back directly. So it's very much tied to our strategy. It is also tied to your financial model because we made the comment last quarter on February, that we're obviously not targeting pre-COVID margin level because of the mix shift in the business for some of these new areas that we're now focused in but we do expect to be able to grow our EBITDA margin above the levels we're at in 2023 and the biggest driver, that would be continue to increase our direct mix. We'd also expect to be able to do better from a leverage on our more fixed costs going forward. And those themselves would kind of more than offset the pressure from the mix of lower-margin businesses as they grow within our portfolio. So continuing to improve our direct mix is very important for both the strategy and the financial model and will be the major sources to be able to provide some margin expansion beyond where we are this year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Colantuoni from Jefferies. John Colantuoni : Hoping you could update us on your strategy in the U.S. market. You've had a lot of success gaining share in recent years but I'm curious if you could update us on your learning so far about sort of the return on investments and how that's informing your aspirations to continue pursuing that opportunity as aggressively as you have been? And second, you sort of characterized investing ahead of the travel recovery to gain share throughout 2021 and 2022. I'm curious if that's your strategy in the Asia Pacific region as that market recovers. And if you have any early reads on returns on that investment. Glenn Fogel : Yes. So I'll start off by saying that I'm very pleased with how the strategy has been working out in the U.S. given our gain in share. As David mentioned, we have a bigger business than we did in 2019. It's been growing nicely. I really do think that it's achieving what we've been trying to accomplish which is to not be the under-indexed player than we were in the past and we're making good progress there. In terms of the absolute ROIs on these things, we don't break them out by region at all. But I will say that, obviously, we are very conscious of spending money the right way to get the right return. And we are -- came out of the business. Previously, I was in China. I know how important is to make sure that you're getting your money's worth to where you're spending it and we are doing that. Now, I think it's just going forward strategy work and to see us continuing in the same thing. And in terms of Asia, it was not dissimilar that we want to make sure when people are going to start traveling, we don't want to wait until you're halfway down the track to get out of the gate. That would not be the best move. Get out in front, be there when the traveller wants to start traveling and providing them with what they want. And that we've been doing and we just talked a little bit about how we were very pleased with the first quarter for Asia growth. And I think, hopefully, it will continue the same way. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan from Wolfe Research. Zachary Morrissey : Great. This is Zach on for Deepak. Just first on the fixed cost [indiscernible] you -- or I guess the first half is kind of tracking above the kind of 20% growth that you kind of outlined last quarter. And the 1Q to 2Q is also kind of sequentially stepping up a little bit here. Just curious on your thoughts on how we should think about the fixed cost growth kind of maybe sequentially kind of into the back half of the year and into next year? And then second on just the buybacks. I think 1Q came in this stronger than we were expecting. Just curious how we should think about kind of the puts and takes in terms of the cadence of buybacks through the rest of the year, is 1Q kind of a good run rate? Or how should we think of that? Glenn Fogel : David, you're the owner of the P&L there, looking that you want to take on the cost. David Goulden : Yes. On the cost side, yes, I mean, we talked about being 25% in the first quarter -- we talked about being 25% in the second quarter. So obviously, that's going to put a little bit of pressure on our guidance for the full year. But what I'd say just generally, when you look at anything that's in the kind of full year view, we've not updated our guidance, there are going to be some -- likely go to be some puts and takes for the full year at the line item level but we're not going to update that line item detail today other than just recommit that we'll have a margin expansion by a couple of points versus 2022. Remember, next year, we said that we do expect our fixed cost to grow more slowly next year than we expect them to grow this year and that continues to be the case. Glenn Fogel : And regarding buybacks, I think we laid it out a little bit. You know what our plan is. You know what we're doing. And I'm not sure there's any more color I can give and we're pleased with where we are. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Jed Kelly from Oppenheimer. Unidentified Analyst : This is Josh [ph] on for Jed. Just wondering, if you can maybe speak to how recent improvements in payments is resonating with U.S. property managers and their opportunity to increase share? Glenn Fogel : Sure, Josh. Payments is an important part of the business. I've talked in the past about how it's the glue that brings everything together, along with making it easier for both the customer traveller and for the partner. And I think the growth in the amount of our business going through payments is a good indicator that is working and being accepted well. Customers have choice, both the traveller and the partner. Both of them can choose to use the payments or not. The fact that it's going up to me would be proof positive that people are finding it useful. And I believe in the long run, it's very -- being very, very helpful as we continue to build out the connected trip further. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Stephen Ju : So Glenn and David, your merchant booking dollars are now at parity with your agency dollars. So just wondering how much of this is due to the ramp in air versus a more proactive choice to consumer may be making and they're lodging product selections -- to your point earlier, to alternative accommodations. And I guess doing more merchant and the rise in deferred merchant bookings there should improve your free cash flow generation. So does this change your capital allocation plans a little bit? David Goulden : On the second question, no, the capital allocation plan that we talked about last quarter, that Glenn summarized earlier, anticipated that we would be continuing to increase our merchant mix. So on that piece, there is no change. In terms of where is that merchant increase coming from, just to remind us all, it's really coming from a mix shift inside of Booking.com where we are moving from what used to be almost entirely an agency model now to a much more balanced model. That is the biggest change would be in accommodations. That's still, by far, the biggest part of the business, although our flights grows, it's having an impact. But what's really driving the changes that you're seeing is the increase in merchant mix across our accommodations business, our Booking.com. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Lee from Mizuho. James Lee : Two here. Can you guys maybe give us an updated outlook on ADRs. I think previously, you talked about expectation being maybe flattish on constant currency for FY '23. And also, David, maybe you can remind us -- talk about some of the puts and takes on take rate for your expectation for 2020. David Goulden : We said that we expect our ADRs for the second quarter just to kind of continue the picture. We expect our ADRs for the second quarter to be up slightly on on-year basis. As I mentioned in one of my earlier answers, we're not out -- we're not updating every single line item on our full year guidance. But if they continue to hold at the current level, there may be a little bit of upside compared to what we said on the last call on ADRs. As I said, there'll be some puts and takes up and down our full set of guidance. But we're not specifically updating our guidance or giving you anything beyond what we're talking about for Q2. We'll have to wait and see how that all develops. But I think you can see from where we were in Q1, plus what we're expecting in Q2, things are trending positively. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Richard Clarke from Bernstein. Richard Clarke : Just the first question was what is the ability for you to continue to get discounts from your hotels? I know the Genius discounts tend to be hotel-funded. And in this travel environment, are they more or less likely to give those? And is that influencing your level of merchandising at all? And could that change if the travel environment altered towards the back half. Glenn Fogel : Richard, look, there's no doubt that hotels, when they are doing well may see less of a need to use all other ways to distribute and get business, then just have to come to them direct, right? And one of the things they're always looking at is what's the return. So with us in Genius, it's really being very targeted with them to make sure they understand how we can get the incremental demand that they wouldn't necessarily be able to get otherwise and then working with them and make sure is this value for them or not. And something I actually talked a bit in the past, I'm not sure on a call but our sales people have worked with hoteliers and talk to them sometimes, well, we're working with Genius program -- the Genius program in or that it's not actually the best use of their money in the best way for the business and told them, look, don't think you should use Genius this way, this amount, this time, whatever other time, etcetera. This is an idea long term, having a good partnership. It's just -- it's not just knocking down the door of hotel, give us discuss, give us discount. That's not how this works. This works with science. This starts with data. This is the machine learning stuff I talked about in the past. This is getting together to come up with a way that we can come up with a better way to improve their business. Now no doubt, as travel improves and such, there's going to be less of a need as the hotels will find other ways and perhaps less expensive ways or more efficient ways for them. And so maybe there will be some place but I am not at all concerned if your point is that this is going to make a drastic difference to how we do our business in the future. I don't see it. I see this as something that's going up more and more central as we continue to develop more ways to provide value to the traveller customer and be able to work with the customer supplier partner in ways that are complementary, symbiotic for all of us that we all win in this, the traveller wins, the hotel winds and we win. Richard Clarke : Okay, perfect sense. Maybe just a little technical question after. You talked about -- you've got $19 billion of merchant bookings in the quarter. You've talked about longer booking windows but your deferred merchant booking is only at $4.5 billion. Just trying to square the gap between the $19 billion and the $4.5 billion that we see there. Glenn Fogel : Richard, you're confusing me on this one. David Goulden : Richard, you [indiscernible] spoke on that one. Richard Clarke : The deferred merchant booking line which is $4.5 billion on your balance sheet, how does that square with you getting $19 billion of bookings -- merchant bookings in the quarter that you're saying are largely for future quarters? David Goulden : Richard, why don't we follow up with you offline on that one and try and progress all down? Just to understand the question, make sure we get you the answer. And if others want -- just to give us the answer, we can follow up to them as well. But we'll touch base with you offline. John will call you back. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Glenn Fogel, I turn the call back over to you. Glenn Fogel : Thank you. So as always, I want to thank our partners, our customers, our dedicated employees and our shareholders. We appreciate your support as we continue to build on the long-term vision for our company. Thank you, everyone and good night. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

And now, I'd like to introduce Booking Holdings speakers for this afternoon, Glenn Fogel and David Goulden. Go ahead, gentlemen. Glenn Fogel : Thank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings' second quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. I am pleased to report that in the second quarter we continue to see robust leisure travel demand which helped drive the strong results we are announcing today. The 268 million room nights booked in the second quarter increased by 9% year-over-year and gross bookings of $39.7 billion grew 15% year-over-year and was the highest quarterly gross bookings ever. Both room nights and gross bookings came in ahead of our previous expectations as a result of the favorable demand environment. Revenue growth of 27% in Q2 also nicely outperformed our expectations. The strong top line results in the quarter combined with better-than-expected marketing efficiency helped drive our Q2 adjusted EBITDA to about $1.8 billion which is an increase of 64% versus Q2 last year, and meaningfully exceeded our prior growth expectations of about 35%. Looking at the month of July we have seen an acceleration in year-over-year room night growth relative to the 9% growth we reported for Q2. We estimate July room nights increased by about 20% year-over-year benefiting from the easier comparison to July 2022. Overall, we have been very pleased to see our strong performance in the first half of the year which has benefited from the continued strength and resiliency of overall travel demand. Our solid start to the year combined with what we currently believe will be a new all-time high for Q3 summer travel period results and an improved outlook for the full year which David will discuss in detail in his comments. While the near-term results and outlook are encouraging we remain focused on what is important for the business for the long term which means making the necessary investments to strengthen and grow our enterprise while simultaneously remaining cost conscious. We are seeing progress and momentum across several important initiatives, which will help strengthen our business over the long term. These initiatives include advancing our Connected Trip vision, further integrating AI technology into our offerings, continuing to grow alternative accommodations, and building more direct relationships with our travel bookers. Starting with the Connected Trip : this is our long-term vision to make booking and experiencing travel easier, more personal, and more enjoyable, while delivering better value to our traveler customers and supplier partners. To be clear, this is not a discrete product we will introduce at some point in the future, instead this is a meaningfully enhanced way for a booker to experience and utilize Booking.com. Over time you will see incremental improvements and enhancements to our platform that move us another step closer to this long-term vision, and importantly, this approach allows us to realize benefits while we are building towards that future state. We believe that the current travel experience is much more complicated, fragmented, and frustrating to travelers than it should be and, eventually, our Connected Trip vision will greatly improve it via technology. Looking at the other side of the travel marketplace, we believe that our supplier partners will also benefit greatly from the Connected Trip as it will provide more opportunities to personalize and merchandise their offerings. We continue to build out our Connected Trip vision and have much more work to do, but we are pleased with the progress we have seen so far and expect it to ultimately result in increased customer and supplier engagement with our platform. We have always envisioned the Connected Trip as having AI technology at its center. Across our company, we have a long history with investing in AI technology and incorporating it into our platforms in order to optimize interactions with both our travelers and partners. This is an area where we believe we are well positioned given we have built strong teams of AI experts and gained valuable experience from using AI extensively for years. In addition to the many current applications for AI on our platforms, we believe that we can build an even more compelling and differentiated offering for our bookers if we can leverage AI technology to deliver a more personalized booking experience : A Connected Trip that would be more responsive to a booker\u2019s needs and help manage different aspects of their trips. Generative AI may play an important role in delivering that Connected Trip experience to our bookers, and our teams have been hard at work to integrate this exciting technology into our offerings in innovative ways, for example, In early July, Priceline unveiled its 2023 Summer Release, which delivered over 40 new booking tools and upgrades, including Penny. Penny is Priceline\u2019s generative AI travel assistant. Priceline has currently positioned Penny at the \u201cend-of-the-funnel\u201d on the checkout page where Penny can answer travel related questions that a customer may have when they have reached the checkout page. Penny is built on Priceline\u2019s own proprietary technology and data, and also leverages large language model technology to power its conversational capabilities. The combination of these technologies allows for innovations like the ability to make a booking directly in the chat interface. The Priceline team is rapidly gaining insights on booker questions, concerns, and behavior as Penny continues to interact with customers. The plan is to further enhance Penny over time by leveraging those valuable learnings. Around the same time as Priceline\u2019s Summer Release, Booking.com launched its own AI Trip Planner, which began rolling out on the mobile app in the US to Genius customers. In contrast to Penny the AI trip planner sits towards the top of the funnel, where travelers are in the discovery and planning processes for their trips. Built upon the foundation of Booking.com's existing machine learning models that recommend accommodation options to millions of travelers on the platform every day the AI trip planner is also partially powered by large language mall technology to create a conversational experience for people to start their planning processes. The AI trip planner advances planning by providing travelers with a rich visual list of destinations and properties including Booking.com's live pricing information with deep links to view more details on the options. From the chat interface of the AI trip planner bookers can tap on any recommended accommodation they're interested in and then complete the reservation. Accretive to our approach here is to marry our own proprietary data and machine learning models with degenerative AI technology. This allows us to provide a conversational interface with the traveler while leveraging our own recommendation engine to provide accurate detail and real-time information on the property recommendations. Like Priceline, the Booking.com team is already gaining valuable insights from the interactions with bookers even though the trip planner is in beta and is still currently in a relatively limited rollout. While we are excited by these new advances at Booking.com and Priceline it is of course still very early days and we have much more to learn about how customers will ultimately want to interact with this new technology. In addition, we mentioned last quarter that [indiscernible] like Kayak were Experian [ph] with AI plug-ins. And we will continue to examine all areas of our company to ensure we are taking advantage of AI-created efficiencies. We are confident in our company's ability to benefit from AI development and improve our products for our customers given our many years' experience in AI our travel-related data and connections to our supply partners and our human and financial capital. Across our businesses, we have two equally important customers our travelers and our supply partners with each representing one side of our marketplace. For our supply partners, we strive to be a trusted and valuable partner for all accommodation types on our platform and we look to add value for our partners by delivering incremental demand in developing products and features to help support their businesses. One area of focus for us on the supply side continues to be our alternative accommodation offering at Booking.com. Alternative accommodation room nights grew faster than our traditional hotel category at about 11% year-over-year for the second quarter and represented about 34% of Booking.com's total room nights, which is two percentage points higher than in Q2 2022. This is a new all-time high mix of our total room nights. We are pleased to see continued momentum in terms of alternative accommodation of supply growth both globally and in the U.S. with global listings reaching about $7 million by the end of the second quarter which is about 8% higher than Q2 last year. We aim to build on this progress by continuing to improve the product for our supply partners and travelers particularly in the U.S. For our travelers, we remain focused on building a better experience that leads to increased loyalty, frequency, spend and direct relationships over time. In the second quarter, our mix of customers booking directly on our platforms continue to increase year-over-year. We see a very high level of direct bookings in the mobile app which is an important platform as it allows us more opportunities to engage directly with travelers and we believe will result in increased traveler loyalty. About 48% of our room nights were booked through our apps in the second quarter which is about six percentage points higher than in Q2 2022 an acceleration in the mix shift compared to Q1 and all-time high in terms of mix of bookings coming from our mobile apps. We will continue our efforts to enhance the app experience to build on the recent success we have seen here. In conclusion, I am encouraged by the strength of travel demand so far this year and signs of what we expect to be a record summer travel season. Our teams continue to innovate and execute well against our key strategic priorities which helps us position our business well for the long-term. We remain focused on delivering a better offering and experience for our customers both our supply partners and our travelers alike. We are as confident as ever in the long-term growth of travel and the opportunities ahead for our company. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden. David Goulden : Thank you, Glenn and good afternoon. I'll review our results for the second quarter as well as our thoughts for Q3 and for the full year. All growth rates for 2023 are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise indicated. We will be making some references to the comparable periods in 2019, where we think these are helpful. Information, regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. We will post our prepared remarks to the Booking Holdings Investor Relations website, after the conclusion of the earnings call. Now on to our second quarter results, again it's a tough year-over-year comparison in the second quarter, due to a strong rebound in travel after Omicron in Q2 last year. We were pleased to have blurred 9% room night growth in Q2 which was a few percentage points better than our expectations. Looking at our year-over-year room night growth by region in the second quarter, Asia was up over 40%. Rest of world was up low-double digits. Europe was up a couple of points and the US was down slightly. It's helpful to remember that the US was very strong last Q2 and stronger than Q1 and Q3 versus 2019 due to a rebound from Omicron. Compared to 2019, our Q2 global room night growth was 26% which was in line with Q1. For the second quarter, all our major regions grew at a similar rate versus 2019. In Q2, the booking window of Booking.com expanded further versus 2019 than it did in Q1. The Q2 booking window of Booking.com also expanded versus 2022. As Glenn mentioned, our mobile apps represented about 48% of our total room nights in the quarter, which was about six percentage points higher than the second quarter of 2022. We continue to see an increased mix of our room nights coming to us through the direct channel. The direct channel increased as a percentage of our room nights in the second quarter relative to the second quarter of 2022. For the first time since the onset of the pandemic, in Q2, we saw the international mix of our room nights fully recover to 2019 levels. Our cancellation rates in the second quarter were higher than Q2 2022 as the second quarter of 2022, benefited from the strong recovery in new bookings following the relaxation of travel restrictions in many parts of the world post-Omicron. Our cancellation rates in the second quarter continue to be below 2019 levels. For our alternative accommodations at Booking.com, our Q2 room night growth was about 11% year-over-year and the global mix of our tag recombination room it was about 34% which was higher than about 32% in Q2 2022 versus 2019, alternative combination room night growth was about 38%. Q2 gross bookings increased 15% year-over-year, or 16% on a constant currency basis. The 15% increase in gross bookings was six points higher than the 9% room night increase due to 5% higher accommodation constant currency ADRs and also due to a couple points from flight bookings, partially offset by the one percentage point of negative impact from FX movements. Our accommodation constant currency ADRs were negatively impacted by regional mix due to a higher mix of room nights from Asia and a lower mix of room nights from the US. Excluding regional mix, constant currency ADRs were up about nine percentage points year-over-year. Despite the higher ADRs in the second quarter, we have not seen a change in the mix of hotel star-rating levels being booked or changes in length of stay that could indicate that consumers are trading down. We continue to watch these dynamics closely. Airline tickets booked in the second quarter were up about 58% year-over-year, driven by the continued expansion of Booking.com\u2019s Flight offering. Revenue for the second quarter came in nicely ahead of our expectations, increasing 27% year-over-year, or about 28% on a constant currency basis. Q2 revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was about 130 basis points above last year, which was about in line with our expectations. Our underlying accommodation take rates continue to be in line with 2019 levels. Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line, increased 4% year-over-year. Marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings was about 50 basis points lower than Q2 2022 due to higher ROIs in our paid channels and a higher mix of direct business. Performance marketing ROIs increased year-over-year due in part to our ongoing efforts to improve the efficiency of our marketing spend. Marketing and merchandising combined as a percentage of gross bookings in Q2 was about 60 basis points lower than last year, which was better than our expectation. Relative to our expectation, this was primarily due to better ROIs in our paid channels, as well as lower than expected merchandising spend, which was impacted by the booking window being more expanded than we expected in the quarter which will push merchandising expense into future periods at the time revenue is recognized. Sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings were up about 30 basis points compared with last year, a bit better than our expectation. About 48% of Booking.com\u2019s gross bookings were processed through our payments platform in Q2, up from about 38% in Q2 2022. Our more fixed expenses in aggregate were up 20% year-over-year, which was below our expectation due to lower IT expenses in the quarter, including some impact from phasing of IT spend into later in the year. We continue to manage our more fixed expenses very carefully. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.8 billion in the second quarter, which was up 64% year-over-year, and would have been up 70% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA was well above our expectation due to the stronger topline, the efficiencies in marketing and merchandising, and lower than expected IT expenses. Our adjusted EBITDA margins increased by about 7 percentage points versus Q2 2022. Non-GAAP net income of $1.4 billion in the second quarter resulted in non-GAAP EPS of $37.62 per share, which was up 97% year-over-year. Our average share count in the second quarter was 9% below Q2 2022 and 15% below Q2 2019. On a GAAP basis, we had net income of $1.3 billion in the quarter. Now on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q2 ending cash and investment balance of $15.7 million was up versus our Q1 ending balance of $15.3 billion due to the $1.9 billion of debt issuances in May 2023 and the $1.6 billion of free cash flow generated in the second quarter offset by the $3.1 billion in share repurchases we completed in the quarter. In the first half of the year, we repurchased $5.1 billion of our shares, which represented 5% and of our year end 2022 share count. The repurchases so far this year take our combined authorization down to $19 billion from the $24 billion we discussed earlier in the year. We remain comfortable with our ability to complete the full $24 billion of share repurchases within four years from when we started the program at the beginning of this year assuming no major downturn in the travel environment. Now on to our thoughts for the third quarter of 2023. In July, we saw year-over-year room night growth of about 20% up from 9% in Q2. Looking across our major regions, in July we saw Asia up about 45%; rest of World up over 20%; Europe up mid-teens; and the US up mid single-digits. When comparing versus 2019 July room night growth was in a similar range to the 26% growth in Q2. The US was our most recovered region with growth at over 30% versus 2019. Our comments for the third quarter made the assumption that room night growth will be up low double digits year-on-year assuming some moderation in growth from July due in part to harder prior year comparables in August and September. You'll recall from our commentary on the third quarter of 2022 that room night growth versus 2019 was 4% in July 2022 and 10% in August and September 2022. In addition, we expect that due to expanded booking window in the first half of the year stayed in Q3, but there will be fewer last-minute bookings for stays in the rest of Q3. We expect Q3 gross bookings to grow about seven points faster the room nights on a year-on-year basis due to a few points from continued flight bookings growth and a few points of positive impact from FX movements. We expect accommodation constant currency ADRs to be about in line with Q3 2022 including a couple of points of pressure from the changes in regional mix. We expect Q3 revenue as a percentage of gross bookings to be around 19% slightly above last year due to a more positive impact from timing in part due to the expanded booking window in the first half of this year and from increased revenue from payments. We expect these will be partially offset by a higher mix of flights and increased merchandising spend some of which is related to bookings we received earlier in the year. We expect Q3 marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings to be lower than last year. We expect marketing and merchandising combined as a percentage of gross bookings in Q3 to be slightly lower than last year. We expect Q3 sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings to be about 20 basis points higher last year primarily due to higher gross bookings mix. We expect our more fixed expenses in Q3 to grow year-over-year about 30% due to higher personnel and related expenses, higher IT expenses including the impact of phasing from Q2, and higher indirect taxes in G&A. The year-over-year growth in our more fixed expenses includes about seven percentage points from changes in FX. The difference between the 20% growth in our more fixed expenses in Q2 and a 30% growth in Q3 is driven mainly by FX and major one. Taking all into account, we expect adjusted -- we expect Q3 adjusted EBITDA to be around 20% higher than last year. Given the strong level of bookings that we've seen, we are updating our commentary for the full year. We currently expect gross bookings to grow slightly over 20%, up from our previous expectation for low teens growth. We expect full year room night growth in the mid-teens and constant currency combination ADRs were up slightly for the year, including a couple of points of pressure from changes in regional mix. We currently expect revenue as a percentage of gross bookings to increase year-over-year by about 20 basis points down from our previous expectation of 50 basis points increase. The reduction in our full year take rate is driven by less of a benefit from timing including due to the higher growth rate we expected earlier in this year and also due to expanded booking window. Also, from stronger performance, which drove a higher mix of flights than expected earlier in the year. We currently expect marketing merchandising, as a percentage of gross bookings to be slightly below in 2022 as compared to our previous expectation for it to be similar to 2022. The improvements in our expectation is driven primarily by higher ROIs in off paid channels. We currently expect our more fixed expenses to grow about 25% up from our previous expectation to around 20%. The increase in our expectation is driven primarily by variable components of personnel expense due to the overperformance versus expectations at the start of the year as well as higher indirect taxes which are generally tied to revenues and some additional FX pressure. We manage our more fixed expenses very carefully and continue to expect our more fixed expenses next year to grow at an appreciably lower rate than this year. We continue to expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to expand by a couple of percentage points versus 2022. In closing, we are pleased with our year-to-date results and the momentum in the business that we moved into Q3. We'll now move to Q&A. Adam, can you please open the lines? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with UBS. Your line is open. Lloyd Walmsley : Great. Thanks. Two if I can. First thanks for some of the color on the Gen AI trip planners you guys have rolled out. Wondering how you guys think about that strategically and balance that with what search engines are doing. Do you think this brings you guys more direct traffic, or do you think when you look at what some other players like Google are doing with their new search experience like how that might change traffic flows in the travel space? And then second one you mentioned marketing ROI improvements and efforts to improve efficiency. Is that a function of just making higher ROI targets or just other changes you're making within marketing? Any commentary you can give there would be great. Thanks. Glenn Fogel : Lloyd, why don't I take the first one about AI and then I'll let David talk about marketing and ROIs. So first and while it's an easy answer, it's the true answer, which is nobody knows yet how there's a very new technology generative AI how that's going to play out in the long run. That's one. Two, even though we don't know how it's going to come out, we know it's very important that we continue to do everything we can to explore experiment see what might be very helpful to our travelers and to our supply partners too along with internally to do things better internally for us. Every company is doing that including the big search engines like Google and they're coming out what they can do and nobody knows. A couple of things though I am fairly certain that history provides a good road map. And that is there will be changes but companies that are able to adapt quickly be agile have great technology experts will benefit from these kinds of changes. We saw it as things for example like when the mobile for came out, we were able to adapt quickly adjust and we got I think a very good advantage from that. I think that we will hopefully get the same type of benefits as this new technology Generate AI comes out. But one thing I didn't mention in the prepared remarks was, I mentioned all the companies, but I didn't mention Agoda. So Agoda is doing some very good things in terms of internally how can we use Gen AI to become more efficient with all types of code co-pilot type systems. So there are lots of different things that we're playing with all one. I'm really happy the way that we're doing from different directions having price line doing it at the bottom of the phone see how that works. Doing Booking.com's AI Trip Planner tops how that's doing that. The ChatGPT plug-ins from open table and from Kaya. So being able to do all these things from the different brands and being able to learn from each other, what works, what doesn't work, where should you put more emphasis where should we put less emphasis. I think that will help us have an advantage over many other companies that may not have the scale experts the -- basically the capital to put into what could be a very, very exciting future for us. We'll see how it plays out. And of course, nobody knows how regulations are going to play into this and that is something that could affect everybody. And David, I don't know if you want to talk about the market ROIs. David Goulden : Yeah. Sure. Thank you, I will. Lloyd thanks for the question. So first of all, let's clarify that this is not a change in our approach relative to our design to lean in this year to recovery in travel market. We're still leading in through a recovering travel market. And you can see from our top line numbers we're doing quite well. So that hasn't changed and marquee merchandising investment in total will still be higher this year than it was in 2019, it kind of goes hand-in-hand with that lead-in comment. What I would say and what you're seeing is within that envelope, as we look for ways to optimize our marketing spend we've done a little bit more optimization than we expected not going into all the components of where that's happening. But we're looking at channels for incrementality or return to direct things like that and consistently testing across a very large marketing spend. You see that during the quarter we spent about $1.8 billion on marketing. So it's a large amount of money that we're spending across that spectrum. We are always looking at ways to kind of optimize different spend, different channels and different approaches. So it's really more to do with our ongoing effort to improve the efficiency of our marketing spend. But again, within the context we're still leaning in and looking to take share as the market continues to recover from COVID. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore. Your line is open. Mark Mahaney : Okay. Two questions please. First Glenn, have you noticed any changes in the type of travel demand? And I mean, short versus longer stay, rural suburban versus urban. And then, I wanted to ask the CFO question on AI, which is when you think about the impact that AI has had and Gen AI could have on the business from a financial perspective, do you think that that's -- Dave, do you think that's more likely to be on the monetization side or on the cost efficiency side? And I'm sure you're going to say both, but if you could be a little bit more -- if you have any more specifics on which of those you think could be more and could be more impacted by the application of Gen AI over time? Thanks a lot. Glenn Fogel : Hi, Mark, I'm smiling because I want to do number two first and to say both. But I'll do it in the order you gave it. So this is a question that comes up a lot because -- and I mentioned in the last call about how I'm always looking for the smoke signals is something changing. And some of the key things I always look at are people trading down in terms of star ratings, or are people going for a lower length of stay. Or are people shifting to areas that may be cheaper travel than what previously was more expensive travel, always looking for some sort of early warning signal that something is happening. And I do not see that yet. I do not see that in any of those areas. And that's what we're seeing right now. In terms of the AI, it's a very interesting question. And, of course, if we knew the answer we have a good sense of where should we be putting most of our investment dollars in our people put them into the area is going to give us the best return. But the things I mentioned in the first question, nobody knows the answer to these things. These are all just guesses. So at this stage it's very important to spread the bets around and see where the return is coming to see where we want to put people to work, put more money to work and see what's going to come back. One of the DNA of our company has always been experiment, see what works and keep pushing in what's better working better than other areas. So we're going to be doing a lot of different experimentation. And I think that's going to go on for some time before we really have a good sense where the best returns are. I think in the long run, of course, all -- both things you mentioned are going to give tremendous benefits to everybody. But if you're correct to ask the question, which things first and how much? And that is not known yet. Mark Mahaney : Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Your line is open. Justin Post : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Obviously, very strong in Asia, maybe talk a little bit about what you're seeing there? And are you able to take some share from direct bookings at hotels or competitors? And then I thought your marketing ROI comment was very interesting in a very crowded quarter for marketing spend. So can you talk about -- is it the direct traffic that's helping you be more judicious with your marketing spend, or how are you getting that way up? Glenn Fogel : So I'll let David speak second about if you want to give any more color into the marketing question. I'll leave out Asia. So, yes, very pleased with Asia. Very nice to see the second quarter numbers and even nicer to see July accelerating like that. That's great. And, obviously, that's a function of Asia took more time to recover the restrictions dropped later. We're doing a year-over-year comp. So we're getting some benefit out of that. And by the way just everybody there is no confusion in China not producing significant they're far behind in terms of outbound recovery and we're much more an outbound player there and I don't expect a recovery in China for us for some time, significant time probably. So overall it's good. There are a lot of factors happening there. There are very similar to other parts of the world where people wanted to travel. They're going out there. They're doing it. And we have done a very good job, the same way we did in the US, and we did in Europe is making sure that when people wanted a trial we were there for them and we're seeing the results right there. And David if you want to give any more color into that marketing question? David Goulden : Yes. Justin, I think I gave a fair amount of color in my first answer, so I'm not going to repeat it. You did ask about when the direct makes place into this as well. And yes obviously as our direct mix is increasing as we commented it continues to do so. That helps but we're also getting helped from just looking across our total spend on marketing and looking at pockets of efficiency using some of the areas I talked about earlier. Justin Post : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Kopelman with TD Cowen. Your line is open. Kevin Kopelman : Great. Thanks a lot. Could you give us an update on your efforts and progress in the North America vacation rental market just where you're at on that initiative? Thank you. Glenn Fogel : Hi Kevin. So, I'm very pleased that we're continuing to advance while we talked about the overall -- we'll call it alternative accommodations is the way we define that area. We talk globally about our 11% growth being faster then the 9% for the overall company that 11% was a Booking.com number. But in terms of North America specifically are less reduced to the US which is the area where I think we all are more focused on. We have said many, many times I have seen many, many times that's an area of focus for us. We know we're under index. We know the areas we had to improve the product. And we talked in the last call, we called [indiscernible] for that too probably. About the things we're doing to improve it and that is both on the supply side making sure we're improving things so that people who own homes, people manage apartments, people who are in this space say, I'm sorry, but Booking.com, you're not doing certain things that you need to do for me. I'm glad that we are doing those things they will then be willing and are being to list their properties on our platform. That's great. And on the other side as I talked about last time is the importance okay, we got the properties now. We've got to make sure people know about it and I talked last time again about awareness and then we need to bring that up to. This is not a thing you saw overnight. This is something that you day by day, step-by-step grind it out and that's what we're doing in all different areas and we're seeing the progress. So, are we there? Yes? No, not even close to there yet. But the good thing is we're making the progress and that's all upside for us down the road. So we're going to keep on plugging away at it and I think we'll continue to experience good returns as we continue to invest in the area. Kevin Kopelman : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Doug Anmuth : Thanks for taking the questions. Can you talk about where you're seeing the biggest impacts of connected trip? And how big of an impact do you think that's happening in terms of your outsized growth in the quarter? And then just switching to mobile the 48% of room nights booked through the apps. Anything you can share in terms of better frequency and loyalty among those app users? Glenn Fogel : So I'll leave the second one what David wants to actually reveal in that area of specifics. I'm not sure if he does or doesn't. Regarding the connected trip a couple of things on that. So let's start off right at the start that, the Connect trip is not producing material numbers increases in our -- what we're doing right now. The good numbers that we're showing right now are not because of a connected trip and it's just too small to show that. Imagine we're building it in orange -- until every piece is in place. You're not getting a lot of advantage from this arch. Right now build in the arch. So you see parts that are showing up but not the big effect. So for example really happy about one element which is you have to have a flight product. And we're doing 58% year-over-year growth in tickets and flights that's greater \u2013 I mean that's a really good number. It shows that we're producing a good flight product, we'll get that going. And then the other areas that we have to build out like things like the attractions, things like the right part gets to you from the hotel to the airport or from your home to the airport things like that. Building all those things out. And then of course, the glue payments. That's very important to make sure the whole thing is working correctly. We're able to give benefits value to both the traveler and enable our suppliers to have an opportunity to give types of benefits so they'll win that deal. These are things we need payments to do and we're making great progress and really happy to see that number up there they're 48% in the growth from last year. So all these elements are being worked on but that is not what's producing the very good returns in Q2. The flip side that says, look at all the potential future we have down the road. That's really encouraging to me. So I'm very happy where we are. I'm glad with the progress we're making but it should not be misthought that this is the thing that's produced Q2's numbers. And David I don't know if you want to talk about mobile app anything there in terms of repeat? David Goulden : Yes. Thank you. So Doug, you're going to ask the question? Doug Anmuth : No, go ahead. David Goulden : So in terms of when you think about what's happening with the app. There are three ways of people can interact with us directly. They can come through the app. They can come to us directly on a desktop device and come to a strictly on a mobile device. And out of those three not too surprisingly, the app is the \u2013 is the sickest channel in terms of frequency and loyalty as you mentioned, which is why obviously your app is now a very high percentage of direct and has become an increasing usage of direct and we think that's a good thing. But relative to differences in frequency and loyalty we're not in a position to get into those today but it is definitely our best channel in terms of frequency and loyalty. Glenn Fogel : And Doug, one other thing I want to add to this is Doug is the importance of the app and the connected trip. It's one of the important parts along with the other ones because one of the things that we really believe is important when you're traveling is to get advice, deals all sorts of things that you want to have your travel agent in your pocket. Well in your phone, that is the travel agent in the pocket. And then you throw on top of this all the Gen AI stuff all that. There's some real potential opportunities down the road that people are traveling they're going to have a much better experience than they have had in the past and that's what I'm looking for down the road. Doug Anmuth : Thank you, Glenn and David. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lee Horowitz with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Lee Horowitz : Great, thanks. Your direct booking mix improvement remain impressive. I guess for starters can you help us unpack what drove the acceleration in mix towards direct in the quarter? Something specific on your run that you guys are doing that drove that improvement quarter-on-quarter? And how should we take that being replicated going forward? And then secondly, are we getting to a point where direct mix may fully offset your growth into lower-margin business and thus over time allow you to actually walk margins back towards 2019 levels? Just any commentary there in terms of direct mix and margins over time would be helpful. Thanks so much. Glenn Fogel : Hi, Lee. I'll let David talk about whether or not he wants to talk about where the margins may go with that but I'll talk to just in general why do we continue quarter-after-quarter it seems to be improving our direct mix. And I believe the reason is because people like the product. That's the thing that helps. I've used it and they decide to come back because we're giving the best prices. We're going to most select selection, the greatest election. We're making it easier for them to do it. And we're providing great customer service something goes wrong to fix it. The reason I use and I'm not going to list some other new retail online retailers, there are some big ones I use. I use a need cash. I do it because it's better. And in the end, that's what wins as customers interest they come back with a better product, when the people believe in trust is the reason, people are loyal to a brand. That's what we're building here. And I believe, that's why we are slowly incrementally building out that direct mix. I think that's the biggest thing for me. David, you can add if you want to add anything to that? And also I'm not sure what you want to talk about in terms of margins, where people come direct and what that may do in the long run to our margin profile, EBITDA margin profile. David Goulden : Yes. Lee, we obviously go next is very helpful for the business. And of course, we're talking about here really direct mix within our accommodations business, is kind of core business. And we've mentioned before, that we believe that we can continue to improve margins, a little bit from where they were in 2023, but we're not trying to walk them all the way back to where they were in 2019. We all have significant businesses that are lower margin businesses than we had in 2019, when we have a large price business we're moving towards having a life payments business. So, direct mix can obviously, offset some of the pressure in the business. But don't expect it to walk our margins back to 2019. That's not what we've talked about gains, but we do believe it's one of the factors that can lead us to have continued improvement from where we are now. Lee Horowitz : Helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Eric Sheridan : Thank you so much for taking the questions. Maybe against your broader long-term goals for growth that you called out earlier in your comments. Would love to get any update about how you're feeling about supply growth, with respect to shared accommodations and/or local experiences against continuing to diversify supply, and build out more elements of the connected trip. And how do those factor in as elements of investment beyond 2023, looking out into next year? Thanks so much. Glenn Fogel : Hi, Eric. So the important thing is always priorities. What's the most important thing -- and we've mentioned numerous times, in terms of our alternative accommodations, how important it is to continue to build out the supply there. We have a large number of listings, that's true. I've talked about many times though, you have to have the right type of listing in the right locations. And we talked in the past, and it's not done yet in the US, getting the right accommodations, in the right places, so that we -- you will come they have something to buy. That's very important. That's top priority. When you ship down to something like attractions, not as important right now, it's important but it's not as high a priority, as getting an ultra combination. That's one of the most critical things, is making sure we're spending the time, energy, effort and money in the place they're giving us the best return. We have good attractions, from third-party connections. We have the key ones. And someday, it will be important to build out further along that. But for right now, for this year and next year, I want to make sure that we're going to have the bigger bang for the buck, which is being sure we have the right number and the right types of alternative accommodations on our platform. Eric Sheridan : Super clear. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jed Kelly with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Jed Kelly : Hi. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Just going back to the US business. You highlighted mid-single-digit growth in the US. Can you talk about how that's trending relative to your competitors? And does that number does that capture the amount of Americans traveling over to Europe, or is that including in your European road lights? Glenn Fogel : Yeah. David, I'll let you go on both those. I mean I'm not sure what you want to talk about in terms of us versus competitors or not. David Goulden : Yes. Let me clarify. First of all, when we talk about these regions on a geography basis we're talking about on a book basis. So yes, Glenn it does capture bookings being made by U.S. travelers including those that are moving overseas, which is one of the reasons why we're getting growth. We mentioned that we're back to a mid-single-digit growth in July in the U.S. after seeing a very small decline in growth in Q2. And actually, that was really just April and May. By the time we got to June, we were back to growth as well. And then the April May comparisons relate you to the really strong rebound we saw particularly in those months when the old player was declared in Omicron last year. So we got a little bit of a funky comparison on there. So I think we're doing well in the marketplace. It's too early to kind of call how we see us doing any against the market for a single quarter. We like to kind of look at that on a longer-term basis you can look at how the year pans out. I would just point out that relative to the market, we mentioned in July when over 30% growth in the U.S. versus 2019 not significantly well ahead of any market data points. Market is perhaps closer to breakeven maybe slightly positive compared to 2019. We're up 30. So we tend to look at it over the longer period of time and we'll have a better view on exactly, how we're doing in the U.S. relative to the market as the year develops and as the year ends. As Glenn mentioned, we're pleased with many of our programs there. We also know there's a lot of upside for us to continue to push more into the U.S. marketplace. Glenn Fogel : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Brignall with Redburn. Your line is open. Alex Brignall : Hi, guys. Thank you. Glen must have taken a question. I just have one on the full year guidance. Obviously, the big change are the revenue divided by growth being up only 0.2% year-on-year. So could you just talk a little bit about how that will map next year? Obviously pulling forward some bookings brings forward the marketing and also therefore it has the impact on EBITDA. But can you talk about the longer-term dynamic presumably that has no impact on 2024 and on the margin trajectory you see going forward? David Goulden : Yes, Alex let me take that. So yes, I mean as you called out in the prepared remarks there are two factors that are causing us to take the guidance to take rates to call our number down a little bit from where we were before. And actually, both of kind of what I call good things happening within the business. So the first is that the business is growing faster and the booking window has steel on gate compared to where we thought we'd be this year which means that we're not going to get all the benefit from timing recovery this year. Some of that timing recovery will be delayed into next year. So that we should get back as a positive that piece of the reduction will get back as positive next year. The fact that flight is growing faster than we expect is also putting a little bit of pressure on margin. But as Glenn said, that's a good thing as well because we are building out more capabilities and more opportunities to work with our customers across connected transactions. So those are the two main dynamics, one of which we will get back in terms of the timing recovery, which we thought would happen this year will now happen more likely over two years. Alex Brignall : Okay. That's really helpful David. Thank you. As a follow-up, one of the things that's obviously changed is that some of your marketing dollars, which come below the revenue line have turned into merchandising dollars above the revenue line. And so it seems really like that revenue line is very, very hard to model. If we were to think of things in terms of EBITDA divided by gross bookings, is there any meaningful reason why your core business or the accommodation business outside of payments and flights and all of the sort of businesses that dilute that bigger should not see a return to pre-COVID profitability if not improvement if you increase direct mix. So if I just think accommodation EBITDA divided by gross bookings is there any reason why that should be less profitable in the future than it was before COVID. David Goulden : That's obviously a different way of looking at the EBITDA margins than we do but you're right obviously some of the contra revenue because of merchandising impacting the revenue line. The diet mix will obviously help overcome pressures in the accommodation business. Obviously, it seems like alternatives become slightly bigger seeing Asia becomes slightly bigger. So I think when we've talked about the long-term model for the business, assume that the core accommodations business can get back to in the rough region where it was 2019-ish and then the impact on EBITDA margins in the overall business will be driven by the mix of some of the newer businesses will become quite large in terms of particularly payments and flights neither which were a major factor in 2019. What I would point to is as I step back further and say what we've committed to for our long-term more, which I think is very important compared to 2019 is we have a business that is larger on the top line and the bottom line and growing faster the top line and the bottom line than it did in 2019. And that I think is the overall commitment that we've made that we're very convinced will stick to that I think will help drive your thinking about the overall model. Alex Brignall : So I guess it's crucial to think of the additional businesses as incremental to your core business. David Goulden : That's the last way to think about building the model out to look at our future EBITDA, yes. Alex Brignall : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with Citigroup. Your line is open. Ron Josey : Great. Thanks for taking the question. And really helpful to hear all the stats and see everything go as well this quarter. Glenn, I wanted to take you back maybe a year ago, we talked about growing bookings share of annual spend per customer. And as we see direct bookings increases to increase the connected trips rise, AI trip planners launch, just talk to us about the progress of just gaining share of that annual spend per customer. Any updated goals there? Thank you. Glenn Fogel : So Ron, let me try, understand the question. You're saying the annual spend per customer is that, right? Ron Josey : So percentage share of travel spend. Yes. I think we talked about getting like 25% a year ago or something. Glenn Fogel : Yes right. So clearly part of the issue is that our customers, I'm happy about this, they don't always use us. Sometimes they use a competitor. And we see that. We see that unfortunately more than I'd like. Part of it is not having a product that they want. That's one thing, which we're building out as we talked a little bit about. And the other thing is post things that there's -- they go for example internationally will go for this brand and by domestic on that one. The key thing for us is to develop that loyalty that the reason that somebody really thinks that they will come to us for any travel will come to us. So part of it is bring all this together with the connected trip. Bring it all together with payment, developing the more we learn about the customer with their permission of course and then providing them with the -- what they may want more than anyone else. So they will always come back to us for all this. What do I believe in the end it could be to I believe that in the end we could have all customers all the time of course not. But I hope that we can continue to improve this substantially in the long run. And we'll see that as we get to finish off some of these areas though that we're still building out. Things like making sure we have enough of those alternative accommodations from people so he wants it we actually have one. It's like making sure that we have the payment product that they want to use a payment system that. Many things around the world we've talked about they don't use Visa card. They don't use Mastercard. They don't use [indiscernible] space. They got other ways they want to pay. Make sure we have that payment for them so that traveler customer to comfortable using us. And I can go on and on and on with many other things. That's what we need to do. And how high do I think can be? I'm not going to guess at it. I just know it could be substantially better than we are right now. Ron Josey : Thank you, Glenn. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Devitt with Wedbush. Your line is open. Scott Devitt : Thanks for taking my questions. I had two please. The first one, I'm just wondering Glenn in terms of anything you can speak to in terms of shift in travel trends. There's been a lot of discussion around shoulder month travel April, May, August, September because of remote work and elevated prices. When I hear you guys talk about the months I don't necessarily see that in what you're saying but it may be related to comps. I'd just love to hear your perspective on shoulder month travel first? And then secondly now that there's a new loyalty program in the market I was just wondering your thoughts on Genius? And how you're thinking of the current offering relative to competing programs now in the market? Thank you. Glenn Fogel : Sure. So, yes, it used to be easy. There's a shoulder and there was a peak and life was easy to understand and that's how it used to be and it's not like that at all. And boy -- are things confusing right now when you have Omicron circling the world and some areas is hitting. And then a year later that's the area to comp against. So it gets very, very confusing. As David was pointing out in the numbers how something could look something, but actually it's much more understandable they had COVID in that area last year or they just opened up last year. Here's the thing. I hope that next year things have turned back to a more normalized ease understanding what the seasonality of travel is. However, there's a new thing this come in and that is the idea of people not going to offices as much and then, they're also traveling more. So they're using this Monday and Friday where they're traveling more for these longer weekends et cetera or perhaps a whole week et cetera. And I think that's going to make a more uncertainty to see what that is. What that may end up doing is, evening out travel throughout the year more where people are able to use time in areas that used to be shoulder season, but now people are using more which help spread out the travel more. I don't know. But we'll find out. That's why the -- I can't change any of that. So I'm not going to worry about it too much. What we use is in the near-term is, what signals we see in terms of how much we should spend on marketing or not. And in the long run what we hope is to continue to improve the products, because that's the way in the long run to win. That's how we do it. I'm sure lots of you are going to have lots of guesses about what the seasonality trends are going to be for the next couple of years globally. I'm not going to try and do that. You had another question I believe I forgot it though. Scott Devitt : Yeah. Just Genius and your thoughts on Genius for the computing product now in the market? Glenn Fogel : So there\u2026 Scott Devitt : There is \u2026 Glenn Fogel : Yeah. So if we look to way back to when American Airlines came out with our first loyalty plan. I'm actually old enough to me, I actually joined it. All the way to now there are lots of different loyalty plans for all different things and beyond travel for sure. And that another company comes out with a new one whatever that's nice interesting but the truth is I love what we're doing on Genius. I think it's a great pod and we're going to do even more with it. One of the things that's really wonderful about is that we use it with our partners together in a way to give benefit to both of us making sure that it is actually incrementally improving what's good for that partner along with of course being so good for our customer traveler, doing that is the way of any type of loyalty program should really work. And that's something that I think we've done a good job within [indiscernible]. Now we need to gain on more benefits and any more benefit that enable the supplier to give more opportunity to merchandise and give things that will be good for the traveler so they can win that actual transaction. And that's something we're going to continue to do. We've talked about how we've improved it from where it just started out and now we're up to three tiers. And there are lots of things down the road that will add on as we continue to develop the connected trip that will give us opportunity to give more benefit -- incremental benefits to both sides. I really don't worry too much about what somebody else is doing a more concern making sure we're executing right on the things that's important for our customers, or both the travelers and the suppliers. Scott Devitt : Yeah. Thank you and congratulations. Glenn Fogel : Thank you. Operator : I will now turn the call back over to Glenn Fogel, for closing remarks. Glenn Fogel : Well, I'd like to thank everybody for participating. We are very, very pleased with the results you had. So I want to thank the partners, of course our customers, our dedicated employees and of course our shareholders. We appreciate everybody's support, as we continue to build on the long-term vision for our company. Thank you very much, and good night. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect. Goodbye.",

And now, I'd like to introduce Booking Holdings speakers for this afternoon, Glenn Fogel and David Goulden. Go ahead, gentlemen. Glenn Fogel : Thank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings' third quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. I'm encouraged by the strong results we are reporting today and by the strong leisure travel demand environment that we continue to see. In the third quarter, our traveler customers booked 276 million, or more than a quarter of a billion room nights, which was an increase of 15% year-over-year, and we had gross bookings of $40 billion, which was an increase of 24% year-over-year. Room night growth versus 2019 was 24% in Q3. Both room nights and gross bookings were record quarterly amounts for the company, and both came in ahead of our previous expectations. Third quarter revenue of $7.3 billion grew 21% and adjusted EBITDA of $3.3 billion increased 24%, both versus Q3 last year, and both exceeded our prior expectations. Finally, our non-GAAP earnings per share in the quarter grew 36% year-over-year, and was nearly 60% higher than in the third quarter of 2019. Our earnings per share growth benefited from our improved profit levels, as well as our strong capital return program, which reduced our end-of-quarter share count by 10% versus the third quarter of 2022. Now, turning to October, we estimate that room night growth was about 8% year-over-year and about 20% versus 2019. Excluding Israel, we estimate these growth rates would have been about 9% and 22%, respectively. We saw a significant negative impact on our business in Israel, and there was some impact on travel trends outside of Israel. Nevertheless, we were encouraged to see global room night growth improve towards the end of the month. And David will explain more about October in his remarks. Overall, we continue to see resiliency in global leisure travel demand. And as we take a very early look ahead to 2024, we see strong growth on the books for travel that will take place in the first quarter of next year, though a high percentage of these bookings are cancellable. Given current trends, we expect customers and consumers will continue to prioritize travel over other discretionary spend in 2024. I firmly believe we are well-positioned to continue our work attracting customers and partners to our platform, while making progress on several important initiatives, which will help strengthen our business over the long-term. These initiatives include : one, advancing our connected trip vision. 2, further integrating AI technology into our offerings, 3; continuing to grow alternative accommodations, and four, building more direct relationships with our traveler customers. Starting with the Connected Trip : this is our long-term vision to make booking and experiencing travel easier, more personal, and more enjoyable, while delivering better value to our traveler customers and supplier partners. In the third quarter, we saw an increase in the percentage of transactions which we count as connected trips, meaning two or more travel components within a trip. Though still a small percentage of our total transactions today, it is encouraging to see an increasing number of our travelers booking more elements of their travel with us. Outside of accommodations, one of the most important elements of travel is flights, and we continue to focus on further developing our flight offering on Booking.com. In the third quarter, air tickets booked increased 57% year-over-year, driven by the growth of Booking.com's flight offering. To provide some context on how this has developed over the last few years, the 9 million tickets booked on our platforms during the third quarter were more than 5x the number of air tickets booked through us in Q3 2019. This significant growth of our flight offering at Booking.com over the last 4 years was achieved through our successful partnership with Etraveli. As previously announced, our proposed acquisition of Etraveli was blocked by the European Commission in September, a decision we will appeal. While we strongly disagree with the EC\u2019s decision to block the deal, our commitment to building the flight vertical at Booking.com has not changed. In fact, we have extended our partnership agreement with Etraveli through at least the end of 2028, which means we anticipate continuing to work with them on improving Booking.com's flight offering over the coming years. We believe offering a compelling flight product alongside our accommodation, ground transportation, and attractions offerings, helps to create a better, easier, and more comprehensive travel booking experience for our travelers, and more opportunities for our partners. We will continue to build out our Connected Trip vision, which we believe will ultimately result in increased customer and supplier engagement with our platform. As we discussed last quarter, we have always envisioned AI technology at the center of the Connected Trip, and we have a long history of investing in AI technology and incorporating it in our platforms across our company. I previously spoke about the hard work our teams have been doing to integrate Generative AI into our offerings in innovative ways, including Priceline\u2019s generative AI travel assistant, named Penny, and Booking.com\u2019s AI Trip Planner. It is still very early days, but both teams are gaining valuable insights on booker questions, concerns, and behavior as the tools continue to interact with customers. At Priceline, we are seeing some encouraging signs of lower customer service contact rates, and we are exploring other areas across our business where we believe we can use generative AI tools to increase productivity For example, our brands are running projects using generative AI to enhance the productivity of our software developers with encouraging results so far. And we look forward to using these tools more widely in the future. I remain confident in our company\u2019s ability to benefit from AI developments by improving our products for our customers and operating more efficiently over time. Turning to our supply partners : we strive to be a trusted and valuable partner for all accommodation types on our platform, and we look to add value for our partners by delivering incremental demand and developing products and features to help support their businesses. During the quarter, some of our partners at Booking.com experienced delayed payments due to a planned upgrade to our finance and payment platforms in early July. We have now cleared the backlog of outstanding payment issues related to this system upgrade. We plan to provide compensation to partners who experienced an extended delay, and we recorded this in our Q3 results. We plan to communicate to all partners who were impacted by these payment delays within the next few days We continue to focus on strengthening our alternative accommodations offering at Booking.com by increasing supply and raising awareness among travelers. In the third quarter, alternative accommodation room nights grew at about 24% year-over-year, which was faster than our traditional hotel category. Alternative accommodations represented about 33% of Booking.com's total room nights, which was 3 percentage points higher than in Q3 2022. We are seeing continued momentum in terms of alternative accommodations supply growth both globally and in the U.S., with global listings reaching about 7.2 million by the end of the third quarter, which is about 9% higher than Q3 last year. We aim to build on this progress by continuing to improve the product for our supply partners and travelers, particularly in the U.S. For our travelers, we remain focused on building a better experience that leads to increasing loyalty, frequency, spend, and direct relationships over time. In the third quarter, our mix of customers booking directly on our platforms continued to increase year-over-year. We see a very high level of direct bookings in the mobile app, which is an important platform as it allows us more opportunities to engage directly with travelers. For the first time ever for our company, over 50% of our room nights were booked through our apps in the third quarter, which is about 6 percentage points higher than in Q3 2022. This is a remarkable achievement considering the mix of our mobile app room nights in the third quarter of 2019 was about 18 percentage points lower than it was in the third quarter this year. We will continue our efforts to enhance the app experience to build on the recent success we have seen here. In conclusion, I am encouraged by the strong third quarter results and the continued resilience of leisure travel demand. Our teams continue to execute well against our key strategic priorities, which helps position our business well for the long-term. We continue our work to deliver a better offering and experience for our supply partners and our travelers. We are confident in the long-term growth of travel and in the opportunities ahead for our company. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden. David Goulden : Thank you, Glenn and good afternoon. I'll review our results for the third quarter as well as our thoughts for Q4 and the full year. All growth rates for 2023 are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise indicated. We will be making some references to the comparable periods in 2019 where we think these are helpful. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. We will post our prepared remarks to the Booking Holdings investor relations website after the conclusion of the earnings call.  Now onto our third quarter results. We are pleased to report 15% room night growth in Q3, which was a few percentage points better than our expectations. Looking at our year-on-year room night growth by region in the third quarter, Asia was up about 35%, Rest of World was up mid-teens, Europe was up low double digits and the U.S. was up low single digits. Compared to 2019, our Q3 global room night growth was 24%. The average booking window at Booking.com expanded in Q3 versus the same period in both 2022 and 2019, and was a bit more expanded versus the prior year periods than it was in Q2. In Q3, our mobile apps represented over half of our total room nights for the first time ever. The Q3 mobile app mix of about 51% was about six percentage points higher than the third quarter of 2022. We continue to see an increasing mix of total room nights coming to us through the direct channel. The direct channel increased as a percentage of our room nights in the third quarter relative to the third quarter of 2022. The Q3 international mix of our total room nights was over 50%, up from about 45% in the third quarter of 2022. The Q3 international mix was in line with 2019 levels, similar to the second quarter. Our cancellation rates in the third quarter were slightly higher than Q3 2022, but were slightly below Q3 2019. Cancellation rates were the same as in Q2. For our alternative accommodations at Booking.com, our Q3 room night growth was about 24% year-over-year and the global mix of alternative accommodation room nights was about 33%, which was a few points higher than Q3 2022. Q3 gross bookings increased 24% year-over-year, or 21% on a constant currency basis. The 24% increase in gross bookings was 9 percentage points higher than the 15% room night increase due to about 4% higher accommodation constant currency ADRs, plus about 3 percentage points of positive impact from FX movements, and also due to about 2 percentage points from flight bookings. Our year-over-year ADR growth was negatively impacted by regional mix due to a higher mix of room nights from Asia and a lower mix of room nights from the U.S. Excluding regional mix, constant currency ADRs were up about 7 percentage points year-on-year. Despite the higher ADRs in the third quarter, we have not seen a change in the mix of hotel star-rating levels being booked or changes in length of stay that could indicate that consumers are trading down. We continue to watch these dynamics closely. Airline tickets booked in the third quarter were up about 57% year-on-year driven by the continued expansion of Booking.com's flight offering. Revenue for the third quarter exceeded our expectations, increasing 21% year-over-year, or about 18% on a constant currency basis. Although we had a stronger-than-expected Q3 from a room night and gross bookings perspective, the outperformance versus our expectations was mostly driven by mainly bookings that are for travel in future quarters. As a result, we did not see all of the revenue benefit in Q3 from these incremental bookings. Revenue as a percentage of gross bookings in Q3 was 18.4%, which was lower-than-expected due to this timing effect. Our underlying accommodation take rates continue to be in line with 2019 levels. Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line, increased 13% year-over-year. Marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings was about 50 basis points lower than Q3 2022 due to higher ROIs in our paid channels and a higher mix of direct business. Performance marketing ROIs increased year-over-year helped by our ongoing efforts to improve the efficiency of our marketing spend. Marketing and merchandising combined as a percentage of gross bookings in Q3 was about 30 basis points lower than last year, which was a little better than our expectations, driven by the improved performance marketing ROIs. Q3 sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings were up about 10 basis points compared with last year, a bit better than our expectations. About 51% of Booking.com's gross bookings were processed through our payments platform in Q3, up from about 40% in Q3 2022. For the total company, 56% of gross bookings were merchant, up from about 45% in Q3 2022. Our more fixed expenses in aggregate were up 24% year-over-year, which was below our expectation, due to lower personnel and personnel related expenses. We continue to manage our more fixed expenses very carefully. On a GAAP basis, our more fixed expenses were up 33% year-over-year and included a $90 million accrual in G&A expense for the termination fee related to the acquisition agreement for Etraveli, this accrual was excluded from our non-GAAP results Adjusted EBITDA was $3.3 billion in the third quarter, which was up 24% year-over-year, and would have been up 22% on a constant currency basis. This was also ahead of our expectations. Non-GAAP net income of $2.6 billion in the third quarter resulted in non-GAAP EPS of $72.32 per share, which was up 36% year-over-year. Our average share count in the third quarter was 9% below Q3 2022 and 16% below Q3 2019. On a GAAP basis, we had net income of $2.5 billion in the quarter Now on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q3 ending cash and investments balance of $14.3 billion was down versus our Q2 ending balance of $15.7 billion due to the $2.6 billion in share repurchases we completed in the quarter, partially offset by the $1.3 billion of free cash flow generated in the third quarter. We repurchased $7.7 billion of our shares through the first three quarters, which represents 8% of our year-end 2022 share count. The repurchases so far this year take our combined authorization down to $16 billion from the total of $24 billion we discussed earlier in the year. Our buyback program takes our share price into account and at current share price levels we expect to spend more on buybacks in Q4 than we did in Q3. We remain comfortable with our ability to complete the full $24 billion of share repurchases within 4 years from when we started the program at the beginning of this year, assuming no major downturn in the travel environment. Now onto our thoughts for the fourth quarter of 2023. In October, we estimate year-over-year room night growth was about 8%, down from 15% in Q3 due in part to a tougher year-on-year compare, as well as the war in the Middle East. When comparing versus 2019, October room night growth was about 20%. Excluding Israel, October room nights grew about 9% versus 2022 and about 22% versus 2019. The 22% growth versus October 2019 excluding Israel is a little lower than the 24% growth we saw in Q3 versus 2019. Looking across our major regions, in October we saw Asia year-on-year growth of room nights without 15%, Europe up about 10%, and the U.S. and Rest of World were down slightly. The impact of the Israel-Hamas war is seen most in the Rest of World growth numbers. Israel on a booker plus inbound travel basis is about 1% of our global room nights. The Middle East, including Turkey and Egypt, on a booker basis is about 4% of our global room nights. Globally, we saw a slowdown starting the second week of October due to cancellations and a drop in new bookings after the start of the war in the Middle East. The cancellations we saw that started in the second week of October were concentrated in Israel, but we also saw some impact on travel trends outside of the country as people absorbed the news. We were pleased to see room night growth recover towards the end of the month. Our comments for the fourth quarter make the assumption that room night growth will be up about 9% year-over-year. When comparing versus 2019, this means we expect Q4 room night growth to be about 20%. This outlook assumes that there is no further expansion of the war in the Middle East. We expect Q4 gross bookings to grow about 5% -- points of about 5 points faster than room nights on a year-on-year basis due to a couple points from higher accommodation constant currency ADRs, including some pressure from changes in regional mix, as well as a couple of points from continued flight bookings growth. We expect Q4 revenue as a percentage of gross bookings to be about 15%, which would be higher than Q4 last year due to benefits from timing. We expect Q4 marketing expenses as a percentage of bookings -- gross bookings to be slightly lower than last year. We expect marketing and merchandising combined as a percentage of gross bookings in Q4 to be slightly higher than last year as we continue to look for opportunities to lean in. We expect Q4 sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings to be about in line with last year as the higher merchant gross bookings mix is offset by efficiencies in payments costs. We expect our more fixed expenses in Q4 to grow a couple of points faster year-over-year than it did in the third quarter. Taking all this into account, we\u2019d expect Q4 adjusted EBITDA to be just over $1.4 billion. Our year-to-date results plus our fourth quarter commentary means that for the full year we expect room nights to grow in the mid-to high-teens year-over-year. We currently expect full year gross bookings growth of over 20% year-on-year. We currently expect revenue as a percentage of gross bookings to increase year-on-year by about 10 basis points, down from our previous expectation for a 20 basis point increase due to higher bookings growth and a longer booking window, which reduce the expected benefit from timing. We continue to expect full year marketing and merchandising as a percentage of gross bookings to be slightly below 2022, and for our more fixed expenses to grow around 25% year-over-year. We manage our more fixed costs very carefully and continue to expect our more fixed expenses next year to grow at an appreciably lower rate than this year. We continue to expect that our adjusted EBITDA margins will expand by a couple of percentage points versus 2022. In closing, we are pleased with our Q3 results, the trends we are seeing into Q4 and with the bookings we have already received for early 2024. We are now [technical difficulty]. Operator : Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore. Your line is open. Mark Mahaney : Thanks. I will ask two questions, please. Glenn, I think just at the very beginning you mentioned something about March quarter, a visibility into the March quarter. Is there anything in particular that you were trying to hint at or point to the areas of that, because the bookings went as a little longer than you get. Do you have more visibility into the March quarter than you typically do. And then secondly, the David the room night growth, upside this quarter that came in a little bit faster than your guidance. What would you attribute that to was at a particular region that contributed to that or was that the alternative accommodations that came in a little bit stronger than you thought. Just the sources of room night growth upside in the quarter. Thank you very much. Glenn Fogel : Hi, Mark. I was not saying that I see more than I normally do. I'm just saying I was very pleased to see this resiliency in global leisure travel demand and saying that we're looking at 2024, we're seeing strong growth on the books for travel. And that's going to happen in the first quarter. So it's just reinforcing my belief that travel is healthy. And we're looking forward to continue healthy travel. David Goulden : Yes, Mark, to answer your question relates a little bit to what Glenn just said. Our upside in the quarter, our room night growth was driven by travel -- expect by stronger travel demand across the peak season and along the booking window. If you remember, we said that coming into Q3, we have exceeded -- we see the booking lengthening of the booking window in Q1, Q2. And therefore we expected fewer last minute bookings in Q3. Well, the last minute bookings in Q3 were a little lower than we would have expected any year when we didn't have that long booking window. But what we got were more bookings for longer periods of time out there. So the booking window actually expanded in Q3. And that created the situation that Glenn talked about where we now looking into the first quarter of next year, because of the strong demand we saw for bookings, a lot of which are outside of the quarter plus the window means that our Q1 on the books situation is much stronger than it has been prior to the current situation. Mark Mahaney : Okay. Thank you, Glenn. Thank you, David. David Goulden : I would also just comment that the over performance we saw versus our expectation was across all different regions, I wouldn't call one region out. We actually did that and we expected in all regions when compared to our guidance, looking at the actual for the quarter for room night growth. Mark Mahaney : Okay. Thank you, David. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Your line is open. Justin Post : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe one for Glenn and one for David. Glenn, you've been working on Connected Trip for a long time. Obviously, a lot of progress with air and other areas. If this vision really works out, what does it mean for Bookings financials? And do you think you're accelerating the pace of progress there? And then for David, we see the U.S., which reopened first at kind of low single-digit growth. How are you thinking about Europe comps next year? And can you just remind us of your kind of relative exposure by geography? Thank you. Glenn Fogel : So, Justin, hello. And I have been talking about the Connected Trip for a while, because I do believe that really is a differentiator in the long run, and why someone would come to us and continue to come to us rather than another way to do their travel. So in the long run, of course, if somebody's coming direct, because they really enjoy the way we do it versus an alternative that of course, the lower the marketing cost, you wouldn't have to reacquire that, that customer. It's interesting because the small send small data, but we do see people who book more than one element with us currently, we do see some benefits the person coming back more frequently, and a higher direct. So I like that. And I think we can do a lot more with them. Now, one of the things that we're not the only person doing this, of course, in this competition, because I think a lot of people see this. And now, on top of this, the whole benefits of generative AI, along with all the AI work we've been doing for a long time. And we see the potential to create a much better experience in discovery, planning and executing your travel in a way that if we do this, right, we may be able to greatly accelerate the growth of the company, because it really is transformationally different versus just incrementally different. And that's what we're striving for. Now, that's not going to happen tomorrow, you know that I know that it's not going to happen next week, next quarter. Not going to happen next year. It's going to take time to get all this built out. But what I'm really pleased about is seeing historically, we said what we're going to do, and we've been doing it, and we're showing markers along the way, hitting milestones, hitting a slight growth rate still, 57% of air ticket booking I talked about talking about, that's 5x greater than 2019. We said we're going to do it, and we did it, and we're going forward. In so many of these other areas where I believe that people are frustrated in the way they travel now. We can do it better. We'll achieve great things, both for the traveler, of course. We're going to achieve great opportunities for our partners to give them more opportunities to get more business working with us. And then of course, together those things will end up with a great derivative, which is more value for the shareholders. That's what we're trying to do. And I'm really pleased to where we are. David Goulden : Yes, thank you, Glenn. And then, Justin, relative to your question. Yes, we were pleased to see room night growth year-over-year in the U.S market. Don't forget, in the U.S., our room nights are over 30% higher than they were in 2019. So we have made significant strides in terms of advancing our overall position in the U.S., if you compare that with market growth rates are probably more likely recovered versus 2019, not up by 30%. When we think about next year, I don't want to get into too much detail. But I will give you a couple of things to think about. I'd say that when you look across all the regions, if you look at where travel as a percentage of GDP is going to wind up in 2023 compared to where it was in 2019, it still has some recovery, before it fully gets back to the percentage of GDP. It used to be in 2019. So I think that provides upside. I'd also say that, as Glenn said in his comments, and as we see, we do see consumers continue to crack and travel of other discretionary expense items, we don't see any reason why that should change based on current trends. And then also just relative to our own view of the business, we're still committed to our milestones we gave you and said we will continue to grow faster post COVID than we were before on the top line and bottom line and consequently basis, that was 8% bookings on revenue, 8% on bookings, 8% on revenue, 15% earnings per share or constant currency growth rates in 2019. And whilst we're not talking about even specific, around 2024, we are still sticking to those overall guidelines and outlooks. Justin Post : Thank you, Glenn. Thank you, David. Very helpful. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Kopelman with TD Cowen. Your line is open. Kevin Kopelman : Thanks a lot. Could you comment on the outsized growth in alternative accommodations that you saw in Q3? I think in Q2, the growth was closer to the overall growth. So what were the drivers there any regions and then I have a follow-up. Thanks. Glenn Fogel : So, Kevin, why don\u2019t I start and David can add on anything I fail to add in. Obviously, very, very pleased with that number. That's a really good growth rate. And when we compare it to some other people in the space, I'm very impressed by what we've been able to accomplish. And I will shout out to the whole team that works on alternative accommodations. But there's some again. I've been talking about for some time about, we need to improve the product, we need to make people aware of it. And by doing that, we'll get more business. And that's what we've been doing. Now I can do all the things I've talked about them in the past, and we continue to do things to make it a better product. And there's still a lot of things that need to be done to make it even better. And that's what we're going to keep on doing. There's no magic bullet. No, no silver bullet and tell, here's how it came about. It comes through a lot of hard work and a lot of different ways of just grinding away, cranking out making it better talking with the suppliers who have these properties, making sure we're marketing appropriately when people want that property, they can find it and they see it. All those things together will enable us to achieve what I think was a very, very good print on the growth rate there. But I'll tell you, we're not there yet. And I mentioned look, I want to increase the supply a lot more look, it's great. 9% increase. So I mentioned in my prepared remarks and the increase up to 7.2 billion listings. That's great. That's good. But I know there are a lot of areas we need to add even more, particularly in the United States, because that's the place that I want to use our product. Because if I look for anything, and I don't see it. Well, to me, that's upside down. We're doing great right now. And I still see so much opportunity ahead because for example, we don't have enough properties in certain areas and other product features that we need to improve upon. All together. I look at this great opportunity. We're going to well, and we will do it even better in the future. I hope and David, anything specific to add to that? Okay. David Goulden : Nope, nope. Thank you. That was great. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my questions. The first one, let me just ask about the U.S. a little bit. You've made some really good progress in the U.S. post COVID, but it has decelerated quite a bit, and now it even down in the most recent months. So Glenn, I guess the question is, as you look into 2024, what are the keys to sort of reaccelerating that U.S. growth from here to sort of contribute to your goal of growing faster post-COVID than you were pre-COVID. So what drives U.S. growth from here? And then secondly, any quantifiable metrics or factors you can share with us on progress on Genius and the Loyalty program over the course of the summer into the fall? Glenn Fogel : Yes, sure. Thank you, Brian. So, the U.S is not that much different than any other geography in terms of the elements that help create growth are providing a better product. Enabling people to be able to find the properties they want, at the right price, and the easiest thing to do and if anything goes wrong, given great customer service. That's the playbook. And yes, I -- some of the numbers look a little funky. And of course, COVID is really create all sorts of things, different geographies come out faster than others. So you're comparing a year-over-year, and maybe it looks like a deceleration and then there's domestic and international events, I think a good way to look those like compare back to 2019. And the fact is, we've achieved, we've accomplished some great things in terms of increasing our share in the U.S. And we keep on doing what we have been doing. And that will continue to increase that share. And I just mentioned in the previous question about our alternative accommodations, which is important part of growing out of the U.S. And another thing is also you mentioned Genius. So I'll switch over to there. -- and that is continue to develop the Genius program in a way that continues to provide not only great value to the traveler, which of course, is an obvious one, but it's providing opportunity for our partners to be able to get incremental demand when they need it, where they need and how they need it. Working that together is a way for us to provide a better opportunity for both sides of this marketplace to achieve greater value for both sides. And I think that we have that great thing, layer on all those other things we talk about with the whole idea of the Connected Trip. Bring in more of the Generative AI stuff. And altogether, I think this is a good playbook to try and continue to grow our share in the U.S. And again, we've been doing it for some time now. So I'm really pleased with where we stand. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with UBS. Your line is open. Lloyd Walmsley : Thanks. I had a couple, if I can. First, it sounds like you're still talking about holding this lean in posture on marketing with the leverage on I think marketing plus merchandising in 4Q. As growth slows, should we expect to see you all moderate that posture and get more leverage? And I guess looking at markets, like the U.S growing low single digits? Are you still holding that that posture there? Or are you kind of bifurcating the strategy differently as different markets are perhaps more recovered. Anything you could share there would be great. And then the second one would just be sort of related. But as more than half of room nights are now booked through the mobile app, should that also be an increasing driver of marketing leverage? Or do you think just escalating pricing in performance channels offsets that, so it's kind of balance that? How should we think about that? Thanks. Glenn Fogel : So Lloyd, let me talk a little bit about this and all we do and add other facts that he wants to add in here. And I want to be very careful here. Obviously, the one thing I don't want to do is give away our [indiscernible] ideas and all the things we're going to play with our competitors listening in on this. So you'll understand it, while it'll be a little bit general in this. But one of the things I continue to try and talked to the team about is we need to be nimble. We need to be agile, and we need to be able to be smart and move into markets, where we see opportunities and pull back in other places where we think we're not going to get the right ROIs. Whether that be a geography, whether it be a channel, would that be developing a entire product, whatever it is, I don't look at any of these in a different way. I look at all together holistically. What we're trying to do to achieve growth at the right type of profitability levels. And we're going to continue to do that. Right now, as David said, we have a lean-in position because we see opportunity here. Time can -- these things can change depending on the time. And certainly, the idea is to say I'm going to do this for a long-term period is it's a nice thing to say, but who knows what the world is going to be like, and as we all see, unfortunately, the world can change very, very rapidly. So we'll continue to do this, and this is our profile right now the way David explained those numbers for what we are going to disclose right now. But you should always recognize that we have an overall view of how to do things, but we will be willing to change, depending on circumstances. Regarding the mobile app, I talked about, David, why don't you just take in terms of how that will apply to our numbers going forward. David Goulden : Yes, Lloyd, I'd add a couple of comments. So first of all, just to kind of pick up on what Glenn lets off on the leading in. We are leading into a recovery marketplace. I said, there's still on one of my other answers, there's so some recovery of travel as a percentage of GDP post-COVID left tap into 2024. We haven't seen it fully recover yet. So there are still opportunities to do that. You'll notice though, that we are in lower spending more on marketing, merchandising, in 2023, than we did in 2019. We are getting leverage relative to what we spent in 2022. As a couple things happen. One as our direct mix increases, and of course mobile is highly correlated to direct mix. The majority, the vast majority of all our mobile -- of all of that mobile app bookings are in fact direct bookings, so that helps as well. So and then you did make a reference, I would just say to Q4, and I wouldn't read too much into Q4. Here's how I would explain why we expect to get some deleverage in marketing in Q4, relative to the other quarter where we've shown leverage. It's really quite simple. We're having a strong year, and we decided to invest in some additional programs in Q4 that will help us finish the year well. And to build on our momentum going into 2024. So that was us. It's very conscious. Again, we are not going to go into the playbook in terms of what they are or where they are, but we recognize that we're doing well this year financially, delivering great EBITDA and results. So we are leaning a little bit in Q4 to position us well, the first year and going to 2024 strong. Again, that's what we are doing. Not driven by any [indiscernible] in the marketplace is our conscious decision. Of course, we'll still create leverage on marketing merchandising for the full year. Lloyd Walmsley : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Doug Anmuth : Thanks for taking the questions. Glenn, you talked about expecting a strong 2024. Just curious if you have any more color on how you're thinking about the outlook for ADRs next year. I think you said it was a 4% increase in 3Q. Any more thoughts there would be helpful. Thank you. Glenn Fogel : I will let David talk about what you wants to [indiscernible]. I don't think we talked about 2024. I think we talked first quarter. I will let David, clarify whatever he wants to clarify. David Goulden : Yes, Doug, I mean, the 2024 conversation, we're going to have that when we get into February next year, I really don't want to have -- how that now. We've told you a little bit about the strength of the on the books in the first quarter given the strength of bookings in the booking window. And we talked a little bit about our framework for growth post-COVID hasn't changed. So I want to keep anything beyond that until we get to see a little bit more. We are talking to you next time, of course, we'll give you much more insight at that point in time. But it's too early to talk about the specifics of line items in the income statement in 2024. Doug Anmuth : Okay. Thank you, David. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lee Horowitz with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Lee Horowitz : Great, thanks. Maybe following up on some of the comments around sort of the vacation rental industry? Can we talk a bit more about sort of the U.S vacation rental business. Glenn, you talked about growing supply and building product functionality in order to continue to grow that. [Technical difficulty] getting this incremental products rolled out and getting supply to the place where you are competitive relative to some others in the market. So how do we think of sort of the timeline and maybe even the investment dollars needed to get that business to the place where you want to get it to? Glenn Fogel : Hi, Lee. Well, you won't be surprised, I'm not actually going to give out the details exactly how and what level and what amount of money we're going to put to work out and what the methods are. I will say that the best way to look at this and look at what we've done historically. And where the numbers have been going and how the growth has been going. That's the best indication for you in terms of thinking forward, how -- what we're going to end up in result, and the results going to be. I will say that it's fairly obvious to be looked at our site and tries to find homes in certain properties and in certain parts of the U.S., you can see perhaps you don't have enough of them in those areas. So it would not be illogical to think that's where we'll start going to. As we talked in the past, we think that there is a lower hanging fruit for us in properties that are controlled or managed by larger groups of properties, makes it easier for us to get that. So I'm not giving anything away here. When I say, well, we'll let us go there first, and let's be sure we're doing that. And for example, you may have noticed that recently started doing the request on demand type of thing, where a person doesn't automatically be able to book instantly. And that's a product improvement because some people in, let's say, higher quality or higher value properties. Perhaps the owner or the manager did not want to have an instant booking and want to have a chance to do it on request basis. So that's an improvement thing. So we'll continue to roll out all these different things that we think will make our property -- our product as good as anybody else's, it applies the money to the appropriate marketing to make sure people are aware of it, and that will enable us to continue the growth that we've seen so far, I hope. Lee Horowitz : Helpful. Thanks. And then maybe one follow-up on perhaps another air of the low hanging fruit. Can you comment at all on anything you're seeing in terms of APAC outbound travel pattern, travel patterns, and how much room there may be in this travel quarter sort of cover back to pre-COVID levels. Should we be thinking -- thinking of this travel pattern as a source of premium growth in the medium term? Glenn Fogel : I'm not sure the term premium growth, I'll just say, well, we talked a little bit about, look, we talked some time about different geographies coming back faster in other areas. Asia was certainly the one who was last. And of course, it looks good when you're starting to see the, nice growth rate those regions as the other ones start getting more normalized. It's a nice thing to say. It's certainly outbound for example, outbound China still significantly behind, when you look at any of the industry reports, and think how much lift do they have going out bond, et cetera. Although that's a small part of our business, not going to make a huge difference even when it starts to come back. So overall, look, we love to see that Asia is going to get back to where all the other parts of the world are -- and I really do and I understand the term premium that you mentioned, maybe explain that I could give a better explanation. Lee Horowitz : I guess just faster growth relative to the core. Glenn Fogel : Oh, faster. Okay. I thought maybe you're talking about more expensive travel or something? Lee Horowitz : No, no, no, no. Glenn Fogel : Okay, got it. Sorry. Thank you. Lee Horowitz : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Eric Sheridan : Thank you so much for taking the question. Maybe come back to the topic of Air, where I understood on the comments about appealing Travel decision from the European Commission. If we go beyond that appeal and think about how you plan on building scale in a the supply side. I would love to know how are you thinking about some of the investments that are key to build that as opposed to possibly going down the acquisition route in Air. And where you've already deployed Air, especially markets like North America, can you remind us of what Air has done in terms of growing overall checkout baskets and return on trip side? Thank you so much Glenn Fogel : I will let David handle that last part. In terms of the appeal, the appeal will take some time. This type of court action is not going to happen overnight. I can't tell you exactly how long it will take, but it's not going to happen anytime soon. So I would not put anything in terms of what that will mean for [indiscernible] in the relative future. However, we do like the fact that we do have this new agreement with Etraveli, going out to 2028. That's really great. Also, as you know, it's not just booked many travel line. That's one area of our air business. We have Priceline. Of course, that's that company started Priceline or as an Air product. That was the first product. We have lots of good relationships with air travel there. I obviously am very disappointed by the European Commission's blocking, what I believe would have been an extremely beneficial transaction for the travelers, good for them, were they good for the partners, good for them. And together, this will create value, which, of course, would have come back to all the people involved in the company, whether they be for higher value for our shareholders, a higher value for our employees working on , et cetera. Very disappointing decision, we moved on. We will continue to develop this product. And by the way, it's been growing very nicely even though we didn't actually have possession of Etraveli, and yet, we still were able to reduce 57% increase in air tickets. David, I'll let you if you want to talk anything about basket size and things around if you do. David Goulden : I can talk about where we are with some of the customer oriented dynamics around there, Eric, I think will be helpful. So we said this is about Booking.com, which is of course where Air is still relatively new and growing very rapidly. We said previously that over 20% of Air customers are brand new to us. We've never seen them before, that continues to be the case, as the business grows, which is very, very healthy. We also see that those new customers who are booking Air [Indiscernible] who've never booked anything prior to that with us, are doing a healthy attachment rate from into accommodation because these are brand-new customers. So you wouldn't expect that attachment ratio to be all that high, but it's quite healthy. Not quite as high as examples of what we're doing with Priceline where we've been doing that for many years. But it's certainly an encouraging attachment rate. What I would tell you, though, on the other side, of course, by definition, most of the air that we are selling is to existing customers, which you would expect. And there is a very good attach rate on those air tickets to accommodation because these customers know us from an a combination background in the first place. What I would also say is that we still have good data that says that customers who buy multiple things from us, whether they be the new customers or the existing customers buying air and the combination. We have good data that says that, that will drive better frequency, loyalty, future basket size, getting them kind of up that loyalty and frequency curve that we talked about to the higher value customers. So the dynamics around air are still healthy and they haven't changed. We are encouraged about them. And as you can see, they're helping us in multiple different ways. Eric Sheridan : Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with Citi. Your line is open. Ron Josey : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Glenn, I wanted to ask a little bit more about AI. And just you talked about a little bit in your script as to consumer adoption of the booking tools, a trip planner. Wondering if this adoption is trending as you would have expected, I think we're still relatively early days. And you also mentioned the common around lower customer care costs because of AI. So any insights there would be helpful. And David, we don't hear too much about just the milestones coming out of COVID. I know they're there, we've talked about it, but just remind us a little bit more about the underlying assumptions of maybe the bookings and revenue growth. Thank you. Glenn Fogel : Okay. AI. We only have so much time because I could go on for a long time on this, so I'll try and concise my thoughts on this. So as in all new technologies, the hype is always great, very beginning or [indiscernible] thing is going to be the greatest thing some slice bread, but then it takes longer than it takes to toast a slice to actually haven't needed. That's the thing about what we are seeing is that it's really exciting. I absolutely believe it's going to be transformative, but it's going to take a long time. And when I said in my prepared remarks about this is very early, it is very, very early. Now some of the stuff that we are seeing and that we have done enough so we see some data to see there are going to be some good benefits. So the example of the customer service example is, for example, you have a customer service agent, who actually is able to use a copilot, let's call it, with AI agent that helps enable that customers or agent answer the question or taking action much faster, than they would have been able to do previously. Particularly in terms of a number of years, the person has been a CS agent and maybe a CS agent has been there forever. They're instant how do everything perfectly is great and all that. But if you're a relatively new CS agent, this is going to be extremely healthy for that person. As you know, the turnover of CS agents is very great because there's a good efficiency productivity game there. Then everybody, I'm sure, has read lots about how coding can be greatly increased in terms of speed and efficiency, using some of these copilots in terms of coating. So there's another area, again, early stages, just seeing it, but we do believe that is going to do something like that. And then you go on into the things that we have for the customer. And the things like Priceline and their Penny product. We're a customer when they're about to buy something, there's a chatbot where they can put in a question because they get not sure they want to buy or not. And instead of having to go all the way back up the funnel to find the information they say, do they want to buy or not, using that chatbot, they can be instantly given an answer that will help convert that person into a buy much faster and actually not losing as much. And questions be everything one of the things that I've noticed is coming a lot is, can I bring my dog to the hotel. And actually, it can become quite a conversational type thing where, yes, you can't bring your dog and so, but my dog is a very big dog. How big is your dog and if you go back [indiscernible] that's using our information that we have -- that's all our current end using an LLM in combination [indiscernible] this type of chat relationship. That's really good. And then you can go to the other things, we're in the Booking.com AI product, which is really trying to create an itinerary, the discovery from the very top and going down. And then when it offers hotels, it integrates with our hotel condos [ph], you can book right data also very good. Now both those things relatively small usage of any of these things compared to the overall size of the amount of inquiries we get a number of bookings, we do in terms of the overall size of the company. But it's very encouraging that this stuff really does matter, and it's going to make a difference. Now the question would be how long until we get sort of that hit that inflection point, where people start saying, \"oh, this is so much better. I don't know that yet. But we're going to keep on experimenting on all these things, increasing the efficiencies. So we can do things faster with a lower cost and at the same time, increasing things for the travelers to make sure they want to come and use our products and our services versus anybody else's. That's the plan right now, and I like it. And David, I'm not sure what the second question was. David Goulden : Yes, I will talk a little bit about a framework for post-COVID recovery because I think that's important. So we've committed that when the dust settles and the market goes back to normal growth rates, whenever that is, we'll be a larger and faster-growing business. Delivering more EPS and faster-growing EPS than we did before. So larger and faster growing on the top line and the bottom line. So why do we think that is the case? Well, we will have made a ton of progress. So the comparison point is 2019. If 2024 is the year that we get to normalized growth rates, it will be 5 years later. If it's 2025, it will be 6 years later. But the business is so fundamentally different in, the business we had in 2019. I think we need just to step back and remind you of that. So, what we've done since 2019 and mainly around Booking.com, but other parts of the business have also contributed as well. Back then, we were mainly, an accommodation mainly hotel, mainly agency business. So since then, we have added a significant alternative accommodation business, which is now very sizable and now we're trying to be for growing quickly. We have -- back then, we did very little in payments. Now over half of our business is transacted through Payment. So we built out our payments platform, which is enabling better service for customers and partners. We have built out air taxi and car capability, we didn't have back in. Back in 2019, we were great at performance marketing. We didn't do much around merchandising. We've now developed a big merchandising arm and capability, but also we've refined our performance marketing tools to the level where we really think we can lean into recurring marketplaces and gain share more aggressively than we did back then. And then, of course, we've added our Genius program and enhanced it significantly. So we believe that we have made huge strides since 2019, which is our comparison point when we grew at 8% on the top line, constant currency bookings and revenue. And of course, this year, we are going to be a lot bigger than we were in 2019. But you add all those capabilities together, and we believe we have a fundamentally different and more competitive business that's providing more value to our customers and partners and is much, much for towards the vision of the Connected Trip than we had back then. And that's why we are confident that we can grow faster and have a bigger business that grows faster on the top line and the bottom line than we had in 2019. That is the framework. Ron Josey : Super helpful. Thank you both. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Colantuoni with Jefferies. Your line is open. John Colantuoni : Thanks. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple for me. So as more bookings come through the app, I'm curious how repeat rates have trended among more recent cohorts on the app or whether you're seeing any diminishing returns and stickiness as you move beyond early adopters into the longer tail? And second, are you seeing any patterns in behavior like demand strength in higher priced hotels that's giving you confidence in consumers' continued continuation of prioritizing travel spend over other forms of discretionary spend next year? Thanks. Glenn Fogel : Let me just take that last one, and then I'll let Dave. I'm not sure what we disclose and what we don't disclose about your first question. Obviously, it's an important one. So we say -- and we've said this several times, several quarters [indiscernible], the same question keeps coming up in different forms of -- do we see any softening? Do we see anything decline? Do we see a decrease in star rating? Do you see a decrease in length of stay and things like that. We say no. And that's what we'll be -- no and no. In terms of why we believe that discretionary spending will continue to travel versus other things, that's obviously a lot of the survey. So I can maybe a whole bunch of things that are independent, third-party actual people are saying they're going to do etcetera. Here's something more important though. And I really try and stress this is how important the long is in terms of how we think about the business and increasing value. So if we agree that over time, GDP for the world will continue to increase and per capita GDP will continue to increase. It's fairly logical that as people get wealthier, they're going to spend more of their money on things that are services or experiences than they are things. Once you going rich enough to have, let's say an apartment, you have one apartment in generally or you have one sofa. You're not going to buy a sofa each year. What you're going to do is you need to get more money is you will travel either more frequently or in a higher level of style travel or you'll do both. And we see that over and over again, when you go look at countries and you see what the amount of the -- ease to look at his international travel, which is a higher I think you know that's going to be a higher level for some people. And you see, as the GDP for a person there goes up. You see the amount of going outbound travel increases, too. So that's why I believe that this is in the long run. We have a great tailwind. The trial will continue to be one of the things that people always are going to want or there's a lot more of it. And thus, provide a great service, our job is get a safer share, a bigger piece of that pie that is going to continue to grow. And you grow a little bit faster than global GDP. That's why I believe we have a great future here. And Steve, I don't know what we talked or do not disclose regarding his question regarding apps. David Goulden : I'll be really quick because we got over time. But there are multiple ways you can book on our property on our platforms directly. You can book directly through the app, book directly on the mobile web and book directly on a desktop or laptop. The app is by far the stickiest those in terms of repeat rates return rates. And of course, the app is where we're kind of designing to optimize the experience around the Connected Trip, because not only do we want you to be able to book all elements through the app, but also goes with you on the trip, that doesn't usually happen when you book and print something on one of the other platforms. So it's very important for us. It's a big effort. It's where the Connected Trip is moving towards. And then what I would just leave you with as a final sort of course, not all customers are created equally and the higher value customers who do more business, where spend more of their total spend with are higher usage of both app and direct by an appreciable amount, compared to the average customer. So the app is very much at the center of that thinking. John Colantuoni : Okay. Thanks so much. Operator : And with that, I will hand the call back over to Glenn Fogel for closing remarks. Glenn Fogel : Thank you. I want to thank our partners, our customers, our dedicated employees and our shareholders. We appreciate your support as we continue to build on the long-term vision for our company. Thank you, and good night. Operator : This does conclude the conference call. You may now disconnect.",

And now I\u2019d like to introduce Booking Holdings speakers for this afternoon, Glenn Fogel and David Goulden. Please go ahead, gentlemen. Glenn Fogel : Thank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings\u2019 fourth quarter conference call. I am joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. I am pleased to report a solid finish to 2023 as fourth quarter room nights slightly exceeded our expectations and grew a bit more than 9% year-over-year or 11% when excludes Israel from both periods. When compared to 2019, our room nights grew 21% versus our expectations of 20%. We delivered record fourth quarter revenue of $4.8 billion and record adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion, which were ahead of our expectations. Finally, the GAAP and earnings per share in the quarter grew 29% year-over-year, helped by the reduction in our share count versus last year. At the start of 2024, we continue to see resiliency in global leisure travel demand. As we look to the year ahead, we see strong growth on the books for travel that\u2019s scheduled to take place in 2024, which gives early indications of potentially another record summer travel season. As we\u2019ve noted previously, a high percentage of these bookings are capable and what is on the books today for the summer period represents a small percentage of the total bookings that we expect to ultimately receive. David will provide further details on fourth quarter results and on our thoughts about the first quarter and full year 2024. Looking back at the full year of 2023, I am proud of our efforts to drive more benefits to our travelers and supply partners while also delivering record-setting industry-leading financial results. We reached a significant milestone last year with our customers\u2019 booking an all-time high of over 1 billion room nights on our platform, which was an increase of 17% versus 2022. Gross bookings of $151 billion increased 24% versus 2022. In 2023, we reached a new revenue record of over $21 billion, which was 25% higher than 2022. We achieved this strong top line result while improving our profitability with record adjusted EBITDA of $7.1 billion, an increase of 34% versus 2022, and our adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by over 2 percentage points year-over-year. Our non-GAAP earnings per share of about $152 increased 52% year-over-year and was 48% higher than our prior full year all-time high back in 2019. Across all of our key metrics in 2023, we were a meaningfully larger and faster-growing business than we were in 2019. Our ambition going forward in a normalized growth in market for the travel industry is to continue to grow our gross bookings, revenue and earnings per share faster than we did in 2019. We are confident we will achieve these objectives because we\u2019ve invested in building a stronger business and better product offerings for our travelers and partners that we had back then. We can see this in many areas, but I will highlight a few examples of where we have strengthened our offering relative to 2019. We now have a scaled up merchant platform at Booking.com, which processed first half of Booking.com\u2019s gross bookings in 2023. Our merchant offering brings many benefits to our travelers and partners as well as new strategic benefits to us, including the ability to merchandise. We have continued to scale up our offering at Booking.com since in 2019, with total company air tickets booked in 2023 up more than 400% over that time frame, primarily driven by Booking.com. We see this vertical bring new customers to our platform while delivering a more complete offering to our existing customers making travel planning and booking easier for them and creating opportunities to provide more value to them. On alternative accommodations, we continue to increase the mix of our alternative accommodations room nights, which treats 33% of Booking.com\u2019s room rights in 2023 as we improve our product offering and increase our supply choices with further opportunities ahead, particularly in the U.S. Early, we are pleased that for Booking.com, we have created foundations necessary to offer insurance, attractions and ground transportation options and expect these offerings to add value to our connected trip vision. On marketing, we\u2019ve improved our abilities in using performance marketing channels even more effectively and are now better focused on our brand spending. On loyalty, we\u2019ve expanded and enhanced our loyalty program, Booking.com to deliver more benefits to more of our traveler customers with more of our property and rental car partners participating. And lastly, we are continuing to strengthen the direct relationship with our travelers as our mobile app room nights and total direct room nights continue to increase in our mix. We remain confident in our long-term outlook for the travel industry, which we believe will grow faster than GDP growth across our core markets. With that foundation of industry growth and the improvements we\u2019ve made to strengthen our offerings, we are positive about our future and believe we are well positioned to deliver attractive growth across our key metrics in the coming years. With our long-term positive outlook, solid financial performance and strong balance sheet, we returned over $10 billion to shareholders during 2023 by repurchasing our shares. Returning capital to shareholders will remain a high priority for the company going forward. And today, we are taking another important step in that journey by announcing that our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend to complement our existing share repurchase program. David will provide further thoughts on our approach to capital returns in his remarks. In addition to our strong financial results in 2023, we made meaningful progress against our key strategic priorities, which include : advancing our connected trip vision, further integrating AI technology into our offerings, supporting our supply partners and growing alternative accommodations and building more direct relationships with our traveler customers. Let me address the progress we have made in each of these areas. On the connected trip, we continue to take steps towards our long-term vision to make planning, booking and experiencing travel easier, more personal and more enjoyable, while delivering better value to our travelers and supplier partners. We believe this is important because we know the current travel experience is much more complicated, fragmented and frustrating to travelers than it should be. The contribution aims to greatly improve that experience for consumers which we believe will drive further differentiation of our offerings and lead to improved loyalty, increase direct bookings, higher frequency and a greater share of total travel spend on our platform over time. This is good not only for our travelers, but also for our partner suppliers who will be able to utilize different elements of the connected trip to obtain additional business in an efficient and lower cost way. As we continue to make progress in developing the connected trip, you will see incremental improvements and enhancements to our platform that moves us closer to this long-term vision. This approach allows us to realize benefits while we are building towards that future state. In fact, some of the key improvements to our platform over the last few years that I spoke about earlier were driven by our work on the connected trip. For example, our emerging platform at Booking.com is a foundational base to the connected trip, and it helps deliver a more seamless and frictionless booking experience for our travelers. Plus, it enables us to smartly merchandise a variety of partner and self-supply offers when appropriate. Another example would be the development of flights on Booking.com, with flights being one of the most important elements of travel outside of accommodations. In 2023, air tickets booked on our platforms increased 58% year-over-year driven primarily by the growth of Booking.com site offering. We continue to see a healthy number of new customers to Booking.com through the flight vertical, and are encouraged by the right that these customers book other services on our platform. Outside of flights and accommodations, we need solid progress in expanding the breadth of our attraction supply that is available to our travelers. While we do not expect attractions to be a major financial contributor on its own, we see benefits from a strong attractions offering given the potential bundling opportunities as we will see ability to increase traveler engagement with the app while travelers are in destination. Overall, we believe we have made great progress in building toward our Connected revision and we are starting to see early signs of the benefits. We continue to see a growing percentage of transactions, which we count as connectors though these are still a small percentage of our total transactions today. Importantly, we see these types of customers returning to us more frequently, and we point to experiment with expanding Genius program to include all travel verticals in 2024, which we expect will drive more value to travelers across the different elements of the connected trip. We plan to continue to build out our Connected Trip vision, which we believe will result in increased travel and supplier engagement with our platform. In order to achieve the easier and more personalized experience of the Connected Trip, we have always envisioned AI technology playing a central role. Over the last few quarters, I have discussed the hard work our teams have been doing to integrate generative AI into our offerings in innovative ways, including Booking.com\u2019s AI trip planner and Priceline\u2019s generative AI travels \u2013 named Penny. After launching Booking.com\u2019s AI trip planner in the U.S. last summer, we expanded the rollout to the UK market in the fourth quarter. At this early stage, the team remains focused. I learn more about customers who want to interact with the tool and what types of questions they will ask. We see the AI trip planner is getting better answering customers\u2019 inquiries and we are excited to start testing other verticals out of accommodations. At Priceline, last week, they announced their weaker product release, which included several enhancements to Penny following 6 months of real-world interaction with users that resulted in valuable learnings from the Priceline team. Priceline\u2019s AI travel assisted product can now help travelers be on just the hotel category as it now covers flights, car rentals and vacation packages. While was nicely launched at the end of the booking funnel on the checkout page, it is now available on the Priceline homepage where it can help with travel planning, booking and modifying a trip as we booked. This is a clear example of how our teams iterate and enhance our AI-powered products as we learn more through user interactions. We continue to see encouraging signs that Priceline\u2019s Penny product helps lower customer service contact across travel verticals, and we believe, improves the customer experience. Beyond improving customer service contact rates, we believe that, over time, we can leverage generative AI technology to help make our customer service agents more efficient across our entire Outside of customer service, we continue to explore areas where we believe we can use generative AI tools to increase productivity. We have early indications that using generative AI enhances the productivity of our software developers and are encouraged by the results so far. We look forward to experimenting with these and other ways Gen AI tools might make our business more efficient in the future. Turning to our supply partners. We strive to be a trusted and valuable partner for all accommodation types on our platform. And we look to add value for our partners by delivering incremental bookings and developing products and features to help support their businesses. The majority of our partners are small independent businesses, and we are pleased to see many are reporting significantly improved business performance over the last year. We believe that helping our smaller partners thrive contributes to the long-term diversity and sustainability of our sector. One area in which we work with many small independent businesses is through our alternative combination offering comp. This is an area which we have continued to strengthen our business, increasing supply and raising product awareness on many travelers. Also combination room nights grew 19% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and 24% for the full year, which was faster our traditional hotel category. We saw meaningfully higher growth in our U.S. alternative accommodation room nights, though this is all a relatively small Globally, alternative accommodations represented about 33% of Booking.com\u2019s total room nights in 2023, which was 3 percentage points higher than in 2022. Our strong trend of accommodation room nights growth is benefiting from having more listings available on our platform were travelers to choose from. We are seeing continued momentum in annual turn combination supply both globally and in the U.S. with global listings reaching about 7.4 million by the end of 2023, which is about 12% higher than the 6.6 million last year. We\u2019re focused on continuing to build on this progress by further improving the product for our supply partners and travelers, particularly in the U.S. For our travelers, we remain focused on building a better experience that leads to increasing loyalty, frequency, spend and direct relationships over time. I am encouraged that in 2023 at Booking.com, we had strong growth in our base of our peak bookers, demonstrating strong retention, while we\u2019re also pleased with the increase in the number of new users to our platform versus 2022. We\u2019re also strengthening the direct relationship with our travelers as our mix of customers booking directly on our platforms continues to increase year-over-year in the fourth quarter and when measured for the full year. We see a very high level of direct bookings in the mobile app, which is an important platform as it allows us more opportunities to engage directly with travelers. Our mix overnight through our mobile apps increased year-over-year by about 5 percentage points for the full year to 49%. Booking.com remained the number one downloaded travel app in the world in 2023. In Asia, Booking.com and Agoda are top five travel apps. And in the U.S. Booking.com, Priceline and OpenTable are all in the top 10 travel apps. We will continue our efforts to enhance the app experience to build on the recent success we have seen here. Finally, I want to briefly address a regulatory matter that\u2019s impacting the financial results we are reporting today. The Spanish Competition Authority has issued a draft decision alleging infringement by Booking.com of Spanish competition law and then intends to issue a fine of $530 million. We could not disagree more with this draft decision and the arbitrarily large fine that they imposed, which is completely disproportionate to the alleged conduct. If the draft decision were to become fine, we plan to appeal. The success of our business is built on a mutually beneficial and balanced partnership with our millions of hotels and other accommodation partners around the world. We provide exceptional choice, value and service for travelers and we provide a marketplace for hotels and other partners that allows them to attract travelers from around the world at lower cost than many other marketing channels. We have a clear track record of cooperating with many competition and consumer authorities to find amicable and workable solutions to their concerns, including working with the year being commission on the Digital Markets Act. As we have previously disclosed, we plan to file our notification for designation under the DMA suit. And we believe the main concerns raised by the Spanish Authority overlap with the DMA. We will continue to work closely with these regulatory bodies to maintain consistent rules. And most importantly, we will continue to ensure that we are offering the best possible platform to our partners and our customers. In conclusion, I am encouraged by the strong fourth quarter results and the continued of leisure travel demand. Our teams continue to execute well against our key strategic priorities, which helps position our business well over the long-term. We continue our work to deliver a better offering experience for our supply partners and our travelers. We are confident in the long-term growth of travel and the opportunities ahead for our company. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden. David Goulden : Thank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I will review our results for the fourth quarter and provide some color on the trends we see in the first quarter and \u2013 on 2024. All growth rates are on a year-on-year basis unless otherwise indicated. We will be making some references to the comparable periods in 2019 where we think these are helpful. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. We will post our prepared remarks to the Booking Holdings Investor Relations website after the conclusion of the earnings call. One housekeeping item before discussing our results. We have reclassified digital services taxes into sales and other expenses and out of G&A expense. Due to the highly variable nature of GSTs, which are tied to the revenue earned in the countries where GST are enacted. We have provided a table with two areas of updated quarterly financials in our earnings press release that reflects this chain P&L geography, and all of my comments on this call will also reflect the change. Now on to our quarter results. Our room nights in the fourth quarter grew 9% year-over-year and 21% versus 2019, which was slightly better than our expectations of about 9% and 20%. Excluding Israel, Q4 room rights were up 11% versus 2022 and 22% versus 2019. Looking at our year-over-year room nights by region in the fourth quarter, Asia was up mid-teens Europe was up low double digits, Rest of World was up low single digits, and the U.S. was flat. All regions improved from October. The average booking window of Booking.com expanded in Q4 versus the same period in both 2022 and 2019, but was a bit less expanded than it was in the third quarter.  In Q4, mobile app mix of about 53% was about 5 percentage points higher than the fourth quarter of 2022. We continue to see an increasing mix of our total room nights coming to us through the direct channel. The direct channel increased as a percentage of our room nights in the fourth quarter relative to the fourth quarter of 2022. The international mix of our room nights in Q4 was 50%, up from about 48% in the fourth quarter of 2022 and reaching about the same level as the pre-pandemic Q4 mix. Our cancellation rate in the fourth quarter was slightly higher than Q4 2022, impacted by the war in the Middle East. As we expected, the higher overall cancellation in October normalized by the end of the quarter. For our alternative accommodations at Booking.com, our Q4 room night growth was 19% year-over-year, and the global mix of alternative body room nights was about 32%, which was up versus about 29% in the fourth quarter of 2022. Q4 gross bookings increased 16% year-over-year or about 15% on a constant currency basis, which was ahead of our expectations. The 16% increase in gross bookings was 7 percentage points higher than the 9% room night growth due to about 4% higher accommodation constant currency ADRs, plus over 1 percentage point of positive impact from each of FX movements and flight bookings. Our year-over-year ADR growth was natively impacted by regional mix due to higher mix of room nights from Asia. Excluding regional mix, constant currency ADRs were up about 5 percentage points year-over-year. Despite higher ADRs in the fourth quarter, we have not seen a change in the mix of hotel star rating levels being booked or changes in the length of stay that could indicate that consumers are trading down. We continue to watch the dynamics closely. Airline tickets booked in the fourth quarter were up about 46% year-over-year, driven by the continued growth of Booking.com\u2019s flight offering. Revenue for the fourth quarter exceeded our expectations, increasing 18% year-over-year or about 17% on a constant currency basis. Revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was 15.1%, which was about in line with our expectations. Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line increased 9% year-over-year. Marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings was about 30 basis points lower than Q4 2022 due to higher ROIs in our paid channels and a higher mix of business. Performance margin ROIs increased year-over-year, helped by our ongoing efforts to improve the efficiency of our marketing spend. Marketing and merchandising combined as a percentage of gross bookings in Q4 was about 15 basis points lower than last year, which was better than our expectation due to lower merchandising expense, higher direct mix and better performance marketing ROIs. Q4 sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings were up about 20 basis points compared with last year and also about 20 basis points above our expectation normalize for the DST reclassification, due in large parts to higher accounts receivable provisions related to our decision to delay some collections during the partner payment issue we discussed last quarter. We do not expect this to be an ongoing issue. More fixed expenses in aggregate were up 21% year-over-year, which was below our expectations primarily due to lower personnel and IT expense as well as due to the DST reclassification. 21% is calculated usually on non-GAAP expenses in both Q4 2023 and Q4 2022. Adjusted EBITDA of almost $1.5 billion was ahead of our expectation and was up 18% year-over-year and would have been about 22% on a constant currency basis. Separately, Q4 adjusted EBITDA was negatively impacted by a $37 million loss recorded in other income related to the devaluation of the Argentinian peso, which is not factored into our prior guidance. This reduced Q4 adjusted EBITDA margin by almost 1%. Non-GAAP net income of $1.1 billion resulted in non-GAAP earnings per share of $32 a share, which was up 29% year-over-year. Our average share count in the fourth quarter was 9% below Q4 2022. Our non-GAAP results exclude $276 million or expense in personnel related to a ruling in the Netherlands pension fund matter and $530 million of expense in G&A related to a draft decision by a Spanish Competition Authority. I\u2019d like to provide some perspective on each of these. As Glenn mentioned, we strongly disagree with the draft decision and unprecedented fine proposed by Spanish Competition Authority, which we plan to appeal if it becomes final. The appeal process could take a few years. During any appeal process, we would expect to influence some changes to our business practices in Spain, we do not currently undertake that these will have a significant impact on our business. Turning to the Dutch pension case. In January, the court of appeal in the ruled the most Booking.com employees in the Netherlands should enroll \u2013 in a travel industry-wide pension fund. The liability we recorded in our Q4 results is for prior periods related to this pension plan. We\u2019re working through how we align this travel industry-wide plan with the existing pension plan we offer to our employees in the Netherlands. We expect there will be some increase in our pension plan costs in the Netherlands going forward, but we do not expect these to be material. On a GAAP basis, we had net income of $222 million in the quarter. When looking at the full year, we are pleased to report that our \u2013 2023 room nights grew 17% year-over-year, and our gross bookings grew 24% and about 25% on a constant currency basis. Our full year revenue was over $21 million, which was up 25% year-over-year and up similarly on a constant currency basis. Full year revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was 14.2% in 2023, which is up slightly versus 14.1% in 2022. For the full year, there is more than 0.5 points of positive impact from timing as well the benefit to take rates from increased revenues associated with payments, but this was mostly offset by an increase in the mix of flights, an increase in Asia mix has really recovered and by our increased investments in merchandising. Our underlying accommodation take rates continue to be in line with 2019 levels. For the full year, our marketing plus merchandising at Booking.com as a percentage of gross bookings was 5.6%, down from 5.9% in 2022, driven by marketing efficiencies and direct mix. The 5.6% in 2023 is still up from 5.5% in 2019 and are leading into a recovered travel market more than offset gains due to increased direct mix. For the full year, the direct channel as a percentage of our room nights, continue to increase in mix. When we exclude our B2B or business-to-business, our direct mix was in the low 60% range for the year. Our full year EBITDA was more than $7 million and was up 34% year-over-year and up about 37% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 33%, which was 12 percentage points higher than our adjusted EBITDA margin in 2022 and in-line with our expectations at the start of the year. Our full year non-GAAP earnings per share was about $152 a share, which is up 52% year and up about 58% on a constant currency basis. Now on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q4 ending cash and investment balance of $13.1 billion was down versus our Q3 ending balance of $14.3 billion due to the $2.4 billion in share repurchases we completed in the quarter partially offset by the $1.3 billion of free cash flow we generated in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we generated $7 billion in free cash flow. We repurchased over $10 billion worth of shares in 2023, taking our remaining repurchase authorization down to $14 billion and reducing our year-end share count by 9% versus 2022 and by 16% versus 2021, which is just before we restarted our share repurchase program. As we think about our capital structure and allocation framework going forward, we remain focused on appropriately investing in our business and growing returns for our shareholders while maintaining our strong investment-grade credit ratings. Given our confidence in our earnings power, strong free cash flow profile and our ability to consistently shareholders, we are announcing today that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $8.75 per share to complement our existing share repurchase program. The dividend is payable March 28, 2024 to shareholders record on March 8, 2024. We believe the introduction of a dividend will allow us to enhance our capital return program and further expand our base of investors. In terms of composition of capital returns, we expect the share repurchases will represent the vast majority of our total capital return to shareholders going forward. We continue to expect to complete the $24 billion share repurchase authorization we announced early 2023 within 4 years where we started, which would be before the end of 2026. We reiterate our previously stated gross leverage target 2x, and our goal to move to a 1x net leverage over time. The initiation of a dividend does not change our thinking around these targets. Now on to our thoughts for the first quarter of 2024. All growth rates are on a year-on-year basis. Given that we\u2019re now beyond the COVID period, when granular short-term information was helpful in assessing the path \u2013 we\u2019re returning to our historical guidance approach with outcome range for the full quarter ahead and less detail on monthly trends and individual P&L line items. Based on the solid travel demands we\u2019ve seen so far in the first quarter, we expect Q1 room night growth to be between 4% and 6%. We expect the ongoing war in the Middle East have a negative 1% impact on Q1 room night growth. We\u2019re also comparing with a strong start to the year in 2023 when we started to see an expansion of the booking window. January room night growth was above the high end of that range. As we move through the quarter, every room bank growth will benefit from an extra day, our March room night growth will be hurt by Easter being in March. We expect these to roughly offset each other. We expect Q1 gross bookings growth to be between 5% and 7%, about 1 percentage point faster than room night growth due to slightly higher accommodation constant currency ADRs and faster growth from flights, partially offset by about 1 percentage point of FX pressure. We expect Q1 revenue growth will be between 11% and 13%, faster than Q1 bookings growth due in part to the Easter shift, which we expect to bear the Q1 revenue by about 3 percentage points. We expect a similar native impact on revenue growth in Q2. We expect Q1 adjusted EBITDA to be between $680 million and $720 million, which at the midpoint would be 19% year-on-year growth and about a 1 percentage point increase in EBITDA margin. We expect EBITDA margin to bank from market expenses growing slower than revenue and growing similar to gross bookings, which we expect will more than offset our fixed OpEx growth growing slightly faster than revenue. As we set our course to the full year ahead, I want to first address our longer-term ambition for growth in our business. As we\u2019ve discussed previously, in a more normalized market environment, we\u2019re aiming to achieve constant currency growth rates for gross booking revenue and earnings per share that are higher than what we achieved in 2019. This would remain growing above 8% for each of the top line metrics and about 15% for earnings per share. We believe we\u2019ll be able to achieve these levels of growth, given the investments we made to build a stronger business and a better offering for our travelers and partners versus what we had 5 years ago. At recent FX rates, we expect changes in FX will negatively impact our reported growth rate by a little more than 1 percentage point. With that framework and with FX in mind, we expect to grow our full year 2024 slightly faster than 7% and including the assumption that the war in the Middle East will negatively impact our full year 2024 growth rate by 1%. We expect revenue for the year to grow at similar rate to our gross bookings growth. We expect a more fixed expense in 2024 to grow in the low to mid-teens. We are planning to leverage from these more fixed expenses in 2025. We expect 2024 adjusted EBITDA will grow slightly faster than revenue, largely due to expectations for an increased direct mix. We expect adjusted EBITDA margins to expand year-over-year by a bit less than a percentage point. Lastly, we expect EPS growth to be above 40%. In closing, we are pleased with our Q4 results, our Q1 outlook and our expectation in 2024 to grow faster than 2019 across gross bookings, revenue, adjusted EBITDA and EPS with exceeding EBITDA margin year-over-year. We expect 2024 to be another strong year for us. We\u2019ll now move to Q&A. Sarah, will you please open the lines? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Justin Post : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. One for David, and I guess this might be your last call, I would love to hear about your \u2013 who you are on CFO transition. But the guidance, is January growing above the 4% to 6% for room nights? I thought January might have tougher comps. So, maybe talk a little bit about the shape of the quarter. And then maybe bigger picture for Glenn. Just was wondering, you have so much data as the share leader in room nights. How do you think the AI transition could play out for booking? And do you think you have some advantages versus search engines or your peers? How you are thinking about that? Thank you. David Goulden : Yes, Justin thanks. Let me take the first one, and handover to Glenn for the second one. So, yes, as I have said in my remarks, just to reiterate, January is \u2013 did grow faster than the high end of the 4% to 6% range that we talked about. It did benefit, we believe, slightly maybe in the range of about 1% from the shift of Chinese New Year this year, which we expect to be offset in February. And as we said, we would expect therefore, February and March to have a lower growth rate, in January, essentially consistent with our prior guidance of expecting deceleration during the quarter. Glenn Fogel : Thanks Dave for that. And Justin, AI, obviously incredibly important subject for everybody in any business right now. And I think I talked about it at the last call and have been talking about it a lot whenever I speak about how important this is for anybody who is looking to the future to create something that could be transformational. We are very early, as I have said in the past. I like pointing out the things that we have done so far and some of the early signs we see that this is going to be just fantastic for us. Nobody knows how long it will take. One of the things I love is us being in a position because of our financial position, because of the number of people we have who have capabilities to look into this. Because of the data we have, as you pointed out, that people can then be able to use it to create models and use it in ways that are complementary to other people, are doing in terms of creating large language models and so on. I do believe we have an advantage because of our size and scale and the capabilities of our people to create something in all parts of the business, whether it would be, as I discussed, things that help the traveler, which are the sort of products there or helping us in the back part of our business, the back office and make these more efficient, going throughout. I think we do have an advantage, of course, we will see over time how well and how quickly we can actually translate that into better numbers in terms of margins, in terms of more people coming to us, people increasing loyalty, etcetera. But I am very encouraged with what I am seeing so far. And I certainly believe that we do have the full position here in the travel industry. David Goulden : Justin, just before we hand back to the operator for the next question. I just want to reiterate two other things I said about the Q1 room night guide. This is growth after the impact of about a point of hurt from the Middle East. And of course, we are comping against a very strong start to last year when we saw room nights of the booking window moving from a contracted position to an expanded position in the first quarter that also created some strong results in Q1 last year. So, you have to factor those things into account as well. Justin Post : Great. Thank you. And David, this is your last call. We will miss you. Thanks for all the work over the years. David Goulden : Thanks Justin. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Kopelman with TD Cowen. Your line is open. Kevin Kopelman : Thanks so much. I wanted to ask about marketing. First, merchandising was only up slightly in the mix or only up slightly as a percentage of GBV, I should say, 2023. Do you feel that that\u2019s reached a steady state in the mix, or do you see incremental pushes this year in merchandising? And then on advertising, are you seeing any changes to the bidding environment? David Goulden : Okay. Yes. So Kevin, so we have now, I think as you characterize, we can ask here with our merchandising activities that\u2019s been something that we have been ramping up over time, Booking.com. And I think we now kind of deploy it in place in where we plan to deploy it. So, it has reached more of a state and new store, only a slight increase in merchandising in total from last year to this year as a percentage of GBV. So, when we kind of look at our model going forward, we do expect that across marketing merchandising with our continued increase in direct mix, that can be a source of leverage for us. And of course, as I mentioned in my commentary about the full year, that will be the biggest driver of our EBITDA margin expansion this year and will be joined by OpEx next year. And then relative to the competitive environment, it stays competitive. I mean these are very competitive markets. There are many players in there. I think people realize it\u2019s not just the OTAs, there are meta players, there are hotel players, there are chains you name it, a lot of people are bidding in these marketplaces. So, I think it just remains competitive, but we are pleased with how we are doing in a competitive marketplace. Glenn Fogel : And Kevin, just a reference back to Justin\u2019s question about AI and data and merchandising, how we do it, etcetera. One of the great things I really see about our position is that using data, using all things you know to merchandise smartly. Do it where we think it\u2019s going to give us an advantage and not do it where we are just giving away money. And I really see as all as AI technology develops further, as we begin to optimize over time, with all the different parts of the connected trip, we are going to be able to provide value to both the travelers and be able to get our suppliers to help provide merchandising opportunities and us doing an intelligent way. So, it\u2019s win for the traveler, win for the partner and us as the people are doing all this, we will also win. Kevin Kopelman : Great. Thanks Glenn. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Mark Mahaney : Okay. Thanks. Two questions, please. In terms of your guidance for the full year on the margins side, what are you embedding in there in terms of marketing or sales and marketing spend and merchandising spend as a percentage of bookings? Are you assuming a little bit of leverage in there? And I am sorry if you covered that in your published comments, but if you could answer that. And then secondly, on the buybacks in Q3, I think they were a little \u2013 in Q4, I think they were a little bit lower than in Q3, was that your intention? Was there a particular reason why you maybe \u2013 may have been a little less active than the market in Q4? Thank you very much. David Goulden : Alright. Thank you, Mark. I will take those. So, as I have said in the prepared remarks, the biggest driver of leverage we expect this year on EBITDA margin going to be from our direct mix increase, which means that we will have a small sustain to the business, which has paid a higher percent of mix and therefore, we would expect to get some leverage on marketing and merchandise. We expect to continue to be aggressive and still lead into the markets where we are spending money on paid marketing and we don\u2019t necessarily \u2013 we are offsetting anything about our ROI on that to tip any hand, but we would expect that it would be the direct mix increase. It will be the driver of leverage in marketing and merchandising therefore would be the driver of improvement in our EBITDA margins. On the buybacks in Q4, I think they are roughly same in size to Q3. At the start of Q4, where share price was lower, we said if the share price stays at a lower level, we will buy more in Q4 than we did in Q3. Share price moved up during the quarter, and we take share price into account when thinking about the level of buybacks and of course we have taken the long-term view. But in the short-term, we do moderate based upon how share price moves. So, that\u2019s perhaps why it\u2019s being a little bit less than you may have expected. A little bit less than we perhaps indicated on the last earnings call, but still a big number and still over $10 billion for the year as you see a significant reduction in our share count\u2026 Mark Mahaney : Thank you, David. It makes a lot of sense. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Doug Anmuth : Thanks for taking the question. I just want to follow-up on the full year outlook. I mean it sounds like you are very confident in the business overall. Just does the full year outlook reflect just normalization of trends in \u201824? The tough comp and the Middle East impact that you mentioned, is there anything else to consider here? Thanks. David Goulden : Yes. I think there is a couple of things to bear in mind in the full year outlook. Bear in mind, we talked about our framework. So, we said that we would grow faster than 8 and 8.15 on a constant currency basis. And we are saying we are going to do that with the impact of the Middle East on slowing our business down. So, I think that is a positive outlook. Of course, we have adjusted the numbers to a reported number. So, when you include the FX shift at current rates of roughly 1%, then the 8, 8.15 becomes 7, 7.4. But again, it\u2019s essentially 8, 8.15 on a constant currency basis, and we expect to be higher than that even with roughly a point of hurt to the business on the top line and the bottom line from what\u2019s happening in the Middle East. So, it\u2019s consistent with our framework and I believe is confident of our position of the travel market and our continued ability to gain share in travel. Doug Anmuth : Thank you, David. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my questions guys. I have two sort of on the U.S. The first one, when you talk about the U.S. being flat, does that include alternative accommodations? So, is the hotel business in the U.S. actually declining then? That\u2019s the first one. And then just sort of, Glenn, as you look into 2024, what are the investments you have to make in the U.S., both on the hotel side as well as the alternative accommodation side to sort of drive more and more durable, consistent growth from here? David Goulden : Yes. I will start with the first one, back to Glenn, the second one. So, U.S. was flat for the quarter, but bear in mind, it was down in October. And October, it was driven very much by the kind of ripple shock effect of the \u2013 what was happening in the Middle East. So, therefore it was back into growth mode in November and December in order to put our plant for the quarter. So, I wouldn\u2019t read too much into a whole quarter that you have got to kind of look what happened in October. Yes, that doesn\u2019t call alternatives. As Glenn said, alternative grew very nicely in the U.S., but it\u2019s a much lower mix of our business in the U.S. than it is in other parts of the world. So, again, I wouldn\u2019t go too much into assuming that means that hotels are\u2026 Glenn Fogel : Yes. And regarding \u2013 the question regarding how we are going to do even better in the U.S., we have talked about the numbers that we have shown so far. I am very pleased you look back to 2019, see what our steer was, that what numbers we then look at them now, it goes really fantastic growth and great work by the team. I think last quarter, I had out to the team then and I will do it again because they are doing fantastic work. One of the things is because the under-indexed, because we are smaller in terms of not clear [ph] of the U.S. versus other parts, this is a great opportunity for us. And I have talked about we have to continue to improve our product particularly in the alternative accommodation on account of that, and we have been doing that. And that\u2019s why we have this large growth rate in the U.S. alternative accommodations. Very pleased to see that happening. They continue to provide to our hotel partners what they need and what they want is incremental demand. They don\u2019t want us to be a provider to manage they think they can always get. And one of the great things about our team is working closely with our hotel partners. As you know, a lot of the U.S. is large chains, and we have developed, I think a very good relation with them to work together to help them, do what they need to do to achieve their results and us being a provider of those services and getting what we need, which is more bookings. I am pleased with the results we have done so far. And I think we have got a great opportunity to continue to do so for a long time. Brian Nowak : Thank you both. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Lee with Mizuho. Your line is open. James Lee : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Two here, I think Glenn, you talked about maybe increasing supply of home accommodation \u2013 alternative accommodation in the U.S. Can you elaborate, maybe talk about that plan a little bit, help us understand your strategy there. And also secondly, I think you guys talked about maybe on the loyalty program to include all verticals in 2024 would be great, you provide some details there as well. Thanks. Glenn Fogel : Thanks James. And I didn\u2019t quite get the second one. Let\u2019s start with the first one, maybe in front of the second one. So, it\u2019s interesting because in our last call, I went into a little bit about what do we need to do to increase that supply of alternative combinations. And I talked a little bit \u2013 and this is that high, it wasn\u2019t the first time I talked about this. Where we have \u2013 while we are even into urban and rural and such, I have talked in the past, though, how we don\u2019t have as many of the single properties that perhaps some of our competitors have less area down the road. But the whole idea is we want to do things efficiently and want do things effectively, which means it goes through the things where you can get larger groups of properties listing quicker by going to the big property managers who have a lot of them. That may be that you are going to end up with more things that are not with single home properties. But then after we have that enough, and that\u2019s the low-hanging fruit after we got that comes, then we got to go on and start getting more of the single homes, etcetera. And I have expressed my own disappointment that when I look for a single property sometimes I have mentioned, at one point on the call about wanting to get something out in the Hampton and New York for the summer and not seeing enough properties for us. There is lots of opportunity. But I look at this as an opportunity, not as a negative, but then you look how well we are doing, even though there is all the other stuff to go out and get. That\u2019s the way I feel about it, and I am pleased the way the team is going out. Look, 12% increase in our listings or $6.6 million, now over $7.4 million, I like the fact that we are increasing those numbers, doing it in a nice size and also particularly really like the fact that our growth rate of return on the combination was significantly higher than some other people in our space. So, I was very happy to see that. I didn\u2019t catch the second part of James\u2019 question. James Lee : Yes, of course. The second part of the question is about your loyalty program Genius. I think Glenn you had mentioned you want to include all travel verticals into the program this year. And I was wondering if you can provide some details on that. Glenn Fogel : Sure. Okay. So, what I would said is we are going to experiment. And we really see, we always want to experiment, where do things work, where do we see return for it, where do we see how this is working so well. So, we are going to continue to experiment and we do have, for example, rental cars well established into our Genius program. Obviously, our combination as well and we are going to experiment with all the different verticals. And the thing, is there a way to do in flights, is there a way to do it in track and how do we do it in terms of potentially even insurance, in all sorts of ways, our ride business when people need a ride from the airport to the hotel or hotel to the airport or from their home to the airport. Again, and this goes back to the first question, I think it was Justin asked about AI and about how you use data. And that\u2019s kind of one of the key things is when you have these models, and you can figure out what the best way to provide a benefit, and that\u2019s through our loyalty Genius program, that\u2019s doing that in a way that it provides value to the traveler, that\u2019s where they use us, that\u2019s why they come back to us. That\u2019s why they come to us direct. Maybe they will use the app because it\u2019s so simple to do it. At the same time, Genus is primarily almost right now, primarily being funded by our partners because they see value in that. They see value in providing a discount or some other type of benefit that we put into the offering, so that the travelers will book, that supplier what they want to sell. And doing to get it in a scientific way in doing it in a way that is going to make sure that we are not leaving value out of the cycle in a way that\u2019s not going to be beneficial to our supplier partners, doing it smartly, that\u2019s the thing that I love. And that\u2019s why we are going to continue to experiment on that. And I think it\u2019s worked so well in hotels and I think it\u2019s in a combination, alternative accommodations, I think this is going to work great in all of it. But we will see after we expand it. James Lee : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Eric Sheridan : Thanks so much. Maybe following up on that last question from James, you talked earlier about connected trip and feeling optimistic about attach rates there, but still work to do. When you think about what you are trying to accomplish with Connected Trip longer term and you think about rising conversion, reducing friction. What do you put it down to? Is it consumer education? Is it supply? How should we be thinking about the building blocks behind connected trip to accomplish your longer term goals? Thank you. Glenn Fogel : So, if the question was really how do we get from here early stage showing good signs, but it\u2019s still small to scale and really showing the bottom line and top line and a loyalty and all those things, I think that \u2013 is that the question really? Eric Sheridan : It is Glenn. Thanks. Glenn Fogel : Yes. So, look, one of the things that we have to \u2013 and I have said this is a long-term path. And the first thing was we had to build the verticals to begin with. One of the fun things was to mention that we started Booking.com we got off the ground in 2019 and now put all our flight numbers together, you see 400% increase there that\u2019s included, of course, Priceline had placed before that, where you just see the growth rate of flights right now, great. So, we got that vertical up and we got excellences up and attract is still early, but up. But these things \u2013 all of these things are the car rental was up, but we still do on that and of course the rides business and others. All of these things are at different levels of development, but still relatively new. And one of that, then we have to build all the modeling, all the ways to figure out what\u2019s the best way to offer one versus the other, and make sure that we are doing it the right way. And then it\u2019s working with our partner suppliers to provide us and prove out to them that this is worthwhile to them. All of these things take time. But I do like to say, we are seeing those signals. We are seeing the numbers. It is early and I am not going to do \u2013 I am sure you would like me to give you some numbers, say, here is what it\u2019s going to be tomorrow. Here is what the next milestone. I am going to do that. And I can\u2019t say I see we are on the right path. Eric Sheridan : Great. Thank you. And thank you for everything David, congrats on the last call and good luck for everything. David Goulden : Thank you, Eric. Operator : That is all the time we have for questions. I will turn the call to Glenn for closing remarks. Glenn Fogel : Thank you. So, I want to thank our partners, our customers, our dedicated employees, our shareholders. And as mentioned by a couple of people on the call, I have to give out a very special thank you to my very good friend and colleague, David Goulden. As you know, after 24 earnings calls as Booking Holdings CFO, he is retiring from this role and will be working on other areas of the business going forward. We greatly appreciate everything that David has done for this company, and we greatly appreciate everyone else\u2019s support as well as we continue to build on the long-term vision of our company. Thank you very much and good night. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s call. We thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

And now I'd like to introduce Booking Holdings speakers for this afternoon, Glenn Fogel and Ewout Steenbergen. Go ahead, gentlemen. Glenn Fogel : Thank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings' First Quarter Conference Call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, Ewout Steenbergen. I am pleased to report a strong start to 2024. Our travelers booked nearly 300 million room nights across our platforms in the first quarter, which exceeded our expectations and grew 9% year-over-year. First quarter revenue of $4.4 billion grew 17% year-over-year, and adjusted EBITDA of about $900 million increased 53% year-over-year. Both revenue and adjusted EBITDA were ahead of our first quarter expectations. Finally, adjusted earnings per share in the first quarter grew 76% year-over-year, helped by improved profit levels as well as our strong capital return program, which reduced our average share count by 9% versus the first quarter last year. We continue to see resiliency in global leisure travel demand, including healthy growth for travel on the books that's scheduled to take place during our peak summer travel season, although a high percentage of these bookings are cancelable, and what is on the books today represents a modest percentage of the expected total summer bookings. As we look ahead to the second quarter, room night growth compared to last year will benefit from the shift in Easter timing. However, we expect that this will be offset by a less expansion of the booking window and an increased impact from the geopolitical situation in the Middle East. We believe this will result in some deceleration in room night growth versus Q1. Ewout will provide further details on our first quarter results and our thoughts about the second quarter. Over the last few years, we have talked quite a bit about our key strategic priorities, which include building towards our connected trip vision, expanding our merchant offering at Booking.com, developing our AI capabilities and enhancing our genius loyalty program. These initiatives may seem to be distinct efforts, but I'd like to emphasize, they actually all fit together in our ongoing effort to deliver a much better planning, booking and traveling experience for our travelers while also benefiting our supplier partners. By creating a much better experience for our travelers and solving more of the challenges they face when planning, booking and experiencing a trip, we believe travelers will choose to book directly and more frequently with us, resulting in increased loyalty over time. We see encouraging early proof points at Booking.com as we have grown the number of total active travelers while experiencing higher growth in repeat travelers, which speaks to the progress we are making in encouraging customers to book again with us. In addition, we are seeing increases in the average number of trips booked per traveler as well as an increasing mix of our room nights that are booked directly with us. On direct mix, we are pleased to see the direct booking channel continues to grow faster than room nights acquired through paid marketing channels. While we see paid marketing channels becoming a gradually smaller proportion of our business over time, we think it's important for us to remain proactive in these channels in order to bring new travelers to our platforms, so long as we're able to do so at attractive ROIs. We believe continuing to improve the experience for our travelers by advancing towards our connected trip vision will help to further drive these positive proof points around loyalty, frequency and direct booking behavior. I'm encouraged to see strong growth in transactions that are connected to another booking from a different travel vertical in a trip. These connected transactions increased by just over 50% year-over-year in the first quarter, though it's important to note that this growth is off of last year's small base. Connected transactions represented a high single-digit percentage of Booking.com's total transactions in Q1. It's great to see more of our travelers choosing to book connected transactions. And we believe by providing more value and a better overall experience to those travelers, they may choose to book more trips with us and have a higher likelihood of booking directly with us in the future. Flights is the most frequently booked vertical in a connected transaction outside of accommodations. And it is an important component of many of the trips our travelers are booking. In the first quarter, air tickets booked on our platforms increased 33% year-over-year, driven primarily by the growth of Booking.com's flight offering. We continue to see a healthy number of new customers to Booking.com through the flight vertical and are encouraged by the rate that these customers and returning customers see the value of the other services on our platform. Winning a traveler's business is never easy because of the high level of competition in our industry. But we are pleased to see that by providing a better way to do it, less friction, better value, a broader selection and great customer service, we are building a customer base that is more likely to choose us. Outside of flights and accommodations, we are seeing strong growth from rental cars and attraction bookings that are part of a connected transaction. We believe continuing to enhance and expand the attractions vertical has the ability to increase traveler engagement with the app while travelers are in destination and looking for something to do. And we believe that over time, travelers who experience the value we provide for in-destination services like attractions will choose to use us more in the future. Bringing all of these elements of travel together in a seamless booking experience and unlocking the ability of merchandise across verticals is a capability we have been building at Booking.com over the last several years. In addition to being a foundational element to our connected trip vision, our merchant offering brings many other benefits to our travelers and partners. For travelers, we provide the ability to pay in many different methods. And we can offer discounts, incentives and other merchandising opportunities. For our supplier partners, our merchant offering enables us to take fraud liability from our partners as part of the services we provide, reduces cancellation rates versus the agency model. And over time, we believe we can help to lower payment costs for our partners. In order to achieve the easier and more personalized experience with the connected trip, we have always envisioned AI technology playing a central role. We believe we are well positioned to leverage this technology given we have built strong teams of AI experts and gained valuable experience from using AI extensively for many years. In addition, we have proprietary data that can be used to train specific use case models or fine-tune large AI models and have the resources and scale required to help build AI-powered offerings. As we have discussed before, our teams continue to work hard to integrate generative AI into our offerings in innovative ways, including Booking.com's AI Trip Planner, Priceline's generative AI travel assistant named Penny and Kayak's recent release of generative AI-powered features and tools. We will continue to learn from traveler interactions with these tools and enhance our offerings over time. In addition, customer service, which is a critical function that we provide to both our travelers and partners, is an area we believe will be meaningfully enhanced by AI advancements. At each of our OTA brands, our teams are actively exploring ways to leverage generative AI technology to improve self-service tools, which we believe will reduce live agent contact rates and enable us to answer traveler questions faster. When customers still need to speak with a live agent, we believe that this technology will improve our live agent efficiency by making it easier to access information and document the conversations. In sum, we believe gen AI will lower our customer service cost per transaction over time and improve the customer experience.  Our Genius loyalty program at Booking.com also plays an increasingly important role in the multiple elements of travel that we offer as we expect our travelers will be able to experience the benefits of Genius in each of our travel verticals over time. In addition, bookings in travel verticals outside of accommodations will contribute to a traveler's Genius level tier. We have seen an encouraging number of our rental car supplier partners choosing to adopt the Genius program, and we have just begun to test the program in flights and attractions. We are seeing success in moving more of our travelers into the higher Genius tiers of Level 2 and Level 3, which require 5 and 15 bookings in a 2-year period, respectively. We see encouraging behavior from our Genius Level 2 and 3 travelers, including higher frequency and a higher rate of direct booking than what we see for our overall business. We will continue to explore opportunities to enhance our Genius loyalty program and deliver more benefits to our travelers with more of our supplier partners electing to participate. While we have mostly been discussing about our traveler customers, we operate a 2-sided marketplace, and our supplier partners are equally important to us. The success of our business is built on a mutually beneficial and balanced partnership with our millions of hotels, alternative accommodations and other supplier partners around the world. We strive to be a trusted and valuable partner for all accommodation types on our platform, the majority of which are small independent businesses. We believe that improving the competitiveness and profitability of our smaller partners contributes to the long-term economic health of our sector. And we continue to onboard more small independent businesses through our alternative accommodation offering at Booking.com, and we are benefiting from having more listings available on our platform for travelers to choose from. At the end of Q1, our global alternative accommodation listings were about 7.4 million, which is about 11% higher than Q1 last year. We are focused on continuing to build on this progress by further improving the product for our supply partners and travelers, particularly in the U.S.  In conclusion, I am encouraged by the strong first quarter results and the continued long-term resilience of leisure travel demand. We continue our work to deliver a better offering and experience for our supply partners and our travelers. We remain confident in our long-term outlook for the travel industry. We are positive about our future, and we believe we are well positioned to deliver attractive growth across our key metrics in the coming years.  I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Ewout Steenbergen. Ewout Steenbergen : Thank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I'm very excited to join the Booking Holdings team. I look forward to continuing to work with you and David in his new role and the rest of the leadership team to help drive continued future success for our investors, employees, traveler customers and supplier partners. I will now review our results for the first quarter and provide our thoughts for the second quarter. All growth rates are on a year-over-year basis. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found on our earnings release. We'll post our prepared remarks to the Booking Holdings Investor Relations website after the conclusion of the earnings call. Now let's move to the first quarter results. Our room nights in the first quarter grew 9%, which exceeded the high end of our guidance by about 3 percentage points. The higher-than-expected room night growth was driven by a continued expansion of the booking window as well as healthy underlying demand with better-than-expected performance in Europe and less of a negative impact from the war in the Middle East than expected. Looking at our room night growth by region. In the first quarter, Asia was up mid-teens. Europe and the rest of the world were up high single digits. And U.S. was up low single digits. We are encouraged by the continued progress we are making in strengthening the direct relationships with our travelers. Over the last 4 quarters, the mix of our total room nights coming to us through the direct channel was in the mid-50% range, and when we exclude our B2B business, was in the low 60% range. We have seen both these mixes increase year-over-year in each of those 4 quarters. We're focused on continuing to increase our direct mix going forward, which we believe will benefit from our efforts to improve the experience for our travelers, including building towards our connected trip vision. Increasing our direct mix benefits our P&L by driving higher efficiency of our marketing spend as a percentage of gross bookings while reducing the mix of bookings we source through paid marketing channels. In our mobile apps, the significant majority of bookings we receive are direct. And we continue to see favorable repeat direct booking behavior from consumers in our mobile apps when compared to direct bookings on desktop or mobile web. The mobile apps also allow us more opportunities to engage directly with consumers. In the first quarter, mobile app mix of about 51% was 5 percentage points higher than the first quarter of 2023. We continue to offer our travelers a broad selection of places to stay and are seeing an increasing mix of our room nights being booked in alternative accommodation properties. For our alternative accommodations at Booking.com, our first quarter room night growth was 13%. And the global mix of alternative accommodation room nights was 36%, which was up versus 33% in the first quarter of 2023. Outside of accommodations, we saw airline tickets booked on our platforms in the first quarter increased 33%, driven by the continued growth of Booking.com's flight offering. First quarter gross bookings increased 10%, which exceeded our expectations. The 10% increase in gross bookings was approximately 2 percentage points higher than the 9% room night growth on an unrounded basis due to about a 1% higher accommodation ADRs plus about 1 point of positive impact from flight bookings. There was an immaterial impact from changes in FX on our gross bookings growth rate. Our ADR growth was negatively impacted by regional mix due to a higher mix of room nights from Asia. Excluding regional mix, ADRs were up about 2 percentage points. Similar to comments we have made in the past, we have not seen a change in the mix of hotel star rating levels being booked or changes in the length of stay that could indicate that consumers are trading down. We continue to watch these dynamics closely. Revenue for the first quarter of $4.4 billion also exceeded our expectations, increasing 17% year-over-year. Revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was 10.1% and improved versus the first quarter of 2023 due mostly to the Easter timing shift as well as the easier year-on-year take rate compare due to changes in the booking window last year, as mentioned on our first quarter 2023 earnings call. Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line, increased 6% year-over-year. Marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings was 3.7%, about 15 basis points lower than the first quarter of 2023 due to higher ROIs in our paid channels and a higher mix of direct business. Performance marketing ROIs increased year-over-year, helped by our ongoing efforts to improve the efficiency of our marketing spend.  First quarter sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings was 1.6%, about 20 basis points higher than last year due in large part to a higher merchant mix. Our more fixed expenses on an adjusted basis were up 11%, which was below our expectation due primarily to lower G&A expense. We recognize that this fixed expense growth is elevated as we invest in the business but are fully focused on driving operating leverage from our more fixed expenses and targeting a much lower OpEx growth level in 2025. Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $900 million was above our expectations, largely driven by stronger-than-expected bookings as well as better-than-expected marketing efficiency. Adjusted EBITDA was up 53%, including about 20 percentage points of benefit from the shift in Easter timing. Note that we expect the first quarter will be our seasonally lowest EBITDA quarter for the year. Adjusted net income of over $700 million resulted in adjusted EPS of $20.39 per share, which was up 76%. Our average share count in the first quarter was 9% below the first quarter of 2023. On a GAAP basis, we had net income of $776 million in the quarter. Now on to our cash and liquidity position. Our first quarter ending cash and investments balance of $16.4 billion was up versus our fourth quarter ending balance of $13.1 billion due to the $3 billion debt issuance in the first quarter and $2.6 billion in free cash flow generated in the first quarter. This was partially offset by the $1.9 billion in capital return, including share repurchases and the dividend we initiated in the quarter as well as $315 million in additional share repurchases to satisfy employee withholding tax obligations.  Now on to our thoughts for the second quarter. We expect second quarter room night growth to be between 4% and 6%, a deceleration from the first quarter as the first quarter benefited more from the year-over-year expansion of the booking window. We expect the booking window to be closer to the prior year in the second quarter. Additionally, the impact from the ongoing war in the Middle East was less negative than we expected in the first quarter. However, we expect a more negative impact in the second quarter given the geopolitical situation in April. April room night growth rate was above the high end of that range and benefited by a couple of points from Easter being in March this year versus April last year. Adjusting for Easter, April room night growth was about in line with the high end of that range. We expect second quarter gross bookings growth to be between 3% and 5%, slightly below room night growth due to about 3 points of negative impact from changes in FX, offset by about 1% higher constant currency accommodation ADRs plus about 1 point of positive impact from flight bookings. We expect second quarter revenue growth to be between 4% and 6% and for revenue growth to be impacted by about 2 points of negative impact from changes in FX. Adjusted for the changes in FX, we expect second quarter revenue growth to be in line with second quarter gross bookings growth as the negative impact from the shift in Easter timing is offset by increasing revenues associated with payments. We expect marketing to be a source of slight deleverage in the quarter. But if you adjust for Easter timing, we expect marketing as a percentage of revenue to be neutral year-over-year. We expect our sales and other expenses to grow faster than revenue in the second quarter, driven by a higher merchant mix. We expect our more fixed OpEx to grow faster than revenue in the second quarter due primarily to faster IT expense growth as we have been investing in new tech platforms and in line with the full year guidance we provided last quarter. We expect second quarter adjusted EBITDA to be between about $1.7 billion and $1.75 billion, down low single digits year-over-year due to about 7 points of pressure from the shift in Easter timing and about 2 points of negative impact on growth from changes in FX. Normalizing for Easter timing and changes in FX, our expectation for second quarter adjusted EBITDA would be for mid- to high single-digit growth. In closing, we are pleased with our first quarter results and the healthy leisure demand environment we are seeing. In terms of our outlook for the full year, we're not updating our previous full year commentary at this time. We want to see how the next few months develop before considering any updated commentary. We continue to expect 2024 to be a strong year for the company. Lastly, I would like to thank all my new colleagues across the company for their hard work and dedication to make these strong first quarter results possible. And thank you for your continued commitment towards our shared vision of making it easier for everyone to experience the world. We'll now move to Q&A. And Kathleen, will you please open the lines? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Kevin Kopelman of TD Cowen. Kevin Kopelman : So a quick one on the guidance. Can you talk about what changed in terms of the shape of the year that you're seeing versus what you expected on the February call? And walk us through this kind of changing booking window trends that you're seeing. And then if you could comment on whether it's giving you any concern about the back half or you see it as more of a neutral change. Ewout Steenbergen : Kevin, this is Ewout. If you think about the second quarter guidance that we have provided to you, I think a couple of elements that you have to take in consideration. One is we are expecting a less expanded booking window in the second quarter than we have seen in the first quarter. So there has been a little bit of a pull forward of room nights from the second quarter into our first quarter results. We are expecting more of an impact from the Middle East from what we have seen so far. But in the opposite direction is that Easter is a slight benefit for the second quarter. There is a little bit of noise, so to say, in the results quarter-by-quarter, particularly from Easter and the booking window. But if you look at the combined first half year results that we are expecting, so the actuals in the first quarter and the guidance for the second quarter, we believe that the results are really strong and very consistent to full year guidance that we have provided.  In terms of the comps that you are referring, actually, first quarter and second quarter comps are a bit tougher for us. And the second half of the year, the comps will become easier. So that is actually going to be a benefit during the course of 2024. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney of Evercore. Mark Stephen Mahaney : Can I try 2 questions, please? First, why do you think the ROI is higher in paid marketing channels? Is that just efficiencies you found or you find that overall performance marketing channels, platforms that are out there are just providing a better return on ad spend to their customers in general? And then secondly, could you quantify at all what percentage of total transactions now are connected? Glenn Fogel : So why don't I say the first part, Mark, and I'll let Ewout talk a little bit about -- I think we gave away that -- a very generic term. I'll let him repeat it. So look, we are pleased with what we're doing with our marketing programs all around everything. And you know, Mark, we've talked about this for many, many years. We view this all holistically. And we're always looking for what is the best use of the money, what's the best way to put it to work. And when we find things that work, we put more into it. When we find things that actually are not incremental and are actually duplicative, we pull it out and say, well, let's not spend the money there. And that's really what we've been doing. And I'm not going to get into specific things because, obviously, it's competitively -- a competitive advantage to have these things are better. But I definitely, definitely love the fact that we are producing some very nice ROIs on our marketing programs. It's really a lot of hard work by a lot of people. So I'm going to going to shout out to them because I know they've done some really good work. And Ewout, do you want to give a -- repeat what we've already said once? But go ahead. Ewout Steenbergen : Sure. Mark, so the percentage of connected trip as a mix of total transactions at this moment is high single digits, and that is growing very rapidly. I think the way we look at it is really in combination with multiple other elements. We're seeing that we're delivering more value for our customers. Therefore, we see higher loyalty customers moving up to higher levels of Genius, more repeat customers coming to us. We can provide them more benefits over time. They're buying more from multiple verticals, and therefore, the connected trip is growing as well. So this is really a flying wheel that we're having here. And we're seeing all of these metrics moving in the right direction, and they are all interrelated. So we're actually really encouraged by the total pattern of what we're seeing in terms of the added value we deliver to the customer and how it is being recognized by those travelers. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post from Bank of America. Justin Post : I was wondering if you can give us the update of your regional mix. We get that question all the time and just how it's changed, any regions growing faster than others at this point and how it's changed maybe since pre-pandemic. And then second, the Digital Service Act in Europe has taken hold. And just wondering if you're seeing any changes in performance marketing channels around that or any disruptions or any opportunities. Glenn Fogel : Thanks, Justin. I kind of missed the second part. Let me start with the first part, and then let Ewout pick it up on the other. So regional mix. And one of the things that we've been talking about for some years because of the pandemic. The issue has been depending on when the pandemic was in its worst parts and then people coming out of it, definitely impacted how we're doing different regional ways. So as we talked in the last year's calls -- calls last year, we talked about how Asia had been behind in coming out, but of course, we're getting a good comp because they were farther behind. And now we're still benefiting from some of that. The U.S., if you recall, came out first. So of course, we had a harder comp, so to speak, when we're looking last year. But one of the things I've said, though, in terms of regional mix and one of the things, as you know, we are very strong in Europe. You also know that I have prioritized that we should be better in the U.S. And that is something we have been spending money, time, energy. And I'm really pleased, I've mentioned a couple of times in our previous calls, how well we have performed in the U.S. going back to pre-pandemic numbers. And it's just wonderful to see that the effort that we've put to work is actually producing results. We are going to continue to put priority in the U.S. I said that. And one of the areas where I think we've done extremely well, in our alternative accommodations. As you know, we have a very strong alternative accommodation on a global basis, but I've also talked in the past about us being a little bit further behind in the U.S. in alternative accommodations, particularly in types of properties that I think will be helpful in the U.S. And we are making good progress, and we're improving the product. And it's giving you the reason that people have supply, the people who own the homes are willing to come now and put them onto our platform, too. And you've seen some of our marketing, where we've been mentioning more about the alternative accommodations. All those things together are things the reason I believe we have a great opportunity to continue to increase our share in the U.S. and so I'm looking forward to. Ewout, I'll let you pick the rest because I didn't catch the second part. Ewout Steenbergen : Yes. And quickly to give a couple of numbers around the regional mix. Europe, high single-digit growth in the first quarter, that was above our expectations. Very important that we see even Europe continue to do better than our own internal expectations. Asia, mid-teens growth, particularly very strong, China, Japan, Korea, India and Indonesia. And then U.S. at low single-digit growth, as Glenn already mentioned, but we believe that we have done better than the market in the first quarter with our U.S. growth and are on great trajectory and have many additional opportunities to grow faster in the future in the U.S. With respect to your second question regarding the DMA changes, actually, if we look at the higher ROIs for our paid channels and the marketing leverage that we're seeing in the first quarter, that is all coming from our own actions, from the improvements we're making, the continuous optimization of our paid marketing approach as well as the growth of direct channels. We don't see really an impact from the Google DMA changes. And I would say that is more neutral for us as a total effect. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth of JPMorgan. Douglas Anmuth : Glenn, just hoping you could perhaps quantify anything on Genius frequency or bookings versus nonmembers? And maybe you can just help us understand what you see in the path of customers as they move into upper Genius loyalty tiers. And then Ewout, just a follow-up on your U.S. comments from a few minutes ago, the low single-digit room night growth above market. Is there anything to point to in that region in particular relative to the faster growth you've seen elsewhere? Glenn Fogel : Doug, we don't give away numbers in our Genius membership. We don't talk about how many are in different tiers. I can say, though, how pleased I am and how the whole program continues to grow. And that's why we're continuing to expand, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks about we are now testing additional verticals, flights, attractions. The idea is that to give more value to the traveler, but it also provides a great opportunity for our supplier partners to get incremental demand when they need it. It's really a symbiotic relationship here. We're working together with our partners to both increase the value of our business but also increase the value of their business. Genius is not something somebody has to do. A partner decides to participate and decides how they want to participate because they believe they are actually getting true value out of that. And we're going to continue to experiment with it in terms of different ways, and sometimes we'll even put value in ourselves to make sure that we are providing the best alternative for any traveler. They should come to us and then they start to come back. And we talked about that in my prepared remarks about -- Ewout just mentioned it, too. As people get more value, as they get a benefit, they see the reason to come back. And then they come back not only again and again more frequently, but it's the coming back to rep. And that's the great thing. And I see this as another reason. I love Ewout using the term. I think he said flywheeling. I use flywheel. It's the same thing. It's the idea that giving more value will get people to come back more often, and that is something I see great opportunity for us. And I'll let Ewout talk a little bit about the low single digit for the U.S., any more comments he wanted to make on that. Ewout Steenbergen : Yes, Doug, a couple of additional insights around the U.S. So what we like particularly is the sequential improvement from the fourth quarter in terms of our growth. Particularly within the growth, we saw the highest growth for alternative accommodations, which is really encouraging. If you look at U.S. bookers, more international growth than domestic growth. And then again, we really very much believe that U.S. is for us a growth market opportunity. It's fantastic with the scale that we have already today, with all the strategic expansions we're doing in multiple verticals and going more direct to connected trip, generative AI and many of the other strategic initiatives that we're having that we're actually having an opportunity to expand our position over the next few years in the U.S. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Lee from Mizuho Securities. Sorry, your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak : Maybe to come back to the last discussion you are having about the U.S. Over the last sort of 10 years or so, you've had a lot of strategies in the U.S. between branded spending, paid search spending, the merchant product and now AI. I guess maybe for either of you, as you sort of think about the next couple of years, what do you sort of think the largest unlock will be to differentiate yourself to drive continued outsized growth within the online travel category in the U.S.? Glenn Fogel : Brian, a couple of interesting things about that question. And it's interesting when you said online, you kind of limited to online. I just had the benefit of looking at a research report by -- an industry report that talked about how much business there is that's not online yet and seeing that, saying, wow, this is still a tremendous opportunity for us. I'm speaking specifically about U.S. But directly to your question, so you're right. We've been doing a lot of things, and I would say they all have worked out fairly well given the numbers, the share that we have increased over the time, again, going to pre-pandemic. And I love the way we're doing, the way it keeps going. And we're going to continue to grind it out. And I've talked about it. I've used that word a number of types in previous calls, about we're grinding it out, just doing incremental changes that are getting us a little bit more. And it continues to grow on itself. But I think your question more is, is there going to be something down the road that is going to be transformational instead of just incremental? And I believe that is possible. I believe the things that we are doing with AI, the things that we can do with technology, the way we can do it, so it really is different. And I think I hear your question a little bit of is there enough differentiation between us and our competitors. And I believe over time, we will be doing that. And I believe the things that we can build will make it different. And I talk about how -- the frustration that travelers have nowadays. So even though it's become so much better than it used to be, it's still not good enough. And I believe the use of AI, particularly gen AI, and what I'm seeing through, I'm seeing testing and things that are being done, I believe that over the next few years, it will become much better because of these technological advancements. Our job is to make sure we get it out fast, and we are able to provide it to both sides of the marketplace, to our supplier partners and our travelers, such that they see the value and they continue to come back. And then we begin. I love it. I'm going to be using flywheeling from now on. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Lee of Mizuho Securities. James Lee : Two over here. Can you guys comment about ADR by region and kind of what you're seeing among different markets that you're operating? And also, can you update us on ADR expectations for 2024? Maybe any changes from your prior expectation. I guess lastly, any trends that you see in terms of summer travel season, I guess, especially in Europe? How does that compare to last year? Glenn Fogel : ADR by regions, James, in the first quarter, what we have seen is ADRs were up in Europe and were flat in North America and in Asia. So therefore, on a constant currency basis, 1% overall growth in ADRs as we have reported today. Ewout Steenbergen : And in terms of summer, as I said earlier, I said that we have a healthy growth for travel on the books that's scheduled to take place during the peak summer. And that's where we're feeling that -- why I'm feeling pleased about the summer. I'm not going to quantify it though. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju of UBS. Stephen Ju : So I was wondering if there is anything you can share about how the folks who have access to Trip Planner might be behaving. It seems like there's a lot of potential application here because if they're doing research, then there's top-of-funnel implications. And then you could theoretically recommend other pieces of the trip as well. So this could theoretically drive greater connected trip activity. So just wondering. This has been out for a little less than a year. So I'm just wondering what you guys are seeing so far. Glenn Fogel : Yes. So it's low numbers of people who are using in such, and we're continuing to develop and learn all the time the interactions to see how people are using it. So it's a very small number of people compared to the number of people who use our services, but we are continuing to advance it. And I agree with you. This has tremendous potential down the road. And I think a lot of people believe that, too. In fact, it's very hard to read any article about generative AI and not have in the first paragraph the use case of travel. It's always right there because we all see how complex the number of permutations, trying to understand what is the best way to do it. And using gen AI to simplify it, it's really something that I believe will make a huge difference, albeit it's going to take time. You're not going to see tremendous changes over the next couple of quarters. But I do believe, over time, this will create a much better way for people to do their planning, their booking, executing and helping them when they are in destination, which is a really important thing because nobody goes on travel so they can sit it in the hotel. They want to do stuff. And we want to be able to provide that, too, and bring, as I said, about all the elements we've talked about, all the initiatives into one holistic system that enable it to be a better experience for our traveler customers. I believe that just has tremendous opportunity for us. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lee Horowitz of Deutsche Bank. Lee Horowitz : Great. Two if I could. Ewout, there remains sort of a robust debate on sort of what the structural growth algorithm is for online travel at this point. I guess in your early experience of booking, what strikes you as perhaps the most compelling area that you could put $1 of investment to work in order to drive faster revenue growth for longer that maybe comes in above the investor expectations? And then maybe one on fixed OpEx. Obviously, your fixed OpEx base is up materially relative to '19, particularly when you compare it to bookings growth relative to '19. So I guess maybe what has shifted in the business that is perhaps maybe a bit more capital intensive at this point or necessitating sort of greater headcount to sort of accomplish the goals that you guys want? Ewout Steenbergen : Yes. Thanks, Lee. So first, your question about structural growth. So I am really super positive about the outlook for the company. Why? This is, of course, a phenomenal company, super high quality, very successful. And I very much believe that we will be able to grow in the future faster than GDP. Shift of offline to online bookings. I think overall, also consumers that will spend more on experiences than on material goods.  And then a number of areas that I believe actually, in my view, now being 6 weeks here in the position that are really underestimated for the company. So first, let me talk about direct. I think this is a company now that is -- completely has a complete game changer with respect to the share of direct. We're not only dependent on pay channels anymore. And that is now in the low 60% range for the B2C business. It's really important, and we are keeping those customers with us, and we have talked about it now before previous questions of really adding more value and more of those travelers coming back to the app, booking direct to us and the benefit we are having with that. The other is the opportunity we have with respect to alternative accommodations. I think, again, this is completely not well understood and underestimated. We are actually, in terms of size, 2/3 of the largest player in this space, and we are growing faster in most of the last 8 quarters. And we still have a lot of opportunity to further develop our offering. But the fact that we are combining traditional accommodations and alternative accommodations on a platform and having travelers really being able to go from one to the other -- sometimes they go in and want to book one type of accommodation, and they end up booking a completely different type of accommodation. And the last is gen AI. Glenn was just commenting on this. I have to say, I think the strategic benefit we have in terms of our capital investments we can make as well as the quality of the data because in generative AI, it's not so much about the language models. The data that go into the language models is strategically probably the biggest differentiator. And we have really advantage with respect to the data because of all the different ways that we touch travelers and partners and other stakeholders in the travel industry. So therefore, I'm really very positive and optimistic about the structural growth opportunities for the company over the next couple of years. Quickly about fixed OpEx. I think that has to do with a couple of strategic expansions that the company has done, multiple verticals, moving in payments. But that is actually linked to your previous question. That will help drive future growth for the company. So that's actually a good thing. But as we have said, we are targeting to lower the growth of fixed OpEx from 2025 onwards. And you will see more operating leverage from that over the next few years. So this year, we'll still have some end finalization of some of the investments, for example, about some of the tech platforms. But then for next year, you will see more operating leverage coming in from all of those investments we have been making. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Colantuoni from Jefferies. John Colantuoni : Just wanted to ask about underlying room night trends. just talk about in the first quarter, the size of some of the transitory impacts that you called out like Easter shift, geopolitical disruption and the booking window and sort of how that shakes out to how you think about underlying trends in the business. And second, on the attractions offering, can you talk about the investments that you've made so far and how your supply is today versus where you need it to be over time to sort of open up the full potential of that opportunity? And our understanding is that attractions are often booked closer to the trip date, which requires getting the traveler back to the app. Talk about how you're sort of looking to drive a solution to that dynamic and how the connected trip offering could help drive that behavior over time. Ewout Steenbergen : With respect to your first question, room nights dynamics in the first quarter. So positives here compared to our original guidance for the first quarter were the fact that the booking window was expanding and that we're able to pull some room night bookings from the second quarter into the first quarter, healthy demand in Europe, and Europe was stronger than we anticipated, as we mentioned before, and less of an impact from the Middle East. And you saw excluding the Middle East impact, actually, the result was exactly the same. So there was no material impact from the Middle East. Easter was a negative, a small negative. But that was, of course, anticipated in the guidance that we provided before. Glenn Fogel : So on attractions -- and it's a good question to ask because we haven't talked about it a lot in the past. Attractions is mostly supplied through third parties. So we have arrangements with companies like Viator, or a Klook or Musement. And we get the supply that way. In addition -- and we don't talk about this much at all either. We also have FareHarbor, which if you may recall, we acquired that. Think of it as the OpenTable for small- and medium-sized attractions because it's a good loop into those attractions. We have priorities though. We can be anything, but we can't be everything, and we definitely can't be everything all at once. So the priorities have been to get the flight stuff up, get that one. It's the biggest thing, get that going well first. And then we have making sure that we have the ground transportation to make sure all that stuff is -- now our people have attraction. They also want to have a lot of emphasis, too, and they are doing a great job building that, and we've talked a little bit about that. And that's going to come in as part of the overall connected trip because as you point out, people don't generally book their attractions far, far in advance. In fact, a lot of them want to book it when they're actually in destination, and that's why I love the fact of the increased amount of use of our app because that's like having your travel agent in your pocket and be able to -- we're able to send them great offers, great ideas where they go right to it, checks on the app and can they get something better. And that's why we're bringing that into our Genius program for people to have an attraction business and want to get that incremental demand. We can push something to a customer who's in destination and give us on -- bring them to that particular supplier. All over, it's a tremendous opportunity down the road. We have yet to even really scratch the possibilities with that, and that's just another reason why I see just tremendous opportunity for us as we continue to roll on. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ron Josey from Citi. Ronald Josey : I want to ask maybe a follow-up on alternative accommodations here just given how much faster overall room nights are growing. And Ewout, you talked a little bit about this as well as Glenn, but I wanted to hear more about the supply side, the 7.4 million properties on the site. Are these higher quality than maybe what you've seen in the past? Are they differentiated from other platforms given -- that are available out there? And Ewout, you made a good mention earlier just that with Booking offering both alternative accommodations and traditional, that's an advantage. I'd love to hear your thoughts on what you're seeing from a consumer perspective, those that book both and then the mix between that going forward between those 2 bookings. Ewout Steenbergen : So let me first take the second part of the question in terms of alternative and traditional accommodations. We're actually not so much separating in our thinking one versus the other because we believe that our unique proposition is that we're putting both in the same way on our platforms because it is an artificial separation as we are seeing many consumers are looking for both. They want to alternate -- look at different alternatives. They want to compare. And often, if they start to look for a traditional hotel, they maybe end up with an apartment they want to rent as an alternative accommodation or the other way around. So actually, the way we look at it is we think it's actually really strong to bring all of these propositions together and have a really a combined offering to our traveler customers. Glenn Fogel : In terms of quality -- and I'd like to think that the inventory we have is high quality, obviously comes at different price points. It's a complete range. And you may not be surprised that lower-priced things may not be as luxurious the higher-priced things. And I think we cover the gamut, but we don't have enough of certain types in certain areas. And I've talked about this before. We're entering close to the summer, and I look at -- I live in the New York metropolitan area. And I'm looking, do we have enough of these high-end homes in the Hamptons? And I don't think we do. If I look at some of our competitors, I see more. I look at that as opportunity for us, though, because we're doing so well. Yes, we don't have all the different types of accommodations and the quantity that I want to have in that. It's great that we are as big as we are, but I absolutely see no reason we shouldn't be significantly bigger throughout every geographical area. Look, our base was Europe. So we are very, very competitive. We have great inventory, all types there. But I've talked about the U.S., and that's an area we continue to do more work. And I mentioned earlier, I see us making great progress there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jed Kelly of Oppenheimer. Jed Kelly : Great. Just following up on that last point, Glenn. How do you think about getting more of that single unit inventory? Is it connecting more with property managers, the PMS systems? And then my second question is, just how should we view the big events in Europe this year, this summer in travel, particularly around the Olympics impacting demand or how people would travel? Glenn Fogel : Sure. So yes, and we definitely have -- you're not surprised of the fact that it's easier to get more inventory when you go to some of the managers who have significant number of the inventory you're looking for. And those multi-property managers are the place where we definitely assume more business. And we have not, until very recently, really spent a lot of time trying to do it in the low -- trying to go for individuals and trying to bring them in, too. There's no doubt, though, over time, we have to make sure to make an effort to everybody. And that means being sure that we are providing a platform that a supplier really likes to use. And I saw something recent. Just to give you an example, turns out that until fairly recently, it was hard for some of our big managers to be able to reconcile the payments with individual properties. And we improved that significantly recently. And that's the reason, it was, okay, now I'll do that. And I can go through a whole bunch of different individual things that, well, by themselves may not be so big. As a whole, they end up saying, yes, I will now be more than happy to get incremental demand from Booking.com because I find it easy and helpful. If somebody is going to make business to make money, you definitely never want to have your property empty. That's 0 revenue. You're never going to get back. That inventory expires. So that's why people are always looking to try and get more demand. As long as we provide them with demand and we provide them with a platform that they find easy and helpful, they will come to us. In regards to the summer and things like Paris and the Olympics, stuff like that, it's always a mystery what's going to happen with the Olympics. So I've been here now 24 years. So I've been through a whole bunch of Olympics and thought it was going to be -- this is what's going to happen and then something else happens. Here's the big point. Let's not concentrate too much on one individual event to last for a couple of weeks. I continue to say the important way to view value in this company in the long run. What have we done? What have we done over the last 24 years here? Continue to increase the value, bring in more customers and more suppliers and continue to produce more cash flow for our investors. That's the way we've done in the past and what we did in the past. And as far as how the Paris Olympics go, I really -- I can guess, but my guess is as good as yours. And I don't think that's something that I'd spend a lot of time worrying about. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tom White from D.A. Davidson. Thomas White : Just one. I wanted to follow up on some of the prior questions on the U.S. market. I was hoping you could kind of comment on maybe the relative unit economics of your U.S. accommodations business today versus in Europe. Obviously, the Booking.com brand here is well known but less well known than in Europe. And so maybe there's like a heavier kind of marketing load per room night here. But the ADRs here are nice and high. But then again, maybe the take rates are lower. So I'm just kind of curious directionally how accommodation kind of unit economics in the U.S. stack up versus Europe at the moment and maybe where you kind of see that going over the next few years. Glenn Fogel : We don't disclose much more and giving you these regional growth rates. We don't go any further than that in terms of detail. And I don't think we'll be starting that right now. I understand your reason for asking, but for reason of competitiveness and such, we're not going to break this down any further than that. Operator : That concludes our Q&A session. I will now turn the conference back over to Glenn Fogel for closing remarks. Glenn Fogel : Thank you. I want to thank our partners, our customers, our dedicated employees, our shareholders, and I especially want to thank Ewout for joining the team. Ewout, thank you very much. We greatly appreciate everyone's support as we continue to build on the long-term vision for our company. Thank you, and good night. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect. Goodbye.",

And now I'd like to introduce Booking Holdings' speakers for this afternoon, Glenn Fogel and Ewout Steenbergen. Go ahead, gentlemen. Glenn Fogel : Thank you and welcome to Booking Holdings' second quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, Ewout Steenbergen. I am proud to report second quarter results that exceeded the high end of our expectations for room nights and revenue. The upside on revenue, combined with lower-than-expected fixed OpEx growth, helped drive adjusted EBITDA above the high end of our prior guidance range. As expected, the travel market has continued to normalize and we are pleased with the strength of our underlying business. Moving to our key metrics in the second quarter. Our travelers booked 287 million room nights across our platforms, an increase of 7% year-over-year. Revenue of $5.9 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $1.9 billion, both increased 7% year-over-year. Finally, adjusted earnings per share grew 11% year-over-year, helped by our strong capital return program which reduced our average share count by 7% year-over-year. In line with our expectations, we saw that the booking window expanded less in the second quarter relative to the first quarter which negatively impacted room night growth compared to Q1. From a regional perspective, we observed a mild moderation of travel market growth in Europe. However, we believe we're continuing to perform well relative to the market in Europe. Looking at our other regions, we continue to see high growth levels in Asia and a slight improvement in growth in the U.S. As we look ahead to the third quarter, we believe room night growth will be impacted by a booking window that expands less than it did in Q2 as well as by the more moderate market growth we have seen in Europe, where our growth has remained stable from May through July. We expect that this will result in some deceleration in room night growth compared to Q2. Ewout will provide further details on our second quarter results and our thoughts about the third quarter. I remain confident in the attractive long-term growth profile of the travel industry, our competitive position over the long term and our long-term growth and earnings model. We remain focused on what is important for the business for the long term which means continuing to execute against our strategic initiatives while simultaneously taking actions to drive more cost efficiency in the business. We continue to see progress across several important initiatives which include advancing our connected trip addition, expanding our merchant offering at Booking.com, continuing to develop our AI capabilities, growing alternative accommodations and enhancing our Genius loyalty program. These initiatives all fit together in our ongoing effort to deliver a better planning, booking and travel experience for our travelers while also benefiting our supplier partners. We believe that continuing to drive benefits to our supplier partners is critical to successfully operating a growing 2-sided marketplace. We are encouraged to see healthy second quarter year-over-year growth in a number of supply partners working with us at Booking.com. We are focused on being a trusted and valuable partner by delivering incremental travel demand and developing products and features to help support these accommodation properties, the majority of which are small and independent businesses. We believe that improving the competitiveness and profitability of our smaller partners and supporting those partners across macroeconomic cycles contributes to the long-term economic health of our sector. Our alternative accommodation offering at Booking.com continues to benefit from having more listings available for travelers to choose from. At the end of Q2, our global alternative accommodation listings were about 7.8 million which is about 11% higher than Q2 last year. We believe this greater selection of listings is contributing to the increasing mix of alternative accommodation room nights booked on our platform. We continue to make incremental enhancements to our alternative accommodation offering for both our travelers and supply partners. For our travelers, we are focused on successfully delivering a better planning, booking and travel experience over time which we believe will lead travelers to choose to book directly and more frequently with us. At Booking.com, we are continuing to grow the number of total active travelers with repeat travelers growing at an even faster rate. In terms of direct booking behavior, we are pleased to see that the direct booking channel continues to grow faster than room nights acquired through paid marketing channels. As I've stated before, we think it's important for us to remain proactive in paid marketing channels in order to bring new travelers to our platforms so long as we're able to do this at attractive ROIs. In addition, I'm encouraged by the work our team at Booking.com is doing to increase our spend on social media in a disciplined manner which is an effort that helps to further diversify the channels we utilize while reaching our travelers on platforms they are actively using. Our Genius loyalty program at Booking.com plays an important role in helping to drive more travelers to choose to book directly with us over time. We see a meaningfully higher direct booking mix for Genius users versus other users. And that direct mix percentage steps up at each higher level of Genius status. So we are encouraged to see continued success and more of our travelers moving into the higher Genius tiers of levels 2 and 3 which now represent nearly 30% of our active travelers. In addition to a higher direct booking rate, we also see higher booking frequency from our Genius Level 2 and 3 travelers when compared to our overall business. In Q2, we drove more Genius benefits to our travelers with a 15% year-over-year increase in benefits. This is primarily driven by accommodation bookings. However, we are seeing growth in benefits and the other elements of travel as well with triple-digit growth in Genius discounts for car rental off of a small base last year and continued testing of Genius benefits for flights. In addition to these benefits, bookings in travel verticals outside of combinations contribute to a traveler's Genius level tier. We will continue to explore opportunities to enhance our Genius loyalty program and deliver more benefits to our travelers. And we know that Genius is a win-win with our supplier partners, enabling them to get incremental demand when they want it which is one reason more of our supplier partners are electing to participate. On the connected trip, we continue to take steps towards our long-term vision to make the planning, booking and travel experience easier, more personal and more enjoyable, while delivering better value to our travelers and supplier partners. In order to achieve the easier, more personalized experience of the connected trip, we have always envisioned AI technology at the center of this vision. Our teams of AI experts continue to draw on their valuable experience from using AI extensively for many years as they work to further incorporate this technology into our platforms. We believe our proprietary data, along with our resource and scale, position us well to build compelling AI-powered offerings over time. Another foundational element of the connected trip is the merchant offering that we continue to expand at Booking.com. Merchant capabilities will help bring different elements of travel together in a seamless booking experience while also unlocking the ability to merchandise across verticals. The mix of merchant gross bookings reached 58% of total gross bookings at Booking.com in the second quarter which is an increase of 10 percentage points year-over-year and is higher than our prior expectations. We are pleased to see that processing transaction through Booking.com's merchant offering generated incremental contribution margin dollars in the quarter, though this was still a small percentage of our total adjusted EBITDA. We continue to see growth in transactions that are connected to another booking from a different vertical in a trip. These connected transactions increased by about 45% year-over-year in the second quarter and can change or represent a high single-digit percentage of Booking.com's total transactions. We believe by providing a better overall booking experience, travelers may choose to book more trips with us with a higher likelihood of booking directly in the future. Flights are an important component for many of the connected trips that our travelers are booking. In the second quarter, air tickets booked on our platform increased 28% year-over-year, driven primarily by the growth of Booking.com's flight offering as well as strong growth in Agoda's flight business. We continue to see a healthy number of new customers coming to Booking.com through the flight vertical and are encouraged by the rate that these customers and returning customers see the value of the other services offered on our platform. In conclusion, we continue our work to deliver a better offering experience for our supply partners and our travelers. We remain confident in our long-term outlook for the travel industry, we are positive about our future and we believe we are well positioned to deliver attractive growth across our key metrics in the coming years. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Ewout Steenbergen. Ewout Steenbergen : Thank you, Glenn and good afternoon. I will now review our results for the second quarter and provide our thoughts for the third quarter and the full year. All growth rates are on a year-over-year basis. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. Now let's move to our second quarter results. Our room nights in the second quarter grew 7% which exceeded the high end of our guidance by 1 percentage point. As expected, we saw room nights growth moderate from the first quarter as we saw less year-over-year expansion of the booking window in the second quarter. Looking at our room night growth by region, in the second quarter, Europe was up mid-single digits. Asia was up mid-teens, rest of world was up high single digits and the U.S. was up mid-single digits. We continue to grow our alternative accommodations business faster than our overall business. For our alternative accommodations at Booking.com, our second quarter room night growth was 12% and the global mix of room nights was 36% which was up 2 percentage points from the second quarter of 2023. We continue to see encouraging progress in strengthening direct relationships with our travelers and increasing loyalty on our platforms. Over the last 4 quarters, the mix of our total room nights coming to us through the direct channel was in the mid-50% range and when we exclude our B2B business was in the low 60% range. We've seen both of these mixes continue to increase year-over-year. Mobile ad mix of our total room night was about 53% which was up 6 percentage points from the second quarter of 2023. We continue to see that the significant majority of bookings received from our mobile apps come through the direct channel. For our Genius loyalty program at Booking.com, we continue to see a year-over-year increase in the mix of room nights booked by travelers in the higher Genius tiers of levels 2 and 3. These members booked more than half of the room nights over the past 4 quarters. Outside of accommodations, we saw airline tickets booked on our platforms in the second quarter increased 28%, about in line with our expectations, driven by the continued growth of flight offerings of Booking.com and Agoda. Second quarter growth in bookings increased 4% which was approximately 3 percentage points lower than the 7% room night growth due to about 2 percentage points of negative impact from changes in FX and about 1% lower constant currency accommodation ADRs. The year-over-year ADR decline was negatively impacted by a higher mix of room nights from Asia. Excluding regional mix, constant currency ADRs were about flat versus 2023. While room night growth was above the high end of our guidance range, gross bookings growth came in at the midpoint of our range due to about 2% lower constant currency accommodation ADRs versus our expectation. In addition, our gross bookings were negatively impacted by lower flight ticket prices in line with the recent trends we have heard from many airlines. Second quarter revenue of $5.9 billion grew 7% year-over-year which exceeded the high end of our guidance by 1 percentage point. Revenue growth was negatively impacted by about 2 percentage points from the change in Easter timing and 2 percentage points from changes in FX. Adjusting for these two items, revenue would have grown about 11%. Revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was 14.1% which was slightly higher than expected due to a timing benefit as we saw gross bookings growth decelerate in the quarter and a less expanded booking window than expected. Additionally, revenue associated with payments was higher than expected. Marketing expense which is a highly variable expense line increased 8% year-over-year. Marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings was 4.7%, about 15 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2023, due primarily to the timing of brand marketing spend as well as increased spend in social media channels. Second quarter adjusted sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings was 1.9%, about 15 basis points higher than last year due to a higher merchant mix and higher transaction taxes. Our more fixed expenses on an adjusted basis were up 5% and were below our expectation across all three line items : personnel, G&A and IT. We're very focused on carefully managing the growth of our more fixed expenses and are taking actions to help improve our operating leverage in future quarters. Adjusted EBITDA of $1.9 billion was above our expectations, largely driven by higher revenue and lower-than-expected fixed expenses. Adjusted EBITDA grew 7%, despite approximately 5 percentage points of pressure from Easter timing and 2 percentage points from changes in FX. Adjusting for these two items, adjusted EBITDA would have grown about 14%. When looking at our adjusted EBITDA margins, for the first half of 2024 which neutralizes the impact of the Easter timing shift, we're pleased to see 160 basis points of margin expansion versus the first half of 2023. Adjusted net income of over $1.4 billion was up 3%, slower than the growth in adjusted EBITDA, due primarily to higher income tax expenses which was impacted by some discrete items. Adjusted EPS of $41.90 per share was up 11% and benefited from a 7% lower average share count than the second quarter of 2023. On a GAAP basis, net income was over $1.5 billion in the second quarter. Now on to our cash and liquidity position. Our second quarter ending cash and investments balance of $16.8 billion was up versus our first quarter ending balance of $16.4 billion due to about $2.4 billion of free cash flow generated in the quarter, partially offset by about $1.9 billion of capital return, including share repurchases and dividends. Moving to our thoughts for the third quarter. We expect third quarter room night growth to be between 3% and 5%, a sequential deceleration as we expect the third quarter to benefit less from a year-over-year expansion of the booking window than we saw in the second quarter. For the third quarter, we expect the booking window to be more similar to last year. Additionally, we have seen a mild moderation in the market growth in Europe over the last couple of months, though our growth in Europe has remained stable from May through July and we believe we continue to perform well relative to the market. We expect third quarter gross bookings growth to be between 2% and 4%, slightly below room night growth due to about 1 percentage point of negative impact from changes in FX. We expect constant currency ADRs to be down slightly year-over-year and for this to be offset by a slight benefit on flight bookings growth. While we continue to expect growth in flight bookings, we believe this will be less than previously expected due to lower flight ticket prices. We expect third quarter revenue growth to be between 2% and 4%. We expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA to be between about $3.25 billion and $3.35 billion, about flat year-over-year at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA to grow slower than revenues due to deleverage from sales and other expenses and from growth in IT expenses related to higher software license fees and increased cloud cost. We expect third quarter revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth to also be negatively impacted by 1 percentage point from changes in FX. In terms of our outlook for the full year, we're adjusting our gross bookings growth expectation to faster than 6% which is a bit lower than our prior expectation due to less growth in flight growth bookings as a result of the lower flight ticket prices I previously mentioned. While flight prices have come down, we still expect strong growth in flight tickets for the year as we continue to expand the flight offerings at Booking.com and Agoda. We expect accommodation ADRs will be about flat to down slightly on a constant currency basis. For revenue, we now expect revenue growth of more than 7% which is a bit higher than our prior guidance, based on the outperformance in the first half of the year and our expectation for higher revenue associated with payments. Revenue is impacted to a much lesser extent than gross bookings from the decline in flight ticket prices. We continue to expect about 1 percentage point of negative impact from changes in FX on our topline growth rates while reducing our fixed OpEx growth expectation to low double digits as we continue to focus on bringing this growth rate down over time. We expect adjusted EBITDA to grow in the high single digits which is slightly faster growth than our prior expectation, given our outlook for increased revenue growth and lower fixed OpEx growth. We continue to expect adjusted EBITDA margins to expand year-over-year by a bit less than 8 percentage point. Finally, we're increasing our adjusted EPS growth expectation to above 15%. In conclusion, we continue to expect 2024 to be a strong year for the company. We remain focused on executing against our strategic initiatives while taking actions to drive greater operating leverage. We're excited about our long-term vision for the connected trip and enhancing our offering through technology innovation like generative AI. And with that, we will now take your questions. Operator, will you please open the lines? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore. Mark Mahaney : I was just asking about the European travel conditions, Glenn and Ewout. It sounded like that market may be slowing a little bit but if I'm capturing it right, your performance there seems to have been pretty steady, that sort of indicates market share shifts, market share gains. Any more color on that? Why you would be -- why your performance would be relatively unchanged, I guess, in a slowing European travel market environment? Glenn Fogel : Mark, it's Glenn. I agree with what you say. I'm very pleased with where we're sitting right now. We've talked in the past about normalization and we're happy with the numbers that we're seeing so far. Your question sort of assumed a softening of the travel business overall. Let's talk about how much and to what extent. Our goal always is to gain share. Whether the market goes up or the market goes down, I can't control demand. I can't control economies. What I can control is how well we can provide value to the travelers and to the suppliers. And as long as we continue to do that, as long as we continue to provide a reason that people should come to us as a traveler or use us as a way to distribute somebody's travel suppliers, we'll continue to gain. And we've seen this in the long run here and I expect to continue to see it in the long run going forward. I can't really give more than that right now. Ewout Steenbergen : And Mark, if I may quickly build on the answer that Glenn just gave, it's also important to point out that actually our growth in Europe has been quite steady and stable in the period from May through July. So yes, we are seeing some mild moderation but it has been relatively stable over the last couple of months. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Kopelman with TD Cowen. Kevin Kopelman : Great. Could you maybe give a little bit more color on some of the moderation you're seeing, like other indicators, like length of stay or any trading down activity that you might be seeing? And given that things have started to slow, how do you gain confidence that they're not going to continue to slow both in room nights and rates? Ewout Steenbergen : Kevin, if you look at the overall conditions of the market, we're not really seeing a trade down on a global basis. So both in terms of the star ratings as well as in the length of stay, it's relatively stable to what we have seen in previous periods. Maybe with one exception is a really mild indication of some trade down in the U.S. but otherwise, globally, we see a very steady picture. Kevin Kopelman : And a quick follow-up on ad spend dynamics with the deleveraging expected in the third quarter. Is that more of the same in terms of brand and social spend? Ewout Steenbergen : If you look at deleverage in the third quarter, that mostly relates to SNO and fixed OpEx. Marketing, actually, we expect leverage -- to see leverage in the second half of this year and also from a longer-term perspective because we expect to continue to see some benefit from the expansion in the direct mix. I also would like to point out and we think it's a really positive message for this call, that we are spending more on social media channels. That's a very attractive channel for us where we are expanding now and where we're investing more and we can do that at very attractive incremental ROI. So really an important point to really highlight with respect to our marketing leverage and the success we're gaining there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Justin Post : Great. Glenn, I'd love to hear your perspective on the travel market, bookings growing 3% to 5%. We know Europe has a really tough comp against reopening last year. Is that kind of how you're thinking about longer-term market growth? Or do you think it's kind of depressed right now on really difficult comps? And then love to hear about alternative accommodations, really, really strong growth there, an increasing percentage. Are you featuring that more on your website? And do you really like the economics of accommodations? How do you feel about those economics versus hotel? Glenn Fogel : Justin, so two separate questions. One, just going back to the general sense of the travel market. And we talk about this a lot over many, many, many calls about how much we believe that the travel market is best influenced by GDP and that in the long run, GDP goes up, more people travel, more people couldn't travel, get wealthy enough that they can travel, that's a tailwind for us. And we talk about other things. You mentioned the 3% to 5%. I mean, lots of people can come up with whatever way you want in terms of global, what's global GDP? What's it going to do to travel? Numbers aren't that different or some are probably in that neighborhood, then how much additional can we get out of increasing share because we provide a good service. And then, of course, there are the other tailwinds of the off-line to the online, another one that's a point in our favor. All these things together blew the -- the growth algorithm that we've talked about in the past is totally intact. There's going to be volatility, there's going to be variations, there's going to be events are going to happen globally, macro events that happen that can influence a quarter or a week or a day. But in the long run, we just continue to build what we've been trying to build for a long time which is a better service and that's how we do it. And one of the things we've been building and we've been working hard on and I've talked about it for a number of years, how important it is for us to build an alternative accommodations business that will rival anybody's. And we admitted that it was taking us time to build it. We started from behind. Another company may have had a bigger head start on us and building it bigger. We think we've done a really good job of catching up. I love the last call we did a few months ago when we came out and we talked about it, our homes business, our homes business, more than 2/3 of the biggest player in the industry. In that last quarter, we said how we had grown faster, 11 of the last 12 quarters. Now, I don't know if our 12% is going to win or not this time, I don't know. I'm pleased with that growth rate, given the size of the business. And how are we doing it? We're doing it by doing what we do with all things is provide a reason, I said this just to Mark earlier, is that continue to build out a product that gives a person a reason to come and use it. Now I don't really care whether the customer uses a home, or a hotel, or a villa or an igloo. I don't care. I care they get what they want. That's the important thing. And then come back. In terms of the profitability of one versus the other, we can go into that and talk about it but it's not really relevant. Because what's relevant is making sure that they use what they want. We don't try and steer them. We're trying to just make sure they have the best tools to choose what they need in the long run. That's the way we'll win and create a great business. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Doug Anmuth : Glenn, just curious, first, how you're interpreting the relative tightening of the booking window and what does that tell you about the state of the traveler into the back half? And then just curious, in your outlook, how much are you contemplating? Any impact from the tech issues that we've seen over the last couple of weeks and their impact to airlines as well? Glenn Fogel : Right. Sure. So the booking window is an interesting thing and we saw it expanding, expanding, expanding and at some point it has to stop, right? I mean, eventually, you can't keep getting bigger and bigger. One of the things I was wondering was why. Why was it expanding? Was it expanding because of inflation and people trying to book early to get that price locked up, afraid that was going to be more expensive down the road. And then now maybe they're thinking well, maybe rates aren't going to keep on increasing, so I can wait. Maybe I'll get a lower price later. I don't know and I haven't done any data to analyze and come up with what the reason is. The fact is, window gets bigger and the window gets smaller. That, of course, influences any particular quarter but in the long run, it all averages out. So I'm not going to worry too much about that. What we do make sure though is make sure that we're spending the right amount of marketing money to try and get the right conversion, do it the right ROI and that's what we continue to do and we're very careful with that. But again, another thing, just like the economies, I can't control what people are going to decide when they want to book. In regard to the tech thing, the tech issues, if you assume you're talking about the horrific events that disrupted travel throughout the world but particularly hit some of our supplier partners significantly. Delta, horrific event and I saw the CEO's interview on Squawk Box and read about what they're planning to do. It's a problem when you have critical infrastructure breaks down and then disrupts millions and millions of people's lives. That's really unfortunate. And hopefully, it won't happen again. Hopefully, people test their products before they put them out into the market. And hopefully, there are backups. Things happen but in travel, we know happens a lot. Certainly, weather happens an awful lot. This is something though that wasn't weather which you can't control, this was making sure that your infrastructure works and will be interesting how that lawsuit turns out. I will point out, it didn't affect us very much though. So we're very pleased about that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Eric Sheridan : Maybe two questions, if I could. First, following up on sort of the demand environment. When you think about the shift from goods to services that has played out in the economy more broadly in the last couple of years, do you think elements of stability or maybe re-acceleration in terms of demand, it might be down to price? Or do you think it's just time and duration that might have to sort of find a new footing for demand and maybe elements of a potential to return to growth? So will this come down to sort of suppliers and pricing or elements of a new normal and finding a new level. I'm just curious for your perspective there, Glenn. And then in terms of the broader marketing messages, you've been on this journey to sort of rejigger the way you're approaching marketing funnel and driving more direct traffic. What do you see as the key investment priorities built on some of the learnings in the last 12 months that you want to share in terms of how the marketing focus for the company might continue to evolve beyond just 2024? Glenn Fogel : So the first more generic question about goods versus services and I think your question, I'm trying to narrow it down to, I think what we're really talking about is we saw a change in people's behavior where they seem to value services significantly more than good which, of course, helps someone like us. And I think the question is, is this a permanent change or appears to go back to a balance that they had a few years ago, maybe pre-pandemic. And I think that in the end, again, this is one of those things that I believe but I don't have proof of is that as people get wealthier, you end up spending more money on services. And it ends up a lot because people generally have one home, you got one couch. You don't keep buying more and more but as your wealth increases, you want to do things, you want to enjoy things. And we see that happening. There's also -- there could be something of the Instagram effect where -- and this is a human nature that you want to show off to your friend, to your friends, all the great things you're doing, I think that definitely has some impact because we certainly -- certain parts of the world that people never used to travel to, now they are being overrun and I think that is the Instagram effect there. So that's all good for our business. I don't know how much further it will go, though, because you need to buy homes and you need to buy couches, et cetera. And I don't see that as a big swing but I'm not concerned that it's going to flip back and we're going to end up with lower; that's one. In terms of the marketing, let's talk a couple of these. I just want to repeat this point I made earlier about. One of the things that we -- I'm happy to see is seeing us making some progress in using social. We have a long problem getting that to work for us for many, many years, just didn't seem to work. But now we're seeing, okay, starting to work, getting some good ROIs. Putting more money into it like that and I think they will continue doing that. Another thing we saw that we don't talk a lot about it, I won't get too specific but we saw ourselves using money that we thought was producing a good ROI and we turned out, it really wasn't. And we shut some of these things down. I won't go into exactly what they were. And we said, that's really not hurting us. We said, \"Well, that's great.\" And that's something that over last year or so that we saw some of the benefit in terms of our marketing leverage is coming from that. So, two good things and I'll let Ewout anything else to say about marketing there. Ewout Steenbergen : Yes, Eric, maybe to give you another perspective. So I'm now 4.5 months with the company. A lot of joy, a lot of pleasure to be here and a great honor. But I'm also, of course, looking at some of the perceptions of the company. I think it's still very much an outdated perception out there that we are largely dependent in terms of sales in our business on the paid channels. Actually, we're emphasizing a lot as you have heard in our calls around the direct mix and being now in the low 60% level for B2C which is really a game changer from my perspective for the company. Also we're very much diversifying our paid channels which is very important because this is a very dynamic world. The paid channels are changing all the time. They are changing their algorithms. But I'm really impressed about the science that the company has behind its paid channels, the algorithms that we are adjusting to optimizing all the time, the way how we spend our paid marketing dollars and how we're investing that. And so it's -- there is not a silver bullet. It's all the time really the details about the optimization, how to get to the highest number of new customers coming to us through the paid channels in the most optimal way with the most attractive ROIs and super impressed how the company is doing that. And I think that gives us really an edge in terms of how we can deal with paid channels also in the future. Operator, I think you are ready for the next question. Operator : And our next question is from James Lee with Mizuho. James Lee : Two here. First, on loyalty program. It seems like one of your major peers is having mixed success with their loyalty program. And maybe, Glenn, you can once again talk about how your program is differentiated and that would allow you to have very high rate of repeat bookings? And secondly, on advertising, I noticed that your ad revenue seem to be under monetized at only 0.7% of gross booking. Is that a source of opportunity as you're looking to give -- to take advantage of scale or your reach? And if so, maybe help us understand what areas are you looking to expand? Glenn Fogel : Yes. Sorry about that. Thinking of the answer. I'm going to let Ewout handle the ad opportunity. I'll talk about our loyalty program, Genius which is the Booking.com program which we talked a little bit about in our prepared remarks. We really haven't talked about it much in terms of numbers in the past but I was just really pleased to be able to talk about our Level 2 and Level 3 players. 30% of our active users -- active travelers are Level 2 or Level 3. And we talked about that gives us more than half of the Booking.com business which is really great. That -- and we talk about how they come back more frequently and they come back more direct. That's the point that it works. And one of the great things about it is, for the most part, we're not paying for it. Our partners are supplying almost all the benefit right now but we talk about we are also putting some benefits at a time. We're going to experiment putting more in ourselves. But it's a great thing. You think why do the suppliers do it? They do it because it gets them incremental demand. It gets them demand when they need it, when they want it. It's very flexible. We work together with them, with these partners, so they can get the demand and the reason they get the demand is because our high Genius level people, our high-spending people and they are going to come and they're going to use those services. It's really a win-win-win. Win for our travelers, win for our partners and win for us. There aren't a lot of people who are doing a program like that. So we think it does differentiate. And I'm really happy to see car rental now doing a lot more of it and we're experimenting with flights. And part of the whole vision of the connected trip the Genius program fitting right into that comes with all different types of permutations of ways to provide better benefits to travelers and use it in a way, a scientific way, a data-driven way. A way using all of our AI capabilities, all the data we have so that we can come up with the best solutions for both sides of the marketplace. That is where -- that's what we're driving to. And I see it happening now in some of the numbers we said, I think gives a little indication. And then, of course, there will be the other thing which is really [ph] advertising opportunities are great. And I'll let Ewout talk a little bit about that. Ewout Steenbergen : James, thank you for pointing out the advertising revenues because it is indeed a very attractive potential line that gives us an opportunity in terms of growing our revenues in the future. Today, this line is mostly coming from KAYAK and OpenTable but there are opportunities, of course, to think about more advertising income from particularly the apps and the active app use that we're having mostly with Agoda and Booking.com. But as everyone knows, this is a very fine line because if you get too many advertisement as a traveler on an app, where you're interested in something else that can ultimately also become quite annoying. So finding there the optimal point is really important. But overall, you're right, that is an opportunity to help to drive further growth with the company in the future, next to many other opportunities we have because I think that's actually -- the exciting part for us as a business, are not just growing with the market. We have so many opportunities to grow faster if it is alternative accommodations we discussed or the multiple verticals around the connected trip we discussed or growing geographically in Asia, in the U.S. around payments, around generative AI and many other opportunities. So definitely, I would put this on the same list as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju with UBS. Stephen Ju : All right. Great. So Glenn, I think I heard you talk in the prepared remarks about connected trips bookings up, I think it was 45% and accounting for a high single-digit percentage of the mix. At this point, is there anything you can share about how the basket size of a particular trip could be moving around and presumably it's up a lot because people are attaching more things. And I guess what the impact to your customer acquisition strategy may be as a result as customer lifetime values go up? Glenn Fogel : Sure. Well, I won't give specifics but I'll confirm what you say is true, is that somebody buys two things. It's definitely going to be bigger than one thing. And also because they bought more things, as we use the science, as we use our data, as we use all the capabilities we have to come up with, what is the value for that customer? Well, how much should we spend to attract that person is going to change, obviously. And it's also the question is in terms of loyalty. We found and it does make sense, a more satisfied customer is going to come back more often. And people in the connected trip, people who use the connected trip, we do see a higher repeat rate for a connected trip person. And we see them coming direct. And the great thing about the connected trip too is that in the past, with just one vertical which was the hotel business, we were missing on customers who wanted to start with flights and now with flights, people are starting at flights and they come and they buy something else too. And also, it's the convenience factor and that goes into the whole reason why the connected trip. I've heard from people say, \"Well, what makes you different?\" And the truth is right now, we're semi-different because we don't have the full connected trip done yet, the way I want it to be. But at the end of the day, we all know how frustrating travel is. And we know how much easy it would be if there was just one place, one person who would handle everything for you, put it all together in the way that was the optimal way with all the different things you have to decide upon. And then if anything went wrong, that it would all get fixed. And now with the benefits of GenAI coming out and the progress I see being made with it, I talked to our people in customer service and what we're putting together there, I believe we will create something that truly is differentiating and that will create a reason that people will want to come to us. The more people who come to us, more opportunities we have to work with our partners to provide them opportunities to help build their businesses. Again, I'll get to use it again, I could say win-win-win again, because that's really what we're trying to achieve here. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Lee Horowitz with Deutsche Bank. Lee Horowitz : So the modestly softer travel environment that the industry seems to be expecting in the second half of the year seems to be working through models by way of pricing pressures. I guess, Ewout, can you comment some on how you think about flexing your cost structure going forward to the extent that, say, hotel ADR has become a bigger headwind for the industry and by extension, your adjusted EBITDA margins? Ewout Steenbergen : Lee, thank you so much for asking the question because we are, at this point in time, really putting much more emphasis on this particular area and looking for more operating leverage for the company in the future. And we should particularly be well positioned to do that because we have the scale. So we should be able to run much more volume over the same fixed infrastructure that we have as a company in the future and take advantage of that. And take advantage of that in the way that we can reinvest in new growth initiatives as well as, of course, also benefiting EBITDA margins and return of capital to our shareholders. So let me give you a couple of examples what we are doing at this moment. We have already done a couple of reorganizations in some of our businesses. We have been looking very carefully at head count, in some places, put a head count pause in place. We are looking at some expense benchmarking in some other brands and businesses, looking at procurement in real estate and many other areas. So more to come on that over the next couple of quarters that I can give you more details. But definitely, this has become a really big focus area. And we are pleased that, therefore, we can also say to you that for the full year guidance, we are now reducing the outlook with respect to fixed OpEx from low to mid-teens to now low double digits. As well as we continue to focus on growing our fixed OpEx at a lower level than the topline growth in 2025. Lee Horowitz : Really helpful. And then, Glenn, maybe on alternative accommodations, you continue to deliver very healthy supply growth here. Do you feel like you are reaching a point of supply parity relative to your peers in the U.S. specifically, where you can perhaps lean in more aggressively investing against marketing and discounting within this vertical to sort of accelerate share gains? Glenn Fogel : I have to admit, I don't believe we are at that level at all right now. But that, to me, is an incredible opportunity. The fact that we are performing as well as we are in terms of our overall number but we still do not have anywhere near the number or the type of home accommodations in the U.S. to be fully competitive is, well, it's a disappointment to me that is not done yet. It's an opportunity where we have all this upside still to come. And we won't be spending huge amounts of money on a subpar product. So not to fear. We're not going to do that. What we're going to do instead to spend the money that we're spending now to make sure we get the properties we need, get the things up and running the way we want the product, the way we want it to be. So nobody ever comes to our site and feels disappointed because it wasn't as good as X. That's what we're working on right now. Clearly, the numbers show that we're doing a good job in many parts of the world but the U.S. is, to me, something that is great opportunity. And for people who live in the New York area, you know if you were looking for -- I use this example all the time because I live in the New York area. If you are looking for a rental, you wanted a home in the Hamptons this summer, you came to our site. You probably said, \"Jesus, there's not a lot here compared to some other people.\" I don't want that to be. I want us to have as many, if not more and I want it to be easier for them to come. I want the trust that coming to Booking is a better way to get that summer rental. And we're going to work on that and that's good for us, an opportunity for us. But your answer is correct. We're not there yet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Colantuoni with Jefferies. John Colantuoni : You mentioned direct bookings were mid-50% of total and low 60%, excluding B2B which I think implies your B2B mix decreased from last year, if I'm doing the math correctly. In general -- but in general, B2B is a smaller offering relative to your biggest competitor. And I imagine this was a strategic decision but I'm curious why you're less excited about the opportunity in the B2B relative to some of the other players in the space? Ewout Steenbergen : John, we are not really recognizing that math. And actually, we are really encouraged by the growth of our B2B business as well. You're right that overall, it's a smaller business than some other players in our industry but we have a couple of propositions that are really strong and all of our brands are actually active in the space. Booking.com is active in this space. Priceline with Getaroom, Agoda with Rocket Travel and many other propositions that we have in the market. So it is an important part of our commercial strategy but it is definitely something that is a bit smaller than other players. John Colantuoni : Great. And maybe a second one on alternative accommodations. I think just broadly speaking, marketing intensity in the alternative space appears to have escalated a bit year-to-date. Talk about Booking's offering and positioning in the vertical and how that positions you to sort of continue delivering impressive growth if the competitive environment continues to ramp over time? Ewout Steenbergen : John, I think actually, our proposition is unique with respect to alternative accommodations because we are putting both traditional and alternative accommodations on our same platform. So we have the benefit of all our brand marketing spend, all our paid market spend coming together on the same platform and giving the traveler an opportunity to pick and select their best option. Maybe they're coming in and looking for 2 hotel rooms for their family and ending up by booking an apartment with 2 bedrooms and they're very happy with that outcome. As Glenn said earlier, we are actually agnostic about which direction this is taking customers because it is important that they are finding the best option for them, ultimately, how to travel. We're agnostic from an economics perspective about this. And it is all about making sure we have the most attractive proposition in the market. But this is, from our perspective, a differentiator because we are able to bring all of those supply opportunities together on our platforms as a company. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Naved Khan with B. Riley Securities. Naved Khan : Maybe just on this commentary on booking window kind of not expanding as much. Can you maybe just talk about if you're seeing any mix in your cross-border versus domestic bookings and if that might have anything to do with it. And the second question I have is on the U.S. online growth. It seems like it picked up a little bit versus the last quarter. I'm wondering if it was driven by alternative lodging or if that is not the case? Glenn Fogel : Ewout, why don't you take that first one and then I'll talk a little bit about the U.S. and the increase we saw in the second quarter versus the first quarter. Ewout Steenbergen : Naved, the way how we look at booking window is, as Glenn actually commented on a couple of minutes ago, to some extent, it doesn't matter for us. It doesn't matter when a traveler actually books because they will travel at a certain point in time. When they travel, they have the experience. And at that point, we will recognize the revenues and the economics to the company. So if you look at the performance of the business over multiple quarters, this is averaging out. If bookers booked earlier or later, ultimately for the same trip and that can really depend on many factors. It can depend on assumptions what will pricing do over time or locking in certain flights or locking in certain accommodations or other factors why bookers might come to us earlier or later for the same trip. But it is important if any investor looks at us from a medium- and long-term perspective, it doesn't matter because over time, it's averaging out and we will deliver the same results for our shareholders and continue to build our business over time with all the opportunities we have. Glenn Fogel : In regards to the U.S. and trying to distinguish, is it because we did better in homes or we did better hotels or -- I really try and stay away from that a little bit. We're trying to provide a traveler with what they need and provide all the different opportunities, whenever. But I'm very happy in the second quarter, accelerated versus the first quarter for our U.S. business. That's very good, I'm pleased by doing better over the long run. But I'm not going to say it's because we did X, Y or Z. In the end, we have to do well in every single part of this business. That means we've got to provide the homes. Absolutely, I talked about that. We got to be a good partner to the hotels and provide them with the incremental demand they need, when they need it. In addition, the connected trip, we got to make sure we're getting all the inventory we can in terms of flights, to making sure we have that ground transportation. And as I always say, nobody goes on a holiday to hang out in the accommodation. They want to do stuff. So we got to make sure we get our attraction things working well and that we're putting up the right offers to the person that they want, when they want at the right time. And of course, there's all the other things, provide the insurance and tying it all together in our merchant platform which we put in our prepared remarks some of the numbers, very pleased about the increase in that. Glad to see it continuing to go up. Glad because it provides a great convenience. It makes it easier to do a lot of things in the connected trip. All working together to provide the ultimate thing which is having a better experience for the traveler and providing more opportunities for our supplier partners. Glad that we're seeing that we did better in America, I'd like to do even better in the long run. I think America, the U.S. is a great opportunity. We continue to under index there which means for me, that's a place that we can do better. Operator : This concludes the Q&A session. Yes. That was our last question. Thank you so much. And with that, I will hand the call back over to you, Mr. Fogel for closing remarks. Glenn Fogel : Thank you. So I want to thank our partners, our customers, our dedicated employees, our shareholders. We greatly appreciate everyone's support as we continue to build on the long-term vision for our company. Thank you very much and good night. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

Go ahead, gentlemen. Glenn Fogel : Thank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings third quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, Ewout Steenbergenn. I am pleased to report an improvement in topline trends in the third quarter, particularly in Europe that resulted in room nights, gross bookings and revenue all exceeding the high-end of our prior expectations. The revenue outperformance combined with disciplined marketing spend and lower-than-expected fixed OpEx growth helped drive adjusted EBITDA that was 9% above the high-end of our prior guidance range. We continue to be encouraged by the strength of our underlying business, the health of the travel industry and the attractiveness of our products. In the third quarter, our travelers booked just under 300 million room nights across our platforms, an increase of 8% year-over-year. Revenue of $8 billion grew 9% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA of $3.7 billion increased 12% year-over-year. Finally, adjusted earnings per share grew 16% year-over-year, helped by our strong capital return program, which reduced our average share count by 6% year-over-year. From a regional perspective, we observed an improvement in our room night growth in Europe in the third quarter, which was the primary driver of the sequential increase in our global room night growth. In Asia, we continue to perform well with another quarter of double-digit growth and we remain optimistic in our outlook for this region, which I'll discuss in more detail later on the call. In the U.S., we see relatively stable levels of growth in our business so far this year, which we think continues to outpace the broader U.S. accommodation industry. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect to continue to see healthy levels of room night growth as demand for travel remains resilient. Ewout will provide further details on our third quarter results and our thoughts about the fourth quarter. I remain confident in the attractive growth profile of the travel industry, our competitive position and our long-term growth and earnings model. We continue to see progress across several important initiatives, which include growing alternative accommodations, advancing our connected trip vision, continuing to develop our AI capabilities and continuing our progress in Asia. These initiatives contribute to our ongoing effort to deliver a better planning, booking and travel experience for our travelers, while also benefiting our supplier partners. We remain focused on being a trusted and valuable partner to all of the accommodation properties on our platforms by delivering incremental travel demand and developing products and features to help support these businesses, the majority of which are small independents. For alternative combination of booking.com, we continue to see more properties connect to our platform with listings at the end of Q3 reaching $7.9 million, up about 10% from last year. The growing number of listings provide more combination choices for our travelers, which we believe contributed to strong alternative accommodations room night growth of 14% in Q3. We believe that we have a differentiated offering, because we make all property types, hotels and alternative accommodations available on our booking.com platform. We see benefits to this approach. For example, our data shows that a portion of our bookers landing on our platform with an interest in a hotel will instead end up booking an alternative accommodation and vice-versa. We believe that this shows, in many cases, travelers are open to comparing hotel and alternative accommodation options when determining the best place to stay for their trip. Our objective is to make sure we continue to provide great choices for our travelers across all property types. On the connected trip, we continue to take steps towards our long-term vision to make the planning, booking and travel experience easier, more personal and more enjoyable while delivering better value to our travelers and supplier partners. We believe the connected trip is strengthened by our growing merchant capabilities, which help bring the different elements of travel together in a more seamless booking experience. In addition, our Genius loyalty program at booking.com has been expanding outside of accommodations and into our other travel verticals, which helps to deliver more value to our travelers as they book more components of their trips with us and to our partners as they receive incremental bookings. We continue to see growth in Connected Trip transactions, which means a trip that includes booking more than one travel vertical. These connected transactions increased by over 40% year-over-year in the third quarter and represented a high single-digit percentage of booking.com's total transactions. We believe by making it easier to plan and book multiple elements of a trip on our platform, we are providing a better overall booking experience for our travelers and we have seen in past experiments that customers who choose to book a connected trip book more frequently with us and have a higher likelihood of booking directly with us in the future. Turning to flights. They're an important component for many of the connected trips that our travelers are booking. In the third quarter, air tickets booked on our platforms increased 39% year-over-year, which was an acceleration from Q2 growth of 28% and was driven primarily by the growth of booking.com flight offering, but we also benefited from strong growth in our flight business. We continue to see a healthy number of new customers coming to booking.com through the flight vertical and are encouraged by the number of these customers and returning customers that also see the value of the other services we offer on our platform. To achieve the easier and more personalized experience of the Connected Trip, we've always intended for AI technology to be at the center of this vision. At each of our brands, our teams of AI experts continue to draw on their valuable experience as they incorporate AI technology into our platforms. We believe that our proprietary data, along with our resources and scale, position us well to build compelling and personalized AI-powered offerings for our travelers and partners. This technology will also enable us to drive further efficiency in our own operations. We have significant activity in this area across the company, and I'll briefly discuss just a few of the encouraging efforts that are underway across our brands. Last summer, Booking.com launched its AI trip planner. And since the launch, Booking.com has gained valuable insights from its millions of interactions with bookers, as well as from the use of the Gen AI technology alongside our existing machine-learning models. The learnings from the AI trip planner are leading to new applications of Gen AI technology, including a recent launch of our smart filter, which makes over 200 potential search filters findable through a free text interface. These innovations also extend to the partner-facing side of the business at Booking.com. Gen AI is being leveraged to help properties write responses to traveler queries, and this tool has led to an increase in response rates to traveler messengers. This improves the experience for our travelers and partners. Booking.com is also testing a Gen AI-powered partner Chatbot to help with questions during the onboarding process and accelerate sign-ups, starting with a focus on alternative accommodation properties. Booking.com is also working to incorporate Gen AI into its customer service function to drive increased efficiency and a better experience for travelers. Initial testing shows meaningful improvements in topic detection in Booking.com's customer help center as well as customer service agent case summarization. Booking.com is still early in this journey and sees meaningful opportunities in improving customer service and driving greater efficiency by leveraging AI in the future. At Priceline, travelers have now had over 3 million interactions with its generative AI travel assistant called Penny. This was launched last summer. While Penny was originally positioned at the end of the funnel on the checkout page, it's now available across the full booking experience and can address many types of traveler questions, including destination discovery, hotel search and trip support. In October, Priceline launched Penny Voice, which enables Penny to engage in verbal conversations with travelers and to assist them with planning trips, searching for hotels and servicing bookings. As Priceline continues to enhance this offering, we envision that Penny will be able to anticipate needs based on preferences and past interaction, and then respond in a real-time voice. While there has been great progress in the development of Penny over the last year, Priceline is focused on further enhancing Penny over time by leveraging their valuable learnings so far. In Agoda, over 120 use cases for GenAI have been implemented across customer service, software development, content generation, product, finance and HR. Agoda is highly focused on leveraging Gen AI to automate product development using both externally and internally developed tools. This is leading to an increase in the share of code written by AI as well as measurable improvements in productivity per developer and development time. In March, Kayak launched its Ask Kayak travel Planning tool, which improves and personalizes the search experience by allowing travelers to use free-form text entries to search and refine the results. At the same time, Kayak, also launched PriceCheck, a price comparison tool that allows travelers to upload a screenshot of a flight intinerary, which Kayak can then check against many different sites in order to determine if there is a better price available for the traveler. At OpenTable, an AI voice bot has been recently integrated into its offering to help participating restaurants answer their phones. Diners can call these restaurants and perform tasks like making a reservation, altering their reservation, asking questions and noting dietary restrictions, which are then automatically updated into OpenTable software. OpenTable has also partnered with Salesforce Agent Force platform. This helps its customer service agents better serve its restaurants and diners. This platform is now handling restaurant web queries, which is helping agents focus on delivering great service in more complex situations. It's exciting to see the work happening across our company to integrate Gen AI into our platforms and the knowledge hearing that is ongoing between all of our brands. We know we are still in the very early days of Gen AI and we have much more to learn about consumers, how they ultimately want to interact with this new technology, but I remain confident in our company's ability to benefit from AI development and to improve our products for our customers given our many years of experience in AI, our travel-related data, connections to our supply partners and our human and financial capital. Over time, as we further incorporate this technology, we expect to see benefits in traveler and partner acquisition, retention and satisfaction. In addition, we expect it to improve operational efficiency, which will contribute to a deceleration of our fixed expense growth in the future. Finally, as I mentioned at the start of the call, we continue to be optimistic about our long-term outlook for Asia. We see Asia as strategically important due to its size, growth potential and our positioning in the region. We estimate that the travel industry growth in Asia will be in the high single-digits over the next five years, which is the highest market growth rate of our major regions. Our ambition is to continue to grow faster than the overall travel industry in Asia as we have done through the pandemic recovery. Over the last 12 months, about 24% of our global room nights were booked by bookers in the Asia region, which is a slightly higher mix than it was prior to the pandemic. Our business in Asia is diversified across the countries in the region with no single country representing more than a low single-digit percentage of our global room nights. The success we have seen in Asia and our solid positioning in the region has been driven by operating two complementary brands, Agoda and Booking.com. Our approach is to utilize both of these brands across the region with an eye on profitable growth for Booking Holdings over the long run. In conclusion, I'm encouraged by our strong third quarter results and the continued resilience of leisure travel demand. Our teams continue to execute well against our key strategic priorities, which helps position our business well for the long term. We remain confident in the long-term growth of travel and in the many opportunities ahead for our company. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Ewout Steenbergen. Ewout Steenbergen : Thank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I will now review our results for the third quarter and provide our thoughts for the fourth quarter and the full year. All growth rates are on a year-over-year basis. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. We will be posting a summary earnings presentation as well as our prepared remarks to the Booking Holdings Investor Relations website after the conclusion of the earnings call. Now let's move to our third quarter results. Our room nights in the third quarter grew 8%, which exceeded the high end of our guidance by 3 percentage points. The stronger-than-expected room night growth was driven by an improvement in trends in Europe starting in August and benefited from the booking window expanding year-over-year in the third quarter versus our expectation for it to be more similar to 2023. Looking at our room night growth by region in the third quarter, Europe was up high single-digits, Asia was up low double-digits, rest of higher world was up mid-single-digits and the US was up low-single digits. As Glenn noted, we continue to make progress against our strategic priorities, including growing alternative accommodations, increasing the mix of our bookings to the direct channel and our mobile apps, enhancing our Genius offering and driving growth in our other travel verticals as part of our Connected Trip fishing. For our alternative accommodations at Booking.com, our third quarter room night growth was 14%, which continued to outpace the overall business. The global mix of alternative accommodation room nights at Booking.com was 35%, which was up 2 percentage points from the third quarter of 2023. We continue to strengthen our direct relationships with our travelers and increase loyalty on our platforms. Over the last four quarters, the mix of our total room nights coming to us through the direct channel was in the mid 50 % range. And when we exclude our B2B business was in the low 60% range. We've seen both of these mixes continue to increase year-over-year. Mobile app mix of our total third quarter room nights was in the mid 50% range, which was up from the low 50% range in 2023. We continue to see that a significant majority of bookings received from our mobile apps come through the direct channel. For our Genius loyalty program, the mix of Booking.com room nights booked by travelers in the higher genius stairs of levels two and three was in the mid-50% range over the last four quarters and this mix continued to increase year-over-year. In our other travel verticals, we saw airline tickets booked on our platforms in the third quarter increased 39%, driven by the continued growth of flight offerings by Booking.com and Agoda. We also saw rental car days booked on our platforms increased 16% in the third quarter, driven by strong growth at Booking.com. The growth rates for airline tickets and rental car days were both better than our expectation and both accelerated from the second quarter. Third quarter gross bookings increased 9%, which was approximately one percentage point higher than the 8% room night growth due to about two percentage points from higher flight bookings growth, partially offset by a decrease in constant currency accommodation ADRs of less than 1%. The year-over-year ADR decline was negatively impacted by a higher mix of the room nights from Asia. Excluding regional mix, constant currency ADRs were up less than 1% versus 2023. The increase in gross bookings exceeded the high end of our guidance by five percentage points due to stronger room night growth plus less pressure from changes in FX and stronger flight ticket growth. Third quarter revenue of $8 billion grew 9% year-over-year, which also exceeded the high-end of our guidance by five percentage points. Revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was in line with our expectations at 18.4% and was also in line with the prior year as increased revenues associated with payments were offset by a higher mix of flight bookings. The increased revenues from payments were driven by an increase in our merchant mix, which reached 65% of our total gross bookings, up from 56% in the third quarter of 2023. Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line, increased 6% year-over-year. Marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings was 5.0%, about 15 basis points lower than the third quarter of 2023 due to a higher direct mix and higher-performance marketing ROIs, partially offset by increased spend in social media channels. Third quarter sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings was 2.0% in line with last year. Our fixed expenses on an adjusted basis were up 7% year-over-year and were below our expectation due primarily to lower IT expenses, some of which we expect to shift into the fourth quarter, as well as lower G&A expenses. We continue to be very focused on carefully managing the growth of our fixed expenses. We believe it is important to drive greater operating leverage in our fixed expenses as this creates capacity for disciplined investment across our strategic initiatives, which we believe will help drive stronger top line and earnings growth in the future. Adjusted EBITDA of $3.7 billion grew 12% year-over-year and was above our expectation, largely driven by the higher revenue and also by the lower-than-expected fixed expenses. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 45.8% in the third quarter was up versus last year by a bit more than one percentage point due to marketing and fixed expense leverage. Adjusted net income of over $2.8 billion was up 9%. Adjusted EPS of $83.89 per share was up 16% and benefited from a 6% lower average share count than the third quarter of 2023. On a GAAP basis, net income was $2.5 billion in the third quarter and was negatively impacted by a $365 million accrual in G&A expenses related to a potential settlement of certain Italian indirect tax matters, partially offset by a $250 million reduction to our US repatriation tax liability, which lowered income tax expense. Now on to our cash and liquidity position. Our third quarter ending cash and investments balance of $16.3 billion was down versus our second quarter ending balance of $16.8 billion due to about $2 billion of capital return, including share repurchases and dividends and a paydown of about $1.1 billion for debt that matured in September, partially offset by about $2.3 billion in free cash flow generated in the quarter. Moving to our thoughts for the fourth quarter, we expect fourth quarter, room night growth to be between 6% and 8%, continuing our positive trend from the third quarter. We expect fourth quarter gross bookings to grow between 7% and 9%, a point ahead of room night growth due to expected higher flight ticket growth. We expect constant currency accommodation ADRs to be approximately flat year-over-year. We expect fourth quarter revenue growth to be between 7% and 9%. We expect fourth quarter, adjusted EBITDA to be between about $1.6 billion and $1.65 billion, representing growth between 9% and 13%. We expect adjusted EBITDA to grow faster than revenue due primarily to marketing leverage as a result of increasing direct mix. We're increasing our outlook for the full-year, driven primarily by the stronger than expected third quarter, which is our seasonally largest revenue and profit quarter. We expect full-year gross bookings to increase about 8%, an improvement from our prior expectation of faster than 6%. We expect full-year revenue growth of just below 10%, which is better than our prior expectation of faster than 7%. We expect a slightly negative impact from changes in FX on our full-year top-line growth rates, which compares to our prior expectation for about one percentage point of negative impact. We expect fixed OpEx on an adjusted basis to grow around 10%, lower than our prior expectation. We expect adjusted EBITDA to grow between 13% and 14%, which is better than our prior expectation due to the increased revenue growth and lower fixed OpEx growth. We expect adjusted EBITDA margins to expand year-over-year by a bit more than one percentage point. And finally, we expect our full-year adjusted EPS to grow in the high-teens. In conclusion, we are pleased with our third quarter results and our outlook for the fourth quarter, and the full year. Thank you to all my colleagues across the company for their hard work, determination, innovation and teamwork. With that, we'll now take your questions. Operator, will you please open the lines? Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] We'll take the first question today from Justin Post, Bank of America. Justin Post : Thanks. I guess since you talked a lot about AI in your prepared remarks, maybe you could talk about how you expect that to translate to financials. Do you think AI can bring more direct traffic because of all your tools, better attach rates when people come to your site, maybe lower expenses? Just how we see that translate to financials. And then one on bookings. It looks like, you know, could you talk about some of the factors in Q4 that could affect bookings, either the hurricanes or the you know maybe the Middle East comps, how you're thinking about some of the 4Q factors? Thank you. Glenn Fogel : Hi, Justin. It's Glenn speaking. I'll take the first question about AI and then I'll let Ewout talk a little bit about your question regarding fourth quarter. So we did give a number of examples about some of the things we're working on at the company on AI because I know there's a lot of curiosity about where are we, what's happening and it is one of the most exciting times I've -- this company ever. And it's something I've talked about before, maybe you've heard me talk in some conferences, et-cetera, that this type of technology is really transformational and it's going to make it so much better for all people in the travel industry, particularly for the traveler. It's also going to enable us to be able to provide a better service to our partners, enabling them to get more incremental, more targeted customers, help their business better. You, of course, you'd like to know how does that translate into dollars and cents. That is difficult at this time. It's still very, very early. We see some of the efficiencies already coming in some places. And we've mentioned and I mentioned in the prepared remarks about some of the numbers in terms of number of people using it, which is actually a relatively small number compared to the total number of interactions we have with customers. Sounds like a big number, 3 million, where that's a big number, but it's small compared to the size of this company. So I know what you'd like to know, but we're not going to project those kind of numbers right now. But what I will say is, it's incredibly important the companies that are successful in AI are going to be the long-term winners because it is going to, as I say, be transformational. I'm very pleased that we've made progress so far and we have some certain advantages. We've got capital. We've got people who have been working with AI now for many, many years. Sure, it wasn't Gen AI. They're working on machine learning model, et cetera, but we've got a lot of people who are very, very skilled in the areas of technology. In addition, having more data, which is so important to be able to combine with other people's large language models, other people's systems and come up with really unique ways to provide a better service. It's something that I'm just so thrilled to see what we're doing, what we're building. And I urge anybody who's curious about this, test out some of the things we have out there. It's out in the market. It's live, it's real. See what you think of it. I've done it a lot myself and sometimes I'm really pleased, sometimes a little disappointed, but I know we're making great progress. And in the future, we'll be able to better quantify for you what you'd like to know. Ewout I'll let you go into fourth quarter. Ewout Steenbergen : Justin, with respect to the outlook for bookings in the fourth quarter, I think the headline is we're looking at the fourth quarter as a very robust and positive quarter where we see a continuation of the trends we have seen over the last few months. But let me dive a little bit deeper into that. First, the comps get a little easier in the fourth quarter because we are lapping the period last year where we had an impact, particularly with respect to the start of the conflict in the Middle East. The second point is, you are referring to events. Events from our perspective doesn't really impact our results. It might have a really short-term impact, but in the end, it always will average out. So you will never hear us really pointing to events as an impact on our outlook or actual performance. The third is what we have seen so far is continuation of the strength of August and September, also in October. The fourth is, I think it's important to take into consideration that we expect the booking window to be less expanded in the fourth quarter than we have seen in the third quarter. In other words, there might have been some pull forward of bookings that otherwise would have been in the fourth quarter into the third quarter. And the last is, we absolutely also have reflected uncertainties and risks with respect to the global geopolitical environment. We all know there are a lot of things out there that are happening and we also have taken that into consider -- in our consideration with respect to our fourth quarter outlook and guidance. Justin Post : Great. Thank you. Appreciate it. Operator : The next question comes from Mark Mahaney, Evercore. Two questions, please. Mark Mahaney : On the Asia callout, Glenn, was this the first time that Asia, I think as a percentage of your mix was higher than it was pre-COVID? I assume so. That's why you called it out, but anything in particular in the region that you've done? Or is that just the region you know finally recovering back to kind of full outbound travel mode? So you know how much of that sort of success for you was what you did versus just the market there finally recovering? And then AA in the mix, this I think 35% number. The question I have for you is trying to figure out where that mix is you know long term. In markets where you have kind of full sufficient inventory, both traditional and AA, is the usual mix in those markets around that average of 35% or is it materially higher? Therefore, we could expect the overall mix to go up because you still have a lot of regions where you don't have enough AA inventory? Thanks a lot. Glenn Fogel : Hi, Mark. I'm not sure if you're right actually on that thing about calling out Asia. I think we had some things where Asia has done better, but regardless of that, let's just talk a little bit about how pleased we are with the growth we're seeing in Asia. And yes, we're obviously getting a bit of a benefit because Asia overall as a market is growing fast. There were certain areas of Asia that were a little slower coming out of the pandemic and such. But this is an opportunity for me to really put out a thanks to our Agoda team. That team has been just doing really well in coming up with ways to provide a better service to the Asia customers. It's a little bit different in some parts. Now I say Asia, obviously, Asia is a very big place, a lot of different countries, a lot of different ways people buy what people are looking for. And the Agoda team has done a good job of localization of coming up with ways that the customer in different parts of Asia, the way they want to buy, matching up with different types of payment methods, for example, to be able to -- that the local person who wants to pay in a certain way can use our service and feel comfortable doing that. In addition, making sure we're getting great inventory. Again, can be a little different in Asia than other parts where there's a lot of small independence or different ways to get great pricing, make sure it's showing up on our site. So great team effort by everybody there in Agoda and that's helping great deal of booking, also doing Asia efforts. So overall, we're really, really pleased with what's happening there. Now your second question about alternative accommodations, we are pleased, again, with the growth rate there, 14%, like it, increasing the listings to 7.9 million, 10% increase in list like that one too. You know last time in the call, I said how we had beaten our biggest homes competitor 11 of the last 12 times and we came out of that time ahead of them in terms of the earnings announcement, I didn't know if we're going to beat them again and we did. So I'm wondering this time will we do it again, maybe at 13 quarters out of 14 and it's not a small business. It's a big business because as we mentioned a couple of times, the total amount of room nights for alternative accommodation is running roughly a little bit two-thirds of the biggest homes player in this market. So it's a big business. So it's great to be able to growing at this size and it's great to be doing in sort of the leading in terms of growth. Your question is, at what stage do we end up and feel sort of that sort of the max or so? I don't know because one of the key things to our business is making sure that we just get as much of the inventory that the customer wants on the site and they choose. And I mentioned it in the remarks about how customers come to our site and from what they've chosen to start with, we know what they were thinking of and then they go and they buy something else. So a key thing to our business is making sure we provide whatever the customer wants and not try and steer them. So I don't know what the ultimate share is going to be. I do know though what's important is to continue to work on getting great inventory. And as long as we're talking about it, we're nowhere near in certain regions sort of getting it. It's a lot of ramp left in front of us. US in particular, I keep repeating myself quarter-after-quarter. Sure, we're growing that business nicely in the U.S., but there's so much more to be done. And I was just looking today, literally today because seeing what was available for us in the Hamptons, I'm a New Yorker. I look into the summer, it's like not enough inventory there yet. So some people can say that's a negative. I say that's you know an opportunity for us and I'm really looking forward to continue to build out the business. Mark Mahaney : Thank you, Glenn. Operator : And your next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JP Morgan. One moment\u2026 Dae Lee : First one -- Operator : I apologize, just one moment. Okay, go ahead, Doug. I'm sorry. Dae Lee : Okay. Hey, this is Dae on for Doug. Thanks for taking the questions. I have two. So the first one, could you double-click on what you're seeing in Europe? Last quarter, you talked about mild moderation in growth in Europe, but the region drove outperformance this quarter. So what changed there into end of summer and fall? And do you have any macro views to share around the U.S. as a region? Ewout Steenbergen : First, with respect to Europe, we have clearly seen first, with respect to Europe, we have clearly seen a reacceleration of growth starting in August. We believe that perhaps in July, there was a bit of impact of some of the events. But again, we always look at that as purely timing and that is averaging out. But then we also believe there is a general underlying improvement what we are seeing in Europe in terms of the general demand for our products and services. It's partially market, but it's partially also our proposition. Of course, as Glen already explained, having such a great platform with so many options, so many verticals where you can purchase in so many different ways. And in Europe, many people use us on the app and it's really very much a mainstream app that people are using if they want to travel very easy. You have your credit card there, easy to book, easy to adjust. So that is definitely in Europe, a big winner and therefore, we have been so much really the standard in Europe with respect to our proposition. I also need to point at the expansion of the booking window that happened in the third quarter. So that definitely also helped with the acceleration of growth at the same time. Dae Lee : Great. Thank you. Operator : And the next question comes from Kevin Kopelman, TD Cowen. Kevin Kopelman : Great. Thanks so much. I had a question on marketing. Could you give us an update on kind of you know what you're seeing? You mentioned higher ROIs in the third quarter. How much of that is underlying improvement in ROIs versus Europe being stronger? And can you update us on how you expect the full year now to look in terms of marketing and merchandising as a percentage of GBP? Thanks. Ewout Steenbergen : Yes, Kevin. Overall, how you should look at marketing and higher ROIs I think this is really where the company has such a specialized expertise, has such great algorithms that are continuously optimizing our incremental spend to make sure that the incremental ROIs are really the highest that are possible and doing that across all the different options we have how to allocate our dollars. So this could be the different forms of performance marketing channels, it could be with respect to merchandising, but it could also be with the social media channels where we are expanding our marketing spend as well. So clearly, the opportunity was there through our continuous optimization to ultimately achieve higher growth with higher ROIs at the same time. With respect to your question on the outlook, merchandising as a percentage of growth bookings, we expect it to be more or less flat compared to last year for each of the quarters of 2024 and for the full year. With respect to marketing, we expect marketing leverage to continue in the fourth quarter as a result of the continued growth of our direct channels. Kevin Kopelman : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Next up, we'll hear from Eric Sheridan, Goldman Sachs. Eric Sheridan : Thanks so much for taking the question. I want to come back to the theme on fixed investments. You know, first, looking backwards, you know, maybe highlight some of where you've made investments around fixed costs and what you're most proud of in turning a return profile in those fixed investments that you're seeing an impact on the business today? And not about 2025, but just longer term, how do you think about coming out of that fixed investment cycle and how to think about the return profile or incremental margin that could be produced in the business as fixed investments start to grow slower than revenue over the longer term? Thank you. Ewout Steenbergen : Yes, Eric, I really love that question because it's something I'm extremely personally passionate about. The way we look at this is actually in two different ways. One is where do we see opportunities for efficiencies and achieving operating leverage and then a completely separate decision mechanism around where can we reinvest those dollars in the most optimal way that we will achieve the highest growth potential at attractive business case returns in the future. So let me start with the first part. In terms of operating leverage, we believe there are many opportunities we have as a company because we have been building up skill in the organization and now, we should have an opportunity to run much more volume over the existing scale over the next period. So let me point you to a couple of areas. First, we have tremendously slowed down hiring. So if you look now, our year-over-year headcount is up approximately 3%. If you go back a year ago in the third quarter of 2023, headcount was up 13%. So clearly, we are being more efficient and we are very careful with hiring. We already touched on our AI, artificial intelligence as a clear opportunity to find efficiencies in the future across many different areas. In the interest of time, I will not elaborate on that, but that's a clear opportunity. We're also looking at procurement, real estate, operating model optimizations, looking at spends, layers to really make the organization more agile in many of those areas. And we believe we really have an opportunity to expand on that in the future, But then I think your question is also where are we proud about in terms of investments? Well, if you think about the number of new areas where we're growing as a company, it's super impressive from my perspective. A few years ago, we were not really in flags. Look at the growth we are reporting, 39%, look at all the other verticals. Looking at what we're doing with respect to payments and fintech, looking at what we're doing from a geographical perspective. Glenn was touching on the very impressive growth in Asia, the investments we're making in the U.S. and we believe we are growing still faster than the market in the U.S. and we'll continue to aim to do that in the future as well and many other areas. So we are very much focused on in a very disciplined way, looking at our scarce resources, making sure that we're using that in the most optimal way and in the end, invest in the most attractive growth opportunities for the company over the next period. Glenn Fogel : And I'll just add, I think what Ewout said really hit a lot of the key things that have made us successful. And looking back, there have been a lot of times that people have questioned what are we investing in and why we're spending the money there, et cetera. And we're now finally beginning to see a little bit of the benefit to this. So there was a point where, as you know, Booking.com was totally an agency business, totally an agency business, no payments at all. Now we talk about our merchant mix is now 65% and we talk about how important it was to have that as a foundational pillar for our connected trip, which is another area where people question, why are you getting out of hotels? Why are you getting into these other verticals? The end of the day is long term success of a company is being able to make change, to make things different as the world changes, you have to change with it. If we just stayed as an agency-only hotel and not had invested in other areas, we will not be where we are today. Now going forward, we can't stop. We continue to do that. So as Ewout said, we've got to be very careful, where are we spending our money. We've got to not put money into things that are not going to be productive and move resources into place that is -- of something is no longer necessary, we just have to have the will to stop that and do something else. So I'm really proud that we've been able to -- I've been here now almost 25 years. It will be 25 years in February. And throughout this, we have changed tremendously, but the one thing that we really concentrate on is making sure we are careful with our shareholders' money. Eric Sheridan : Thank you. Operator : And from Deutsche Bank, Lee Horowitz has the next question. Lee Horowitz : Great, thanks. Maybe Glenn, another one on alternative accommodations. You gave a lot of color on the booking patterns you're seeing on the platform as it relates to cross-shopping hotels and alternative accommodations. But can you comment at all what you're seeing in terms of incrementality of this volume? Do you think your growing presence here is bringing in new cohorts of travelers who are coming to booking for this vertical specifically or is a large piece of this volume coming from consumers that would have likely booked a hotel on your platform otherwise? Glenn Fogel : That's a very interesting question because I haven't noticed any surveying or trying to understand. Obviously, we can see if we look at it, a customer has come who we've never seen before, we started with an alternative accommodation because they knew that we had alternate accommodations and that would be completely incremental because we have alternate location accommodations. I don't have the data on that, but I can say, I believe without actual data proof, I believe that we have brought in people who would not have come otherwise, would have gone to another site, but came to us because we did offer them an alternative accommodation. And I would say specifically in Europe, I'm almost certain of that because the awareness of our alternative accommodations business in Europe is very high unlike in other parts of the world. So when somebody thinks that I want to have a nice villa in Nice and France, they will think booking.com and that is the incrementality that you're asking about. But again, what's more important is to offering all aspects of travel that goes back to the whole connected trip vision because if somebody does get that nice villa, they have to get there somehow. So if they're going to fly, it's good to be able to combine that. And then they'll have to get from the airport to the villa. So it's nice to have the ground transportation, maybe they need insurance. And as I always say, nobody goes on a holiday, so they can sit in the room, whether it be a villa, even this really nice one or a hotel room, they want to do stuff and that's why attractions is important. I can go on and on and on. And tying that all together in that connected trip vision using science, using data, using our Gen AI capabilities to make sure we're offering the optimal things for that traveler in addition given the opportunities for our suppliers to offer up different types of service at different price points so that they too can enjoy the benefits of this connected vision in terms of more customers, more profitability. That's the thing we're building. That's the real true incrementality and that is getting people whoever they're traveling right now some other way that they come to us because we offer them a better service. Lee Horowitz : Great. Thanks. And then maybe just one follow-up on sort of fixed OpEx. So given a lot of conversation around your passion for driving fixed OpEx going forward. I guess, given where you guys are in your investment cycle, the -- your motivation to free up resources to invest in a lot of your growth drivers and a lot of the conversation on the potential for Gen AI to help the P&L? Do you think that, you know, the business is in a place where it can drive fixed OpEx leverage, not just next year, but for many years out into the future and it should be part of the way we think about you guys going forward? Glenn Fogel : I would say absolutely, Lee, there is a big opportunity to do that. But there's always the flip side of how much opportunity do we have to reinvest in the business. So again, coming to the two sides of the coin that I was talking about before, do we have opportunities to find more opportunities for operating leverage, not only in 2025, but also in 2026, absolutely. And of course, some of the initiatives that are being worked on or under development or have been recently implemented, the run rate effects, you will see that coming in then over time in the future. But as I said as well is, I think this company -- the uniqueness of this company is it's doing well, it's growing fast, it's delivering very strong results. We have a lot of free cash flow generation, but we also can reinvest in so many initiatives in order to grow even faster, grow even faster in all those different areas. So how that on a net basis will play out, that's a little bit hard to say. But on the growth basis, in the sense of how much can we really find in terms of efficiencies, I think there's still a long way to go. Operator : Next up, we'll take a question from Tom White, D.A. Davidson. Tom White : Oh, great. Thanks for taking my question. Just one, if I could, on social. It seems like in recent months, you know, we've heard you guys mention having better success kind of accessing travel demand in social media channels, which I guess for a long time didn't really seem to be the case. There's obviously a ton of engagement there, but it didn't seem like it was necessarily efficient demand source for you. Can you maybe talk a bit about why that's changing or it seems to be changing? And curious like how big a vector of growth social maybe could be for you guys over the next several years? And how do you think about the incrementality, I guess, of that channel? Thanks. Glenn Fogel : So, this is Glenn speaking, I'll let Ewout talk a little bit if he wants about anything that I don't mention. But we are pleased that we are seeing good results from putting money to work in social platforms. And as you know, over many years, we had mentioned that we were experimenting, but it wasn't really working for us yet. And now finally, we are beginning to see it work. That being said, it's a relatively small amount of money compared to our overall marketing expenses, but we're glad. And the thing is, it always comes out that we're agnostic. As long as we get the right ROI, that's what we really -- you, know our goal is, that's what we care about and it's working now more than in the past because I think cooperation with people in the social platform areas that we're working with people there and coming up with creative ways together to achieve our mutual goals. And we want to continue to do that and we'll continue to invest so long as we keep getting the ROIs that we want, that's as simple as it is. How big could it be? I don't know. It really will depend on how much further ahead we keep the ROIs. In the past, in the past, we had seen some interesting things that worked a little bit, but then when you try to scale it, the ROIs fell off. Now we're not really seeing that in the things we're trying now. But I can't promise that, you know, as we grow bigger and bigger, you start getting to large numbers, real large numbers like when our number -- our total amount we spend on marketing, who knows, but I am encouraged by the progress we have made so far and I am really glad to be able to diversify that pay performance type spend. And, Ewout, you want to say anything on it? Ewout Steenbergen : Yes, maybe two quick things to add. First, coming back to AI, actually, AI is an important tool to help with the additional advertisement effectiveness. So that the targeting is better and therefore, we can achieve those higher incremental ROIs. And maybe one other point with respect to the financials. Glenn is right, in absolute terms, the spend on the social media marketing channels is still relatively small. But I'm actually encouraged because if you look at the marketing increase spend year-over-year, actually meaningful part of the delta increase is actually going to those social channels. Operator : Next question is Jed Kelly, Oppenheimer. Jed Kelly : Hey, great. Thanks for taking my question. Just going back to the U.S., you're getting some nice branding here with the baseball playoffs having, you know, record ratings. You called out room nights maybe growing low-single-digits. So can you talk about where you think your brand is in the U.S.? And then just on the single units in the U.S., you know, talking to some property managers, they still think you're a little more complex to work with versus some of the other platforms. Can you talk about where you are in terms of maybe simplifying it for them? Thank you. Glenn Fogel : So you're right on your second point about it's not as easy yet as some of our competitors. I know that's true and that's one of the things we're working on. I'll be sure to say that's opportunity for us. That's great. We're doing so well right now and we still haven't perfected that. So that's all upside for us. In terms of awareness, we're still not where we'd like to be, but we continue to improve. I continue to see those numbers going up. When I look at the reports, marketing comes back -- market report comes back to me, reports our marketing department comes back to me. I am pleased with the progress we're making. But again, that's more opportunity for us. Ewout anything specific on that? Ewout Steenbergen : Yes, just a small technicality just to point out is it looks like where we said last quarter, we are growing in the U.S. mid-single digits and now it's low-single-digits. I would still characterize this more stable growth over these periods because we're really at the cusp in both quarters in terms of which of those buckets it's falling. So I wouldn't read too much in it as an investor, but overall, I would call this more stable growth over the last two quarters in the U.S. Jed Kelly : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Naved Khan, B. Riley Securities. Naved Khan : Yes, hi. Thanks a lot. A couple of questions. Glenn, it's great to hear the updates on Gen AI. Maybe give us your thoughts on if you think Gen AI can drive more shift in bookings that can happen through online marketplaces like booking.com versus those that happen directly on a hotel website? And then with respect to Connected Trip, I remember you guys had a partnership with some super apps in Asia like Grab, which is a ride-hailing app. Any updates you can share on those partnerships would be great. Thanks. Glenn Fogel : Sure. So two separate questions. Let me talk first a little bit about AI in general and the ability for us versus others. This stuff is not easy. It's complicated. Gen AI is hard stuff and it's really good to be in a position where you have resources, people, capital, data to be able to drive forward experiments to see what works, what doesn't work, see how well, how quickly it works. And there's no doubt this is an advantage. So if you're a hotel, even an extremely large hotel, you don't have -- you do not have the resources that we have, I believe. Now, of course, you can partner with others. In fact, we're doing that ourselves. An example, we have, you know, go to OpenTable example, they're not building so much themself. They're partnering with us; they did a good agreement with Salesforce to work with their new AI service that's great there. But I believe it's really important to be able to combine your own data in the hotels accommodations area and come up with things that are truly differentiating and personalization. So I am confident that we have, I'd say, the pole position in the growth of this area, and I'm very excited about it. The other thing you mentioned about our partnerships in Asia with some other players, it's a very small amount of business. Look, we're pleased with where our relationships are with them, et cetera. But that is not something that is -- should be seen as anything that was influencing our Asia numbers at all. Naved Khan : Thank you, Glenn. Operator : We'll go next to John Colantuoni, Jefferies. John Colantuoni : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. A quick one on booking window. Maybe you could just help us size the benefit to the third quarter in terms of room nights from both relative to your expectations and on a year-on-year growth rate perspective? And then second, on North America, your business there seems to be maybe the one region that's tracking more consistent with the broader market. Talk about what investments and capabilities you're making to start driving market-share gains once again in North America? Thanks. Ewout Steenbergen : John, I will take the first question. We're not really breaking out how much the booking window had an impact on accelerated growth in the third quarter. It is a bit of benefit, but I wouldn't overestimate the impact period-over-period. So I would say slight benefit in the third quarter, but we're not really quantifying that. In terms of your second question, we are doing in North America relative to the market based on external data sources that we are looking at, we believe in the third quarter actually we were growing a bit faster than the market overall. And that's of course the result of a lot of investments we're making. Glenn has touched on many of those already, the number of listings, the focus on alternative accommodations, the investments in the brand we're making. For example, with respect to the World Series and the baseball playoffs in general, what we're doing in terms of becoming more -- creating more familiarity with the brand in the U.S. and many other features and product enhancements we're making to really further improve our market position in the U.S. We're a challenger in this market and actually we think that's a good position to be in because it is an opportunity to grow and ultimately be able to get to our natural position in terms of overall market impact in the U.S. John Colantuoni : Thanks so much. Operator : And Everyone, that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to hand the call back to Mr. Glenn Fogel for any additional or closing remarks. Glenn Fogel : Thank you. I want to thank our partners, our customers, our dedicated employees and our stockholders. We greatly appreciate everyone's support as we continue to build on the long-term vision for our company. Thank you and good night. Operator : Once again, everyone, that does conclude our conference for today. We would like to thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
