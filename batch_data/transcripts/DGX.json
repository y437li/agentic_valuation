Now I would like to introduce Dan Haemmerle, Executive Director of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead please. Dan Haemmerle :  Thank you and good morning. I am here with Steve Rusckowski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward\u2010looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in Quest Diagnostics' 2013 Annual Report on Form 10\u2010K and Current Reports on Form 8\u2010K. A copy of our earnings press release is available, and the text of our prepared remarks will be available later today, in the Investor Relations 'quarterly updates' section of our website at www.questdiagnostics.com. A PowerPoint presentation and spreadsheet with our results and supplemental analysis are also available on our website. Now, here is Steve Rusckowski. Stephen Rusckowski : Thanks Dan, and thanks everyone for joining us today. This morning what I would like to do is walk you through the industry dynamics, talk about the impact harsh winter on the quarter and review progress against our five-point strategy, and then Mark will provide more detail on the results and walk you through the guidance.  So let's start with the industry dynamics and the legislative dynamics in particular. As you know our industry has been facing unprecedented reimbursement challenges from the government from a long history of reimbursement cuts. The new provisions of what's called the Doc Fix Legislation that related to the clinical fee schedule remove a dark cloud that was hanging over our industry. This legislation gives us an outcome that is much preferable to earlier government proposals. What is does is it delays adjustments to the clinical out fees schedule until 2017. It provides for a rule making process to define new rates, based upon a market weighted medium of commercial rates for abroad or in laboratories and importantly it restricts the authority of CMS to make discretionary cuts. I look forward at working on this with our trade association, particularly in my new role as Chairman. Now there's been questions about the pricing mechanisms in the legislation, and let me provide some clarity to that.  First, this needs to be top defined through the role making process, but it's designed to be representative of the entire commercial laboratory market. The legislation includes hospitals, out reach laboratories and independent laboratories. The laboratory industry agrees that everyone benefits from including a broad spectrum of providers in the network.  Now beyond the recent legislation we continue to believe the affordable care act will be net positive for the industry. In the near term we expected it to be neutral to slightly positive for Quest in 2014. The enrolment process was in line with our expectations, that is bumpy roll-out followed by a late surge near the deadline, and we believe that going into the second half will see some impact, but again neutral to slightly positive. As we all know this was an unusually harsh winter in many parts of the country. And this had a significant impact on many businesses. During the quarter we estimate that the harsh winter reduced our revenues by 2% and EPS by $0.11. At this winter and more like last year revenues would have been essentially flat to the prior year and EPS would have been favourable to 2013.  We saw signs of continued stabilization in the underlying trends. Sequential year-over-year trends improved for revenue, volume and revenue per acquisition.  As we said in January, we want to deliver guidance that is both realistic and achievable. While the slow start to this year clearly is a challenge. We are confident that progress we have made on growth initiatives, particularly as a result of acquisition activities will enable us to meet our commitments.  Given this environment and actions we are taking, we now expect to show revenue growth beginning in the second quarter. In a few minutes Mark will share color on our 2014 guidance. We have been dealing with dynamic market forces and we are in the process of updating our longer term view. We do expect to share this with you later in the year at our Investor Day Presentation. But in the meantime we continue to be bullish on the longer term growth drivers of this industry. First, the market will benefit from continued population growth and favourable demographics as baby boomers move into Medicare and live longer. Also advanced esoteric testing will grow as precision medicine drives demand for advanced diagnostic insights. And despite the slow uptake for the affordable care act, more ensured buyers will gradually begin to enter the market each year. And then finally, medical guideline changes do influence physician behaviour and we expect to see increases in some tests such as hepatitis C, non-invasive prenatal testing, lymph syndrome and lipid testing. Over the long term we see significant opportunity in being a high quality, low cost provider of diagnostic information services which are essential to healthcare delivery. We remain committed to executing our five-point strategy and what I'd like to do now is to give you an update on progress. Our top priority for 2014 is to restore growth. We are making solid progress on our growth priorities. On the business development front, we've completed seven acquisitions at the beginning of 2013, including three this year. Prior to our January call we announced the agreement to acquire Solstas. I'm happy to say the integration is now well under way. I've been impressed with the professionalism in the quality of the Solstas team that I had met. Solstas will help us improve top-line performance and strengthen our presence in important region of the country. We also recently completed the acquisition of Summit Health a few days ago. Summit solidifies our leadership decision in the fast growing wellness business. In this business we partner with employers in health plans to provide an overall health assessment, including biometric screening as well as a comprehensive laboratory analysis. Summit is complimentary to Quest owned wellness offering whose customers tend to be large employers. Both businesses have been growing organically in the double digits. Summit offers wellness services largely through third parties, including through large health plans and employers. And both Summit and our wellness business also works closely to help retailers and urgent care centres meet their necessity explored new business models. Our specimen collection is largely based on vein puncture and Summit relies largely on fair sticks. This positions us well in the major Wellness segments including screening, immunization, coaching and disease management.  At Investor Day on 11/20/12, we indicated that we are targeting 1% to 2% of revenue growth through strategically aligned acquisitions. As we have shared Solstas Lab about 5% to revenues on a annualized basis. In addition other acquisitions including Summit and Stewart, we add an additional 1% to 2% to revenues growth in 2014. Beyond the quarter growth we have been highlighting the opportunity to target with hospital systems in integrated delivery networks. Our investor day on 11/20/12 we spoke about the challenges that integrated delivery networks would begin to have as a result of intensified reimbursement pressure and following utilization.  There are many ways that Quest Diagnostics can help from performing reference testing to various forms of laboratory management partnerships, all the way to including purchasing of hospitals outreach business, such as our recent agreement with Stewart Health System.  What we're seeing over the past year is increased interest from the C-suite of integrated delivery networks, interested in learning more about our broad experience across the spectrum of service offerings. During our last call we announced that we have reached agreement with three humidity based hospitals, and we indicated that we would have more to share. I am pleased that during the quarter a lab professional services team reached agreement with a significant regional integrated delivery network. This is a multi-million dollar opportunity evolving several sights. We have taken out hundreds of this client's former employees to operate this lab network and we begin to generate revenues earlier this month.  These are all exciting opportunities for us. This last win is further evidence that hospital leaders are open to new ideas to help them manage the emerging challenges of reimbursement pressure and lower utilization. We have the experience and expertise to help tailor solutions for the needs to hospitals of all shapes and sizes. Finally, we are seeing results from our focus on specific disease stay-in conditions. We talked about the strong growth in our Wellness business, combining with Summit Health, will strengthen this business. We have also seen solid growth in our toxicology and prescription drug monitoring offerings, as well as improvements in Hepatitis C, BRC Advantage, and non-invasive prenatal testing. In Oncology, women's health, we have launched a test to assess the risk of lymph syndrome, a genetic disorder associated with the higher incidence of colon, rectal, and other cancers. While we are making progress, we need to keep our focus on this top priority of restoring growth. We also continue to make progress driving operational excellence.  Our Invigorate cost reduction in this is expected to approach $700 million in run-rate savings by the end of this year compared to 2011. And we also are committed to our longer term goal of $1 billion in savings beyond 2014.  As we have said the operational excellence program which we call Drive, is improving our quality and efficiency, it will enable us to improve our overall customer experience. You know driving operational excellence is really all about creating a superior customer experience in towards that end we recently launched what we call Our My Quest, which is by Care360 patient portal that allow patients to take ownership of their own results and manage their conditions more effectively. A new federal rule that took effect earlier this month, gives patients in all 50 States the right to view their tests directly without first being authorized by a physician. We also made great progress on our simplifying the organizations strategy last year. So in 2014, our intention has been shifted towards building a high performance culture, focusing on our behaviours and delivering results.  We also made some important organizational changes. First, I'm pleased that Lidia Fonseca, an industry veteran has joined Quest as our new Chief Information Officer. I worked with Lidia years ago at Philips in Marlborough. Lidia is now fully engaged in this part of our plant to strengthen our IT capabilities, which includes improving the customer experience and driving efficiencies that will help us reach our $1 billion goal. Also as previously announced John Hayden, formally our Senior Vice President of Operations has moved into a key role to oversee our equity joint ventures. He has succeeded in the operation role by Jim Davis, who has deep operational experience and had led our Employer Insurance and Products businesses. Finally we continue to review our portfolio for opportunities to refocus on Diagnostic Information Services and enable us to continue to deliver disciplined capital deployment. We remain committed to our plan to return the majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.  The harsh winter made a particularly tough quarter. But we are seeing signs of continued stabilization in the business and closed this quarter strong in March. We are making progress and recognize that there is much more to be done.  Now I would like to turn it over to Mark for a detailed analysis of numbers, Mark. Mark Guinan :  Thanks Steve. Starting with revenues, consolidated revenues of $1.75 billion were 2.3% below the prior year. Our Diagnostic Information Services revenues which account for over 90% of total revenues were 2.1% below the prior year. Volume was 0.07% favourable to the prior year. Recent acquisitions added approximately 3.5% to volumes. The seasonably harsh winter depressed volumes by approximately 2% compared to the prior year.  You've heard us talk about the impact of weather on our business in the past. Given the severity of this past winter let me take a minute to give you some color on how we calculate the impact of weather on our business. Our analysis is based on specific declines in volume versus trend for a specific geographies related to various specific weather events. Adjusting for acquisitions in weather, we are estimating our organic volumes decline less than 1% compared to Q1, 2013. This year-over-year comparison is essentially in line with our exit run rate from Q4, 2013, and is an improvement in the comparison from the earlier periods of 2013. Revenue per acquisition in Q1 was down 2.8% compared to the prior year. The recent acquisitions and price erosion each accounted for about 100 basis points of the change. While changes in business mix accounted for the remainder. However we except this metric to improve as we move through the year, as certain items will anniversary, including sequestration and certain commercial rates that were renegotiated during 2013, consistent with what we shared with you in the fall of 2012. We continue to plan our average reimbursement pressure of 1% to 2% through 2015. Q1 revenues in our Diagnostic Solutions businesses, which include risk assessment, clinical cross testing, healthcare IT, and our remaining products businesses were down 4.3% compared to the prior year, with approximately half of that impact related to the devastator of Inter X last year.  Adjusted operating income at 13.5% of revenues was about 1.7% below the prior year, with the decrease due principally to lower margins associated with reimbursement pressure and limited flexibility in our ability to remove costs in response to short term weather events. Despite these challenges we continued to make progress on our Invigorate Program, which helped offset wage bill inflation and lower margins on our more recent acquisitions.  As we indicated on our last call, we expect to achieve approximately $200 million in real life savings during 2014, and approach approximately $700 million in run rate savings as we exit 2014, with a longer term gaol of $1 billion over time. Adjusted EPS of $0.84 was $0.05 below the prior year, with an $0.11 headwind resulting from the impact of the unfavourable weather in the quarter. Special items totalling $28 million principally restructuring in integration costs, reduced reported operating income as the percentage of revenues by 1.6%, and reported EPS by $0.13. Last year's first quarter included $45 million of costs associated with restructuring and integration charges, which reduced reported operating income as a percentage of revenues by 2.5%, and reported EPS by $0.17. Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues increased 30 basis points from the prior year to 4.3%. Two issues to keep in mind on our bad debt, first as you think about the year, our bad debt expense is typically the highest in the first quarter due to increased patient responsibility associated with the un-met deductible amounts. Second, from a benefit design perspective, as we shared in our last call, we expected that employers would shift more costs to individuals and we see a continued increase in the prevalence of high deductible plans. Despite this trend we believe we are managing the change in operating environment and continue to see improvement in our collection rates across our various pair categories, as a result of our efforts to drive operational excellence. DSOs were 49 days, a two day increase from last quarter, principally as a result of the Solstas transaction. That is our results include all of the Solstas accounts receivable balance, but only revenues since the early March close date.  Cash from operations was $84 million in the quarter, compared to $47 million in the prior year. Cash flow for Q1 is seasonally the weakest of the year and as we explained last year our Q1, 2013, cash flow was reduced to a tax payment that has previously been deferred. Capital expenditures were $68 million in the quarter compared to $49 million a year ago. During the quarter we repurchased $32 million of our common shares at an average price of $52.80. We plan to meet our capital deployment commitments by returning the majority of our free cash flow to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. We also acquired Solstas and recently went to the Capital markets and ran a very successful $600 million bond offering last month at attractive rates, while maintaining our investment grade credit ratings. We remain committed to maintaining our investment grade credit rating and also remain committed to paying down the majority of the debt associated with the Solstas transaction over the next 18 months. Turning to guidance, our guidance remains unchanged to what we shared last month. We expect results from continuing operations before special items as follows; revenues to increase 2% to 4% compared to a year ago. Earnings per diluted share to be approximately between $3.95 and $4.15. Cash provided by operations to approximately $900 million and capital expenditures to approximately $300 million. While the first quarter was negatively impacted by the weather, we continue to believe that guidance is realistic and achievable, and will benefit from our recently completed acquisitions and our efforts to restore growth. Finally I'd like to remind you of some data points to help put our guidance into perspective. Regarding reimbursement keep in mind some items were anniversary this year, including sequestration and certain commercial contracts. On acquisitions, you should dial 6% to 7% revenue growth into your models for the remainder of the year, 5% from Solstas and an additional 1% to 2% from other acquisitions in the year. And we expect acquisitions to benefit EPS gradually through the year as integration plans unfold, both Solstas and Summit will be dilutive to second quarter earnings but accretive for the full year. As a result of these items, we now expect second quarter EPS to approximate the prior year level and to show growth in adjusted EPS in the back half of the year.  Now I'll turn it back to Steve. Stephen Rusckowski :   Thanks Mark, and to summarize the harsh winter hurt us in the quarter, but we are seeing positive signs in underlying trends. Fortunately Congress lifted a cloud from our industry with a recent legislation that effects the clinical out fee schedule, and our top priority for 2014 is restoring growth.  We are pleased with progress we are making on our growth priorities and particularly the recent acquisitions. As we said in January, we believe our 2014 guidance is both realistic and achievable. Now we would be happy to take your questions, operator. Operator :  (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse. Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse :  Thanks and good morning. I just want to follow-up on the pricing question. Mark, if I heard you correctly, I think you sort of talked about the revenue pre-requisition being down 2.8%. You kind of laid out the different components being acquisition, price erosion, and business mix. I wonder if you can elaborate a little bit more on the price erosion and business mix, you know components of that erosion because I think if I heard you correctly your assuming that pricing will be down 1% to 2% this year and next year. So given that you\u2019re down almost 3% in 1Q, should we assume that you\u2019re going to start an anniversary in some of these acquisitions and ultimately in some of these contract renewals and so we should see pricing start to improve sequentially throughout the year. Is that the right way to think about it? Mark Guinan : Yeah I appreciate the question Glen. So first off the 1% to 2% guidance is really a three year from 2013 to 2015. So what we're, what I was trying to emphasise is that we're not deviating from what we had communicated. You know starting with our investor day in 2012 and I think pretty consistently, each time we have a chance to address it. So the, when you look at the 2.8% that I referenced, the revenue per rack, this quarter about 100 basis points was true price, and that's what we are referring to when we talk about the 1% to 2 percentage. True price independent from business mix and business mix obviously comes in two forms. One is, should we do acquisitions, for instance we've talked about the toxicology acquisition, we did mid last year. That can have a different structure and had lower revenue per rack, obviously also lower cost per rack as well, and therefore it has a negative mix impact on us.  The other one is the mix within our core organic business as we go forward and things can shift you know quarter-to-quarter depending on tax mix and so on and so forth. So the trend throughout the year, what I'm really talking about is the comparisons year-over-year will improve. Not necessarily you know forecasting and improvement in overall rent per rack, although we have talked about the fact that we have seen a positive trend in a number of tests per acquisition and that's certainly something that we would expect to continue. Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse : Okay, I appreciate that. Steve maybe if you can just follow-up on the molecular diagnostics piece of the business. You know your primary competitor obviously has called out you know some big challenges getting paid in that area in 2013. Maybe we start and see a little bit of reprieve on that in 2014. Could you maybe comment in terms of what your collection experiences have been related to the molecular diagnostics and ultimately do you think this could be an opportunity as some of the payers start to maybe ease up a little bit on some of the restrictions here and can just be a tailwinds. For U.S. we think about the balance in 2014 relative to 2013. Stephen Rusckowski :  Yeah. Thanks. Glad it. Let me just underscore something that Mark just went through. We feel that we have good visibility on pricing and there has been a lot of interest at pricing in the past and as we said our guidance for the next three years is 1% to 2%. We shared at 2013 it was going be about 3%, we ended at about 3% and we actually showed in the first quarter that were making movement down. We actually believe that we\u2019re executing well against our pricing discipline approach in the market place and the 1% real price effect in the first quarter, I think, underscores that strategy. So, Dan answered your on molecular diagnostics. Actually, we continue to work with payers and what I\u2019d share is even though we had been in constructive dialogue, I would not say that it\u2019s material change than what we\u2019re getting paid for by payers. So, this is a continued process we continue to work at. We\u2019re hopeful we\u2019re having a good dialogue and good discussion, but I can\u2019t say in the first quarter there was material change of what we were paid for versus prior quarters. Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse :  Okay, thanks for the comments. Stephen Rusckowski :  Thanks brother. Operator : Next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley :  Ah yeah, good morning. Stephen Rusckowski : Good morning. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley : Just a couple of questions here. Obviously, we\u2019re hearing a lot of commentary around hep C. I just want to get your perspective. Are you seeing any upside to your hep c testing business as a result of sociability [ph] you expected to be a meaningful contributor for the remainder of the year? Mark Guinan : Yes. Thanks for the question, Ricky. We did actually mention in Steve\u2019s prepared remarks at just one of the areas that we had seen growth in. So, yes absolutely we\u2019d seen growth and we expected to contribute to our overall business success for after remainder of the year. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley :  Okay. And can you quantify for us? Mark Guinan :  Yes. Stephen Rusckowski : Now I\u2019ll take that. It\u2019s tough to quantify. I think as you\u2019re commenting has a lot of visibility right now with the new drug therapies in the market place and now there is effective treatment for hepatitis C. There is lot more visibility to it and so therefore we should see some tailwinds in the testing we performed, but we can\u2019t quantify for you at this time. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley : Okay. And then on your ACA comments, obviously, it\u2019s early on and we get most of the uptick in lives towards the - actually we\u2019re getting in first quarter. But any early insights on ACA-related volumes? How are patients on exchanges utilizing that services versus kind of like your non-NCA population? Stephen Rusckowski : Well. The best way that will I answer at this point were so digestive what we\u2019ll see. We are at commences that for this year on the neutral-to-slightly positive for us in our numbers. We [indiscernible] of this industry or trying to understand the true impact of the exchange. We still believe there was increase at Medicaid volumes and we\u2019re also trying to digest it and have it on the employer\u2019s side. The [indiscernible] breaking is as you know we do have a larger percentage of our business with highly top [ph] peoples. We are relieving a fair percentage of the new lives. We will have higher deductibles and as interest they are aiming for our business both in [indiscernible] but actually these people will have to pay our pocket. It\u2019s exactly [ph] what it does to pressure our bad debts. So, we\u2019re digesting it all. We don\u2019t have better fill for it yet, but again we believe it will be neutral to slightly positive in 2014. Mark, will you care to join? Mark Guinan :  Yeah. There is someone come out at us. One of the very positive aspects amongst many of the Affordable Care Act is that there is a number of diagnostic and preventative treatments that are not actually subject to many patients responsibility. It\u2019s not clear that that\u2019s broadly understood. So, until that\u2019s broadly understood certainly the passion would be so much needed to taking advantage of past not having to work after deductible and these higher deductible plans. So, I think it\u2019s very early. I think it\u2019s the answer. And we\u2019ll be interested, we\u2019ll be monitoring it. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be asking us about regularly but it\u2019s just too early to make a call at this point. Stephen Rusckowski :  Let me just assemble [ph] on last comment on you for Affordable Care Act again. We believe Affordable Care Act continues to be net positive. This is free and net positive for us. We have said in the past, we\u2019ll continue to say that more people are determined to continue with what we do and that\u2019s the trust. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley :  And that\u2019s \u2013 those are included in your 1% to 2% assumptions for pricing trends going forward? Yeah. Stephen Rusckowski :  We have to do this. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley : Thank you. Stephen Rusckowski : Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Michael Cherny with ISI Group. Michael Cherny - ISI Group Inc : Hi. Good morning, guys. Stephen Rusckowski : Good morning. Stephen Rusckowski : Good morning. Michael Cherny - ISI Group Inc : So obviously, a few weeks ago everyone knows the push-outs you mentioned of the clinical lab fee schedule reimbursement changes. In terms of your negotiations there I guess you obviously think that the clinical lab has been a bit of the crosshair as seen with us for a while now. This is clearly a sign of positive for you guys. What you think was a key tipping point in convincing CMS to delay some of these costs particularly? And also what you did mention much also was the downside limits on those cuts of 15% released [rail guards] up to 17%. Stephen Rusckowski : Yeah, Michael. I have described it this way is if we did a good job actually as an industry as you know active with the Miracle Clinical Episode Association so are number of people in this industry. We expect a fair amount of time walking the halls of Congress getting Congress involved and what this industry has paid in the past and what is at risk if it in fact we didn\u2019t have any what we\u2019ll describe as guard rails on the process going forward. Fortunately, we got them to listen. We were fortunately there also thinking about how they would do this year\u2019s doc fix. We took advantage of that opportunity, and fortunately with the build-up was passed it allowed us some time now to get it to a good dialogue about the rule-making process and also that will allow us to have a comprehensive market view by code that will eventually set the prices that will take effect in 2017. So, we\u2019re encouraged by that. We have worked on furloughs [ph] to make sure the rules are done correctly and eventually when we do the market analysis and again when I set up my remarks it\u2019s a full market view including all segments of the market place and we feel good about that. We think it serves all segments well to be participants in that survey, and when we go through the data in 2015 and 2016 we\u2019ll eventually have new prices in 2017. We did have caps at the per code level. You know they are at 10%, but until you get the market data you\u2019re not sure really what the effect would be per code, but that\u2019s 2017. So, we feel good about the process, we feel good that we\u2019ve some time to digest it and create some stability with us but this is unknown in the market price and as I said from my earlier remarks it actually lifts the cloud that was over this industry that worked in the past. So, we feel good about what\u2019s happened. Michael Cherny - ISI Group Inc :  Great. Thanks. And just quickly relative to maintaining the 1% to 2% compounded reimbursement cuts to 2015. Are there any other really unknown there are swing factors one way or the other that could impact on \u201915 and the year currently debating to you positive or negative? Stephen Rusckowski :  Yeah. Mark would you like to add that one? Mark Guinan : Yeah. I think the add to that is no. I don\u2019t think there is any other wildcards, at this point certainly not in the radar. So, I think as you mentioned in the past we\u2019ve got a good handle on the cycle of commercial renegotiations. I think we got a pretty track good of be able to kind of guard rail those as Steve mentioned and we called the 3% going into 2013 that includes negotiation but had yet to be completed. At that point, we at that pretty much nail right on the head and we talked about obviously our setting those lower rates in 2014 and 2015 and certainly as we shared this quarter it seems like we\u2019re delivering on that. So, at this point, we feel very confident in those guard rails of 1% to 2% that we mentioned over that period of time. Michael Cherny - ISI Group Inc : Perfect. Thanks. Operator : Next question comes from Darren Lehrich with Deutsche Bank. Stephen Rusckowski : Hey good morning, Darren. Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank : Good morning. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So I just keen to one of your comments, Steve, just around what you said you\u2019re in the process of updating your longer term view. Can you just remind us what is your current long-term view of the market? I recalled at the initial Investor Day that you had hosted you thought it was around 4% market growth and maybe just give us a sense for how you\u2019re thinking any differently about the longer term view. Stephen Rusckowski :  Sure, well enough you to reiterate what we said in 2012 and I guess we have to update it. So, it\u2019s all decimals, but we\u2019ll tell you what we said. We said that we believe that market place was a good market and that\u2019s this market will be growing at about 4%. Now in that market assumption, we assumed the Affordable Care Act would be taking full force in 2014 and as you know that hasn\u2019t happened, so that was a big assumption in that. Clearly, this has been pushed out. It could be more of a gradual build and we\u2019ll eventually come back to you with our current assessment of the market. This fall we\u2019ll evaluate what our current forecast is as far as the Affordable Care Act. On the Investor Day I said my comments were really arranged [ph]. The population is growing, we\u2019re all living longer and we [indiscernible] will be into the med care system. Also, advanced diagnostics are critical to persist with medicine. These all have very positive effects on other Diagnostic Information Services that are needed in the market place. So, we\u2019ll update this when we have our Investor Day in the fall. Some of the assumptions that we had at 2012 really have changed, but we still are optimistic and bullish of the process with this industry. Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank : Okay. That\u2019s all for DGX [ph]. It\u2019s clear that you\u2019re suggesting here that the ACA benefits may just come in more gradually and that seems like a key assumption that\u2019s changed and this would be cherished. Are there any other things that maybe changing for the better in your view because we\u2019ve heard a lot from you just about the activity in the hospital domain? And I\u2019m just wondering if you think you gain more traction there such that you have a different view the other way in that part of the market? Stephen Rusckowski : Yeah. We\u2019ll see as it\u2019s in our comments. We\u2019re encouraged by the traction we are getting with our dialogues in hospitals. We\u2019ve announced the relationships over the first quarter too a bit about those, and in their [indiscernible] range of difficult relationships that we formed but still got the boasted integrated delivery system. We feel good that they have decided to continue to work with us and for other in our relationship. We also announced the small hospital punitive [ph] hospital in North-western Connecticut this week in [indiscernible] again is a community in North-western Connecticut, but [indiscernible] hospital all these happened [indiscernible] the same thing and their cost structure there is [indiscernible] about that. We also announced with [indiscernible] is that there is [indiscernible] integrated delivery system that has multiple [indiscernible] and all the multimillion dollars as the volume for us and we\u2019re encouraged about that. We started to see some of this. Then we shared this with you because the [indiscernible] is to build our discussion continued to build around and we think about that, but we\u2019re not so optimistic that at this point we\u2019re going to change our guidance because there are so building and you need to bring [indiscernible] will progress. We feel bit of our guidance for this year. Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank :  Okay. That helps for me. Just one follow-up really with regard to your Q2 commentary, I guess be implied on flat year-over-year guidance for Q2 is roughly 6% to 7% below consensus on ETS line. Are you saying that most of that is the diluted nature from the DOs? Can you just suppose think about prior year you\u2019re giving us this Q2 flavor at this point? Stephen Rusckowski :  Yeah, I do appreciate the question. First up, generally, we don\u2019t really address consensus but what I can tell us you is that if we look at the year obviously we\u2019re guiding to something that\u2019s just little bit better than flat year-over-year. So, really the question is how the cord is to get lay down. In the first quarter your nickel [ph] behind and you mentioned that you do have a little bit of delusion in the second quarter from soft business of it, which really implies that we\u2019re going to pay cut nickel or so in order to grow [indiscernible] in the back half of the year as these acquisitions really become creative through the integration synergies that were driving and take a little time to accomplish. So, yeah I\u2019m not quite timed to your 6% to 7% below consensus, some of the priority was about 6% and while we\u2019re not speaking precisely, giving you precise number in Q2 which does try to simulate generally flat, a little bit of growth on the underlying business offset with a bit of delusion on the two recent acquisitions. Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank :  Okay. That\u2019s all folks. Thanks very much. Stephen Rusckowski :  Um hmm. Operator : Next question comes from Bill Bonello with Craig Hallum. Bill Bonello - Craig Hallum : Hi guys. I also just wanted to say hi to Lydia. I worked with Lydia too and I think that\u2019s a great hire. Stephen Rusckowski : Great. Bill Bonello - Craig Hallum :  I wanted to ask a couple of questions too about the hospital deals because it seems to me like those are really starting to take off. That\u2019s the first thing and you probably talked about this before. But can you just remind us sort of what your targeting in terms of return on capital with these deals? How we should think about what the metrics that they really need to achieve for you to want to get involved with \u2013 I assumed margin is probably less of a concern than return but maybe just elaborate and then we\u2019ll have a follow-up. Stephen Rusckowski :  Yeah. I\u2019m characterizing that every hospital has its own lab strategy. They were approaching peacefully just working in and were having a discussion about the lab strategy and just like so much it helped to see one strategy seem one strategy same for the lab. And what we try to give you is portfolio of all the different opportunities, which we find exciting. People are engaged dialogue with us. It all starts. We have a strong hospital business as you know. We do reference testing for hospitals and people don\u2019t really like relationship and some of these deals will take the form of laboratory management and the deal we talked about that\u2019s a multi-side deal has a portion of that laboratory management. We also have forms of joint ventures in the past. We have a number of successful joint ventures with integrated delivery systems. And finally, in some cases hospitals want to get out of the outreach business and already between [indiscernible] and the [indiscernible] stores selling the remainder of the household outreach that today of course some hospitals coming their way. It is an encouraging time that many systems are now thinking or rethinking what they should do in the labs base in the setting that\u2019s best for them to focus on what they do well and rely on earlier [indiscernible] we do well for them. So, we think that\u2019s encouraging. This supports what [indiscernible] We believe those two large role drivers of value are growth and return on invested capital, and we think that this business or lab professional services business will allow us to restore growth and at the same time be accredited to our return on invested capital targets as before. And I will turn to Mark to add some color to that as well. Mark Guinan : Yes, Steve mentioned. Bill, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re smart, at least deals come in different shapes and forms. So, we buy a business from average business like they were still like [indiscernible] there\u2019s some of the greater invested capital but you also will get higher margins because you owned the business. Whereas in some of the other deals we\u2019re really just partnering. Obviously, we don\u2019t have as much investments and the margins, therefore, are acceptably lower to still get an attractive return on invested capital. So, we\u2019re really focused on growing our return on invested capital. Certainly, we try to do as well as we can in the margin in every given deal, which suggests that the structure of the partnership deals are going to be lower margin with lower invested capital than the acquisitions. I also want to make sure we\u2019re clear because you mentioned that some of the acquisitions are lower margin that\u2019s really the initial margin, so until we drive those synergies. But as we mentioned and I think I specifically addressed on the January call once we get Solstas, for instance, up and running we expect those margins be comparable to our base overall business. Bill Bonello - Craig Hallum : That\u2019s helpful. And do you have an actual return hurdle than an acquisition have to gather a deal have they hit that you can share? Mark Guinan :  Yeah. No that we can share. Well, we have, as I said, we\u2019re really targeting to grow our return on invested capital. So on the acquisitions we do mention that we wanted to be a creative on our RIC basis by the third year but have not shared specific overall RIC targets or hurdle rates. I mean as you know, Bill, there is some subjectivity on this because everything has different levels of risk. So, we certainly would not accept anything below or cost of capital and we turn on getting to grow our RIC, which suggests they all have to be above our current level of our RIC but we haven\u2019t shared special hurdle rates. Bill Bonello - Craig Hallum : Okay. Great. And then just one final question, I guess, for both of you. There seems to be an ever-growing mass of clear wave especially labs and for the most part you haven\u2019t done a lot in that area, you\u2019ve done a couple, I guess, in the past. But can you just kind of tell us your view on that? Can those be attractive opportunities? Those seem to be growing really fast, but I know that there can be other concerns maybe about integrating them with the business like yours, but I just be curious if you think that\u2019s an opportunity for growth or not. Stephen Rusckowski : That\u2019s so. First of all, one of our points of our five-point strategy is to build or deliver disciplined capital deployment and as part of that we have a goal to go over 1% to 2% through acquisition. And what we said is we want to use our money wisely. We\u2019re going to look for strategically aligned accredited acquisitions, and as you get from our comments this morning we feel good about the progress we\u2019re making, we are on the high end of that range. We provided it in our five-point strategy. We\u2019re tracking well against it. So, Bill in terms of speciality labs we will consider speciality labs that are strategically aligned and they need to be creative. Every deal is a deal by itself and we need to look at it based upon how we can make money for our shareholders, but we\u2019ll consider it but in the end that\u2019s be aligned. We also would consider make [indiscernible] considerations whether we could do it ourselves and whether it\u2019s wise for us to invest on buyings so that we can do it ourselves, but at the end we need to deliver on our goals of making money for our shareholders and we\u2019ll continue to put up through that filter. Bill Bonello - Craig Hallum : Okay. Thanks. Stephen Rusckowski :  Thanks Bill. Operator :  Next question comes from Amanda Murphy with William Blair. Stephen Rusckowski :  Good morning, Amanda Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company:  Hi guys. So, I just had a follow-up on some of the questions around volumes. I know there is a lot going on in the numbers that I\u2019m curious. What you guys are seeing in terms of underlying dynamics relative to HAS [ph] plans just in excluding reforming [indiscernible] not. Are you seeing that impact Q1 volumes or benefit Q4 volumes at this point? Stephen Rusckowski :  Yeah, I think looking at that level of granularity it\u2019s a little bit tough and especially looking at the first quarter, Amanda, with the amount of weather we saw it\u2019s tough to read too much in some of these trends at the moment. Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company: Got it. And I\u2019m just curious about the pathology side of the business. Are you seeing, I guess two questions there, one, any attempt to sort of insourcing dynamics that\u2019s given all the reimbursement issues in this phase? And then secondly is that an area that you think maybe - or I guess are you seeing more assets in that area, come to market, is that something that you would consider being more active in terms of M&A? Stephen Rusckowski : Yeah. Let me give you some color on pathology. Clearly with the ADA [ph] three or five cuts last year, there\u2019s more pressure on everyone to make money in pathology services and also on the tech side. You would have expected given the pressure that there will be increased interest in outsourcing if you will. What we shared before then really haven\u2019t changed. We haven\u2019t seen enough material change on people\u2019s perspective on this, but we do have discussions with hospital systems, we go department if you will by department talking about what their strategy is in pathologies consideration, but no notable change at this point. Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company: Got it. Thank you very much. Stephen Rusckowski :  Thank you. Operator :  Next question comes from David Clair with Piper Jaffary. David Clair - Piper Jaffary : Hi good morning, everybody. Stephen Rusckowski :  Good morning. David Clair - Piper Jaffary : First question from me. I was just hoping we could get an update on BRCAvantage and your NITT businesses. How are they performing compared to your original expectations and any color on reimbursement? Stephen Rusckowski :  Yeah, sure. Let me take that. BRCAvantage as you know we entered the market place in the fall. We did this very, very quickly after the Supreme Court decision in June, we feel good about that. We\u2019re gaining traction in the market place. As you introduced product you first have to introduce it to your customers. There is a variety of segments in this market place from the surgery to radiology to women\u2019s health specialist, and we\u2019re doing that as we speak. We\u2019re actually tracking to our internal plan, which obviously would have a ramp build into it and we feel good that we\u2019re making the progress we would expect. But also non-evasive prenatal testing is a growth market for us, we\u2019re focused on that as well. We feel that with the progress we\u2019re making there we think it\u2019s a fast growth market place. It is a great example where medical guidelines are actually stimulating demand for us and we\u2019re taking advantage of those new guidelines of the market place. So, in summary they\u2019re both tracking, they\u2019re both opportunities for growth for us and we\u2019re looking about their prospects. And Dan, any colour you can give us on reimbursement for using one of those? Mark, would you want to add anything to that? Mark Guinan : Yeah. We have successfully negotiated reimbursement rates with the typical health plans that we contract with. We feel good about the prices again similar to what Steve said on expectation as not just volume but the reimbursement rates that we thought we could achieve. We\u2019re feeling good about those. So, the reimbursement environment is reasonable certainly like any other task that starts to get lot more attention - the payers start to put some things in place like pre-authorizations, etc. that can slow down the process, make things a little cumbersome and you\u2019re going to work through some of those issues initially to smooth up the process but no major hurdles on reimbursement in those two categories right now. David Clair - Piper Jaffary :  Okay. Thank you. And then as you look at the portfolio right now, are there any businesses that you\u2019re kind of looking at potentially the best thing or what\u2019s your thoughts there? I know you\u2019ve pointed out in the past that the [indiscernible] products business is something that could potentially be divested. Stephen Rusckowski : Yeah. So again go back to our five-point strategy what we have worked on in the course of 2013 as we\u2019re focusing on Diagnostic Information Services. Back in 2014 we actually sold four assets too small too larger. We continue to evaluate some other portions of our portfolio. When we had our Investor Day on 2012 we did talk about looking at our strategic options for [indiscernible] products, we\u2019re currently still evaluating that. And we\u2019ve got a few others that will evaluate but we\u2019ll keep you informed as necessary. We continue to stay focus on our core business, which is Diagnostic Information Services and there is a few things we might consider changing in our portfolio but we made excellent progress making sure that we\u2019re focused on bringing more Diagnostic Information Services companies into our portfolio with our acquisitions. David Clair - Piper Jaffary : Okay. And then just one quick one on guidance. I\u2019m assuming the update that you gave at mid March did not include Stewart or the IDN that you\u2019re talking about right now. So, should we assume that these deals just get you more comfortable with guidance or should we assume that there is potential upside here? Stephen Rusckowski : Yeah. Within the guidance we earmarked with the 1% to 2% for strategically aligned acquisitions. So, while we may not know exactly which acquisitions there might be, we typically have a pipeline. So, the Solstas\u2019 acquisition kind of stands outside that given its size, you should really look at some [indiscernible] and the other two as kind of being within the envelope of that 1% to 2%. So, they weren\u2019t explicitly in the guidance. I think you should assume they were in place of [indiscernible] guidance. David Clair - Piper Jaffary : Okay. Thank you. Stephen Rusckowski : Thank you. Operator : Our last question comes from Bryan Brokmeier with Maxim Group. Stephen Rusckowski : Hi Brian. Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group : Hi good morning. Stephen Rusckowski :  Good morning. Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group : How large is your clinical trial business? And despite the recent slowdown are you seeing any impact to that business from the recently high level of biotech financings? Stephen Rusckowski : Mark, go and check that. Mark Guinan :  Yeah. We have not shared the specific size. It\u2019s one of the smaller businesses within our Diagnostic Solutions. But certainly the slowdown in R&D span has had some impact on the overall market within the clinical trials laboratory area and has made growth a little more challenging. But we also feel good about our service offering and some of the relationships that we have, which really enable us to maintain work with some of our - as preferred provider for a couple of the drug development company. So, it\u2019s been tough headwinds but not anything of major significance in terms of the slowdown and we feel good about that business both today and about its future prospects. Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group : Alright. Thanks. And was the doc fix legislation a fact during your acquisition of the remainder of the Stewart Outreach business and more broadly how does it impact the M&A environment? Stephen Rusckowski : We\u2019ll say that the doc fix legislation had no bearing on your view on our acquisitions that we\u2019ve done in the past and also this year. And as far as the environment going forward it provides the lift, if you will, the cloud that was over the industry where we\u2019re happy about that and it provides us some time now to work on the rule making we feel good about that. So, what it did do the doc fix is it will at least provide us with more clarity around pricing and in 2015 and 2016 some reasonable confidence around the clinical lab fee schedule pricing that we should be considering while we\u2019re looking at acquisitions. So, it\u2019s a part of the conversation, but I can\u2019t say it had an overwhelming consideration for what we do with Stewart. Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group : Does the legislation also make scale much more important in the industry? Stephen Rusckowski :  Well, I think there is a lot of dynamics in general around scale in this industry. It\u2019s true for the broader health care industry. Frankly, what you see us driving is a continuation of what we believe is necessary health care and more and more consolidation. What we did with Solstas, what we did with the other acquisitions are consolidating this industry. We think that\u2019s strategically helpful to us and also we can make money our shareholders and we\u2019re going to get continue to track down that road because we believe it\u2019s the right strategy for Quest Diagnostics and I think it\u2019s consistent with what you see in other parts of health care overall. Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group : Okay. Thanks a lot. Stephen Rusckowski : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you for participating in Quest Diagnostics first quarter 2014 conference call.

A PowerPoint presentation and spreadsheet with our results and supplemental analysis are also available on the website. Now, here is Steve Rusckowski. Stephen H. Rusckowski: Thanks Dan, and thanks everyone for joining us this morning. This morning what I would is provide you with highlights of the quarter, share industry trends and also review progress we are making against our five-point strategy. And then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through the guidance. This quarter we did restore growth revenues grew 5% to $1.9 billion. Adjusted EPS increased 2% to $1.8 and then finally cash from operations was strong at $280 million, which is up 34% from 2013. So let me start with the industry trends where actually reimbursement outlook has been improving. First, we saw some signs that healthcare utilization improved during the second quarter. Also in April, the Congress passed so-called doc fix legislation that delayed adjustments to the clinical IP scheduling until 2017. This provides for a rule making process to define new rates, based on a market weighted medium of commercial rates from a broad range of labs, which includes both large and small independent labs as well as hospitals, out reach labs. And it also restricts the authority of CMS to make discretionary cuts. And right now we are working through the rule making process. Earlier this month, CMS released the proposal for the 2015 physician fee schedule, that proposal provides a modest improvement from the current fee schedule, which is much needed after the significant cuts experience over the past few years. And then last week we learned that Tricare committed to restoring payment for 40 molecular codes that had previously been denied in some cases. Finally, our trade association has been getting the message out about the value of diagnostic information to healthcare. We are making progress as an industry but reimbursement dynamics continue to evolve and there is much more to do. As we have said diagnostic information is a powerful lever for transforming healthcare. And we are determined to be paid appropriately for the value we provide. We did see continued sequential progress on reimbursement during the quarter. Being appropriately reimbursed for the value provide is critical to our success. We compete on a compelling value proposition, not solely on price. You\u2019ll hear more about this later in the call from Mark. Regarding the Affordable Care Act, the enrollment through the exchanges ramped up late in the first quarter. While it is still early, we did see modest shifts from the uninsured patient volumes at the certain payer types during the second quarter. We continue to expect that the Affordable Care Act will be neutral to slightly positive for our business in 2014 and net positive over the long run. I would expect to update you further on reviews on the market and the competitive landscape at our Investor Day, which will take place on November 5th in New York City. Now let\u2019s take a look at the progress we are making in executing our five-point strategy. Our top priority is restoring growth and we made solid progress in the quarter. The investments we\u2019ve made in efforts to improve our sales effectiveness are starting to yield positive results. We are seeing continued improvement in sequential trends and revenues, organic volume and organic price. We are seeing continued improvement in sales productivity. We saw a strong revenue growth in several product categories driven by clinical franchises including prescription drug monitoring, health and wellness and infectious disease. In addition, the clinical franchises are positioning us for future growth. What I would like to do is to share a few comments on two partnerships that we established during the quarter. First, we are very pleased to be partnering with Memorial Sloan-Kettering to use molecular testing in next-generation sequencing to improve physicians' capability to treat patients with a variety of solid tumor cancers, which account for about 90% of all cancers diagnosed in the United States every year. The goal is to give local community-based oncologists access to these strengths of Quest and Memorial Sloan-Kettering to improve their ability to treat their cancer patients. Initially, physicians who order Quest OncoVantage tumor panel will benefit from the Memorial Sloan-Kettering data through a co- branded clinical annotation report to have access to a patient's prognosis, guide treatment selection, and monitored disease progression. Over time, the goal is to build on this partnership to develop new diagnostic solutions in addition to more research in clinical trials. Second, we also partnered with Sequenom to offer national access to its MaterniT21 PLUS noninvasive prenatal test. Beyond these two collaborations are clinical franchises are also delivering insights from our extensive database to improve health. Let me show you a couple brief examples. You many may have seen that The Wall Street Journal covered our latest health trends report showing that about half of the patients complied with their prescriptions for pain medication. In addition, we continue empower patients to manage their health information through what we call our MyQuest application, which is powered by our Care360 which now has nearly one million users. These are great examples of how we delivering on our vision, of empowering better health with diagnostic insights. We are also continuing to focus on opportunities to work collaboratively with hospital systems and integrated delivery networks. Last quarter we announced our fourth professional lab services relationship all these are now operational and generating revenues. Our pipeline of new opportunities continues to expand in this area. Additionally, our M&A program enable us to restore growth in the quarter. We completed the acquisition of Summit Health to bolster our growing wellness business. We also completed the acquisition of Steward Health's outreach business and made progress on Solstas integration. In total acquisitions added approximately 7% of revenues during the quarter and also is better way for us to add some very talented people to the organization. We are also making progress on other key areas of our strategy. We made the number of advances in our effort to improve our customer experience by driving operational excellence. We opened our two new national operation centers; one in Kansas and one in Tampa, to enhance extend customer services for clients and employees throughout the United States. We have added jobs in each of these markets and put in state-of-the-art technology to enable these teams to deliver a superior customer experience. We also began moving into our new state-of-the-art facility of Marlborough, Massachusetts, which we use advanced automation technology to improve the quality and efficiency of diagnostic testing for the New England healthcare community. And finally overall, our Invigorate program remains on track to deliver the expected cost savings this year. We planned to provide you additional details on our plans to not just meet, but also exceed our long-term goal of $1 billion in cost savings at our Investor Day later this fall. The third element of our strategy is to simplify the organization to enable our top priorities of growth and operational excellence. A simplified strategy extends well beyond our organizational redesign it also includes organizational capabilities, culture, and processes. We continue to imbed capabilities in our organization aimed at building a high performance culture and we\u2019ve been driving transformational change for about 18-months and we have made a lot of progress, but this type of work as you all know actually takes time and we\u2019re still in the early stages of the process. We have strengthened capabilities in our management ranks and also we\u2019re building capabilities on our Board. We\u2019ve recently welcomed Vicky Gregg as a new director. She recently retired as CEO of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Tennessee. She also has held a series of senior roles at Humana and serves on the board of Blue Cross Blue Shield Association. Her healthcare intern perspective and also her deep experience in healthcare information technology will strengthen our board. Finally, we continue to deliver disciplined capital deployment and refocus on our core diagnostic information service business. We generated $200 million of cash from operations in the quarter which reflects progress in our approach to delivering and managing working capital. Inline with our plan we made investments in our business, made two acquisitions and continue to return cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Well we\u2019re on-track to meet our commitments for 2014. Now Mark will provide you with an overview on our second quarter financial performance and update you on our latest view on guidance. Mark. Mark J. Guinan: Thanks Steve. Starting with revenues consolidated revenues of $1.9 billion were 4.8% ahead of the prior year. Our diagnostic information services revenues which account for over 90% of total revenues grew by 5.3% compared to the prior year. Revenue per acquisition in Q2 was down 2.3% compared to the prior year. The impact of recent requisition negatively impacted revenue per requisition by approximately 1%. The remainder is attributed to changes in our business mix and price erosion. Pure price erosion was less than 1% in the quarter; we recognized that price erosion has been a challenge for our business; we will remain focused on receiving appropriate reimbursement for the value that we provide. Part of my focus will be on ensuring a disciplined approach to pricing and along those lines we will and have already begun to make prudent portfolio decisions as we move forward. Volume for the quarter was 7.7% favorable to the prior year; recent acquisitions added approximately 8.5% to volumes. As I mentioned, we have already begun to make prudent decisions regarding pricing, and in some cases that means walking away from existing business. During the quarter, such decisions reduced our underlying volumes by approximately 1%, excluding acquisitions and these deliberate portfolio decisions, our underlying volumes were slightly favorable in the quarter compared to a year-ago. Again, we are making sequential improvement on volumes. Q2 revenues in our Diagnostic Solutions businesses, which include risk assessment, clinical trials testing, healthcare IT and our remaining products businesses were down 1.1% compared to the prior year, the decline is entirely due to the divestiture of Interex last year, excluding the impact of this divestiture our diagnostic solutions business would have improved by approximately 1%. Adjusted operating income at 15.5% of revenues was about 1.4% below the prior year, with the decrease due principally to reimbursement pressure and recent acquisitions which carry lower initial operating margins. Of note, this was the first full quarter of integration for Solstas. As we shared previously, we expected Solstas to be dilutive in the first half of the year, given the magnitude of that business and the fact that we haven\u2019t yet fully realized the synergies, it had an impact on our margins, we estimate that Solstas eroded our margins by more than 50 basis points during the second quarter. Additionally, we continue to make progress on our Invigorate program which offset increases in our wage bill as well as price erosions. As we indicated on our last call we continue to expect to achieve approximately $200 million in realized savings during 2014 and approach approximately $700 million in run-rate savings as we exit 2014, with a longer term goal of greater than $1 billion overtime. Adjusted EPS of $1.84 was 1.9% better than a year-ago, as a result of the company\u2019s ongoing efforts to restore growth, drive operational excellence and simplify the organization, reported operating income was reduced by $34 million principally restructuring and integration costs. This reduced reported operating income as a percentage of revenues by 1.7% and reported EPS by $0.16. Last year\u2019s second quarter included $19 million of cost associated with restructuring and integration charges, which reduced reported operating income as a percentage of revenues by 1%, and reported EPS by $0.07. As expected bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues improved 40 basis points from the prior quarter an increased 20 basis points from the prior year to 3.9%. Our DSOs improved by two days from last quarter to 47 days. Cash from operations was $280 million in the quarter, compared to $208 million in the prior year. Capital expenditures were $49 million in the quarter compared to $56 million a year ago. During the quarter we repurchased $25 million of our common shares at an average price of $57.74. We plan to meet our capital deployment commitments by returning the majority of our free cash flow to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. As well as meet our debt repayment commitments which we discussed on the last call. Turning to guidance, we expect full-year 2014 results from continuing operations before special items as follows; revenues to increase 2.5% to 3.5% compared to a year ago, versus prior guidance of an increased of 2% to 4% compared to a year ago, adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $4 and $4.10, compared to prior guidance of $3.95 to $4.15. Cash provided by operations to approximately $900 million and capital expenditures to approximately $300 million. We took another positive step forward to restoring growth this quarter and continue to make nice progress against our integrate targets. With that in mind we remain committed to providing guidance that is realistic and achievable. Finally, I would like to remind you of some data points to help put our guidance into perspective. Regarding reimbursement certain commercial contracts will anniversary later this year. On volumes we anticipate that are focused on pricing discipline will create some additional headwinds that will continue through the remainder of the year. Ensuring that we are paid appropriately for the value we provide will enable us to build value over the long run. Regarding acquisitions you should assumes Solstas will continue to benefit our revenues in the back half of the year by approximately 5%. But also keep in mind that we have two acquisitions, Dignity Health and ATN, that anniversaried in the second quarter. With that said, we expect our recent acquisitions to begin the benefit EPS gradually through the year as we realized synergies. As a result of these items we now expect third quarter adjusted EPS to be better than the 2013 level and closely approximate our second quarter performance. Now I'll turn it back to Steve. Stephen H. Rusckowski: Thanks, Mark. So to summarize we restored growth in the quarter. Trends improved across the Board and pricing, volume and revenue we continue to make good progress executing our strategy and have more to do. And then finally, we are on track to meet our commitments for 2014. Now, we would be happy to take any of your questions, operator. Operator : (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Lisa Gill. Thank you your line is open. Gavin S. Weiss \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, thank you, this is actually Gavin Weiss in for Lisa. So you talked about seeing some positive benefit from ACA volumes and I just wanted to get some more color on what type of payer mix you are seeing there. I assume it would be Medicaid, but can you talk about how that is impacting revenue per requisition and the profitability on those tests. Stephen H. Rusckowski:  Sure, thanks Lisa, first of all, your guess on that is correct and we did see an increase in Medicaid activity in volume in the quarter and we are trying to track this, as I said in my remarks it is early. We\u2019re trying to understand the ins and outs so what\u2019s happening with our volume and where the lives are going. So and we trying to market down to go growth the revenue per req effect as well because there is a mix change here as well. Mark J. Guinan: At this point, Lisa, it is still early there is small changes, I wouldn\u2019t say there was anything material enough to impact revenue req in a quantifiable fashion. As Steve mentioned we saw some increase in Medicaid though not in all of the states that you would have expected. So it still is early and we also saw a slight decrease in our uninsured volumes. So there are some early signs of the ACA, but certainly not anything material enough to give you the kind of depth that you are probably looking for at this point. Gavin S. Weiss \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, that is actually helpful. And then in terms of the business that you are walking away from that is not profitable, is there a specific type of test or is it certain payers that you are walking away from? Mark J. Guinan: It is more of the client bill area so we have some client bill accounts where as we look at it we\u2019ve decided like you do in your products portfolio and other things as we have to make business decision around how we create value that it doesn\u2019t make sense continuing with those clients. So we understand and agree that there should be a lot of focus on volumes, but also want to make sure people understand not all volumes creased equal, and just like we needed to reshape our portfolio along our products and business we also need to do some clean-up of our portfolio around our customer base. Gavin S. Weiss \u2013 JP Morgan Securities LLC : Okay great, thank you very much. Stephen H. Rusckowski: So we've also taken a look Lisa, some of our practices and a variety of our businesses and pathology will be a good example, we are just taking a look at some of the practice has given a substantial changes that\u2019s we've had a reimbursement as you know in the last year and made deliberate choices to reduce some in some areas that we thought were not the best interest of building value overtime. So that\u2019s what we are referring to in our remarks. Gavin S. Weiss \u2013 JP Morgan Securities LLC : Okay, great. I appreciate the color. Thank you. Operator : Thank you and our next question comes from Brett Jones. Your line is open. Bret Jones \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. Stephen H. Rusckowski: Hey Bret. Bret Jones \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co: I wanted to start with the organic price comment where you said you saw some organic price improvement, was that primarily a managed care contract which to me sound like they were going to anniversary in second half or was that really around the client bill as you were talking about walking away from clients? Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes, so we saw a sequential improvement in what we define as real price erosion and so sequential improvement is the decline and our price erosion is better in the second quarter versus Q1. We've indicated going into the year, we expected to have less price erosion in 2014 than we experienced in 2013, we\u2019re still standing behind the guidance, we provided it in the fall of 2012 which that on a \u2013 we believe our price erosion over a three year period would be 1% to 2% and we feel good now that in fact what we believe would happen is happening and we have reasonable visibility. So I\u2019ll turn it to again Mark and Dan to give a little more color on exactly what's happened with the price erosion in the quarter. Mark J. Guinan: Yes and just to build on what Steve shared, right the price erosion we are looking at it from a sequential perspective some things anniversaried was a good example, sequestration which I think we all knew is going to anniversary at April 1, so the year-over-year comparisons are getting better, now less than 1% if you thought about it more from an absolute basis on a sequential basis revenue per acquisition is inline with what it had been running at, but that year-over-year comparison is getting better. Dan Haemmerle : Yes and just on your question about the customer portfolio decisions we would not capture that in price, that would be in mix, so any decision to move away from certain business would be in the revenue per rack mix rate are not in the price calculation. Bret Jones \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co: All right great that\u2019s helpful. On volumes, is there anyway to tell if there was a rebound of volumes due to weather that you saw in the first quarter, were there regions that were hit hard in Q1 that were especially strong this quarter? Dan Haemmerle : Yes, you know that\u2019s a great question and its something that we constantly ask ourselves is when weather happens is it\u2019s a deferral or is it actually a reduction and there is not a lot of evidence to suggest that Q2 benefitted greatly from the decline in Q1 and we picked that up. I really think as we look at the quarter, we feel it\u2019s a true run rate of demand in that quarter versus being some sort of the pick up from that depression in Q1 and a lot of that Q1 weather happens fairly early, some was January, some was February but March wasn\u2019t all that bad of a weather month. So you would have expected probably if you got some pickup, it may have been in March. Bret Jones \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co:  Great, thank you very much. Operator :  Thank you. And our next question comes from Bob Willoughby. Stephen H. Rusckowski: Good morning Bob. Mark J. Guinan: Good morning Bob. Robert M. Willoughby \u2013 Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch :  brought the high end of the revenue range down despite a pretty healthy beat here on the second quarter. Can you give us any indicator as to what kind of fell out of the high end of the expectation there? Mark J. Guinan:  Bob, you got cut off in the beginning, could you repeat your question please? Robert M. Willoughby \u2013 Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch :  Yes, you had a healthy revenue beat here in the second quarter, yet you brought that revenue range, the high end of the range down for the year. Was there anything in particular that kind of fell out of your expectation for the year? Mark J. Guinan:  No, Bob as you know that the beat was against external I guess projections, not necessarily against what we were expecting. So I mean we feel pretty about Q2, it\u2019s pretty much on plan and I think your take away should be based on the updated guidance. What we\u2019re really same as the year tracking as expected obviously we had some disruption in the first quarter with the weather, but once we've gotten beyond that we feel like we\u2019re on-track to the guidance at the beginning of the year and we\u2019re comfortable and therefore we\u2019re hoping you will confident that things are looking good. So I wouldn\u2019t read too much quote into the beat in the first quarter, we really pretty much we landed right about where we expected which is good. Robert M. Willoughby \u2013 Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch :  Okay. And you referenced possibly exceeding the $1 billion of cost savings numbers here and I just kind of compare that with the comment that you are walking away from some business that is poorly price or that isn't paying you well. We've heard about that since about the mid-90s for the lab companies. I\u2019m always amazed that this business finds its way into your portfolio. And if you are cutting the cost as dramatically as you can, why aren't retaining that business or frankly, poised to grow faster here if those cost savings do come through? Stephen H. Rusckowski:  Yes. So we\u2019re doing this is in a prudent way Bob. There are some business they obviously might've been on the margin in the past; because of the strong cost improvements it\u2019s still highly attractive for us so to your point we\u2019re looking at this in a rigorous way. But at the same time, we transact a lot of activity in a variety of businesses and so what we are making sure we do is prudently go through our business portfolio by regions and price appropriately. And in some cases, if we decided to, decide that is not the best interest to continue with the client. So that\u2019s what we are doing. But our price opportunities along with the opportunities to retain business have been helped as you\u2019re pointing out, with our Invigorate program. We are ahead of our plan. The initial goal was $500 million. We increased it in the fall of 2012 to $600 million. We have said this year that is going to approximate $700 million. We are teeing up or share with you a glimpse of the future. We see actually more opportunity, so we are deliberately going after that to make sure that we are stay in the marketplace is aggressively as possible and make money and build value as much as we can. Mark J. Guinan: And Bob as you know not all volumes created equal and it\u2019s both on the revenue and the cost side, so the difference between a capitated payment and a fee-for-service arrangement can be dramatic. The other thing is the cost to serve can very dramatically depending on the what kind of payer situation it is, whether it\u2019s in bad debt or it\u2019s in billing or it is in logistics. So, I think what we are doing as we are doing a detailed rationalization to try to figure out, where we can create shareholder value and focused and then some other areas where maybe where better half moving our focus away from that business. So that\u2019s what we are talking not given up on volume growth, this is kind of a short-term get the portfolio right and then really focus from that new based going forward. Robert M. Willoughby - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch :  Mark, what is a reasonable share repurchase assumption for the second half? Mark J. Guinan: As I\u2019ve said previously, with our $900 million of guided operating cash flow and $300 million of capital spend is about 600 free cash flow and that we\u2019re committed to returning a majority to our shareholders. Now we\u2019ve done a couple of acquisitions that we are funded out of our operating cash flow most recently Summit and Stewart. And then I also have a commitment to repaying some of the debt we took on incrementally for Solstas. So, at this point, what I\u2019ve really talked about is doing enough share repurchases to prevent dilution and not gotten specific, but certainly with our dividend a little less than $200 million and our commitment to delivering at least half of our free cash flow. You can back into something north of $100 million in share repurchases, but I\u2019ve said we\u2019re going to do anything near the level we did in 2013 and probably not significantly more than just preventing dilution. Robert M. Willoughby - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch : That\u2019s great. Thank you. Operator :  Thank you. And our next question comes from Isaac Ro. Sir, your line open. Isaac Ro \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.:  Good morning. Thank you guys. Stephen H. Rusckowski: Hey Isaac. Isaac Ro \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey. So on the ACA I know we are obviously still early stages trying to figure out all the moving parts, but I would be curious if you could may be try and tie in the impact that you got from ACA relative to the trends that you saw in bad debt. Was there a direct benefit to bad debt, because of the ACA coverage? Stephen H. Rusckowski: No. On bad debt again I don\u2019t think the movement yet is significant enough for you to see it, its less than rounding at this point, so it very, very early. When I look at bad debt historically there is a seasonal variation as you are very aware so as you progress throughout the year you expect some sequential improvement. We referenced that. In terms of the year-over-year increase on bad debt, it actually was driven really by Solstas. So we took on a business that had a higher bad debt rate than our rate and we consider ourselves and I\u2019m sure you look at the numbers to be one of the best-in-class, if not best-in-class. And part of those synergies we are going to drive to the Solstas business is improving the rate of bad debt. So initially that mix drove it up a little bit, but if you look at the core organic bad debt, the work that we are doing on improving that area and some of that is within Invigorate, really that organic business bad debt rate would have been down as a percent of revenue year-over-year. Isaac Ro \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. That was helpful. Stephen H. Rusckowski: But really through our effort and our work, not through the benefit of ACA. Isaac Ro \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, thanks. And just a follow-up on your cost savings targets. You guys raised the goals there, but I don't think we got a lot of color on exactly, first of all, where you expect those cost savings to come from. And then secondly, if you could maybe venture if in fact the pricing and volume environment tracks in line with your expectations, what kind of a margin benefit we should expect from these incremental savings over the next couple years. Thank you. Mark J. Guinan: Yes, so thank Isaac so we\u2019ll provide you more color on this at our Investor Day in November, as we said in New York so hopefully you will be there for that. You should expect that we\u2019ll get out of the new forward looking goal is a continuation of some of the work we already have done. We have more opportunities to do more work related to the streams we have talked about before, what we do around procurement, what we do around functional excellence, what we are doing around just across the board looking at improvement opportunities and how we do our work in all the different complicated areas of our operations. So some of it\u2019s a continuation, but I have shared in the past as a matter of fact we shared it at our first Investor Day in 2012. Is that there will be a second tranche of improvement that we see an opportunity to really take a harder look at re-engineering our processes, streamlining activities and then enabling them with the right IT to allow us to get to the next level and that\u2019s what we are going to provide more color in November Investor Day, and that\u2019s where a second piece of the improvement we see will come from. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.:  Got it guys, thanks so much. See you in November. Stephen H. Rusckowski:  Okay. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Massaro. Sir, your line is open. Stephen H. Rusckowski: Good morning, Mark. Mark A. Massaro - Canaccord Genuity Inc.:  Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Stephen H. Rusckowski: Thank you. Mark A. Massaro - Canaccord Genuity Inc.: So you had a nice job lifting the volumes organically on a sequential basis. Could you help us kind of walk through when you see that kind of more meaningfully lifting? And I know you talked about certain aspects that helped your organic volumes, but could you maybe just walk through what you think some of the largest contributors to that would be? Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yeah. Sure so if you go through and think about what we\u2019re doing as far as, our strategy for restoring growth, first improvement we\u2019re gradually same and you have to see the sequential is what we\u2019re doing about our sales force last year, we actually we put in place in organizational structure we put in place better tools we\u2019re build the capabilities to that organization and we feel much better today that we did year ago whether go to market organization we started to see some results from that. On that across the board that we have a very comprehensive salesforce. They call on primary care physicians they call on the variety of specialty areas that we call on. They call on hospitals. They call on integrated delivery networks and across the board we\u2019re much stronger today then in the past. And in the service business as you know Mark this takes time and you gradually get new accounts and we\u2019re starting to see some of that in what we called sales productivity. Second is part of our change as a company as we create a clinical franchises, we actually made modest investments in those clinical franchises which is a lot of to introduce products and solutions in a different way than we\u2019ve ever done before probably the most notable example of that is what we have done with BRCA which we introduced in the fall of last year, it\u2019s a good example. We are bringing solutions to the marketplace and then commercialize and then in selling those in a much better way then ever before and so we\u2019re seeing improvement in our volumes from those solutions start to take hold as we sell this solutions in the marketplace. And then third, as we have built laboratory professional services business and I\u2019ve said in my introductory comments that is building momentum, we announced in the first quarter that we had four deals that were operational and we are executing against those I will share you that we have significant conversations going on with significant systems throughout the United States. I\u2019m often in front of hospital CEOs and integrated network CEOs and hospital chain CEOs about what we can do to help them with their lab strategy and how we can partner. And that\u2019s helping so the sequential improvement we saw as well in the second quarter. So all three had opportunity improvement we are seeing and that will continue to help us as we go into the second half. So let me pause there. Anything else, Mark, you would like to add to that? Mark J. Guinan: Yeah, I think you recognize that when you look at the overall growth rate really what it is, is mathematical calculation of many sub businesses that are growing in our some cases declining and when you look some of the drivers that have been headwinds for us over last several of quarters, we felt utilization was certainly an issue. So the marketplace overall was down and we are starting to see some positive signs. Again, we have imperfect information like you, we look at many things hospital admissions, physician officers and some of you look at scripts.. And what we have started to do is look at what we call same-store sales are equivalent when we look at accounts that have some sort of stability. So that not accounts where either dramatically they are up and down, which is probably driven by changes in membership or something like that and try to look at the overall volume year-over-year to get a field for how is utilization, how is the market. And as we look at that it looks like we have some stability maybe some slight growth and certainly not the decline that we felt like we experience last year. So that\u2019s one of the drivers certainly that we feel the market it is improving and we all hope that the ACA will accelerate that if anything. The other to get when we had obviously is in area Paps guidance. Guideline change is really impact to that that\u2019s not gotten completely behind us that\u2019s been a major headwind for us. But on the other hand, the guideline change in the industry it doesn\u2019t be offset the path guidelines certainly is a tailwind. We talked about our prescription drug monitoring business being the growth engine or wellness business to being the growth engine certainly in the tox area we are seeing some uplift. And then certainly in the gene-based areas, most notably our BRCA business we are seeing growth. So, when you look at the mix that\u2019s where we are feeling optimistic about a growth and volumes moving forward. Mark A. Massaro - Canaccord Genuity Inc.:  Thanks. Just one quick follow-up. You mentioned prescription drug monitoring. Do you know what your drugs of abuse volumes were in the quarter and do you think that that could accelerate going forward? Mark J. Guinan:  We did see a nice growth in the drug abused area this quarter. I believe overall at least near double-digit growth for the quarter to having provided any guidance relate to that business going forward though. Mark A. Massaro - Canaccord Genuity Inc.: Great, thank you. Stephen H. Rusckowski:  Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from A.J. Rice. Sir your line is open. Stephen H. Rusckowski: Good morning A.J. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC :  Hi, thanks. Hi everyone. Maybe just to ask a little bit more about the comment you made on being pleased that Tricare has come out with this announcement. Have you had any feedback from them as to when you actually might start seeing some payments from them or whether confirmation on the comments about retroactive catch ups and Then I guess I would broaden that out and my sense is there are some states that have been dragging their feet on paying for some of the molecular diagnostic testing. Have you had any positive discussions there? Maybe just some update on that general area. Stephen H. Rusckowski: Dan do you want to handle that? Dan Haemmerle :  Yes. Sure. A.J., thanks for the question on Tricare. First part of your question was related to when we\u2019ll see payments and any details related to the retro. Don't have a lot of detail on that front so it\u2019s a little bit of wait and see. We are having dialogue on that front though and working with the trade association and as soon as we know we will be sure to talk more about it. We would say, though that on Tricare and molecular coding we have seen some reimbursement in the past on certain codes. So when we do see some lift, we expect to see some lift but keep in mind we have seen some payment for some testing. With respect to different states we're seeing some progress and we saw some progress last year with different states and I think couple of states that had not been paying specific tests. One state in particular was not paying cystic fibrosis testing for all of their population. So they have put some edits around that so we continue to work through that with different states, but it\u2019s one at a time and we continue to have dialogue and hope to get to a better place than we are today. A.J. Rice \u2013 UBS Securities LLC :  Okay. And then maybe just broadly re-contracting. You are talking about some of the things you are doing proactively on price. But can you just remind us, are you pretty much done with the major contracts that need to be renewed for this year, however you define major? Are there any opportunities out there that you are bidding on that may be things that you could potentially pick up? Dan Haemmerle : Yes, hundreds of contracts out there so it\u2019s just only some level of dialogue going on in terms of major contract we shared earlier this year that we did renegotiate and extend our relationship with Humana is the major contract that we spoke into. Mark J. Guinan:  And A.J, we look as Steve said earlier, we feel very comfortable with the guidance we've given on price the 1%, 2% over the three year period of time which obviously implied something lower and this year and next year given the 3% that we experienced in 2013. So we certainly have contemplated all of the contracts we need to renegotiate the other thing is at the last call I mentioned and we reaffirm that I expected peer price erosion to mitigate and decline throughout the year. So hopefully that will give you an envelope for confidence and where price might play out for the balance of the year. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC :  Okay, great thanks a lot. Stephen H. Rusckowski: Thank you. Operator :  Thank you. And our next question comes from Gary Taylor. Sir, your line is open. Stephen H. Rusckowski: Good morning, Gary. Mark J. Guinan: Good morning, Gary. Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc.:  Couple of question one we\u2019ve been hearing about some pretty significant Aetna out-of-network lab cuts and some renewed efforts to on the doc fix side and I wondered if you had seen any benefit from that or expected to. Stephen H. Rusckowski: First of all we don\u2019t comment on specific relationships we have, but we are working proactively with Aetna. As you know we are their national provider for lab services and they have an ongoing active program to drive as much volume into our business as possible, given what we offer in terms of value to them. So we feel good about that and they are helping us making sure that we do the right thing for their membership. Would you like to share anything beyond that in. Dan Haemmerle :  Gary, not sure exactly which price points you are referring to. I did see some trade publication to put some news out there I think it was limited to non-contracted providers and certain sub-specialties and certain smaller geographies is our understanding on some of what we had read on some of those cuts. So the pricing that was out there, to the extent people had a question about, did not impact us, but was pretty limited from our understanding. Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc.: Right. Second question, I think people tried to dig into this a little bit. I am just going to ask it a little bit different. I had followed Mark's comments kind of walking through the total volume and the acquisition impact and then the deliberate contract exits to getting to a statement where organic volume was up slightly year-over-year, which is certainly better. What do you guys think when you see a Labcorp reporting a plus 3 organic volume number? Certainly part of that answer is probably mix of services, but what does is that make you think about just kind of how you are performing in the marketplace and share gains, share loss? Or do you think that is purely a mix differential driving the apparent reported difference? Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yeah, so I appreciate the question Gary, obviously not going to comment on anybody else, so I will talk about how we think we are doing. The other thing to notice not everyone calculates organic volume consistently and I am sure you guys work to try to tease that out and get an apples-and-apples comparison. So when we offer up organic volume, it is true organic volume. We don't make any exceptions no matter the size of the deal, so you can feel comfortable that when we call it organic it is organic. In terms of share, it is very difficult because of the lack of market data. So as I mentioned, one of things that we are really trying to figure out ourselves is how is the market growing and to both assess ourselves how we are doing and also be able to share with you. When we have started to look at, what I mentioned was kind of our same account sales levels. But there is also mix differential, so some of the businesses that have been impacted by guideline changes and by other changes in demographics might disproportionately impacted various labs and providers differently. And as we have mentioned in the past, we have the largest pathology business and certainly those pathology cuts disproportionately impacted us. So we don't think we are losing share overall. Obviously the national labs and even independent labs have a sub-segment. There is an awful lot of providers out there, including hospital outreach, so it is kind of hard to just look at the small segment and the national labs and look at each of those two and determine where the share might be coming from, if there are share changes and differential. So not trying to be evasive, but it is a very difficult question to answer, and I think the best answer I can give you as we don't feel like we are losing share. We feel like last year a lot of impact was utilization in the market and some of the impacts that were driven by the guideline changes and by the pathology business being really hit by those cuts and that this year we are starting to recover some of that. So that\u2019s kind of how we view our performance. And as we committed, we want to return to growth. And as several people have noted and as we have said, we are not there yet but we feel like we are making progress. Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yeah, so let me just add to that. So, we feel good now that we are making sequential improvement and in our services business it builds. What he outlined is what we are doing to restore growth has started to show its merits so step-by-step we will see progress. As we have said, it is complicated when you look at the volumes. We had noted that we actually took some actions that affected that. When you adjust for that we saw a slight improvement in organic volumes and that is an improvement versus the prior quarter, which is good. I will also share with you that we noted some clinical franchises that are growing, but if you look at broadly when we take a look at our volumes for gene-based and esoteric testing it did grow. We already talked about drug of abuse growing. And even when you look at the routine volumes, and some of it gets back to Mark's comment about the same account or same-store analysis we do, we actually have started to see some improvement in that as well. The other thing that we need to think about so there is continued to have softness in TAP volumes given the guideline changes that have been in place for a few years now. And we continue to see softness in TAP volumes what offsets these improvements we see in the big areas that we are focused on, genetic testing and then the core platform business of what we called routine. So across the board we feel good about the progress made in the quarter. We are building on all the work that we have done in the past and we have more opportunities in front of us. And it\u2019s a big market out there, so we focus on the entire market. We compete with hospital outreach, we compete with regional labs. We compete with many laboratory providers. So when we look broadly at this industry we think there is plenty of opportunity to grow in this market. We are focused on the right areas that are growing and we will continue to restore growth as we go forward. And I think this quarter is a good example as we are proving that we are showing sequential improvement this quarter and we will show more sequential improvement as we go forward. Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup: Sure. That is a pretty comprehensive answer, so I appreciate that. One last quick question for me. Certainly you have achieved some success in the cost cutting. You can look at either COGS or G&A per a session and see that is declining over the last couple of years. But along with that obviously you have had to spend a fair amount on restructuring and integration. Just quick count, I think roughly $115 million in 2012 and 2013 and on pace for over $100 million of restructuring charges this year, so there is kind of $0.40, $0.50 of earnings impact that we have routinely been excluding from normalized results. So the question was just do you have some visibility? I know Invigorate is expected to continue in the next few years. Do you have some visibility on the trajectory of the restructuring and the integration expense? Mark J. Guinan: We will quantify that to some extent in the Investor Day. So, certainly as we are developing our detailed plans that we are intending to share last this year and obviously start implementing, we are looking at the savings side but obviously we are also quantifying the investment. So we certainly will be sharing that later this year. Stephen H. Rusckowski: I will just add that one of the strategies of our five-point strategy is to deliver on disciplined capital deployment. And so any place we put money on the table we, and Mark and I in particular look through the business case that justifies it. That is included in what we do around capital investments, it includes what we do around Invigorate savings, and it also includes, as you would expect, a business case that will give us good shareholder return for any acquisitions we will do. So everything is well underpinned with good returns based upon the goals that we have for the company. Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup: Okay. I will wait for some more detail on that, thanks. Stephen H. Rusckowski: Thank you. Mark J. Guinan: Thank you. Operator :  Thank you. And our next question comes from Gary Lieberman. Sir your line open. Mark J. Guinan:  Good morning Gary. Gary Lieberman \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Steve, you mentioned hospital outreach in part of the answer to the last question. Could you maybe characterize the overall hospital outreach environment? Are hospitals increasingly getting to the business? Are the managed care payers doing anything incremental to try to steer physician volumes away from the hospitals and to you guys? Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes, so Gary its interesting, and the reason why we are so optimistic about our dialogue with the hospitals and its great delivery networks and hospital chains is, as we thought what happened as there become a larger patients responsibility with high-deductible client when we have. And patients are starting to look at their out-of-pocket cost and then with the dynamic of physicians joining integrated delivery networks and as we all know in the past two or three years some portions of our volume has moved to hospital outreach and as we all know their prices in the industry, their commercial rates are higher than ours. Its drawing some attention from patients, from physician and also the systems are evaluation is this going to be sustainable. So we have engaged with many different system you see one lab strategy, you see one lab strategy, in some cases they decided to rely on us for those service. So we bought University of Massachusetts, we bought Dignity Health, then we bought Steward Outreach. Examples were in fact they decided that\u2019s in the best interest to rely on us as Quest to provide them with their laboratory services. So I would say that the momentum on that topic continues to build and I think the strongest dynamic that\u2019s helping force this is transparency around price, and the patients starting to feel the impact of price increases because of decisions that have been made in the health care system and the most notable is they are going to a physician for number of years, their physicians sold their practice to a hospital and lo and behold instead coming place, coming to Quest with some of the great value we offer. They get told to go to the laboratory inside the hospital and what they find is a much bigger bill than they had in the past and they have to pay for it themselves. So this is getting back to the systems and getting back to the physicians and in general that\u2019s starting to turn and that\u2019s part of our dialogue with these systems. Gary Lieberman \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Okay, thank you. Then I guess just going back to your comments in terms of the business that you exited. It wasn't clear if there was sort of a characteristic that applied to that business. Was it more fee for service, was it more capitated? Maybe a little bit more color on it. Mark J. Guinan:  Yes. Actually you are correct I didn\u2019t provide that so all I said was it\u2019s in the client bill area but really didn\u2019t provide any more on that I\u2019m not going to get into any more detail. Gary Lieberman \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Okay. Then maybe finally if you could just give us some color on the progress you are making with BRCA and maybe any challenges or early successes there? Mark J. Guinan:  Yes. First of all, we are encouraged. We keep on building. We introduce the products as you know in the fall last year. We think there is a tremendous market in front of us. We have a compelling value proposition. We have good reach with our channels. We are putting in place even more comprehensive salesforce to go at the market, getting to the right call points, we feel good about commercial contracts that we have. So encouraged by the progress we made and also this is a part of where we expect to get some growth in the second half. Gary Lieberman \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Okay, great. Thanks very much. Mark J. Guinan: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Nicholas Jansen. Your line is open. Nicholas M. Jansen \u2013 Raymond James & Associates:  Hey. Quick question regarding your net cost savings year over year. Did you provide that? And if I missed it, I apologize. But I'm just trying to get a sense of adjusted EBIT was down about $12 million year over year. I know about half of that is higher bad debt. You acquired Solstas and a couple of other acquisitions over the trailing 12 months, so I am just trying to get a sense of how much the underlying business is down when we normalize for the cost-cutting savings? Thanks. Stephen H. Rusckowski:  Dan do you want to answer it? Dan Haemmerle :  Yes, we didn\u2019t provide that reconciliation. And just to remind you that we also have a cost headwind this year that we mentioned going into the year, which is really restoring our management incentive accruals at this point with the hope and expectation that we are going to achieve our objectives. Last year, unfortunately, given the year, we ended up not spending a lot in that area and so that was a headwind this year. Certainly don't take the margin change as being an indication that Invigorate is not delivering its cost savings. It is just that this year, as we mentioned upfront, there were a couple of things in addition to the wage increase, the annual low single-digit wage increase that we give, and then the price erosion we also had this management incentive headwind. Nicholas M. Jansen \u2013 Raymond James & Associates: Okay, that is helpful. And maybe just kind of a broader speaking question. Maybe this is an analyst day type question, but are you guys able to grow EBIT when rev per req is flat to down? Is it too much of an uphill battle given cost inflation? I'm just trying to get a sense of, if there was no cost-cutting programs going on, would this be an industry that can grow EBIT if test mix and payer mix remain under pressure from a rev per req standpoint. Thanks. Dan Haemmerle :  Yes. Appreciate the question and we will provide a little more color on the industry and what is going on with our margins going forward. The interesting part of the revenue per req calculation is that it is an interesting aggregation of a lot of different aspects of our business. We do provide visibility on what we call our price erosion where we try to freeze all variables and say what is the real price change year on year related to commercial contracts and what we are getting from CMS. And that is one aspect. As you know, there is other aspects. There is payer mix, there is business mix, there is geographic mix. You put that all together, so when you look at revenue per req you get some \u2013 you can draw some conclusions that aren't necessarily the conclusions that are quite clear directly related to margins. You can actually have a high revenue direct business that has low margins and you can have a lower revenue per req business that has high margins. And so it is an industry metric that we have used and there is a lot of variables within it and we have seen a decline in it, but I think going forward, as we think about describing where we are going to get our margin lift, we also need to talk about the real margins embedded in a variety of businesses, geographies, payers as we go forward. Mark, would you like to share any more around that? Mark J. Guinan: I think you have captured it well Steve, which I understand why revenue per req is used as a proxy for profitability and margin, but to Steve's point, it is not true in all cases and actually, as we have talked about some of the mix impact, that should not be deemed to be a hit to profitability. We have done some acquisitions in the past, including one about a year ago, that had a lower revenue per req but is quite profitable. Again, I know you guys have less than perfect information but don't always take revenue per req, either an increase or a decrease, as necessarily an indicator of an increase or decrease in profitability. There is more to it than that. Nicholas M. Jansen \u2013 Raymond James & Associates:  Thanks for the details guys. Stephen H. Rusckowski: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from Amanda Murphy. Thank you, Ms. Murphy, your line is open/ Amanda L. Murphy \u2013 William Blair & Company LLC :  Hey, good morning, guys. I just had a follow-up to something you mentioned earlier on the pathology side. So I\u2019m just curious; it sounds like maybe that is becoming a benefit for you just given some of the reimbursement challenges there. So, I guess I'm curious, just given the exposure you have to AmeriPath, is that something that could become a more meaningful tailwind for you going forward? And then just how are you thinking about that market from an M&A perspective now? Stephen H. Rusckowski: Thanks for the question. First of all, with all the reimbursement cuts that we saw last year in pathology we have gotten a lot of questions about does this help you. And I would say this : we haven't seen a meaningful change in hospitals systems thinking about potentially outsourcing or redirecting some of their work. Second is, we do characterize our Pap volumes as part of our AP business and pathology business. As you know, Pap continues to decline. I mentioned that as part of the offset to some nice growth we saw in some product categories and categories of our testing. So Paps, given the guideline changes, continue to decline. We haven\u2019t bottomed out yet in terms of Pap volumes based upon the new cycling of when those exams should happen. So I would say, Amanda, overall we haven\u2019t seen anything meaningful yet but we are watching it because the reimbursement changes were significant. It is a clearly different business and it is in the area that we do see and we expect nice growth, which is in our whole oncology and clinical franchise. And so, therefore, in the future there will be more volume related to the tissue business and we expect that that would be a nice opportunity for us to take advantage. But the example that we brought up brought up of working with Memorial Sloan Kettering is a great example. We are trying to leverage our presence in pathology, leverage that over to genetics and also molecular diagnostics to really have an effect on oncology and cancer care. And we think that is promising as we go forward, but in the short run we haven\u2019t seen a notable change. Amanda Murphy \u2013 William Blair & Company: Got it, okay. And then just a question on the Medicare side. Obviously there is a lot of uncertainty just in terms of how they might implement the private-pay side of things going forward, and you mentioned a bit about this. But how do you think about this in terms of how it impacts Quest and the larger labs? What are the puts and takes there and how should we \u2013 I guess what should we be looking for from an investor perspective about how you guys might be positioned long-term in Medicare reimbursement? Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes, right in the middle of what we are calling \u2013 what they call the rule-making process. And I will share will share with you the trade association that I am now the chair of is actively engaged in this, so I will tell you my colleagues that sit on the Board with me are also very active engaging in this, I feel very good about we are doing as a trade association to make sure that we are quite involved and how they will eventually develop which will be a median market-based price approach to the clinical lab fee schedule. So rule-making is happening as we speak. They eventually do the sampling in 2016 to reevaluate codes in 2017. To support this as a trade association we actually had a third-party do a sampling of the marketplace, which goes back to the wide variation we have around prices in this industry. In fact, what we showed for a variety of codes that CMS pays for, but if you look at the wide variation they include hospital outreach, which is the highest price, and then you have large nationals, like ourselves, which are, in most cases, some of the lowest prices have best value in this industry. CMS is actually in the middle of the fairway from that early sample that we did. So we have to do the rule-making first. We want to make sure we have a representative sample of the market which will include large players like ourselves at our nearest competitor. Second is regional players, and then finally outreach. And we have had public hearings on this. We are doing our fair share of lobbing to make sure that we approach it with realistic pragmatic sampling technique that has a true representative sample of the market, and that will gather that data. In some cases, yes there might be some market adjustments done, we don\u2019t until we get the data but actually in some case we believe that we are under reimbursed by CMS, and that\u2019s the facts demonstrate this. There might be some modest increases as well. So we are in the middle of the process we feel good about that we are going to make sure it\u2019s done in the right way or trying to help CMS come up at the right approach. We will get the sampling done in 2016 and then we will see how that affects the clinical lab fee schedule in 2017. So that\u2019s where we are? But we are on top of it and we think its good approach that were active engaged. Amanda L. Murphy \u2013 William Blair & Company LLC :  Okay, thanks very much. Stephen H. Rusckowski:  Thanks.

Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the express written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. Now I would like to introduce Dan Haemmerle, Executive Director of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead, please. Dan Haemmerle : Thank you and good morning. I\u2019m here with Steve Rusckowski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and also discuss non-GAAP measures. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include but are not limited to, those described in Quest Diagnostics' 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. A copy of our earnings press release is available and the text of our prepared remarks will be available later today, in the Investor Relations 'quarterly updates' section of our Web site at www.questdiagnostics.com. A PowerPoint presentation and spreadsheet with our results and supplemental analysis are also available on the Web site. Now, here is Steve Rusckowski. Stephen Rusckowski : Thanks, Dan, and thanks everyone for joining us today. This morning I will provide you with highlights of the quarter. We will share industry trends and also review progress we are making against our five-point strategy. Then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through guidance. During the third quarter we delivered against our expectations. Continued to make progress against our strategy and reported top and bottom line growth. In the quarter, revenues grew 6.5% to $1.9 billion. Adjusted EPS increased 8% to $1.10 and cash from operations was strong at $271 million. What I would like to do is start with some brief comments on industry trends. We have said, diagnostic information is a powerful lever for transforming healthcare and we are determined to be paid appropriate for the value we provide. In this respect our trade association has been getting the message out about the value of diagnostic information to healthcare. We are making progress as an industry but the reimbursement dynamics continue to evolve and there is much more to do. To give you an example, in July, Tricare announced it had committed to restoring payment for 40 molecular codes that had previously been denied in some cases. During the third quarter, we saw progress of payment on codes that previously had been denied. This is a nice sign of progress we are making as an industry. Also in April, Congress passed the so called Doc Fix legislation that delayed adjustments to the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule until 2017. We have been working with our industry trade association to participate in a rule making process. This will define new rates based on a market weighted median of commercial rates from a broad range of labs which include both large and small independent labs as well as hospital outreach labs. We remain hopeful that this will produce a representative view of market\u2010based pricing. Being appropriately reimbursed for the value we provide is critical to our success and we compete on a compelling value proposition, not solely on price. Also, we continue to work closely with our trade association on another important issue. And that is to oppose the FDA\u2019s proposal to regulate laboratory developed tests, referred to as LDTs. We strongly believe that unnecessary and duplicative regulation could delay patient access to life saving treatments and compromise America\u2019s leadership in diagnostic discovery. Regarding the Affordable Care Act, while it\u2019s still early, we continued to see modest shifts from uninsured patient volumes in the third quarter to government and other payers. Regarding the market dynamics, we saw additional signs of improvement in healthcare utilization during the quarter. And then finally, we will provide you an update on our views on the market and the competitive landscape at our Investor Day in New York City on November 5th. Now let\u2019s look at the progress we\u2019re making executing our five point strategy. Our top priority is restoring growth and we again made solid progress in the quarter. The investments we\u2019ve made and efforts to improve our sales effectiveness are yielding positive results. We saw continued improvement in sequential trends in revenues, organic volume and organic price. If we exclude business we walked away from, organic revenues would be favorable. Revenues showed strong growth in several product categories driven by our clinical franchises, which included prescription drug monitoring, health and wellness, and infectious disease. Last quarter we told you about the partnership with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Our plans were to provide annotated reports on solid tumor analysis based on a panel of 34 clinically actionable gene mutations. We launched those expanded OncoVantage panels during the third quarter. Solid tumor cancers account for about 90% of all cancers diagnosed in the United States every year. Also, as promised, we began to offer our customers national access to Sequenom\u2019s non\u2010invasive prenatal test. And we continue to build our professional lab services business and finalized yet another agreement with a medium sized community hospital on the East Coast. We are making good progress advancing conversations from our pipeline into proposals and new business. These are all great examples of how we are empowering better health with diagnostic insights to make this a better world. We are also making progress on other key areas of our strategy. We made a number of advances in our effort to improve our customer experience by driving operational excellence. We opened our lab of the future in Marlborough, Massachusetts, which will use advanced automation technology to improve the quality and efficiency of diagnostic testing for the New England market. The Invigorate program remains on track to deliver the expected cost savings this year. As you know, the company shared an initial target of $500 million in July of 2011. Since then, we have increased that target to $600 million. Delivered the original target a year earlier, and now expect to exceed the new run rate target by delivering $700 million in run rate savings as we exit 2014. Over the past year, we have been advising you that we will update our future plans for Invigorate at Investor Day. We intend to deliver on that commitment and we will provide you with additional details on our plans to deliver total run rate savings in excess of $1 billion. In addition, we made progress integrating recent acquisitions. We told you that Solstas and Summit were expected to be dilutive for the first half of 2014 but accretive in the back half as we work through our integration plans. We are pleased with the progress we have made realizing the expected synergies. I\u2019m happy to report that these acquisitions as well as Steward and ConVerge, were all accretive on an adjusted basis during the quarter. The third element of our strategy is to simplify the organization to enable our top priorities of growth and operational excellence. Our simplify strategy extends well beyond our organizational redesign to also include improving our organizational capabilities, culture and processes. We continue to strengthen the management team and build a high performance culture. And we have also continued to strengthen our board. Recently, the board elected Dr. Jeffrey Leiden as our newest Director. He currently serves as Chairman, CEO and President of Vertex Pharmaceuticals. Jeff is the third new board member added this year with significant CEO experience. Coupling this with his deep management, scientific and clinical background in healthcare, this will strengthen and complement our board\u2019s capabilities. Finally, we continue to deliver disciplined capital deployment and refocus on our core diagnostic information services business. We generated $271 million in cash from operations during the quarter. We utilized that strong cash flow performance to return value to our shareholders through dividends and stock buyback program and to repay debt associated with the Solstas transaction. As you can see, we continued to make progress executing our five point strategy. Now, Mark will provide an overview of our third quarter financial performance and update you on our latest guidance details. Mark? Mark Guinan : Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues. Consolidated revenues of $1.9 billion were 6.5% ahead of the prior year. Excluding acquisitions and the divestiture of the Enterix business last year, our underlying consolidated revenues were essentially flat to the prior year, reflecting another sequential step forward in our path to restoring growth. Our diagnostic information services revenues, which account for over 90% of total revenues, grew by 7.1% compared to the prior year. Revenue per requisition in Q3 was 60 basis points lower than the prior year. Excluding the effect of acquisitions, revenue per requisition was slightly favorable versus the prior year, and improved sequentially from the second quarter of 2014. Compared to a year ago, price pressure continued to moderate and we benefited from favorable test mix. Volume for the quarter was 7.8% favorable to the prior year. Recent acquisitions added approximately 8% to volumes. Last quarter, I shared that we had made prudent decisions regarding pricing and in some cases decided to walk away from existing business. Excluding the impact on revenue from these decisions, our underlying volumes were favorable to the prior year by approximately 1.5% and represents another quarter of sequential improvement in year-over-year volume growth. Q3 revenues in our diagnostic solutions businesses which include risk assessment, clinical trials testing, healthcare IT and our remaining products businesses, were lower by about 70 basis points compared to the prior year. The divestiture of Enterix reduced revenues for our diagnostic solutions businesses by nearly 2%. Excluding this impact, our diagnostic solutions businesses grew by approximately 1% compared to the third quarter of a year ago. Adjusted operating income at 16% of revenues was about 50 basis points below the prior year, with the decrease due principally to the increased funding of management compensation compared to a year ago and the initial lower margin profile on our recent acquisitions. Earlier this year we shared with you that we expected the Summit and Solstas acquisitions to be dilutive in the first half of the year and accretive in the back half of the year. I am happy to report that these acquisitions were accretive in the third quarter on an adjusted basis as we made nice progress on those integration plans. In addition to delivering on our integration plans, we continued to make progress on our Invigorate program. We continue to expect to achieve approximately $200 million in realized savings during 2014 and approach approximately $700 million in run rate savings as we exit the year, with a longer term goal of greater than $1 billion over time. As I shared last quarter, we will provide additional details at our Investor Day in November. Adjusted EPS of $1.10 was 7.8% better than a year ago. As a result of the company\u2019s ongoing efforts to restore growth, drive operational excellence and simplify the organization, reported operating income was reduced by $48 million, principally related to restructuring and integration costs. This reduced reported operating income as a percentage of revenues by 2.6% and reported EPS by $0.22. Last year\u2019s third quarter reported operating income from continuing operations included the gain on the sale of Ibrutinib royalty rights, the loss on sale of the Enterix business and restructuring and integration costs. These items resulted in a net benefit to reported operating income of $395 million or $1.64 per diluted share. Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 4%, essentially unchanged from the prior quarter and an increase of 40 basis points from the prior year. Our DSOs were 46 days, a 1 day improvement from last quarter. Cash from operations was $271 million in the quarter compared to $186 million in the prior year. Capital expenditures were $102 million in the quarter compared to $51 million a year ago. During the quarter we repurchased $25 million of our common shares at an average price of $62.03. We plan to meet our capital deployment commitments for the year by returning the majority of our free cash flow to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. We also made progress against our debt repayment commitment by reducing our debt by approximately $90 million in the quarter. Turning to guidance. We now expect full year 2014 results from continuing operations, before special items, as follows. Revenues to grow approximately 3.5% compared to a year ago versus 2.5% to 3.5% previously. Adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $4.03 and $4.07 compared to previous guidance of $4.00 and $4.10. Cash provided by operations to approximate $900 million and capital expenditures to approximate $300 million. Now I\u2019ll turn it back to Steve. Stephen Rusckowski : Thanks, Mark. Mark, if I recall correctly, about a year ago you joined Quest. And actually a year ago on this call you shared several priorities. And those priorities included improving our predictability and supporting the business to achieve our five point strategy. Just as we are making progress on our five point strategy, we are also making progress on our commitment to improve our guidance and deliver on our commitments. Well, to summarize. We delivered a second solid quarter of top line growth as we continue to build momentum. We made good progress executing our strategy and our Invigorate program remains firmly on track. As a result, we delivered 8% earnings per share growth and we are on track to meet our commitments for 2014. And then finally, I would like to share, I look forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming Investor Day where we will provide some longer term perspective and deeper updates on our strategic plan. Now, we would be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Ricky Goldwasser. Sir, your line is open. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley : First, a quick question on the volume number. Mark, you talked about 1.5% organic volume figure for the quarter which I think is the best number that you have done for a very long time. So can you just share with us, where are the volumes coming from? Are you seeing it from exchange population, Medicaid population, or are you starting to see improvement in core business utilization? And also just kind of the margins that are associated with the new business. Mark Guinan : Thanks for the question Ricky. Couple of things. First off, organic volume was pretty flat year-over-year. What I talked about is, there were a couple of specific accounts that we had made a decision based on pricing to walk away from, earlier in the year. And what I said is, if you exclude those then that volume would have been up 1.5%. But nonetheless, I think the important message is that organic volume trends continue to improve. And when we started in the beginning of 2013, minus 200 basis points, since then we have crossed the threshold to less than 100 basis points of decline. And now essentially organic volume has been flat in the most recent quarters. So there is an improving trend. Where is that coming from? I think it's somewhat across the board by payer type. We did say there was some reduction in the uninsured. We had continued to see some modest growth in Medicaid. However, it's really in some of the growth past our franchises that we have talked about before. So PDM continues to be an area of strength. Hepatitis C continues to be an area of strength. Obviously, we have launched our BRCA offering which is growing. So it's no single payer. I couldn\u2019t certainly attribute it specifically to anything in the Affordable Care Act. Although, certainly it seems like it\u2019s directionally positive. So that\u2019s what I would say is, it's continued growth in the areas that have been growing and just utilization picking up a little bit and then I think just our business gaining strength. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley : Okay. And just kind of like, one follow-up there. Obviously, I think last quarter you said that the impact on volume, once you normalize from the businesses you exit was about 1%. It seems like it is 1.5% now. So is this a function of you exiting additional accounts, or is this just kind of like an impact of a full quarter of the same existing business that you have exited last quarter? Mark Guinan : It's the same account. It's not additional accounts. So it's really just the impact in this quarter was a little larger than the impact in the previous quarter, given the timing. Stephen Rusckowski : What you see though as you said it, is as we\u2019ve said consistently, we are going to move step-by-step improving our underlying business. And you see some underlying improvement in the third quarter versus Q2. So we feel good about that. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Glen Santangelo. Sir, your line is open. Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse : Steve, just wanted to follow up with you on some of the pricing comments that you made. It seems like the company also experienced a sequential improvement in organic pricing trends. And so I am wondering if you could just maybe give us a little bit more color and clarity around what you are seeing in terms of Medicaid pricing? Any big commercial contracts coming up or what's really driven that slightly better organic pricing number? Stephen Rusckowski : Yes, sure. Thanks, Glen. If you go back to 2012, we have been consistently talking about this. We provided guidance that over a three-year period we expected real price, and when we say real price it\u2019s really freezing other variables and just looking at unit price changes with contracts and Medicare, Medicaid reimbursement, would be reduced by 1% to 2%. It was higher in 2013. And then what we also said is, we believe it's going to be lower this year into 2015. And we actually believe we are on track to achieve that guidance we provided. In that respect, we are seeing lower year-on-year comparisons on pricing, sequential year-on-year comparisons in price. Contractually, we have the visibility of this. We don\u2019t have any major renewals coming forward. We already shared with you the effect of the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule on our price this year, which was about 1.75% this year. And then also what we see overall if you look at revenue per req, is a mix in our business. So when you go through that mix in our business which is different than what we talk about with price, this quarter and even compared to Q2 we saw a richer mix which generated revenue per req which was favorable. So, Mark, I don\u2019t know if you would like to add to any of that. Mark Guinan : Yes. I think Steve covered it. We said in the first quarter price was down about 100 basis points and second quarter about 80 basis points, and this quarter was down about 30. I think it's a combination of the timing of contracts being more disciplined but also, quite frankly, putting more rigor into our pricing efforts across the organization on things such as client bill negotiations and things like that. So I think as an organization we have really instilled a greater discipline around price and obviously we are also benefitting from the timing of contracts that we didn\u2019t benefit from in 2013. And then to Steve's mention of revenue per req, when you exclude the impact of acquisition mix as I said, revenue per req was actually up and so it was some slight price decline offset by some favorable tests and payer mix. Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse : And maybe if I could just follow up with one sort of longer-term question on pricing. Obviously, a lot of questions around 2017 and the potential changes to the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule. And I think, Steve, you commented on some of the lobbying efforts that are going on. Could you maybe give us some of your initial reactions with maybe how you see market pricing being defined by the regulations and who is included and who is excluded in that sort of market price? And are you sort of happy with the direction that\u2019s heading as obviously it's going to have some impact on your business and I am just curious if there is any comments to kind of make, initial comments to make at this point. Thank you. Stephen Rusckowski : Glen, I appreciate that. Well, as I said, we are working hard as a trade association. We are all working on this because it's very important. First of all, we are working with CMS on the rule making process to make sure we get it right. And as a matter of fact a couple of weeks ago we were visiting CMS and we were talking through how they will gather the data. You cannot get a full view of the market without all the competitors in the market. And as I said in my introductory comments, that includes large independent labs like ourselves, smaller independents and hospital outreach. We have been consistent on that and we are trying to work through just how we will collect the data from all those three pieces to get a real representative view on the market. As you know, there is wide variation in pricing and actually we provided in the market from the trade association, a quick snapshot on what we believe the true market-based pricing would be by certain codes we did a sample on. And we look at that actually, the CMS prices are not widely out of line from the median that we had sought on the market in that survey. So we will continue to work through the rule making process. They will gather the data in 2016. And Glen, until you gather the data you do not know what the results are. But if we have a thorough process, a good process and we really gather the data to really get a market-based price, we believe that the outcome will be the outcome but it's not nearly as bad as what some people have intended. But we have got some work in front of us to keep on working on this to get it right in the process and gather the data correctly and correctly represent that in the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Mike Cherny. Sir, your line is open. Michael Cherny - ISI Group : So I want to delve a little bit more into some of the commentary you had around the business that you walked away from. As you think about, I think you did this on pretty much contract by contract basis, but what are some of the metrics specifically? I assume it's not just price or just margin. I mean how much of it is impacted by the return you got from the businesses. Maybe walk through some of the financial metrics that will cause you to say that this contract or this business is no longer for us. Stephen Rusckowski : Let me start and then I'm going to turn it to Mark. First of all, we're trying to build value as you would expect we would. And in building value we're trying to make sure that we drive earnings per share growth which you saw this quarter. And in that regard there is lots of levers and one of which is price. And in our portfolio of our clients and our customers, and we have a wide range of customers and clients. And so what we have done in executing our plans is to take a careful look at all the business we do and to make sure we keep on getting as much value out of those accounts as possible. So some of this I would describe it as hygiene to keep on working through our portfolio of businesses and some of the actions we have taken have helped us improve our margins and you see that reflected in this quarter's results. But, Mark, why don't you add to that, specifically what have we adjusted for to get to 1.5% growth, when we adjust for these decisions we have made. Mark Guinan : Yes, I think even Michael was asking also about the decision criteria. So, yes, obviously the margin is a significant driver in the decision which of course is the outcome of price, with some variables depending on where the geographic location for that business is and therefore what are the other costs associated with it, such as logistics and so on and so forth. What does the book of business look like in terms of the test mix and the payer mix. So there is a number of things that go into it. Pricing is the biggest driver in that margin decision but there are some cost variables as well that we look at. I think the importance here in why we decided to share it was we wanted to send the message that not all volume is value creating volume and we are focused on value creating volume. And there is also some competitors in the marketplace that compete on price, that is not us. And to the extent that we find ourselves in situations where the price is not rational, we are going to walk away and we are going to stick with our strategy. So that's really why we decided to share this. It's not as much about in some way modeling a organic volume and suggesting it's different than what the actual results are, but helping people understand that volume alone is not going to give you margin and growth, your bottom line and your cash flow, but it's got to be value creating volume. Michael Cherny - ISI Group : Thanks. And then just one quick question or quick thought on some of these hospital outsource arrangements. So obviously a new opportunity for you. Can you talk about how some of those conversations evolve? You talked about the midsized hospital on the East Coast. What led them to decide to work with you and then over time what type of capacity you have to add on incremental types of these contracts? Stephen Rusckowski : Yes. It comes to us in a lot of different ways, Mike. First of all, we have a sales force that's selling to about 50% of the hospitals. So we have good presence in all the hospital systems throughout the United States with our sales force. Second is, we have very good executive access. And when we talk about this as part of our strategy, we have garnered a lot of interest from hospital executives. And quite often myself and a few of the leaders on this business are spending time discussing with hospital CEOs and typically there CFO, what their lab strategy is. And like so much in healthcare, you see one then you see one. And so we sit down and we have a conversation about our lab strategy and we talk about the whole range of possibilities of different working relationships, where we can do reference work, we could buy your outreach business, we can form a joint venture. We can run your hospital laboratory, which we call laboratory management. And we eventually end up with a place that is tailored to what they are trying to achieve in their system. And so the contracts and engagements we have announced, all are very different, all are quite different. And I could tell you that some are small community hospitals and some discussions that we are having are large, very large integrated delivery systems that are substantially re-engineering what they are doing in healthcare. And as part of that they are thinking about where they put their resources and what's the best approach to laboratory services. And in that respect we are generally thought of as a trusted partner and we could help them with that. So that\u2019s the way we approach it. Mark Guinan : And I just want to add, Mike, just to be clear. When you ask about capacity, certainly a lot of these deals come with reference work. So we may have been doing the reference work or we may be getting the reference work. But in many cases we are actually managing their work for us. So it's not additional strain on our lab capacity. It's actually our capabilities to help them run their lab better together with our procurement leverage, is really where the value creation comes from. So it's not bringing all their in-house testing into the walls of our laboratory. It's actually running their lab for them with their people. Michael Cherny - ISI Group : No, that\u2019s very helpful. Stephen Rusckowski : Just to add to that. When we have a large hospital laboratory management deal, what we arrive at is an opportunity for them to save somewhere in the neighborhood of 10% to 15% on their hospital based laboratory cost. And one potential strategy we deploy to get there is we take a portion of their menu and we actually move it to our geographic laboratory in the system. The more high volume oriented portion of their menu where we could still respond in an adequate way to meet the requirements of running their hospital. And so it's good for us because as you know most of our laboratories are really in full force starting at midnight to 8 o'clock in the morning. And so during the day we actually have a lot of capacity idle and so it's an opportunity for us to use that capacity to help with this portion of our business. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from David Clair. Sir, your line is open. David Clair - Piper Jaffray : I guess the first one from me, just wondering, you spoke about the FDA regulation of LDTs. So just curious, what your exposure there is and what do you think the cost would be to push these through for approval? Stephen Rusckowski : Well, first of all as you all know, we are already regulated. So we already meet the requirements of CLIA. So we have already have oversight. And so the question that we all have as an industry is, why do we need more and some portion of this would be redundant with what we are already meeting. And so there is a concern about how these two (indiscernible) as we go forward. And frankly the proposal in the language has been silent on that topic. Second is, in essence, what the language would say is that LDTs are devices, medical devices. And when you meet the regs of medical devices, there are substantial changes in getting regulatory approval for new products and also having a quality system that meet those regs. We haven't provided the size of that for labs like ourselves but it's not insignificant. And there's two parts again. There is one getting a new product to the marketplace and new solution to the marketplace and then second is, running your operation on a day to day basis. Our concern, particularly when new innovation comes to the marketplace is, what it would take for us to bring new innovation. Particularly in the case where some laboratory developed tests may require a PMA for approval and that\u2019s a lengthy drawn up process. Where today we believe we can with good data, support that our LDTs we introduce to the marketplace are safe and efficacious and therefore do not require what a device manufacture would need, and that\u2019s our position on it. So we haven't sized it. We haven't provided it. But it is substantial. There is concern about the redundancy that we would have in this industry. And what we would like to do is to understand what we can do to bring these points forward as a trade association and we are doing that. David Clair - Piper Jaffray : Okay. Thanks for that. And then I was just hoping that we could get a quick update on some of the women's health products. So specifically, Pap volumes, BRCAvantage and IPT? Stephen Rusckowski : Sure. Mark mentioned where we are getting some of our growth. Well, BRCA continues to grow. We are seeing nice sequential pickup in our offering in the marketplace. As you know, that\u2019s a big market and a market that\u2019s still growing and we are starting to gain some share. So we feel good about progress made there. In non-invasive prenatal testing, we talked about our introduction of Sequenom's solution in the marketplace. We are seeing nice growth in that market. And as far as Pap is concerned, we continue to see the slowdown of volumes quarter on quarter until we get to some normal steady state of volumes given the new clinical guidelines that are out there in the marketplace. So we still haven't quite bottomed out there yet. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Bryan Brokmeier. Sir, your line is open. Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group : Steve, you said that you saw a richer mix of business. Was any of that mix onetime in nature? Was it a trend of higher priced tests that you expect to continue? I assme the BRCA test is one positive factor there that should continue but are there others? Stephen Rusckowski : Yes. So if you look at some of the growth we talked about, most of the products we are introducing in our clinical franchise is our new solutions that have higher prices. And so therefore if you look at the mix going forward, you should see some effect for that on a continual basis. So that\u2019s some of it. Second is, we did say that the acquisitions that we brought into the sector are revenue per req, and if you adjust for that we actually saw the improvement year-on-year. But there is nothing here that was one big one off if you will, if that\u2019s what you are asking, that won't continue going forward. Mark, you will like to add to that? Mark Guinan : Yes. Just to add to that. Steve talked about the fact that we had actually Tricare payments. But as we have said before, and I will confirm, it's not material. So it's good to see that. That\u2019s a positive sign. But that was not an extraordinary catch up. It's not significant in terms of our overall revenue but still nice to see. So absolutely not. This is really where the business is trending. There is nothing unusual and actually we would expect to see more growth in those higher value hence higher priced areas and favorable mix going forward. The one exception is, we've talked about our laboratory professional services does have a lower revenue per req. So obviously depending on the timing of some of those deals, that could have a mix impact that goes the other direction. But as we have also stated that despite the lower margins, those are very attractive from a return on invested capital perspective. So still very value creating. Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group : Okay. And the unprofitable business that you walked away from, were these contracts that you had to terminate, were you able to renegotiate terms and similar agreements that you ended up not terminating? And are there more of these that you may walk away from in the current quarter or in the 2015? Mark Guinan : Yes. What I would say is, as Steve mentioned, we did some hygiene work. So we looked across our portfolio and we looked at some specific books of business that we didn\u2019t think were creating acceptable value. We engaged with those parties around some pricing discussions, weren't able to come to a reasonable outcome in our onion. And that was kind of a discrete exercise which I would call a portfolio rationalization. As we go forward, we are going to have the same discipline in any new offerings, any renegotiations etc. etc. So there always could be, for the same reason, account that we walk away from because we say, hey, given your pricing position and the competitive price environment, this just doesn't make sense for us. However, I don't want anyone to think that there is going to be regular rhythm of exiting accounts. This was really kind of a refresh of our portfolio and that\u2019s we have taken the time to talk about it. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Darren Lehrich. Sir, your line is open. Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank : So I just wanted to come back to the margin topic. It sounds like you clearly exited some unprofitable business that accelerated in the third quarter. And then Mark you are describing a little bit of a pick up from Tricare and I think you said in your prepared remarks that the deals were accretive in the second half versus dilutive. So when we look at margins down year-over-year and sort of a stable pricing environment and some of the things you are describing. What are some of the other factors at play with margin? Is it the mix of your hospital management business? Maybe just help us think about the margin decline year-over-year despite, I guess, some of the things you have described in the exited businesses which were a drag. Mark Guinan : So obviously, Darren, margin is our total enterprise and when you look at despite the fact that the acquisitions were accretive, they are not yet to the margins of the ongoing organic business. So from a mix perspective year-over-year since we didn\u2019t have those books of business, there is some negative mix impact. We also reference the fact that, we have talked several times about the fact that management incentive comp would be a headwind this year because last year we didn\u2019t pay out anywhere near the target and we are still accruing and hoping and expecting to pay out more to that target. So that\u2019s a headwind as well. And then we have talked about inflation. But with the $200 million we are getting from Invigorate, largely those two things, the inflation and the management comp, should be offset. So really what you are looking at here largely is a combination of the mix impact of the new book of business we have and then bad debt was up 40 basis points year-over-year. And I would really say, those are really the contributors to that decline. So we feel good about the margin going forward, the margin profile. Certainly also as you mentioned, some of these laboratory professional services which were really just starting to ramp up, initially just like an acquisition those margins are now or they are going to be in the long run because there is things to do to get those operationally to their long term margin. So it's a lot of different pieces but we feel good about generally where our margin is heading. Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank : Okay. No, that's helpful. And then just remind us, again the management incentive comp, the year-over-year impact on margin from that? Mark Guinan : We haven't quantified it. But typically we said, hey, and previously if we get about $200 million of Invigorate savings, when you add merit inflation and I guess SWB inflation and the management comp, we had a big chunk of that was going to be taken up for both of those items. So it's not insignificant. Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank : Okay. And then my follow-up here is just, as it relates to like your pathology. You mentioned some modest success with Tricare. We have been hearing that still a lot of the State Medicaid programs are challenging in terms of getting paid for molecular pathology. So how much is still out there in terms of what was denied and can you just give us a brief update on how you are seeing the progress with some of the state programs. Stephen Rusckowski : Dan, why don't you take that one? Dan Haemmerle : Yes, Darren, we have said in the past the total molecular coding impact for us when you look at the umbrella of tests we're looking at, represented about 5% of consolidated revenues. That puts an umbrella over the entire amount. When you look at this and that 5% across all payers, okay, commercial payers, government payers, etc., we continue to work through this with all the payers, commercial payers as well as government. And on the Medicaid program, that's state by state and its code by code. So we are engaging in different discussions in different states and a different levels of success. We spoke to one state last year that had overturned their position and started to reimburse on a particular code late in last year. So there was a positive sign there. Other states have been more challenged to move the bar with that. But it's something we continue to work on and we look at. The state we reference last year, we look at the Tricare scenario here that we talked about earlier today, is two good proof points and we will continue to work the issue one payer at a time. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Isaac Ro. Sir, your line is open. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs : Just wanted to a question about fourth quarter seasonality. You know we have seen an uptick in healthcare utilization across the board, I think in the fourth quarter for the last few years. And I'm wondering if your guidance for the rest of the year assumes that that trend will continue or perhaps increase this fourth quarter. Stephen Rusckowski : Mark, why don't you take a [shot at] (ph) seasonality we see in Q4 typically? Mark Guinan : Yes. Obviously, when we model any given quarter, we model the year, we take into account historical performance. So any sort of seasonality we may or may not have seen would be one of the basis for our forecast. So I don't think we are expecting any significant deviation from our quarterly pattern. So really what's driving Q4 is where we see the business trending, both in terms of some of the growth areas, some of the areas that may be a little drag like Paps. And then things like potential for laboratory professional service in fields and so on and so forth. So we are expecting a, I think as we get into this time of year, a average weather month. So we certainly have built in, based on history, some sort of weather impact. But nothing extraordinarily good or nothing extraordinarily bad at this point. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs : If I could just scratch you a little bit there. I mean what is different this year then of course the enrollment for ACA and all that is changing. Deductibles and cost burdens and so forth. So there is plenty of reason to think that people might be deferring utilization till the end of the year and all that. So I am just curious, as you think about forecasting, that was a meaningful change to your process? Mark Guinan : That certainly, I think could be within the trends we have already seen from the third quarter, some of that. Maybe more pronounced in Q4, given, hey, I got a procedure better I do it in December than January. Is it material enough at this point? Is it materially different enough from what it has been historically? Don\u2019t know. We have not certainly built anything that\u2019s a major shift change. So, yes, I think that dynamic has always existed with people that have high deductible plans and certainly the trend has been more and more private plans as well have a high deductible feature. So we have not assumed any major impact from the Affordable Care Act that will kind of skew fourth quarter. And if it's upside, we will be pleasantly pleased as much as anybody else. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Amanda Murphy. Ma'am, your line is open. Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company: I just had a follow-up on the PMA discussion. So in terms of the inclusion or exclusion of hospitals, do you have a sense of how CMS is looking at some of the new bundling legislation that they have proposed for 2015 as part of [hops] (ph)? Does that meaningfully impact who from a hospital perspective may or may not be included in who is providing data for the 2017 pricing? Stephen Rusckowski : Yes. It's a good question, Amanda. Bundled payments in hospital in-patient obviously is a cost for hospitals and therefore when you think about their revenues, as a matter of fact if you look at the language that was in the bill, it says the majority of their Medicare revenues are from the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule. And if you are running a hospital outreach, that\u2019s the majority of your lab revenues to Medicare therefore they should be included. So the bundle side and the in-patient DRG side of hospital in-patient laboratories is part of the cost of doing business of running that hospital. And really what we are looking at is that outreach portion of that should be included because that is the market as we all know. Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company: And is that still roughly about a third of the hospital market. I think that\u2019s what the data suggested historically in terms of just outreach. Stephen Rusckowski : It depends on what -- but if you look at the market, it's roughly about 40% of the total market, this hospital outreach. Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company: Okay. Stephen Rusckowski : The total market. And the rest is independent laboratories, big and small. Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company: Got it. And then on the molecular, the Tricare and the low Pap pricing situation. I don\u2019t know if I am -- maybe this is a bit of wishful thinking, but have you guys got any sense of whether you might get anything from a retroactive perspective at this point? Stephen Rusckowski : Mark, you want to take that? Mark Guinan : Yes. I don\u2019t. I think we have been pretty consistent and we don\u2019t expect any major windfalls from retroactive reimbursement. So even on Tricare, we mentioned that we were getting paid for a portion of Tricare all along for the active military personal. Many of these were covered. It was really for the retirees of the family members. So it's not as if we are getting paid nothing. And so once in a while you may get a windfall, like in 2013 we mentioned there was one state that started reimbursing for cystic fibrosis and it went retroactively back to the beginning of the year. But still you are talking about small millions not anything in the tens of millions or anything that would be materially significant. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Robert Willoughby. Sir, your line is open. Robert Willoughby \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, Steve or Mark, just two quick ones. Can you comment at all on the Solstas revenue retention rate and possibly could you size the fuel opportunity year-over-year. What kind of benefit might you see there? Stephen Rusckowski : Yes. So first of all, we are pleased with the integration of Solstas, we said that in our introductory comments. We are working nicely through our integration work which we feel good about. As we mentioned, many of these acquisitions we justify the business case based upon cost synergies. And we are integrating Solstas nicely into our operation. We feel good about that. As we make the transition, we have integrated two separate sales forces into one. We feel good that that has happened in an orderly way and in general we are tracking to what our business plan was for that business so far. And as we said, it's accretive along with other acquisitions this quarter. So we feel good about that. And also in the back half we expect that to continue. So, Mark, anything you would like to add? Mark Guinan : No. I mean as Steve mentioned, we are tracking pretty much on our business case. And as we have shared in the past when we model these kind of acquisitions for conservatism, we do build in some level of attrition in each of these deals because despite of our best efforts to not lose any of those accounts, history has demonstrated that there are various reasons why you will get some attrition. So I would say, right now Bob, like Steve shared, we are pretty much on track to our business case. Robert Willoughby \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And the fuel? Mark Guinan : You mean fuel for growth in 2015? Robert Willoughby \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : No, I am sorry. Just gasoline prices being down, it's not a huge opportunity, but... Mark Guinan : Yes. I mean certainly that\u2019s better news than we would have thought six month ago or so. So, yes, we are still in the process, Bob, and obviously I am not going to talk about any guidance or anything else for 2015. We are still in the process of putting up plans together for 2015. But certainly that\u2019s a good tailwind at least for now since we have a large fleet and certainly that should be helpful. Robert Willoughby \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : We are talking pennies though not dimes, correct? Mark Guinan : Yes. Yes. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from A.J. Rice. Sir, your line is open. A.J. Rice \u2013 UBS Securities : First, just maybe quick, to ask you about your thoughts with respect to share repurchases. Obviously, last year was a year where you took in a lot of proceeds from asset sales and licensing agreements and this year has been one more characterized by acquisitions. Within the context of that, do you have any sort of way to articulate your view on -- update your view on share repurchase and how they fall out in the capital deployment mix? Stephen Rusckowski : Yes. Well, look, capital deployment commitment is the same. That is to return the majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders. We have been standing by that. And that will continue. You saw our purchases this quarter, Mark will give you an update on what we have done year-to-date. Also as you know, we feel like share repurchases were heavier in 2012 and 2013 and the acquisitions were heavier in '13. If you look at the two together, it's pretty consistent, pretty good weight based upon the two little heavier acquisitions where we took out the debt. But we stand behind our commitment of returning the majority of our free cash flow and we are tracking well against that and we saw a good cash flow this quarter to support that. So Mark? Mark Guinan : A.J., for this year, I talked about the need to delever, post the Solstas acquisition. As we mentioned, we paid down $90 million in the most recent quarter. So we do have a commitment to get down closer to the 2.5 rate from a spike of up to 3. We were at it post Summit acquisition. So we have been making it a priority to pay down debt. In terms of what we are going to be doing going forward at the investor day, I am going to talk a little bit about the philosophy and some potential outcomes in terms of paying down further debt or getting to that leverage ratio. And then obviously when we give guidance for 2015, I will get specifically around what our intents would be and... A.J. Rice \u2013 UBS Securities : Okay. And I guess at this point in the call, I'll take the bait and ask you the obligatory question about Theranos. Is there any update that you are seeing in their posture in the marketplace that you would want to share? And I know you've said from time to time you would be open to talking to them if they had any interest in talking to you about what they have and how you might work to collaborate. Any update in any of those areas? Stephen Rusckowski : No, A.J. No new news on what they are doing in the marketplace. Essentially they are running some pilots in a couple of locations. As a laboratory, again, what they have presented in the past to the market is some disruptive approach to some routinely provided diagnostics. If in fact they have a disruptive technology, we are all for it, listening about that. And one would hope that a company that had something like that would like to talk to one of the largest providers of diagnostic informational services. But no news to share on that other than what you have probably heard and we have said so far. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from Gary Taylor. Sir, your line is open. Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup: Most of my questions' answered, so I'll do just one quick one here and let you go. I wanted to talk about restructuring charges for a second and $48 million this quarter over $100 million year-to-date. I guess, presumably the fourth quarter has some assumption about $20 million-$30 million perhaps of excluded charges. I just wanted to understand, what's the glide path over the next couple years as your cost saving programs mature and come to fruition? Are we still looking at hundreds of millions of dollars of one timers to get to that or is there glide path for that diminishes maybe more quickly than that? Mark Guinan : Yes. So, Gary, I appreciate the question. Really not in a position to comment on the future at this moment. At the investor day we are going to talk about the next stage for Invigorate. And as part of that, we will lay out not just the benefits but also the required investment, both capital and expense. I do want to mention that the adjustments this quarter were not all restructuring. Certainly there was a significant integration and you could imagine with an acquisition the size of Solstas, as we have mentioned it typically takes 18 months to complete that integration. And you might imagine that the first six to nine months is where you have a significant amount of those integration onetime expenses. We did just open up our lab in Marlborough, Massachusetts and with that we are moving out of some other facilities. We did have some one timers there to get into that new facility. And then finally we did have some legal expenses, onetime legal expenses and those adjustments as well. So they are not all restructuring per say. I want to be clear. And there is not -- certainly you should not look at this quarter as kind of being a consistent representation of the kind of expenses that we will be adjusting out going forward. It really depends on all those different factors and what's going on in the business. Stephen Rusckowski : Any other questions? Okay, if not, as I said in my introductory comments, we had our second solid quarter of top line growth and we continue to build momentum. We are doing a good job executing against our strategy and we look forward to seeing many of you on our Investor Day on November 5th in New York City. So thank you all and talk to you soon.

I am here with Steve Rusckowski, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call we may make forward-looking statements and also discuss non-GAAP measures. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risk and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include but are not limited to those described in Quest Diagnostics 2013 annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Our earnings press release is available and the text of our prepared remarks will be available later today in the investor relations quarterly update section of our website at www.QuestDiagnostics.com. A PowerPoint presentation and spreadsheet with our results, supplemental analysis are also available on the website. Now here is Steve Rusckowski. Steve Rusckowski : Thanks, Dan, and thanks everyone for joining us today. This morning I will provide you with highlights of the quarter. We will share industry trends and also we will review our progress that we are making executing on our 5-point strategy. Then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through guidance. We continue to make progress on our path forward delivering solid revenue and EPS growth in the fourth quarter and the full year. In the quarter, revenues grew 7% to $1.9 billion, adjusted EPS increased 5% to $1.08 and cash from operations was strong at $303 million. For the full-year 2014, revenues grew 4% to $7.4 billion. Adjusted EPS increased 2.5% to $4.10 a share and we generated $938 million in cash. Our performance reflects improved execution and a stable business environment. That combined with our ability to generate substantial and predictable cash flow has enabled us to raise our quarterly dividend 15% to $0.38 a share. This is the fourth time we have raised the dividend since 2011. Before I get into our performance, I would like to talk about industry dynamics, specifically utilization, reimbursement and regulation. To start with in utilization, we continued to see signs of modest increase in utilization. We are encouraged by the progress on exchange enrollment as the result of the Affordable Care Act. During the fourth quarter, we continued to see stability in test volumes on what we are calling a same provider basis. On reimbursement, we will see less government pressure on the clinical lab fee schedule in 2015 than we have seen in the previous 2 years. At this time our industry is focused on effectively implementing the Doc Fix legislation also known as Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 or PAMA, which calls for an orderly review of the clinical lab fee schedule. Our industry trade association, the American Clinical Lab Association, ACLA, continues to work closely with the centers for Medicare and Medicaid services on the rulemaking process. We are hopeful the rulemaking process will be defined in 2015 and will establish an approach to building a representative view of the market. The market view that will be used to update the fee schedule should include participants from the entire market including large and small independent commercial labs, boutique labs as well as hospitals. The current timetable calls for data to be collected from the market participants in 2016 and any revisions to the fee schedule would therefore go in place no sooner than 2017. We will continue to update you on the progress as we know more in the coming year. Another important issue facing the industry is the FDA's proposal to extend regulatory oversight to laboratory developed tests. The American Clinical Lab Association is actively opposing the FDA's proposal and has engaged 2 highly respected experts in constitutional law in the administrative procedure, Laurence Tribe From Harvard Law School and Paul Clement, the former Solicitor General of the United States. The FDA's proposal is regulatory overreach at its worst and is bad for patients and the healthcare industry. For that reason, the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association and other leading healthcare providers have urged the FDA to withdraw its proposal. Now for an update on our performance. We continue to improve on our ability to execute the Company's 5-point strategy. As a reminder, our strategy is to restore growth, drive operational excellence, simplify the organization, refocus on the core diagnostic information services business and deliver disciplined capital deployment. Let's start with our highest priority, growth, and reviewing our progress. In 2014 we executed our strategy and restored growth. First, we improved our sales effectiveness on how we call on the market. As you have heard me say before, our go-to-market team is better led, better managed, better staffed, better trained, better equipped, better motivated compared to 2 years ago. We have seen continued improvement on our underlying revenue trends this year. In the fourth quarter, organic revenues grew 60 basis points versus last year. This is the first quarter of organic revenue growth since I joined the Company in May of 2012. Second, our professional lab services business has announced and implemented 6 new relationships in 2014 which are on track to deliver $40 million in annualized revenues. The most recent contract was finalized in the fourth quarter. Third, part of our improving performance is a result of our strategy to focus on esoteric testing through our clinical franchises. We saw sequential improvement in gene based and esoteric testing for the third consecutive quarter. Some specific tests that are growing faster are our BRCAdvantage breast cancer testing, noninvasive prenatal testing, and hepatitis C. I am also proud of a growing list of strategic partnerships with healthcare leaders that include Memorial Sloan-Kettering and the University of California San Francisco. In addition, we have continued to see notable growth in the quarter in prescription drug monitoring, wellness and infectious disease franchises. We are also making progress on some of the longer term goals to realize the promise of precision medicine and the value of our information assets. During Investor Day, we spoke about our new capabilities we are developing that leverage our connectivity solutions and build on Quest's strong history of healthcare IT innovation. We are developing tools that focus on population health as well as improving provider and patient engagement. I would like to say a few words about each of these. First in regards to population health, our Quest analytical tools will help health plans, ACOs, health systems and care coordinators identify clinical risk, target and close gaps in care, review performance from our clinical performance scorecard tools, monitor quality metrics and query patient test information using a new self-service capability that provides on-demand access to their patient data. We have actually seen strong interest in these tools from our customers and you will hear more about them over the course of 2015. In addition to population health tools, we are making progress delivering what we call interactive insights to providers and patients. Our interactive insights for providers deliver trended data, interactive features such as customizable reports and additional content such as videos and articles specific to specific conditions and diseases. In the back half of 2014, we launched pilots with providers in women's health and prescription drug monitoring. And then finally, about 1.3 million patients have engaged with our new MyQuest patient application which lets them access and control their own health information. The value of our information assets reaches well beyond our providers and patients. A good example of this is the recent commercial expansion of our relationship with the Centers for Disease Control to improve the surveillance of hepatitis C. This demonstrates the value of not just our data but also our diagnostic insights in helping to manage significant public health issues. The CDC relationship builds on the vision we established just 2 years ago that speaks to the impact we can have on people's lives. Our vision is to empower better health with diagnostic insights. Our vision was in a central part of becoming more external and customer focused and over the past 2 years we have made tremendous progress bringing that vision to life. We are more than a lab. We are a diagnostic information services company and a trusted partner. Finally, our strategy calls for a 1% to 2% growth through acquisitions. During the past year, we closed 3 acquisitions Solstas, Steward and Summit. Next is our strategy for driving operational excellence. The Invigorate program delivered significant cost savings. Our original 2011 savings target was $500 million. We raised it to $600 million at our 2012 Investor Day and I'm pleased to say we finished 2014 at more than $700 million in run rate savings. We are well underway with the planning of the next phase of Invigorate which will extend our cost savings to $1.3 billion by the end of 2017. As in the past, we will continue to update you on our progress. Well beyond cost excellence, our efforts to drive operational excellence has always focused on quality and building a superior customer experience. This is a fundamental principle of quality improvement. We track actually 150 medical quality and service metrics. We continue to make progress broadly on many of those metrics. In particular, we delivered 6 Sigma quality on our specimen delivery metric. We have achieved record availability for our order entry results and reporting application called Care360, which puts us at world-class service levels and we have reduced the time it takes us to install EMR interfaces. We are improving service levels while also building a more efficient operation. Our progress on service levels are actually a testament to the commitment of 45,000 employees who help us deliver excellent service each and every day. They really are the Quest difference. As you can see, we have made strong progress restoring growth and driving operational excellence. A key driver of this has been our third strategy, building a stronger organization to improve our performance. We now have a stronger team and a more simplified organization than last year. The fourth element of our strategy is to refocus on the core business. We continue to review our portfolio and look at options for non-core assets and we are always striving to build value for our shareholders. Finally, we remain focused on the fifth element of our strategy, delivering disciplined capital deployment. We returned the majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders in 2014. We just raised our dividend 15%. This is the fourth increase in 3 years and in the quarter, we paid down debt and repurchased shares consistent with our commitment earlier this year. Now Mark will provide you an overview of our fourth-quarter financial performance and walk you through the details of our 2015 outlook which is based upon our strengthening operational performance and improving business environment. Mark? Mark Guinan : Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues, consolidated revenues of $1.9 billion increased by 7.2% compared to the prior year. On a consolidated basis, organic revenues grew by 60 basis points compared to the prior year. Our Diagnostic Information Services revenues, which account for over 90% of total revenues, grew by 7.1% compared to the prior year. Volume measured by the number of requisitions increased 8.8% versus the prior year while revenue per requisition was lower than the prior year by 1.5%. For Diagnostic Information Services, or DIS for short, acquisitions contributed more than 7% to revenues. Acquisitions added nearly 9% to volume and reduced revenues per requisition by approximately 1.5%. Excluding acquisitions, DIS revenues, volumes and revenue per requisition were all essentially flat for the quarter. I would like to share some additional context on these underlying volume and revenue per requisition metrics. First, as you know, earlier this year we took some actions and trimmed portions of our customer portfolio. Adjusting for these actions, underlying organic volume performance would have improved by approximately 1.5%. Second, related to underlying revenue per requisition, the reimbursement pressure in the quarter of less than 50 basis points was offset by favorable tests and business mix. Moving to our Diagnostic Solutions business, which includes risk assessment, clinical trials testing, healthcare IT and our remaining products businesses, revenues grew by 8.1% compared to the prior year with our clinical trials and risk assessment businesses driving the growth in the quarter. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $283 million or 15% of revenues compared to $282 million or 16.1% a year ago. The decline as a percentage of revenues can be attributed to lower initial margins from recent acquisitions and the impact of our management incentive compensation. As Steve mentioned, we continued to make very good progress on our Invigorate initiative and delivered more than $200 million in realized savings during 2014 achieving our goal of approximately $700 million in run rate savings as we exit the year. As we look forward, we have established a goal of $1.3 billion in run rate savings as we exit 2017, an additional $600 million over the $700 million we exited with in 2014. For the quarter, adjusted earnings per share of $1.08 was 5% better than a year ago. The Company adjusted out a net benefit of $27 million in the quarter. The net benefit related to a favorable resolution of tax contingencies which was partially offset by charges primarily related to restructuring and integration costs and ongoing efforts to drive operational excellence. The net benefit contributes $0.18 per diluted share to our reported earnings of $1.26 for the fourth quarter. On a reported basis, operating income as a percentage of revenues was 13.7%. Last year's fourth quarter reported operating income from continuing operations was reduced by $12 million related to restructuring and integration costs. These items resulted in a reduction in reported operating income as a percentage of revenues by 0.8% and reported EPS by $0.06. Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 3.8%, 20 basis points better than Q3 2014 but 10 basis points higher than a year ago. Our DSOs were 48 days, 2 days higher than last quarter with the increase partially attributed to mix of business for our employer solutions, wellness and healthcare IT businesses which tend to have longer payment terms. In the quarter, as previously mentioned, a favorable resolution of tax contingencies along with certain R&D tax credits contributed to our lower tax rate for the year. Looking ahead to 2015, we would expect our tax rate to be more similar to the 2013 rate. Cash from operations was $303 million in the quarter compared to $210 million a year ago. In the fourth quarter of 2013, cash from operations was negatively impacted by the tax payment related to the gain on the sale of ibrutinib. Capital expenditures were $89 million in the quarter compared to $76 million a year ago. The increase in capital spending in the quarter reflects investments to support our Invigorate program, the opening of the new laboratory in Marlborough and continued investments to integrate our recent acquisitions. For the year, capital expenditures were $308 million, in line with our guidance of approximately $300 million. During the quarter we continued to return value to shareholders through our dividend and our repurchase of $50 million worth of our common shares at an average price of $64.44. We also made progress on our debt repayment commitments by reducing our debt by more than $116 million in the quarter. I would now like to review a few of the considerations underpinning our 2015 guidance. Starting with revenues, we have shared that reimbursement pressure should be moderate between 2015 and 2017 based on our assumptions and we expect our reimbursement experience to be more like what we experienced in 2014 than what we saw in 2013. Our most recent acquisitions, Solstas, Summit and Steward, which contributed more to 7% to DIS revenues in the fourth quarter of 2014, will anniversary during the first quarter or early second quarter of 2015. At this point we have not included the benefit of additional acquisitions in our guidance for 2015. As you consider expenses, we have established a goal of $600 million in additional run rate savings as we exit 2017 and we are modeling approximately $175 million in realized savings in 2015 related to Invigorate. We are estimating that one-time charges this year related to Invigorate will be in the range of approximately $95 million to $115 million. We have provided additional detail on the breakdown of these charges in our 8-K filed earlier this morning. We estimate up to $300 million in investments over the next 3 years. As we further develop our course of action for the program in 2016 and 2017, we will provide more detail. With respect to cycling your models first off, while weather may be a benefit in Q1 compared to a year ago, the snow in the Northeast over the past few days has negatively impacted our business. Therefore we do not expect to see a complete rebound from last year's harsh winter. Additionally, we expect the benefit of Invigorate and acquisition synergies to build and contribute more to the bottom line as we progress through the year. As a result of these considerations, we expect to see a relatively steady growth rate quarter by quarter with only a slightly higher rate in EPS growth in Q1 than what you would see in Q2 through Q4. Lastly, as we shared at our Investor Day in November, we are moving guidance to cash EPS or adjusted diluted earnings per share excluding amortization. As described at our Investor Day, we are making this change based on feedback and interest from many investors to provide a comparable reporting presentation to many healthcare companies and importantly, this changes in no way impacts the criteria we utilize to analyze potential acquisitions. With that backdrop, let me frame our thought process on sending our guidance in this year of transition. We started with 2014 full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.10. We built our guidance with a framework that would deliver approximately a 6% to 10% improvement in performance on our 2014 adjusted earnings per share figure. We then added in the anticipated impact of amortization based on our current amortization schedules. The amortization for 2015 is estimated to be slightly lower than what it was in 2014. Based on that math and our view of the business, we are now sharing a guidance range for adjusted diluted earnings per share excluding amortization of $4.70 to $4.85. Given our strategy to acquire 1% to 2% in growth each year and the continued need to pay down some debt, you should not anticipate share buybacks beyond the level to meet our majority of free cash flow commitment and the need to prevent any dilution. We also continue to evaluate our portfolio so should we monetize any significant assets, this could change. Finally on cash from operations, please note the forecasted reduction versus 2014 despite an anticipated increase in operating income is driven primarily by 2 factors. First, given the way the calendar falls out, we have an extra payroll cycle in 2015. This additional payroll cycle is not material to our cash liquidity. The second driver is the payout of accrued management compensation which was depressed in 2014. Based on these considerations, we expect full-year 2015 results from continuing operations before special items as follows : revenues to increase between 2% to 3% compared to 2014; adjusted diluted earnings per share excluding amortization expense to be between $4.70 and $4.85; cash provided by operations to approximate $850 million, and capital expenditures to approximate $300 million. Now let me turn it back to Steve. Steve Rusckowski : Thanks, Mark. Well to summarize, we delivered solid top and bottom line growth in the fourth quarter. In doing so, we reported organic revenue growth as we continue to build momentum. We have made good progress executing on our strategy. As a result, we have met our commitments for 2014, raised our dividend once again and have provided guidance for 2015 that shows continued improvement. We thank you for joining us this morning and we would be happy to take any of your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We will now open it up for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question or comment comes from David Clair from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. David Clair : Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Steve Rusckowski : Good morning, David. Mark Guinan : Good morning, Dave. David Clair : So first question from me, you mentioned looking at non-core assets during your commentary. Can you give us any details on areas that you would potentially be interested in? Steve Rusckowski : Sure. Well, in 2012, we laid out those businesses that were core and those things we would consider our options for. One of those categories were our drug assets. We actually monetized one of those as you will recall with ibrutinib. We still have one remaining. That is something we would consider. And then also we talked about our products business, Celera products is a product line if you will that we talked about. So those are 2 that we would consider our options for. David Clair : If the FDA LDT regulations go through, do you have any estimates in terms of what it might cost you guys and is any of that built into estimates for 2015? Steve Rusckowski : No, first of all, we don't believe it should go through. We believe it is not good regulation. We already have regulation with CLIA. If we need to do a better job with quality and regulatory approvals, then we should improve CLIA. In that regard, the FDA has heard some of the feedback through their panels, is reviewing what we have been talking about. So we will see where this evolves but we have no estimate of what it would cost us at this point if in fact it were to go through. David Clair : Thanks. Congratulations on a nice quarter. Operator : Our next question or comment is from Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Unidentified Speaker : Hi. This is actually (inaudible) in for Lisa. Steve Rusckowski : Hi, there. Good morning. Mark Guinan : Good morning, Gavin [ph]. Unidentified Speaker : Good morning. I just wanted to get some more color on your expectations for market growth. I think you said at Investor Day that you thought the market would be growing 2% to 3% and that you would be growing faster than the market because you are targeting prior growth areas. Can you just walk me through what you are expecting for market growth in 2015? Steve Rusckowski : What we said is that we believe the market - when we do our models - this is mid- to long-term market growth - would grow 2% to 3% and this is for the independent commercial lab market so it excludes commercial outreach businesses from hospitals. In that number we have anticipated growth in population, we have anticipated growth in insured lives, gradual build in lives that have insurance from the Affordable Care Act. We have also considered the advancements of what we do is also going to provide some growth in the marketplace. So that is what we believe the growth to be. We also shared in the fall that we said back to years ago what we will do is show gradual improvement in our organic revenues. We needed to first stop the decline. We needed to flatten out and what you've seen in the back half is that actually we do believe we have underlying organic growth. In this quarter we actually did show organic revenue growth. So we are progressing with our improvement step-by-step. We need to next grow with the market and then finally start growing faster than the market gaining share. So that is the progress we are making. What we laid out today for guidance for 2015 is consistent with that view. Unidentified Speaker : And then just touching on core business and some of the business that you walked away from this year when you saw the improvement in volumes in the quarter, is there any expectation to exit other business lines or customers in 2015 or do you feel like you have lapped that trend? Mark Guinan : There always could be exceptions. Obviously we are continuously evaluating our portfolio of business relationships. But as we said, that was kind of a one-time exercise to look across the broad portfolio and you should not expect that kind of volume impact certainly going forward into the future. So yes, we will continue to look at every relationship, make sure that they all make sense but I think you would consider what we did in the second quarter somewhat extraordinary and not a normal procedure that you should continue to see going forward. Unidentified Speaker : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Mark Guinan : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Bonello from Craig-Hallum. Your line is open. Bill Bonello : Hey. Great. Good morning, guys. Steve Rusckowski : Hey. Good morning, Bill. Bill Bonello : I have a question I guess on sort of operating leverage here. Essentially I am struggling to understand maybe why you haven't been showing more leverage on the income statement. It seems like pricing pressure was actually pretty moderate, the cost savings you are recording are huge. I guess I'm just wondering A, what we are missing in terms of offsetting factors? And then two, what changes that you start to show EPS growth significantly outpacing revenue growth in 2015? Mark Guinan : So a couple of things, Bill. In 2014, we talked about the fact that we had 3 things that really were impacting our ability to leverage Invigorate. One was price which was less severe than 2013 but was still there. The second one is our annual wage inflation and then the third piece was this management comp issue which really is hopefully a one-time year-over-year bad guy compare because of the underperformance in 2013. So when you add all those pieces up as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, those certainly were a headwind to leveraging the P&L. The other thing is we are still early in some of the acquisitions while we have made progress and certainly they are more profitable than when we acquired those businesses, we are not fully synergized. We just have some of that in front of us so you are adding a fairly significant book of revenue that is not at our going operating margins and therefore based on math, it shows some deleverage. As we laid out the plan in the Investor Day, tried to make clear that going forward we expect that leverage so we are giving a view that certainly we are going to grow income faster than the top line and that is really going to come from 3 things. One is to complete those synergies. The second thing as we return to growth and I think you've seen, we are making continued progress and we said it is going to grow in strength over the 3 years of that horizon. So we expect more organic growth and getting up to market growth toward the latter part and not immediately in 2015. That drop through will help us to leverage. And then the third piece maybe most importantly is that Invigorate will be large enough that it will offset any pricing and wage inflation headwinds and contribute to the bottom line which we have not been able to do in prior years. Bill Bonello : Okay, thank you. That was very helpful. Just for a related follow-up then on that. Can you at this point - the acquisitions that you did over the last year, are they at this point additive to net income would you say? Maybe just some sense of maybe what their contribution would be relative to the rest of the business? Mark Guinan : Yes, they are contributing to EPS as I said not at a margin ratio of the organic book of business. When we executed the deals, we talked about in the first half them being fairly breakeven and then contributing in the back half. So we haven't given a specific EPS contribution number, Bill, but it is positive and it will continue to improve throughout 2015 as well. Bill Bonello : Thank you very much. Steve Rusckowski : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question or comment is from Darren Lehrich from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Darren Lehrich : Okay, thanks. Good morning, everybody. Steve Rusckowski : Hi, Darren. Darren Lehrich : So I just wanted to come back to your commentary about the 3-year outlook in the context of the 2015 guidance. And specifically just I want to better understand the cash flow dynamic in 2015. Mark, you alluded to management comp and the extra payroll cycle in 2015 as being the year-over-year factors. Can you just size those so we can understand the number CFFO number being down somewhat? And are you still thinking that high single-digit cash flow growth is possible over the 3-year outlook period? Mark Guinan : Yes, certainly we expect cash flow to grow commensurate with our earnings growth going forward. You know the calendar, there is not even weeks in a calendar so every 7th year you end up with this payroll cycle issue. It is tens of millions of dollars so it is significant. And then the management comp piece which you will be able to see within the proxy and so on and so forth is also tens of millions of dollars. So really the $80 million decline that we are implying based on the guidance is more than covered by these 2 items so without these items we would be growing our operating cash flow and really these 2 items are explaining why it is down. Darren Lehrich : Okay, that is helpful. I just wanted to follow-up if I could, Mark, on a comment you made around buyback and I guess the take away is that there isn't really much buyback in your outlook for EPS. But I just want to make sure I understand how you are framing it, is your buyback philosophy any different or are you just basically stating that your guidance doesn't contemplate a lot of buyback? I just want to understand if you have changed your stance on how you are going to deploy capital toward buyback in 2015? Mark Guinan : No change. In our 5-point strategy, we talk about the fact that we are committed to a majority of our free cash flow returning to shareholders and then above and beyond that we weight the best use of cash or the most critical need for that cash and typically we say we balance that between M&A and additional share buybacks. Given the M&A we executed last year, we did take on some significant debt and we have been paying down that debt. So really this comment is more of a short-term - the guidance that we are giving, it includes a flat share count. At the Investor Day, I just for simplicity sake, I gave you earnings growth without share reductions, that does not imply that going forward there could not potentially be buybacks to reduce our shares outstanding. But it was really just to make it a little clearer in terms of what we were suggesting. For 2015, we have not in our guidance we have not assumed a reduction in our share count and we wanted to make sure that was clear. Darren Lehrich : And so the guidance basically suggests about 6.5% EBIT growth, is that fair to say at the midpoint? Mark Guinan : Yes, I think that is reasonable. As I am sure you understand when you have amortization fall off $0.04 approximately from 2014 to 2015, it actually makes the cash EPS look less favorable, I wouldn't expect that kind of a change every single year going forward. So it kind of confounds the comparison a little bit. So that is why we thought it was important to make clear that we started with the 6% to 10% on the old basis and then we kind of did the math and bridged to the cash. And so instead of $0.40 which it was in 2014, it is actually $0.36 in 2015 the amortization that we are adjusting out. Darren Lehrich : Okay, thanks, guys. Steve Rusckowski : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Cherny from Evercore. Your line is open. Michael Cherny : Good morning, guys, and thanks all the details. Steve Rusckowski : Good morning, Michael. Michael Cherny : So Steve, you made a pretty impassioned statement as I would view it relative to what is going on with the long-term review of the clinical lab fee schedule. And I keep coming back to this concept and topic of I think I tend to agree with you that the entire market should be represented in this testing basket. And so when you are having our conversations with CMS, what is the pushback as to why they say that at this point or why they are not jumping up and saying that this will be all the participants? Why are they holding back given the fact that this is still a pretty full market as you mentioned with all of the various different segments that are represented? Steve Rusckowski : I will share with you - I wouldn't say that they are holding back. What we are doing is we're trying to work through this rulemaking process with them and if you think of about gathering all the data that they need to gather to get a real thorough reflection of the market, it is very complex. So you are dealing with all the independent commercial labs, big and small. You are dealing with all the contracts we all have with our commercial payers. And then you are dealing with all the different diagnostic tests that we have. And then also you are dealing with hospitals. And so part of this is trying to understand how they are going to require the reporting for a representative view of the market. It was always in the intention of the bill, it is in a bill that hospitals are part of the market and therefore they need to report. And what they are working through is how they are going to be able to accomplish what was intended by the bill from Congress and that is what they are working through. With anything, it just takes time. We haven't seen where they are with it. We continue the dialogue so as we said in our remarks, we are hopeful that we will see the rules in 2015 as we should so we can collect the data in 2016 and we shouldn't see an adjustment to the clinical lab piece scheduled sooner in 2017. And that is still the timetable we are working with and we are doing everything we can to help them to make sure they do realize that they will get our market representative view including all participants of the markets - the market including hospitals. Michael Cherny : Thanks, Steve. Just quickly relative to the M&A comment, have you seen any change in the attitude of sellers over the last 3 to 6 months in terms of their willingness to sell either more willing or less willing given some of the changing market dynamics, given some of these questions you have brought up such as what is going to be included with the clinical lab fee schedule, what is going to happen with regards to FDA legislation, of LDTs, anything different when you go out and talk to potential acquisition targets? Steve Rusckowski : I would say this is we have a right strategy. We have always had the strategy of getting a portion of our growth from acquisitions. We said 1% to 2%. As you know, we are higher than that number in 2014. We believe we will have some opportunities that as Mark said are not in our guidance in 2015. If you look at what we have acquired in the past, we think that's some hospital outreach businesses that we believe will be accretive to us. We picked up some regional laboratories, 1 big one with Solstas and then we bought a couple of business that are in a faster growing part of the market, this is Summit in wellness and also a business in drug for our solutions testing business which is quite strong for us. So we are optimistic that we do have a reasonable pipeline for acquisitions and we believe we will meet again our commitment of that 1% to 2% topline growth in acquisitions in 2015. As far as is there more interest or less interest, I won't comment on that. I would just say it is consistent with what we have seen so far. But healthcare in general is going to consolidate and we will be a consolidator and therefore we think for the mid- to the long-term this is the strategy. Michael Cherny : Thank you very much. Steve Rusckowski : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question or comment is from Bret Jones from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : Hey, Bret. Bret Jones : Hey. Good morning. Steve Rusckowski : Hey. Good morning. Bret Jones : Hey. Good morning. Thank you. I was wondering if you could talk about, we have been talking about M&A quite a bit this morning. Can you talk about what happened with the Summit Health deal in terms of reversing the contingent consideration? Was this relative to kind of volume expectations, was it cost synergies a little bit behind schedule or anything along those lines? Mark Guinan : This is Mark. It was completely revenue based and nothing to do with cost. And I'm sure you are familiar with some of the ways that you work through differences between buyer and seller over the projection of the business going forward is setting up some of these contingent considerations or earn outs. And without getting into too much detail, you might assume that the seller have a view and we have a little different view and so that is the way we came to an agreement on the purchase price. So we are happy with the performance of Summit. It is meeting our expectations. It may have fell short from some potential upside that would have given the seller some upside in the purchase price. Bret Jones : Okay, great. Then I just wanted to follow-up on the reimbursement side of the equation for next year within your guidance. Are you still assuming a 1% to 2% pressure? I wasn't quite clear. I know you said lower government pressure but I didn't know what you were contemplating on the private pay side? Steve Rusckowski : Dan, do you want to handle that one? Dan Haemmerle : Sure. The 1% to 2% is really the range that we have given at our 2012 Investor Day and it related to the period 2013 to 2015. So if you look at that period, that 1% to 2% range we still feel pretty good about what we said for next year. No specific guidance but we would expect that reimbursement pressure will be more along the lines of what you saw in 2014. Mark Guinan : Yes, so the 1% to 2% included 3% in 2013 and so that was not 1% or 2% every year. It was a CAGR and then to be clear as Dan said, we said 2015 should be more like this past year. Bret Jones : And then can you just\u2026 Steve Rusckowski : And then one\u2026 Bret Jones : I\u2019m sorry. Steve Rusckowski : Lab fee schedule - the effect that we know of. Yes. Dan Haemmerle : Yes. So the clinical lab fee schedule on the Medicare side has been reduced for 2015. It is a combination of a couple of different factors but it is going to be a reduction of about 25 basis points and on the physician fee schedule that is one where there is some codes - some codes that have moved up, some codes that have moved down and net net it is really essentially neutral in rounding in terms of how you think about overall impact. Steve Rusckowski : So those 2 pieces are less than what we have seen for the last 3 years. Bret Jones : That's very help. Lastly, any big commercial renewals that you have coming up? Steve Rusckowski : Nothing that is notable that we would share at this point. Bret Jones : Okay. Thank you very much. Steve Rusckowski : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question or comment is from Amanda Murphy from William Blair. Your line is open. Amanda Murphy : Hey. Good morning, guys. Steve Rusckowski : Good morning, Amanda Mark Guinan : Good morning. Amanda Murphy : Just a quick question on the mix. I think you mentioned that the mix benefit was positive this quarter and I am thinking if we do the math it is around 50 basis points. I wasn't sure about that but can you just talk a little bit about what is driving that? And then how you think about that going forward because I think mix has been a pretty - it has been at least a headwind for a long time here so just curious about next year if you can give any commentary there? Thanks. Mark Guinan : Yes, it was a help. As we introduce new offerings like BRCA that tend to have a higher value per requisition, certainly that helps. Some of the headwinds that we have had in the past as we have always shared has been really in the pathology part of our business which does also have a high value per requisition and some of these reimbursement cuts in that space which certainly has impacted overall revenue per requisition. And again, I want to stress that you should not assume there is a direct relationship between higher revenue per requisition as a higher margin and lower revenue per requisition as a lower margin. It can be a little bit misleading at times depending on whether it goes up or down and making an assumption on that impact on the bottom line. So we really expect as we continue to go forward overall to see favorable mix as we introduce some of these new higher value service offerings. Steve Rusckowski : And Amanda, we saw, as Mark said, some growth in esoteric, we also saw overall continued progression and improvement in our overall test per requisition as well. Amanda Murphy : So is the right way to think about it kind of in that 50 basis points ballpark? It used to be higher than that at one point I think. Mark Guinan : Yes, it used to be higher. If you look at what we said, the reimbursement pressure was less than 50 basis points, the business and test mix offset that to get us from a revenue per requisition perspective essentially flat. So it is something less than 50 basis points is a fair way to think about it. Amanda Murphy : And just last one. I don't think you mentioned the Mopath situation. Has there been any change there in terms of payments from some of the legacy - ? Mark Guinan : No changes at this point, Amanda, nothing really worth mentioning on the call. Amanda Murphy : Okay. Thank you. Mark Guinan : Thank you. Steve Rusckowski : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question or comment is from Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Isaac Ro : Good morning, guys. Thank you. Steve Rusckowski : Good morning, Isaac. Mark Guinan : Good morning, Isaac. Isaac Ro : Hey. I just want to ask a question on free cash flow. You had a nice improvement year-on-year but we are still off the high from 2012. So would you be willing to offer a little bit of guidance on what you think free cash flow could look like this year and what some of the key levers are to driving it? Mark Guinan : The guidance that we provided is $850 million in operating cash flow and $300 million approximately in capital. Certainly 2012 when you look back 2012, the EPS was again higher than 2013, 2014. We are starting to get back to that relative level. We do have some - as I said, some headwinds this year. Again back to that payroll cycle again, it is the same amount of expense flowing through the P&L. It just happens that if you cut the checks on December 31 instead of January 1, it happens to hit your operating cash flow in 1 year versus the next year. So that is really the anomaly that I think distorting our cash flow both operating and free cash flow in 2015 relative to really the performance trend. So we are very focused on cash. Hopefully, Isaac, you see that. We have said that we expect cash to grow commensurate with earnings. As we move forward and get the high single digits to potentially 10% compound earnings growth over the next several years, you should expect cash to be in that ballpark. Steve Rusckowski : Isaac, one other comment just on the 2012 strong performance. Keep in mind there were some tax payments that got deferred into 2013 related to Hurricane Sandy and some benefit related to some interest-rate swaps so a couple of items there that helped that 2012 performance. Isaac Ro : Sure, understand that. Thank you. Just secondly on portfolio rationalization, I think you mentioned a little bit kind of your thoughts around progressing there. Wondering if you could maybe put some criteria out for us in terms of what you are using to evaluate some of those moves? Mark Guinan : We use similar financial metrics that we would use for an acquisition so we look at kind of the standalone. If we continue to hold onto that asset and what kind of value creation we think would take place if we held onto it and then we would look at what the market might offer us for that same cash flow. Or potentially in the cases where we monetize where they may have a better view of cash flow and think they can do better with the assets than we could. And that is where you can end up finding a deal. So it is really back down to the financial metrics around NPBs and looking at the return on invested capital and things like the earnings impact. That is the evaluation we use. Isaac Ro : Got it. Thanks so much, guys. Steve Rusckowski : Thanks, Isaac. Operator : Thank you. Our next question or comment is from Bryan Brokmeier from Maxim Group. Your line is open. Bryan Brokmeier : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Steve Rusckowski : Hey, Bryan. Good morning. Bryan Brokmeier : Looking at the impact ACA had on your business in 2014, could you provide some color to help us anticipate how volumes and revenues may impacting 2015? Should we start to see it happen somewhat quickly in the first quarter, maybe a quarter or 2 later? Sort of some color around what you saw last year. Steve Rusckowski : So what we have said in 2014 is we started to see some modest underlying improvement particularly around Medicaid lives with the expansion of Medicaid in many of the states. That was probably the most notable lives that we saw entering the system. And as I said earlier as far as our market projections, we do believe there is going to be gradually more insured lives in this country going forward and when those matured lives enter the system they are going to need what we do and that is a good fact. We think the Medicaid volume dynamic we saw in 2014 will continue. We think the exchanges will continue to build and then we also think the employer mandate will help us as well. So this will be a gradual build. We haven't given specifics but it is already assumed in our view of the market and assumed in our view of our guidance or outlook for 2015. Bryan Brokmeier : Okay, thanks. Mark, fuel prices have been cut in half. I know it is not a large expense for you but if 1% of your cost decline by 50% that translates into $0.03 or $0.04 in EPS or 2% to 3% in EPS growth by my estimates. Is a 1% of your total cost a fair estimate of what you fuel costs were and now they are about 0.5% of your total cost? And the $0.03 to $0.04 a fair estimate? Mark Guinan : Yes, what I will tell you Bryan, is it is significantly less than 1% so it is not at the 1%. It certainly is helpful and I was asked this question at the previous call that it is small millions. It is not several pennies but it is certainly helpful to our cost at this point. Bryan Brokmeier : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Unidentified Speaker : Hey. Good morning. This is Zach [ph] for Ricky. I just wanted to ask a follow-up on ACA a little bit. And if you look at the actual lives from the ACA whether it is Medicare exchanges, are you seeing from the individuals any commentary you can give on the actual utilization of those individuals versus the total number entering? And then what you are seeing from pricing on exchanges versus utilization or versus Medicaid? Steve Rusckowski : First of all, what we said before, we are doing every quarter we do a dipstick reading on what is going on with our underlying volumes and you heard in my remarks to start this call, we actually are calling it now on a same provider basis. So we are taking good existing customers, we are comparing year-on-year assuming that whatever volume increases we see there are really truly utilization increases. What we said last what are we will continue to say this today, we are seeing some slight improvement in underlying utilization and we think that is a good indication of what could be happening in the marketplace but that is what we have seen so far. As far as pricing on the exchanges, we actually have said in the past we think it is consistent with what we see in general in our commercial contracts so we feel okay about that for now. Unidentified Speaker : Okay, cool. Thank you. Then just on your market share growth versus the hospital labs, I know earlier you talked about excluding hospital outreach, any changes in the dynamics of what you are seeing from hospital-based testing? Steve Rusckowski : What we saw happening in the last 2 or 3 years is hospitals buying physicians and as they bought physicians their trying to direct a lot of the laboratory services to their outreach businesses and that did have an effect on this industry. The overall acquisition of physicians by integrated delivery systems continues but they are running out of some room. Obviously in the specialist areas, most of the specialists in some specialist areas are already working for integrated delivery services or integrated delivery networks like cardiologists but there is still some primary care practices that are starting to pull in. With that said, we believe it is less of a dynamic than we have seen in the past but it is still a dynamic, they do compete with us in the marketplace and that is why it is so important that when we look at this market based view on prices that we will use for the refresh of the clinical lab fee schedule that we include them in the market. Unidentified Speaker : Great, thank you. Steve Rusckowski : Thank you. Mark Guinan : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies. Your line is open. Brian Tanquilut : Hey. Good morning, guys. Hi. Good morning. So just a follow-up to that last question. As you talk to your hospital partners and some of your targets, how are they viewing the potential changes to reimbursement because it could be a pretty significant cut for them. So is this starting to drive the conversation of them wanting to pursue or explore strategic alternatives or options for those hospital-based labs? Steve Rusckowski : This is why we have focused on this as one of our 3 platforms of growth in our restore growth strategies. We built a laboratory professional services business and what we are doing is having a dialogue with the CEO and CFO of integrated delivery systems around their labs strategy which would include how we can help them run their inpatient plan which we call laboratory management and what we can do to be a bigger strategic supplier for their more advanced testing we call reference testing. And then finally is what are their plans around outreach. And in those dialogues and I will share with you that our funnel and our prospect list of those conversations has built to a higher level than we would have anticipated. The interest of having the dialogue has increased and very rarely do we find a C-suite of an integrated delivery system not interested in that discussion. So what you are talking about and what you are asking is right in line with our strategy and we are still very optimistic about the prospects on this part of our strategy. Brian Tanquilut : The follow-up question for you, obviously congratulations on finally getting the organic growth same-store positive. But what gives you guys the confidence that we can get to 2% to 3% number considering that we are coming off of a positive 40 basis point number for Q4? Steve Rusckowski : Remember the 2% to 3% does include the carryover on acquisitions. It doesn't contemplate new acquisitions. And what you have seen is our progress on the underlying organic volumes over the last several quarters and particularly in the back half, we are tracking at a better level than we did in the first half. So that is why we feel good about our outlook for 2015. Brian Tanquilut : Got it. Thanks, guys. Steve Rusckowski : With that, I want to thank you all for joining the call. As you can see we are making good progress executing our strategy. We met our commitments for 2014 and we raised our dividend once again. We appreciate your support. And I would like to wish you all a good day. Operator? Operator : Thank you for participating in the Quest Diagnostics fourth-quarter 2014 conference call.

Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the express written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. Now I\u2019d like to introduce Dan Haemmerle, Executive Director of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead please. Dan Haemmerle : Thank you and good morning. I\u2019m here with Steve Rusckowski, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call we may make forward-looking statements and also discuss non-GAAP measures. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risk and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to those described in Quest Diagnostics 2014 annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Our earnings press release is available and the text of our prepared remarks will be available later today in the investor relations quarterly update section of our website at www.questdiagnostics.com. A PowerPoint presentation and spreadsheet with our results and supplemental analysis are also available on the website. Now, here is Steve Rusckowski. Steve Rusckowski : Thanks Dan, and thanks everyone for joining us today. This morning I\u2019ll provide you with highlights of the quarter. We\u2019ll share industry trends and also review progress we are making executing our 5-point strategy. Then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through guidance. Before we get into our performance, I want to highlight the joint venture we announced last month with Quintiles in clinical trials testing. Together our two companies will create the new business that will be one of the leading global providers of central laboratory services to support drug developments through clinical trials.  The creation of a joint venture allows Quest and Quintiles to bring together the complementary capabilities in scale of our two organizations in an agile way with a laser like focus on serving customers.  The new company will enable biopharmaceutical customers to enhance their drug development process, support precision medicine through companion diagnostics and biomarket discovery and build value by creating more efficient, effective organizations through leveraging the scale, scientific expertise and operational excellence of the parent organizations. We expect that over time that JV will have an accelerated growth rate, achieve cost synergies and to be accretive to what our clinical trials testing business would have been on a standalone basis. The JV structure addresses three of our five strategic points. First, it will help us accelerate growth in the near term for our clinical trials business and explore opportunities related to our longer term strategies on precision medicine, companion diagnostics and creating value from our data.  Second, it enables us to refocus on our core Diagnostic Information Services business without distraction. And third, with minimal capital that enables us to participate in expected synergies in a way that lets us deliver disciplined capital deployment. Mark will provide some more color later on this exciting partnership. For now, both entities will continue to operator separately until the closing of the transaction, which is anticipated to be no later than the third quarter of 2015.  Turning to our first quarter results, we continue to make progress on our path forward, delivering solid revenue, EPS and operating income growth. Revenues grew 5.3%, $1.84 billion. On an organic basis consolidated revenues grew almost 1%.  Adjusted cash EPS increased 13% to $1.05 and adjusted operating income increased 14%. Our performance reflects improved execution and a stable business environment and we are able to grow despite a harsh winter that while is somewhat less severe than a year ago was particularly difficult in the Northeast portion of the United States where we have a strong presence.  Before I get into our strategy update I\u2019d like to talk about industry dynamics for utilization, reimbursement and regulation. Through the first quarter we continue to see stability in test volumes on a same provider basis. We are encouraged by the process of adding more insured lives to the healthcare system as a result of the Affordable Care Act. More states have been expanding their Medicaid programs, including Pennsylvania during the quarter, and we continue to see growth in our Medicaid volumes. Medicaid expansion will bring new people into the healthcare system with the goal of identifying issues earlier to improve outcomes and reduce overall costs. We actually saw this ourselves on a recent Quest Diagnostic Health Trend study. This peer review publication in diabetes care, found a significant double digit increase in diabetes diagnosis in states that expanded Medicaid coverage, and no increase in states that did not.  On reimbursement we see less government pressure on the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule in 2015, than we have seen in the previous two years. I\u2019ll start with the Doc-Fix. Last week the President signed historic legislation titled the Medicare Access and CHIP Re-authorization Act to primarily reform the Medicare Physician Payment Methodology. We are pleased that cuts to laboratory payments under Medicare were not included as part of the package. This legislation also encourages payments based upon quality and encourages us to make the healthcare systems smarter without dining access.  This legislation is also directionally aligned with the HHS goals announced at January to tie traditional Medicare payments to quality or value through alternative payment models. Both the legislation and HHS have outlined specific measurable goals and timelines for these value based reimbursement models. We believe these emerging payment models will favor providers with scale that are more effective and efficient like us.  Next, I\u2019d like to provide a status update on the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 or PAMA, which calls for an orderly review of the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule. Our industry continues to work constructively with CMS on effectively implementing PAMA legislation. Just a few weeks ago I met with leaders at CMS and a delegation from our industry trade association to discuss the rule making progress that will govern any reimbursement changes. During that meeting we reviewed our view of the industry and its participants. We also discussed our shared goal of delivering an accurate, complete and efficient data collection process.  We remain hopeful the rule making progress will be defined in 2015. It will establish an approach to building a representative view of the market. As this industry continues to evolve and mature, we have the right strategy and team and are well positioned to continue to lead.  We continue to execute the company\u2019s 5-point strategy. As a reminder, our strategy is to restore growth, drive operational excellence, simplify the organization, refocus on the core Diagnostic Information Services business, and deliver disciplined capital deployment.  Now what I\u2019d like to do is to share a few comments on each of the elements of the strategy. Well, this was the second consecutive quarter of organic revenue growth on a consolidated basis. We continue to focus on our core growth opportunities. First, we continued to focus on sales effectiveness. Second, we are getting traction on the Professional Laboratory Services agreements we signed last year; and third, gene based esoteric testing revenues grew in the quarter at a faster rate in more than a year.  We continue to grow BRCA revenues which clearly benefited from Angelina Jolie\u2018s ongoing public advocacy. One way we differentiate ourselves is by advocating for open access for BRCA data for patients and clinicians.  In collaboration with our French research consortium Inserm, we led the creation of BRCA share and open data share initiative. Its goal is to accelerate research on BRCA and gene rotations, particularly a variance of uncertain significance to improve the ability to predict which individuals are at risk of developing inherited breast, ovarian and other cancers. The Inserm collaboration is an example of how we are using our unmatched data and information assets to deliver insights to our customers that demonstrate the value that Quest provides.  Last quarter we told you about some new population health, data analytics decision support tools we are developing. We have been piloting our population health tools with several physician, ACOs and health plans to evaluate disease states for their patient populations, monitor compliance with specific testing protocols and identify gaps in care. In this pilot our customers our now engaging with patients and healthcare professionals proactively, encourage the appropriate use of screening and monitoring test to drive better health.  In addition to population and health tools we are making progress to delivering on what we call interactive insights to providers and patients. Our interactive insight offer providers trendy data interactive features such as customizable reports and additional content such as videos and articles specific to conditions and disease.  IntelliTest Analytics is a web based secure portal that provides hospitals, integrated delivery networks and physicians practices with data driven insights about test utilization patterns, so they can adhere to clinically appropriately testing norms.  Care360 revenue cycle management helps customers manage denials of billing claims with a focus on improving patient and payer collections. In November 2012 we established a new vision that spoke to the impact we have on peoples\u2019 lives. Our vision is empowering better health with diagnostic insights. Our vision was in a central part of becoming more external and customer focused. Since then we\u2019ve made tremendous progress bringing the vision to life. Well, we are not just a lab; we are more than a lab. We are a trusted partner and we provide deep clinical insights.  Our vision was the first step. Next we needed to turn it into a compelling customer facing brand, a simple consistent way to talk about Quest, who we are, the value we bring; in short, what is the Quest difference.  Our new core brand idea is a powerful one. It is action from insight. Our brand strategy is based on three pillars; the idea that we inspire action from the work we do, that we have limited answers or patients and healthcare providers and that we advocate better health for patients and communities. This is a powerful idea, that notion that from data comes insight, from insight comes action, the action that transforms lives. Well, as you can tell I\u2019m excited about what our new corporate position, it means for Quest. It translates our vision into a concise, clear and actual brand that gives us an opportunity to reshape our place in the industry, allowing us to continue to differentiate ourselves and not compete solely on price.  Brand is more than a logo, and we\u2019re tag lined. To bring our band to life, we have to change the way we think and talk of what we do. Additionally, we are engaging all of our 45,000 people with the direct impact on delivering this brand promise. You will start to see the new brand in action in the coming weeks and months.  Next is our strategy for driving operational excellence. We are well underway with planning the next phase of Invigorate, which will extend our cost savings to $1.3 billion by the end of 2017. As in the past we continue to update you on the progress as we go. The third element of our strategy is to simplify against and strength our organization. We\u2019ve been focusing on execution and building a performance oriented culture. We are very pleased to be included recently as one of the Fortune Magazine\u2019s Worlds Most Admired Companies.  Over the past year we have introduced a number of new management tools as part of the Quest management system. We are rolling out a new leadership development initiative this month and as I visited more than a dozen of our major facilities in conjunction with our new brand rollout, I found employees at all levels to be highly engaged and excited about the challenges ahead.  The fourth element of our strategy is to refocus on our core Diagnostic Information Services business. We continue to make good progress and the joint venture with Quintiles is the most recently example of doing this. After considering a broad range of options for our clinical trials business, we found the joint venture was the best option to enable us to focus on the core while unlocking the value of this important business. We\u2019ll continue to review our portfolio and look at options for non-core assets and we always strive to build value for our shareholders.  And then finally, we remain focused on the fifth element of our strategy, delivering disciplined capital deployment. During April we completed the refinancing of more than $1.2 billion of our debt that will lower interest rates for the year to come. We paid our dividend at the increased rate and as noted earlier, we think the joint venture with Quintiles will enable us to share in our future value creation without requiring significant capital outlays.  Now Mark will provide an overview on the first quarter financial performance, walk you through the details of 2015 outlook, which is based on our strength in the operational performance and in improving business environment. Mark. Mark Guinan : Thanks Steve. Starting with revenues, consolidated revenues of $1.84 billion increased by 5.3% versus the prior year and grew organically by 70 basis points. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services or DIS for short grew by 4.9% compared to the prior year. Volume measured by the number of requisitions increased 5.6% versus the prior year, while revenue per acquisition was lower than the prior year by 0.7%. For DIS, acquisitions contributed nearly 5% to revenues. Excluding acquisitions DIS revenues volumes and revenue per acquisition were all essentially flat for the quarter.  I would like to share some addition context on these underline volumes and revenue per acquisition metrics. First let me touch on the impact on the harsh winter. As we have shared in the past, our analysis is based on changes in volume versus trend for given geographies related to specific weather events. Additionally we provide guidance based on historical weather patterns. For the past two years we\u2019ve experienced unusually severe winters, however in 2012 we had a mild weather, which resulted in upside to our expectations.  This year volumes were negatively impacted in the quarter by a harsh winter throughout much of the country and in particular the northeast. While the impact was not as severe as a year ago, it was worse than we anticipated. We believe the impact of weather on the quarter was approximately $0.08 of EPS. As a result, we are pleased with the quarter and we were planning on better performance. Turning to underlying revenue per acquisition, we saw modest reimbursement pressure in the quarter that was in line with our expectations. That reimbursement pressure was offset by favorable test and business mixtures. Moving to our diagnostic solutions business which includes risk assessment, clinical trials testing, healthcare IT and our remaining products businesses, revenues grew by 11% compared to the prior year. We enjoyed strong growth during the quarter from our clinical trials products and risk assessment businesses.  Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $269 million or 14.6% of revenues compared to $236 million or 13.5% of revenues a year ago. With comparable volumes essentially flat, the improvement can be primarily attributed to the benefits of our business mix, Invigorate program and M&A related impacts including synergies. These factors enabled us to improve gross margins and further leverage SG&A. As a result, our adjusted operating income and earnings grew faster than revenues.  For the quarter adjusted EPS excluding amortization was $1.05, 13% better than a year ago. Amortization was $0.09 in both 2014 and 2015. The company recorded after tax charges totaling $80 million in the quarter, primarily associated with the debt refinance in the first quarter. The charges also included restructuring and integration costs associated with our Invigorate program and recent acquisitions and combined to reduce reported EPS by $0.54. Last year\u2019s first quarter included after tax charges of $18 million, primarily associated with restructuring and integration charges which reduced reported EPS by $0.13. Let me share a few comments on special items. As you think about special items, because of their nature they do fluctuate from period to period. This quarter we incurred a charge related to the first tranche of debt retire. A second tranche of debt was redeemed in April which will result in a similar charge in the second quarter. We expect to incur a total pre-tax charges of nearly $115 million related to our debt refinancing.  In addition to charges our special items also include benefits. For example, we anticipate recognizing a gain related to the joint venture with Quintiles at the time of closing. This gain will occur when we contribute our clinical trials business into the joint venture which is expected to take place no later than the third quarter. This gain is expected to be in the similar magnitude to the total charges associated with the debt retirement. We will adjust this one time gain out of our earnings. To put this in perspective, since the beginning of 2012 the benefits adjusted out of earnings have been approximately the same amount as the charges adjusted out of earnings. Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 4.3% flat to a year ago. As a reminder, bad debt expense is typically highest in the first quarter due to increased patient responsibility associated with coinsurance and deductable requirements.  Our DSOs were 45 days, three days lower than last quarter and four days lower than a year ago. This is a testament to our operational excellence, continuously demonstrated by our billing operations and patient service centers teams that continue to be effectively engaged with patients and payers to ensure that we get paid for the work we do. Reported cash provided by operations was $52 million in the quarter; however, excluding the $78 million of cash charges associated with the retirement of debt, cash provided by operations would have been $130 million in the quarter versus $84 million a year ago. Capital expenditures were $56 million in the quarter compared to $68 million a year ago. Moving to guidance, we expect full year 2015 results from continuing operations before special items as follows : Revenues to increase between 2% to 3% compared to 2014; adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization expense to be between $4.70 and $4.85; adjusted cash provided by operations to approximate $850 million; and capital expenditures to approximate $300 million. We have not included in our guidance the impact of contributing our clinical trials business to the JV with Quintiles, largely because the impact will depend on the timing of the deals closing. To help frame it, our clinical trials testing revenue was in the range of approximately 2% of our consolidated revenues in 2014. With respect to the impact of adjusted EPS, we believe the JV will be essentially neutral in 2015. We will provide more details when the deal closes later this year. And as we noted on the investor call to announce the transaction, once it closes we will no longer report the revenues in operating income from the clinical trials business in our income statement. We will however reflect our share of the joint ventures earnings on the equity earnings line on our income statement. This is where we report our current share of earning in our other three unconsolidated diagnostic information services joint ventures, which are with leading regional integrated delivery networks. Now, let me turn it back to Steve. Steve Rusckowski : Thanks Mark. Well, to summarize we delivered solid top and bottom line growth and improved profitability in the first quarter. This is our second consecutive quarter of reported organic consolidated revenue growth. We continue to make good progress executing our strategy and we\u2019re excited to share more details on the joint venture with Quintiles when we close. Thanks for your support. Now we\u2019d be to take any of your questions. Operator. Operator : Thank you. We will now open it up to questions. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Mr. Mike Cherny from Evercore ISI. Sir, your line is open. Mike Cherny : Hi, can you hear me? Steve Rusckowski : Yes, good morning. Yes, we\u2019re here. Mike Cherny : I apologize for that. So a question about volume growth. It seems to be \u2013 you talked about an improvement from a market outlook perspective. Obviously weather across the board is pretty nasty this year. If I recall correctly, I think your still rolling off the comp related, some of the lower margin business that you guys decided to walk away from last year. Is there any way you could provide us with a number of terms of what you think that took away from organic volume growth, so we can try and get to a true number, particularly one that correlates with the positive market competitor you\u2019ve had. Steve Rusckowski : Yes, well first of all your right. We are rolling off some of these businesses. In the past we haven\u2019t given you specifics on that. Marks would you like to shed some light on sequentially our continued improvement? Mark Guinan : So Mike, thanks for the question. We have referenced at one point 150 basis points of volume differential. Obviously we don\u2019t want to get into the habit of every single quarter reconciling that, but directionally it\u2019s the order of magnitude and what you might think of in terms of the impact on our volume.  We did also reference that we would annualize that at some point in the second quarter, but also to be clear, we took those actions in the second quarter, so you shouldn\u2019t be expecting the year-over-year comp to be fully positive until the end of that quarter. So it\u2019s a similar level of volume as we also said, although we continue to regularly look over our portfolio and ensure that all the volume is value creating volume. That discreet set of actions we took during the second quarter of last year was kind of a one-time event and you shouldn\u2019t expect those kind of things to happen again at any sort of regularity. Steve Rusckowski : Yes, so Mike, let me just add to Mark\u2019s comments. What we\u2019re doing is continuing to focus our energy on parts of the market that aren\u2019t growing and defocusing on those parts that aren\u2019t and that\u2019s related to our earlier remarks about what we are doing with our resources and accounts.  But the things we wanted to see grow are growing in the quarter. We did mention that we saw the highest growth rate in our gene esoteric testing business this quarter, we are happy about that. We continue to see good growth in our wellness business, our prescription drug monitoring business, Hepatitis C. All the areas that we focused on for growth are progressing nicely and as you know, I mentioned in my commentary BRCA as well.  So the focus is good. Sequentially we are seeing improvement and the momentum continues to build, so we feel good about that. Mike Cherny : No. Thanks guys. That\u2019s really helpful in understanding the underlying dynamics. And then just quickly on BRCA specifically, I know you called out about esoteric, which is quite strong in the quarter and BRCA is a particular driver. Is it possible at this point given that it\u2019s been a number of quarters since you first launched that test, to give a sense of the sizing of that business roughly to at least the esoteric base and over the course of this year how important you think the growth specifically there could potentially be? Steve Rusckowski : We\u2019re not going to spell out the business. I mean obviously as you look at it, its magnitude relative to the overall size of the class. We don\u2019t get into that detail and business of that size and certainly its growing. It\u2019s one of the areas we called out previously and it continues to be a growth area along with prescription drug monitoring and certainly HCB, our special laboratory services there. So BRCA continues to provide growth that we\u2019re not going to give any granularity at this point of sharing the actual revenues. Mike Cherny : No, that\u2019s fine. I\u2019d figure I\u2019d try anyway. Thanks guys. Steve Rusckowski : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, sir. Our next question is from Mr. Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Steve Rusckowski : Hi Isaac Isaac Ro : Very good morning guys, thank you. First question was just on the weather commentary you had. I was wondering if you could maybe try and ballpark the volume impact. I think I missed that, and then the second question had to do a little bit with the financial. Steve Rusckowski : That\u2019s great. Mark you want to give some more color. We gave you an EPS impact of relationship to last year. Mark Guinan : Yes. So from a volume perspective and revenue, it\u2019s probably in the area of around 150 basis points. So last year we talked about a 2% headwind due to weather. This year as I said, not quite as severe, but a fairly large differential from kind of what we would expect to be an average weather based on looking at historical patterns. Isaac Ro : Sure, that\u2019s helpful, thanks. And then just in terms of market share I simply sort of my square out your commentary on volume and some of the benefits your seeing from your growth initiatives. How do you feel about your market share and then just last one was on tax rate, obviously a bit low this quarter. You had some one-timers, but how should we think about tax rate for the rest of the year? Steve Rusckowski : We continue to feel good about where we are focused in the market and where we are focusing we are picking up share, we feel good about that. As we mentioned in the past, we are deciding in some portion of our portfolio to not participate and so in those areas obviously we\u2019re losing some share. But overall we\u2019re trying to manage our business and the portfolio of resources we have to get the best of earnings growth.  What you see in the quarter and we\u2019re happy to show is that we actually reported nice operating income growth and I think it\u2019s a good indication of our business mix and our focus on those areas of growth and how it\u2019s driving some portion of our margin expansion which we called out in the script.  So you want to mention Mark what\u2019s going on with tax? Mark Guinan : So obviously periodically you can get some discreet items in your tax line and you can always anticipate those. So we did have a couple of small items actually, they we\u2019re that large in Q1, but the direction we gave going to the year was that our tax rate will be higher than it was in 2014 and it would be more in line with historical levels and so I think that\u2019s what your expectation should be for the balance of the year. Isaac Ro : Got it. Thanks so much guys. Steve Rusckowski : Thanks Isaac. Operator : Thank you, sir. The next question is from Mr. Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Steve Rusckowski : Hey Ricky. Ricky Goldwasser : Hi, good morning. I have two questions here. So first of all, now that you\u2019ve refinanced the debt, any thoughts about buybacks and acquisitions for the remainder of the year. I think it wasn\u2019t included in the original guidance. Do you see it at this point representing upside to numbers? Steve Rusckowski : Yes. So I\u2019d say obviously there was kind of cash required Ricky. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s why your tying it to what are the implications for buybacks and I think at this point the guidance we gave is consistent, which is you shouldn\u2019t assume any significant reduction in shares outstanding based on repurchases we committed to targeting to insure there is no dilution from the share account, but not any significant buyback to reduce shares. Now with that said, we have a strategy of deploying some of our cash every year to target 1% to 2% of growth through M&A and we\u2019ve also said that if there was not some value creative M&A that we can identify that we will do more share repurchases.  So I don\u2019t want to completely rule out share repurchases, but at this point as part of our strategy we\u2019re continuing to look and we\u2019d like to believe that we can add some businesses, tuck in, hold in type businesses we\u2019ve done in the past and that would probably be our priority for cash in the balance of the year. But should we find that there\u2019s nothing that\u2019s executable, certainly we would use that cash for more share repurchases. Ricky Goldwasser : Okay. And then one follow-up question on ACH, because obviously we are seeing this kind of like more and more lines joining the exchanges, but I think we are still not quite seeing that kind of like pull through on the volume side. Could you share with us your thoughts? What do you think is kind of like causing it? Is it that this population is consuming healthcare through kind of like hospital systems router the ambulatory space? Is it that you think that they don\u2019t still know how to utilize healthcare and we\u2019re going to see the opportunity kind of like later in the year. I mean any insight would be very helpful there. Steve Rusckowski : Yes, like you and everyone else in this market was trying to digest, the resorting if you will for the system and as we mentioned in our commentary, we are seeing an increase in Medicaid volumes, so that\u2019s for sure and we see that.  As far as the rest, it\u2019s hard to understand where people have come from, went to and how they are entering the healthcare system. So we have seen like you some of the volume reports coming out of some hospitals, not all. Its mixed views on that, so we are still trying to understand how this will all sort out with you. But again, we\u2019re starting to see the impact of more lives in the system. We\u2019re hopeful.  From the beginning of ACA we said we believe that the Affordable Care Act should be net positive for the industry and for us. We believe more people in insurance is a good thing. The diabetes studies that we showed shows that by having people with insurance it can have a positive impact on population health and we think that\u2019s a good example of how more people in the system will serve the industry well, but also us as we go forward, so we\u2019re hopeful. Ricky Goldwasser : So then just \u2013 last one, because you mentioned the population health. You highlighted the pilot that you\u2019re doing with some physician offices on your population health tool. Should we think about \u2013 kind of how should we think about that business model? Should we think about it as a potentially longer term revenue opportunity or is it just kind of like needed aid value to create stickiness with the physician and potentially connect also with the hospital provider space. Steve Rusckowski : Yes, we\u2019re thinking of both actually and we haven\u2019t totally sorted it out, how this might work in terms of the business model. Clearly where we could show more value with accounts, we believe that does offer value in terms of our business, but secondly as we provide more and more value to integrated delivery systems and those organizations that are managing populations, we do have valuable assets here, information assets and this application we think is actually very valuable in terms of managing that population and we\u2019re thinking our way through. May there be an opportunity for us actually to have a revenue business model for this, but we haven\u2019t concluded on that yet. Ricky Goldwasser : Thank you. Steve Rusckowski : Thank you. Operator : Thank you ma\u2019am. The next question is from Ms. Lisa Gill from J.P. Morgan. Steve Rusckowski : Good morning Lisa. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much. Good morning. Can you just maybe two things around the new JV. First off, I think that Steve I heard you say that clinical trial testing was about 2% in 2014. So should we think about that as being a 50 basis point headwind for the back half of this year? It sounds like the volume actually won\u2019t go through your volume, but will come from a below the line items for the JV. Steve Rusckowski : Right. Mark, why don\u2019t you walk through how this will get sorted out on a go forward basis? Mark Guinan : Yes, that\u2019s correct. Depending on the timing, if you want to call it a headwind, it will be an adjustment, so obviously we won\u2019t be the controlling interest as the minority owner. We have a fair amount of involvement in the JV; we have a number of our senior leaders who are involved with clinical trials moving into that business; we\u2019ve got an executive we talked about in the past. John Heins [ph] who is actually going to be sitting on the board and involved in this JV, so while for accounting purposes we are no longer going to be recording it as a revenue and we\u2019re no longer going to be reporting the income on the operating margin line.  It\u2019s not as if we\u2019re completely distancing ourselves from the clinical trials business. In fact through the partnership we\u2019re looking to drive even more in this relationship as we referenced in the earlier companion diagnostics and then potentially using our data for clinical trial enrollment as well.  So yes, in terms of engineering, it will be a headwind on revenue, but from an earnings standpoint, we\u2019re really just in 2015 moving it from one line to the other and then most importantly we believe it\u2019s going to be significantly accretive to what we would have done otherwise with clinical trials in 2016 and beyond. Lisa Gill : So Mark, the way that I\u2019m trying to think about it just from a modeling perspective and your guidance today of reiteration of your revenue expectations for 2015 and just given your comments around the weather in the first quarter, I\u2019m just trying to square that up with how to think about the next three quarters and your expectations around both volumes as well as revenue growth and did you see something that you feel confident to maintain that number, because if I remember correctly, you gave that guidance before you announced the Quintiles JV? Mark Guinan : Right, so Lisa my apologies, let me make sure I\u2019m clear. So despite whether we still believe the 2% to 3% top line guidance is attainable; however, as I said in my prepared remarks, I will be adjusting that for the JV once I know the timing. So we will be reducing that 2% to 3% revenue growth guidance impacted by the JV, nothing related to weather. Lisa Gill : Okay great. And then just Mark, my second follow-up question is also for you. It\u2019s just around SG&A in the quarter and where you are on the cost saving initiatives. The SG&A came in a little bit higher than we anticipated, but your gross profits are a little bit higher. I\u2019m just wondering around the timing aspect of that again. How do we think about the cost savings initiatives coming in over the next year or so? Mark Guinan : Sure. So again, I don\u2019t look at any one specific model, so not sure why we may have been different than what you were expecting, but I can talk about SG&A. Obviously Invigorate contributes to build our cost of sales as well as SG&A. We continue to make progress on Invigorate.  If you look quarter-to-quarter, SG&A was fairly flat in dollar terms. We do have that headwind every year at the beginning of the year from bad debt, so we did get about 30 basis points of increase from bad debt. That is typical cycle of bad debt at the beginning of the year. It tends to be higher than the end of the year, so we are very comfortable with managing of SG&A. You can see that we\u2019ve leveraged it significantly versus last year and as part of our Invigorate program we expect to continue the leverage there. Lisa Gill : Okay, very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ma\u2019am. The next question is from Mr. A.J. Rice from UBS. Sir, your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : Good morning A.J. You there? Operator : Mr. Rice, your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : A.J. are you on mute. Operator : It looks like we lost Mr. A.J. Rice, but next question comes from Mr. Bryan Brokmeier from Maxim Group. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed. Bryan Brokmeier : Hi, good morning. Did you say that the organics volume was flat and is that excluding any business that you\u2019re walking away from or is that just M&A? Steve Rusckowski : Mark, you want to take it? Mark Guinan : Yes, so I didn\u2019t make any adjustment before. As we talked about the business we sort of walked away from. That is an actual number, so we were just talking our results and we\u2019re adjusting for M&A to get to that figure. Steve Rusckowski : So the walk aways we talked about in the past are not adjusted out of that. So that would be based on the earlier comments of lift if you want to look at that. Mark Guinan : Yes, we would have shown growth and I adjusted for that. Bryan Brokmeier : Okay, and NIPT is another large market that you\u2019re currently participating in for a partnership. Can you provide any color on when you\u2019re planning to launch your own test? Steve Rusckowski : Well, first of all its going well. So as I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re quite pleased with our growth rate in advanced and esoteric testing and our non-evasive testing is \u2013 pre natal testing is going quite well, so we\u2019re hopeful about that. We continue to work through our own test as you say. We haven\u2019t announced a specific data on that, but we\u2019re making very good progress. Bryan Brokmeier : Okay, thank a lot. Operator : Thank you, sir. Our next question is from Mr. Darren Lehrich from Deutsche Bank. Sir, your line is open. Dana Nentin : Hi, good morning. Its Dana Nentin in for Darren. Steve Rusckowski : Hey Dana. Dana Nentin : Hey. So just going back to your DSOs being down through your four days from last year, I was wondering if you could provide any color there as it relates to the [inaudible] payment recoveries and I guess if not can you update us on the status of those non-payments? Mark Guinan : Yes, it\u2019s not related in any way to that. Largely it points to UMass, the acquisition of that business. Last year as we were transitioning the billing system from them to us there was some complexity in that and it slowed some collections down a bit and inflated our receivables, I\u2019d say relative to what they would have been otherwise last year. So now that we\u2019ve gotten that behind us, I\u2019d say that\u2019s probably the biggest probably year-over-year. So it\u2019s really nothing at all related to molecular. Dana Nentin : Okay. And can you update us on the size of those non-payments? Steve Rusckowski : Yes, we\u2019re making progress. We\u2019re judiciously going after our payments for what we do. We\u2019re working with all the health plans to do that and I could share with you that if you did that we are progressing through doggedly working through test by test, payer by payer to make sure we get paid for the good work we provide, so you feel like we\u2019re making progress. Mark Guinan : But I do want to clarify, because if we\u2019ve taken this question a number of times in the past and consistently given our response, we are not expecting any sort of significant windfall. While certainly this is a headwind and I think you\u2019ve heard from maybe other people in the laboratory area about significant reductions in payments based on some of the changes, whether its CBT 2013 or now CBT 2015 or other changes in the reimbursement requirement.  So while there\u2019s certainly been a headwind, it\u2019s not material to our performance this year and it should not be something that you expect at some point we\u2019re going to come back and say, hey, we solved a bunch of issues and here\u2019s a big good bag. Dana Nentin : Okay great, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks. Steve Rusckowski : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Mr. Robert Willoughby from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Sir, your line is open. Robert Willoughby : Hi Steve and Mark. Your approaching a year of ownership now of solicitors. Can you speak to retention rates of the business there, what synergies have been captured, what\u2019s left on the table there? Steve Rusckowski : Yes, so we\u2019re making excellent progress with the inspiration of solicitors. What we did in that geography is to really combine both of our businesses together and so we\u2019re integrating operations, we\u2019re integrating our G&A functions, some portion of the improvement you see in our SG&A. This quarter is related to that good work we\u2019re doing there.  We also have integrated the sales force. As you know when you buy any organization, we had planned on some attrition related to clients that we know that would not move over to us and have planned that in our model and we\u2019re tracking to make sure that we did have it planned. So we feel good about the progress that we made and we feel good about what we\u2019re delivering in terms of creating value for our shareholders. Robert Willoughby : Okay, thank you. Steve Rusckowski : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, sir. The next question is from Ms. Amanda Murphy from William Blair. Ma\u2019am your line is open. Amanda Murphy : Hi, good morning guys. I guess just a couple of follow-ups on the reimbursement side. So you mentioned the growth on the esoteric front and BRCA specifically, but just curious as you think forward. Obviously there is a lot of opportunity, particularly in sequencing based diagnostics. What\u2019s your view on the reimbursement environment there specifically? I know there has been some work to establish some coding there, so curious just thinking about that this year and then longer term? Steve Rusckowski : We deliver a lot of value. As you know the average market price has come down over the last year and a half, two years. We believe where we are right now is supporting the plan we have going forward. We feel good about that and we\u2019ll continue to as we\u2019ve done with everything in our business; continue to have the data that justifies that we\u2019re putting a lot of value here and we need to make sure we get back in our reimbursement, the value it delivers.  So we\u2019re going to be careful before we do anything. In terms of pricing changes we believe that defending and continuing to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace is important for us. We think it\u2019s important for the industry to continue to defend and get our value back for the marketplace. There\u2019s a great value we deliver and that\u2019s position we continue to take going forward.  So Mark, anything you\u2019d like to add? Mark Guinan : Yes, Amanda, I\u2019m sure as you fully appreciate, especially in the gene based area, reimbursement is related also to your offering. It\u2019s not an independent decision. So look at our onc [ph] advantage product and the fact that we have a panel of actionable genes, 34 actionable genes and as we engage with the payers, I think the response is the dialog with our medical professionals and so on is you know fairly positive because of the fact that we are moving forward with the limited panel that is actually all around the action.  So as Steve talked about earlier, data brings insights, insights to drive actions and I think the payers are much more willing to pay for things, where clearly there is a path towards actions. So again, not commenting on anybody else\u2019s offerings, it\u2019s not the same for the all of it. Certainly the choices we make around our product offerings and the size of the panels and the action ability of those panels also influences our ability to get paid. Amanda Murphy : And one follow-up to that, is there any way that you can give as an idea as how big that business is for you now. Obviously esoteric encompasses quite a lot, but if you think about just sequencing, I guess as a bucket how big that is and how much of your growth on esoteric is coming from that side of the world. I know you mentioned BRAC again, but... Steve Rusckowski : Mark and Dan should talk a little bit about how we breakup things in our 10-K. Mark Guinan : Amanda we break out the gene based and esoteric in the 10-K we shared on the supplemental analysis on the website. So overall gene based esoteric and Anatomic Pathology is about $2.5 billion business, but in terms of specifics sub-segments and different cuts of the data at the level of granularity you are looking for, we haven\u2019t share that at this point. Amanda Murphy : Okay, thanks guys. Steve Rusckowski : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Nicholas Jansen from Raymond James. Sir, your line is open. Nicholas Jansen : Yes, Mark this one is for you on free cash flow. I think the guidance this year is $550 million, but that certainly excludes some things like the debt restructuring charges and some of the project Invigorate 2.0 charges. So I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of actually how much true free cash flow is available this year. I know you have a dividend payment, I know you guidance includes kind of 1% to 2% revenue growth from M&A. So maybe just walk me through the cash flow dynamics. Mark Guinan : The only thing that I\u2019m excluding is the debt refinancing, so I\u2019m not adjusting for any of the Invigorate expenses. So as we talked about it was $78 million in the quarter. We talked about the fact that we\u2019d have a somewhat similar charge in the second quarter. So that should guide you. I mean at the end of the day, we are expecting somewhere a little less that $100 million of expense from the refinancing.  So the $550 million less that will be kind of I guess the free cash flow number that you are looking for that takes the new account to cash expenditures for other adjustments. And again, we have some positive guys that we adjust out, but actually they are cash positive as well. So when you net all those out, normally we don\u2019t many adjustments, but just given the size and I guess the unusual nature of the debt refinancing, I decided to adjust that just to make the year over year comparison what I thought was a little more meaningful and comparable. Nicholas Jansen : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then regarding the $0.08 weather headwind. I\u2019m just trying to reconcile that relative to what you reported. So I guess on the previous conference call you talked about having 1Q earnings only slightly better than 2Q to 4Q. If we were added $0.08 back to the $1.05 that would be meaningfully better than slightly. So I\u2019m just trying to reconcile kind of the quarter relative to your internal expectations that you gave back in January and kind of how that proceeds to the guidance that was reiterated today. Steve Rusckowski : Thank you for the question. Obviously when we spoke to you in January we hadn\u2019t incurred the February weather, but we had incurred some January weather. So we were trying at that point with the knowledge that we had at that point, we just wanted to make sure that people didn\u2019t get overly exuberant about the potential of the first quarter given the easy compare with the weather in 2014.  So yes, a couple of things. One is we probably formed a little more stronger than we expected in the first quarter adjusting for the weather, so had the weather not been there, it would have been a really, really strong quarter. There is various reasons for that. However I\u2019ll go back and say the guidance that I gave today is something that we are very confident in and whatever the performance in the first quarter, you just assume that guidance is reasonable and that\u2019s where we are going to land. Nicholas Jansen : Thanks for the clarification. Steve Rusckowski : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Mr. Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies. Sir, your line is open, you may proceed. Steve Rusckowski : Good morning. Brian Tanquilut : Hey, good morning guys. Just a quick question for you on the hospital side. So I know we\u2019ve talked about in the past how the opportunity is for these hospitals to look to outsource their labs. We are hearing more and more about payer pressure on commercial pricing for the hospital based labs and also narrow network strategies specifically you know Anthem, Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio. So are we seeing more of that or is the pressure accelerating in the hospitals that you are starting to see more conversations with hospital CEOs. Steve Rusckowski : As I mentioned in the past Brian, the discussions we\u2019re having and the opportunity list that we have and that we are working is larger than we ever anticipated. Most CEOs and CFOs have lab strategies as part of their shortlist were encouraged by all that.  The dynamic you mentioned we think is a very positive dynamic. As we\u2019ve talked about, we offer great value. We have some of the best pricing for the quality we deliver in this market place and therefore in terms of value we are in the strongest of the choices people have.  And yes payers are now starting to look at every tightening their network further, but wide variation in prices from what we have here versus hospital outreach are notable and yes, it\u2019s from the payers, but I also mentioned two other dimensions to that. Employers are spending a lot more time on their healthcare costs and seeing wide variations, so they are starting to ask questions. And most importantly consumers with a higher co-pay in deducible have now started to ask questions. Why would their bills go up, just because physicians are now working for integrated Delivery Systems verses when those physicians used to send the work to independent laboratories like ourselves.  So all this is coming together and in a good way. Most hospitals we talked to realize with payment models moving away from fee for service to population health and bundle payment models that no longer is an incentive to \u2013 or they are no longer incentives to drive volume and activity, but look at how they deliver the best quarter to healthcare with the lowest possible cost, that\u2019s what we saw at the University of Massachusetts. And then second, some do see and realize that they do have a melting ice-cream cone with some of the differential commercial rates that they enjoy today on their hospital outreach. Therefore they are taking to us and thinking about what their options should be.  So it\u2019s coming together nicely. We actually applaud what\u2019s happening with Anthem. We think it\u2019s a positive change for the industry and a positive indication that there is a catalyst out there in the system to start to get the discussions started and move this at an accelerated pace. Brian Tanquilut : Got it. Thanks Steve. Steve Rusckowski : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. David Clair from Piper Jaffray. Sir your line is open. You may proceed. David Clair : Yes, good morning everybody. So I\u2019m just curious, given the timing of the PAMA final rule, it sounds like they are going to miss the initial June proposed rule deadline. So how would you handicap the odds of the clinical lab fee schedule reprising happening by 2017? Steve Rusckowski : Well David, I\u2019ll leave the odds giving to Las Vegas. Hard to handicap CMS, hard to handicap anything that happens in Washington. As I mentioned, we were down there last month; we being myself and some members of our industry. We had a very good conversation. Its complex and they are working through all that complexity. With all the different entities that we have to give them their data, all the different codes they have to look through, all the different tax IDs and so they are digesting all of that.  So with all that said, it is still their goal and that\u2019s how they say it, still their goal to have the rule making out in 2015 for collection in the \u201916 for \u201917 a refresh to the clinical lab fee schedule. So that\u2019s the gold they are still working at. David Clair : Okay. Thank you and then I was wondering was the debt refinance included in your original EPS guidance and if it wasn\u2019t, what\u2019s the offset to the interest savings that we are going to see in the year. Mark Guinan : And so, I\u2019m sure as you appreciate when put guidance together you got a number of items to consider and various ranges I know for modeling purposes, you always need a discreet entry, but we are considering ranges of potential outcomes and inputs. So certainly we had a reasonable expectation we might do the debt refinancing, we didn\u2019t know exactly the timing, we didn\u2019t know exactly what the new interest rate might be and hence the interest savings.  So at this point since I reaffirmed guidance and EPS, assume that the interest savings is in there and I can\u2019t really call out an offset, because we still have $0.15 of range within the guidance. So its within the parameters of all the different contributors to how the EPS was driven and so I couldn\u2019t tell you exactly what the offset was, because there isn\u2019t necessarily, because we are still within a range that\u2019s quire broad. David Clair : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you, sir. The next question is from Mr. Jack Meehan from Barclays. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed. Steve Rusckowski : Hi Jack. Jack Meehan : Hi, good morning guys. I want to sort of just ask about the new BRAC data sharing initiative you announced earlier this week and just the background, how it came together. And then timing wise, just curious why now? Obviously you\u2019ve been on the market 18 months and I think there is a lot of differing thoughts on the merits of the U.S. So just in terms of it being a metric, what are you seeing on the market? Steve Rusckowski : First of all we responded quickly to the opportunity to enter the BRCA market. After the Supreme Court ruling, we entered the market about four months afterwards. So we entered into the market. And as we approach all businesses Jack, we continue to look at ways that we can get better at what we do. So we\u2019ve been improving our offering in terms of our capabilities, of our sales force, capabilities of our generic counselor, capabilities of the quality of our reporting and the look and feel of our interactive insights as I talked about it in my remarks.  But also we are looking at how do we get the actually results to be of higher quality and we only have so much data. We believe it would be the right thing to do, to take our data, combine it with other people\u2019s data. The inserm being the French Institute for Health has 16 labs that report their data gain.  We are also happening to have LabCorp participate in this. So we are going to put in both of data that\u2019s into Inserm and we believe that this is just the beginning, there will be others to follow.  In the outcome of this, we believe it will be an outcome of the curation and also the analytics around that data to produce better sensitivity and specificity around the testing for BRAC and we think that\u2019s a good thing for the industry and a good thing for us. So we think this is the next step of improving and delivering a great solution to the market place at a better way.  We will continue to differentiate ourselves and everything I just described, how we sell it, how we support it, how we present it and how we explain it\u2019s in our solution to the market place which we think will allow us to continue to differentiate ourselves versus the other options that our customers have. So we think its progress in the right direction. Jack Meehan : Yes, got it. And then just maybe off that; is there a way to gauge a sense for just collectively the contribution in terms of volumes and just you know where you think it needs to be in order to have similar VUS rates and if that\u2019s a good metric to consider? Mark Guinan : So we are not going to see any sort of detail on the volumes that are contributed. In the French the institute has been collecting data for 10 years. So there is a fair amount of data. Obviously you\u2019ve got us and LabCorp who have decided it\u2019s in the best interest of patients to contribute, come out to better data information. We are going to compete on other aspects of our product offering than anything around the science.  And again back to the VUS, this is not about VUS. This is really about insuring we have the best ability to provide information to patients and therefore we won\u2019t get into sort of the medical comparisons or anything like that; that\u2019s not why we are doing this. We are not doing this for competitive reasons. We are doing this because it\u2019s in the best interest of patients. Jack Meehan : Got it and if I can squeeze in one more maybe just for Mark, curious if you are seeing anything on the deductable side and any changes to start the year in terms of the prevalence of high deductible health plans. A - Steve Rusckowski : I mean it\u2019s still early for us to know whether there has been a large hit. I mean obviously we\u2019ve built into our assumptions that continued trend towards more high deductable plans for a reported based provider insurance. We did have the usual first quarter lift in bad debts like our efforts in some of it and so forth, so nothing I can share of detail at this point. Jack Meehan : Okay, thanks guys. Operator : Thank you and our last question is from Mr. A.J. Rice. Sir you line is open you may proceed. A.J. Rice: Thanks. Hi everybody, sorry about earlier. Just two quick areas of question; first on the upcoming JV with Quintiles, is it generally in the ballpark to think of the operating margins. Thank you that you gave us to revenues. The operating margins on the clinical trial business you are contributing are somewhere close to the corporate average and then as you think about the JV on an ongoing basis, will there be either cash commitments on your part going forward after the JV setup or will you be taking \u2013 have opportunities to take cash out. What are the cash flow implications of the JV? Mark Guinan : Right so, A.J. I won\u2019t get into the specifics, but the clinical trials businesses is not materially different from its order of magnitude; its margin is similar the overall enterprise. Obviously you get a lot more granularity on that when you start seeing the changes in our equity earnings line going forward.  In terms of cash, there is just some initial cash from a working capital standpoint that\u2019s not significant, because we are going to continue to kind of wean down the receivables of our business and keep that as opposed to contributing that to the venture. So at the end of the day that\u2019s going to about a wash.  We have an annual \u2013 and it\u2019s part of the contract. We have an annual ability to take out cash dividend as will Quintiles as well. So we are expecting to get cash contributions out of the JV going forward. And in terms of any sort of future cash needs, it\u2019s part of this agreement. We have the ability to both, to contribute cash if you want to do more M&A through the partnerships or there some other investment opportunity that going forward agrees make sense. There is an ability to bring cash into the entity. So we feel it\u2019s pretty flexible in terms of cash, but we certainly are expecting to get our fair share of cash out of this entity going forward as well. A.J. Rice: Okay and then maybe just one other follow-up. I think you had said this before, and I think it\u2019s my sense of the industry overall, but when you think about the larger contracts with payers and others, that this is a relatively benign year that doesn\u2019t have a lot of re-contracting activity, but I just wanted to put that out there and confirm that that is indeed the cash, if it\u2019s true. Mark Guinan : So independent of whether we had a lot of re-contracting. What we have said is that the pricing pressure, the price erosion in 2015 is to be more similar to \u201914 and in \u201914 it was less than a 100 basis points and I\u2019m not going to get into the specifics of how close is it going to be \u201914, but more like \u201914 and I also said that as part of the Investor Day that I would expect \u201916 and \u201917 to also be more like \u201914. A.J. Rice: Okay, all right, thanks a lot. Steve Rusckowski : Sure. Dan Haemmerle : Okay, no further questions. Thanks again for joining the call today. As you can see, we are making good progress executing our strategy. We are excited about the clinical trials opportunity. We appreciate your support and you have a great day. Thank you very much.

A PowerPoint presentation and spreadsheet with our results and supplemental analysis are also available on the website. Now, here's Steve Rusckowski. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Dan, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. This morning, we'll provide you with highlights of the quarter, share industry trends, and also review progress we are making, executing our five-point strategy. Then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through guidance. Well, we grew revenues, margins, and earnings in the second quarter, and made progress executing our strategy. Revenues grew 1% to $1.9 billion. Adjusted operating income grew 9%, adjusted net income grew more than 8%, and adjusted EPS increased 5% to $1.25. This was the second consecutive quarter in which operating income grew faster than revenues. This underscores what we've been doing with executing our five-point strategy. We are not just interested in growth at any cost, we are focused on driving profitable growth. And I'll speak about this more in a minute. Before we get into our strategy, I would like to spend some time on industry dynamics. After two years of some of the heaviest government reimbursement pressure this industry has faced, we're seeing a moderation of that government reimbursement pressure in 2015, and we don't see any significant headwinds for 2016. Any changes to the clinical lab fee schedule proposed as part of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act, also known as PAMA, would go into effect in 2017. As you know, CMS continues to work on the rule-making process and the data collection that will help determine future reimbursement schedules. We appreciate the work done by CMS, as well as the complexity of this task, and we will continue to collaborate with CMS throughout this progress \u2013 process. So on utilization, we continue to see stability in test volumes on a same provider basis during the quarter. Turning to the Affordable Care Act, we continue to believe it will be net positive for our company and our industry. The Supreme Court removed uncertainty regarding the future of the act in King v. Burwell. As we look at the impact on our business to date, as you know, there are a lot of moving parts and we don't have perfect information, but what we can say is that we are seeing growth in our Medicaid and managed Medicaid volumes in different markets around the country, as well as a decrease in our uninsured patient volumes. These trends appear to be consistent with our expectations related to the new lives coming into the system. We expect this will improve over time as additional uninsured patients begin to access health care. With greater certainty related to the Affordable Care Act, payer consolidation has dominated the headlines in recent weeks. Today, Quest serves all major national payers with an unsurpassed national network of laboratories, information services and logistics. Health care in general and diagnostic testing in particular are characterized by significant disparities in price for similar services. It's not unusual for test performed by a hospital lab to cost two times to five times as much as Quest. We offer tremendous value, providing the highest quality at a competitive price. We are very well positioned to help health plans in our networks achieve the most efficient network design and provide members with outstanding service. Now, let me shift to the progress we are making on our five-point strategy, which is to restore growth, drive operational excellence, simplify the organization, refocus on our core diagnostic information service businesses, and deliver disciplined capital deployment. Well, starting with growth. This is the third consecutive quarter of organic revenue growth on a consolidated basis. It was also the first quarter we recorded revenue per requisition growth in three years. Now, let me talk about a few of the drivers. Our regional sales team are now better aligned with the clinical franchises and the professional lab services team. We grew revenues in the quarter for several recent clinical franchise solution launches, including BRCA, CardioIQ, Noninvasive Prenatal Screening, and HIV fourth generation testing. We also continue to see growth in prescription drug monitoring. Last quarter, we shared that gene-based and esoteric testing revenues grew at the fastest rate in the year. We were pleased to see that the growth rate continued during the second quarter. This focus on esoteric and gene-based testing has continued to be the increase in revenue per requisition. We continue to grow revenues from new relationships with hospitals and integrated delivery networks by helping them improve healthcare outcomes and reduce cost. Most recently, we announced an agreement to acquire MemorialCare Health Systems' laboratory outreach services business. This transaction fits well within our M&A guidelines, and is a smaller tuck-in type acquisition compared to some of the more recent deals we have completed. We expect the transaction to close in August. Our M&A and business development pipeline is strong, and we are optimistic about the opportunities our team are pursuing. We said before we're enhancing our diagnostic information services to help customers with population health, data analytics and decision support tools. These tools are driving growth and helping us deliver a superior customer experience. So, for example, for physicians, our Interactive Insights offer provider trending data, interactive features such as customizable reports and additional content, as videos and articles related to specific conditions and diseases. We have piloted these solutions with approximately 70 physician providers and are encouraged by the feedback. Now, for hospitals, more than 100 customers are now using our IntelliTest Analytics solution. This easy to use tool provides hospitals, integrated delivery networks, physician practices, with timely access to utilization insights to assist with laboratory test optimization decisions and driving cost controls. And for health plans, we've expanded pilots with health plans for our Quest Analytics platform. This self-service informatics tool enables health plan customers to query our massive database to help manage populations of patients, encourage the appropriate use of screening and monitoring tests to drive better health and follow guidelines. We've received very positive feedback. So we continue to build on our data analytics tools and we will update you on our progress. And then, finally, consumerism is an emerging trend in healthcare, and we offer a number of compelling services in this exciting space. We began to offer our Blueprint for Wellness health-risk assessment directly to consumers in 2010. Now, we're getting ready to offer Blueprint for Athletes, to help athletes and their coaches and trainers, as well as weekend warriors, gain valuable insights into the training recovery regiments, peak performance conditions and optimal dietary consumption. We also recently announced an agreement with HealthTap, a digital healthcare provider. HealthTap's virtual network of physicians can offer easy ordering of tests for patients from Quest Diagnostics. Doctors can see test results on HealthTap's platform, and patients can access their own results using our patient portal, the MyQuest application. More than 1.8 million patients have now downloaded our MyQuest application. A growing portion of those consumers are paying us a premium to gaining access to the historical lab results and maintain access to the longitudinal test results. And last result \u2013 last week, we began to offer direct access testing to consumers in Arizona, where a new law just took effect, enabling people to order tests without a physician's script. We're operating this through our joint venture partner, Sonora Quest Laboratories, which builds on the strengths of our partner, Banner Health, the leading healthcare provider in Arizona. Initial interest in this service is very strong. As the responsibility for managing and paying for healthcare shifts rapidly to consumers, we are well positioned to be the consumer-friendly diagnostic testing provider. The second element of our strategy is driving operational excellence. Our Drive program is focusing on delivering a superior customer experience, as well as allowing us to become more efficient. We perform more than 3,000 different diagnostic tests in our large network of laboratories, many of which came to us through acquisitions with different laboratory information systems and billing systems. We're always looking for ways to improve the service we deliver, whether it's providing more than 90% of our results to doctors by 8 :00 in the next morning or making more than 5 million phone calls a year to notify physicians of critical results they can act on. Our investor day last fall, we said we would be standardizing systems and processes. Since then, the portion of our legacy systems that are standardized has increased from 70% to 75%. Our latest system conversion occurred without any disruptions to clients, which is very encouraging. We also drive and track a number of medical quality and service metrics related to a superior customer experience. Many of our service elements, such as availability of our Care360 Physician Portal, and our specimen tracking performance are already at Six Sigma levels. In addition, we have saw improvement in several key areas, including wait times at patient service centers, installation of EMR interfaces to onboard new clients. We continue to move closer to achieving our Invigorate goal of $1.3 billion in cumulative run rate savings by the end of 2017. As I mentioned at the beginning of this call, this quarter's strong operating income performance demonstrates the value we're creating from our improved efficiency. The third element of our strategy is to simplify and strengthen our organization. We have been focusing on execution and building a performance-oriented culture. Our Quest Management System is the way we run the company by using a set of standard tools and processes. Additionally, we have been training our leaders and recently launched the leading Quest Academy to provide a rigorous form for putting our Quest Management Systems tools to the test. Academy graduates are now hard at work on teams focused on addressing opportunities and challenges facing our business. The fourth element of our strategy is to refocus on our core diagnostic information services business. We've made substantial progress in the last 90 days. As you know, we launched our newest joint venture, Q2 Solutions with Quintiles, in a capital efficient way that provides us with a path to generating better growth and profitability from that business than if we had operated it as a standalone entity. We have a great partner and are excited about the opportunities for that venture. Quintiles will share more on the joint venture, including expectations related to financial performance, in their upcoming earnings call. We're excited to be working with Quintiles exclusively for a period of time to combine our respective data set to help biopharma customers improve their drug discovery and development process. Lastly, we continue to review our portfolio, looking at options for non-core assets that can build value for shareholders. The fifth element of our strategy is delivering disciplined capital deployment. During April, we completed the refinancing of more than $1.2 billion of our debt that will lower interest expense for years to come. We also deployed our cash to reinvest in the business and continue to make progress on our commitment to shareholders by returning approximately $250 million year-to-date through a combination of share buybacks and dividends. Now, Mark will provide an overview on our second quarter financial performance, walk you through the details of our 2015 outlook, which is based on our strong operational performance. Mark? Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues, consolidated revenues of $1.93 billion increased by 1.2% versus the prior year and grew organically by 80 basis points. Revenues for diagnostic information services or DIS for short improved by 0.4%, compared to the prior year. Volume, measured by the number of acquisitions, declined by 0.4%, versus the prior year. However, revenue per acquisition was 0.9% better than the prior year and, as Steve mentioned, it was first increase in three years. While reimbursement pressure continued to be moderate at just under 1%, we were more than able to offset that pressure through favorable test and business mix shifts. The favorable test mix shift reflects the strong growth in our gene based and esoteric testing. Moving to diagnostic solutions business, which includes risk assessment, clinical trials testing, healthcare IT and the remaining products businesses, revenues grew by 11% compared to the prior year. Our diagnostic solutions revenues will be lower on a reported basis in the second half of 2015 as a result of the contribution of our clinical trials business to the joint venture with Quintiles. To provide you with a representative view of the operational performance of the business, we will communicate our reported 2015 revenue against 2014 revenue on an equivalent basis. Revenue for 2014 on an equivalent basis excludes clinical trials revenues reported in the third and the fourth quarters of 2014. The 2014 revenue excluded is $41 million and $46 million in the third and the fourth quarter, respectively. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $321 million, or 16.7% of revenues, compared to $296 million or 15.5% of revenues a year ago. The improvement of 120 basis points can be primarily attributed to the benefits of our tests and business mix, Invigorate program and continued integration synergies from our 2014 acquisitions. Lower amortization in the quarter versus a year ago negatively impacted the comparison of cash EPS to the prior year by $0.03. For the quarter, adjusted EPS, excluding amortization, grew 5%, to $1.25. The company recorded after tax charges totaling $52 million in the quarter, $41 million of which is associated with our recent debt refinancing. The charges also included restructuring and integration costs associated with our Invigorate program and recent acquisitions, and combined to reduce reported EPS by $0.36. Last year's second quarter included $24 million of after tax costs associated with restructuring and integration charges, which reduced reported EPS by $0.16. As a reminder, we also expect to book a gain related to the valuation of the joint venture with Quintiles. We will adjust this one-time gain out of our earnings. Bad debt expense, as a percentage of revenues, was 4.1%. 20 basis points better than last quarter, but up 20 basis points compared to a year ago. Our DSOs were 44 days, one day lower than last quarter and three days lower than a year ago. Consistent with the first quarter, we are adjusting our operating cash for the first half of the year to exclude cash charges for the debt refinancing. Adjusted cash provided by operations was $324 million in the second quarter of 2015. Reported cash provided by operations in the second quarter of 2015 was $275 million and was negatively impacted by cash charges of $49 million associated with the early retirement of debt, in connection with the company's debt refinancing. In the second quarter of 2014, reported cash provided by operations was $280 million. Typically, cash flow is stronger in the second half. However, this year, we have an extra payroll cycle and a tax payment associated with the previously disposed business that, together, account for about $100 million. Despite these headwinds in the back half, we now expect adjusted cash provided by operations to exceed $850 million for the year. Capital expenditures were $61 million in the quarter, compared to $49 million a year ago. Moving to guidance, we expect full year 2015 results before special items as follows. Revenues are now expected to be between $7.49 million and $7.57 billion, an increase of 2% to 3% versus 2014 on an equivalent basis. Adjusted diluted EPS is unchanged, to be between $4.70 and $4.85. Adjusted cash provided by operations is expected to exceed $850 million, and capital expenditures are also unchanged to approximately $300 million. Now let me turn it back to Steve. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Mark. Well to summarize, we delivered solid bottom line growth in the second quarter. It was our third consecutive quarter of organic revenue growth. We continue to make good progress executing our strategy. We thank you for your time today, and we'll be happy to take any questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We will now open it up to questions. Our first question comes from Glen Santangelo from Credit Suisse. Sir, your line is open. Glen J. Santangelo - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah, thanks and good morning. Steve, just wanted to talk to you about volumes in the quarter. They were probably a little bit slower than what we would have estimated. I'm just kind of curious to get your perspective. If you think there's -- are you seeing any type of slowdown in the market or maybe is it more difficult comps from the ACA comparisons from last year or does it perhaps maybe reflect some business that maybe you've walked away from that you deemed to be less profitable? Any sort of color on underlying market trends would be helpful. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Let me start and then I'm going to pass it to Mark. Well, first of all, what I said in the opening remarks is we do this analysis where we look at our stable accounts, and we call it a same provider, same store analysis, and year-on-year what we said they were consistent with the prior years. So on an existing basis, we feel utilization is stable versus the prior year. So that's point number one. Point number two, as I said in our introductory remarks, we continue to steer our resources, our energy around the higher profit portion of the marketplace, whether that's with better solutions and we've gotten some growth. As a matter of fact, you see our growth in our higher end portion of our portfolio growing faster than our top-line growth. So that focus is paying off. And then it's also paying off in better revenue per requisition and, obviously, our growth and operating income. Some portion of that is related to growing the revenue in the right way to get profitable growth. And then I'll turn it to Mark because, as you know, in the past we've talked about some business that we have reconsidered over the last few quarters. We still had that in Q2. We'll start to lap that in the second half, but I'll let Mark provide some insight into that. Mark? Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, thanks, Steve. Glen, you're correct that I think some of that certainly is driven by some of the business that we've talked about for a while and that we thought was lower value add, and I think the fact that we were able to grow revenue and earnings validates that walking away from some of that volume, it was probably a good decision. And that does anniversary certainly through the second quarter, so we've talked about also the back half having easier comps than the front half. The other perspective I just want to provide is we talked about the weakness of using requisitions for volume. Certainly, we're responsible for that. That's what we provide, but there certainly are some watch-outs there, so the real important thing is obviously the tests. And I can tell you that test volumes actually grew despite the fact that requisition volumes declined in the quarter. So we feel good about the volumes. That's what we're trying to drive through our clinical franchise strategy is to actually drive a better outcome for patients, which in many cases means actually filling in more richer req than what it's been maybe in the past and some of the business we walked away were lower value, fewer test requisitions. So again, we just wanted to give you additional perspective. Actually, test volume did grow in the quarter. Glen J. Santangelo - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thank you very much. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Glen. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from A. J. Rice of UBS. Sir, your line is open. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Hi, everybody. Just thought I might ask, Steve, you mentioned in your prepared remarks about what's happening in Arizona with the direct access to tests, the legislation and I'm curious. I'm not sure I've heard you guys opine on that. What's your view about that? Is that something that you would promote in other states? And then more broadly, because Theranos has been in the news and I know they were also part of seeing that legislation pass, any update in your thinking about them or whether you're seeing anything from them competitively? Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, thanks for the question. First of all, we continue to look at the best way to engage with the healthcare marketplace by state. Arizona was notable because of the new law, and we're actively participating in that. I think some portion of all markets will access the healthcare system this way, not all, and it will be a growing trend with, as I said, the trend around the consumer and that's become an increasingly important part of our business. We also have been offering, A. J., access to our Blueprint for Wellness online. That's accessible beyond Arizona. And, as I said, we're expanding that with the Blueprint for Athletes offering. So as far as we're concerned, we're going to continue to evaluate where we get more aggressive in certain starts, where it makes sense, where we can still do it. As you know, all states are not created equal here. Arizona was very strong in this regard. We are trying to see how Arizona goes. As I said, we're actually encouraged by the initial results from what we see in Arizona and we do believe this is a trend we're on top of, and we're very well positioned. You asked a question about Theranos, they continue to be a regional lab that is getting additional labs, as you know. Probably, it's important for me to mention that part of the attention they've received is around Capital Blue in Pennsylvania. And I just wanted to reiterate for the people on this call that actually Capital Blue is a very strong partner of ours. And actually, interesting enough, despite that news, we actually extended our longstanding relationship with Capital Blue with a new contract in January of this year. And we are their only national laboratory and its preferred provider. And, actually, I have recently spoken with the CEO there, and he did note that the arrangement that they have with Theranos does not change, in any aspect, the agreement that they have with Quest. As a matter of fact, what we went on to talk about is the difficult challenges we faced in healthcare, and what we could do together to help with the challenges of healthcare cost and help with this membership. And what we offered to him, with our great quality and our great cost, is an important part of a solution he sees for his marketplace. So we are very well positioned with Capital Blue, and we're, again, one of their laboratories, but we're their only national laboratory and their preferred provider. So I wanted to share that with you. We obviously didn't share that publicly, but to give you some color of, in fact, what we have for a presence in many of our marketplaces despite news you might hear from others. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : That's great. I appreciate that. Thanks. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, A.J. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jack Meehan of Barclays. Sir, your line is open. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, thanks, and good morning. Dan Haemmerle - Executive Director- Investor Relations : Hi, Jack. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Jack. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hello. Just wanted to ask, you mentioned the growth in Medicaid and managed Medicaid in the quarter, and starting to see, potentially, some signs from health reforms starting to come through. I was wondering if you could just maybe parse that out and help us better understand because I think the belief was that new patients were coming through the emergency department. Do you think you're actually beginning to start to see some managed care come through the physician office? And then maybe states that have expanded versus states not expanded, if you've seen some sort of trend there. Thanks. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, well, first of all, and again, I'll start and Mark will add to it. On the managed Medicaid side, we are seeing increased volumes. It is in the states that have expanded Medicaid, to your question. As you mentioned, you can read and what we have heard is those states have seen an increase in those lives entering the system through hospitals. So there's some growth in volumes there. And also, you probably have seen in the last half, we published a study where we looked at diagnosis of diabetes in those states that expanded Medicaid versus those states that did not, and we actually saw an increase in the diagnosis of diabetes with those states that have expanded Medicaid. So the data is out there that expansion for the low-income portion of our population continues to gain momentum. For all intents and purposes, it's the lives increase that we have seen, and for all intents and purposes, it's hard to track this, as you know. It is the reduction we see in some portion of our uninsured patient volumes. So we think the momentum is building. The momentum is building for more insured lives, and as we said, back three years ago, we believe when people have insurance, they need what we do. We're at the core of healthcare, and we're 70% of healthcare decision making, at 2% of costs. So it's a very important part of getting a good baseline understanding of what's happening with someone's life. And, therefore, as they enter the system, we're going to see those volumes. So, Mark, would you like to add some color to Medicaid? Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, Jack, I'd say, as we've mentioned before, it's directional. We're seeing some growth in that area, but certainly not to the extent of what our fair share might be of over 10 million new lives in the system. Our belief is that it's going to take some of the newly insured a while to learn how to navigate the system. Their experience with healthcare has either been nothing or going to the hospital in an emergency setting for a lot of them. And they continue, I'd say, to utilize the hospital to a greater degree than they will over time. So, we're certainly expecting to get our fair share, but I think to this point, we're not there yet. And as I said, they need to figure out how to find a primary care physician, how to navigate the very complicated healthcare system, and then we'll see certainly more growth down the road. And we do see a growth that's fairly aligned with the states that have expanded Medicaid, certainly versus the states that have not, and we absolutely are seeing a reduction in the volume of our uninsureds. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Amanda Murphy of William Blair. Ma'am, your line is open. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Amanda. Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning. I just had a question on the JV with Quintiles. So I'm just curious. I know it's been \u2013 you only recently closed, but wondering if you could share just a general reaction from your side of the world, from clients, as well as if Quintiles might have shared any initial reactions on their side. And then I know you have a temporary agreement to share data, but any updates on how a relationship might work between you and Quintiles more broadly than the central lab? Thinking about economics of sharing data, and then potentially any revenue synergies that might come out of that data sharing. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, sure. First of all, our initial reaction from customers is quite good. We continue to build volume in the business that we moved over to the JV. When I say volume, I mean revenue and profit, and you saw that in some of our numbers, and then that's now part of the JV. So that's a strong combination with their strong business. We're doing this, as I said in my remarks, to build a stronger business when we put both resources together. And this is both in terms of addressing the market, so growing faster, and also taking some cost out. So we're going to be more profitable, and that's why we did it. So, reactions from those customers that we've gone out and spoke about how we're going to act together with Q2 Solutions has been quite good, and we're encouraged by that. The second part of your question, Amanda, has to do with the work we are going to do together now to tease out, if you will, the value we can create for drug discovery. The first part of this is we have this incredible capability in clinical chemistry and our data is very strong. And so, on the testing side, we believe by working proactively with Pharma, we could have an earlier bird's eye access to what we could do with diagnostics and typically have that access to help us be well positioned as the companion diagnostic partner with some of the new drugs that will enter the market in years to come. So that's one area that we're going to put some work into now that the initial JV has closed. And the second is just the data that we've talked about. We have data, they have data, Pharma has data. And how do we collaborate together to use that data, in a smart way, to improve drug discovery? And one idea that people have talked about, and we already have done some of this with our data already, is with better patient selection. And anything they can do to be more targeted and more precise and help with making drug discovery more efficient is a very good thing for our Pharma partners. So that's what we're going to spend some time in. As I said in my remarks, we're going to take some time now to work with the management team of Quintiles to see if we can find exactly what we will do. We're proud to say we have formed all of this in a very capital efficient way, and we're going to deliver good value for our shareholders. Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Amanda. Operator : Thank you . Our next question comes from Lisa Gill of JPMorgan. Ma'am, your line is open. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Lisa. Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, Steve, how are you? Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, good morning. Doing well. Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning. Thanks. I just had a couple quick questions here. I guess my first question would just be around PAMA. Do you have any thoughts or insights into the timing? I think that many of us are tired of sitting and waiting for it to come, but just wondering if you are hearing anything out of Washington, as far as the timing of that? Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, well, we continue to share the information we have with you all. As we shared, we said the goal was to have the draft guidance out in June. Well, we're past that date. But we continue to hear that we're going to be seeing something, not in the distant future, but hopefully in the near future. They're not specific on timing. And as I said in my remarks, it's because it is a very complex task that we're all taking on. We're all engaged. We're working proactively with them. Our trade association, ACLA, which I'm the chairman of, is actively engaged with them. So, we're entering this with the spirit of making sure we get the data we need to have to rebase the clinical schedule in 2017. And, again, we want to make sure it's a full view of the market, which includes all laboratories we compete with, and obviously that includes small independents, large nationals and hospital outreach labs because that's a big part of this market, as you all know. So we know what we have shared and we continue to be anxiously waiting, as you, for the guidelines. We'll have time to comment on that. We have a lot of data to collect in 2016 to get the refresh done in 2017. So that's the schedule we have. Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Is there anything that's changed your view that the full view of the market would be included based on any discussions that you've had in your role? Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, no, not at all. As a matter of fact, we've shared precisely what we shared with you, as far as the market \u2013 the competition in the market, which includes about a third of the market being hospital outreach. As you know, when you buy a hospital outreach business we have to go through antitrust reviews so, by definition, if you have to go through antitrust review, they are our competitor, and therefore they should be part of a full view of the market. So we haven't got any kind of push-back on that at all. So we continue to believe that we will be included because they should be included. Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great thank you. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Bonello of Craig-Hallum. Sir, your line is open. William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : Great. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Bill. William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : Hey, good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my call. Sort of a big picture question here on the hospital strategy. I'm just wondering if there's any metrics at all that you can share with us to give us some indication of how those deals are going. I don't know if there's a growth metric at what you've acquired or partnered with or a profit improvement or just something that gives us a sense of how that strategy is going and then just your thoughts on continued activity there going forward. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, yeah. Well first of all, we continue to be very encouraged. I would say that the interest on the lab strategy for hospitals and integrated delivery systems continues to grow. As I said in my comments, we are very encouraged by our funnel and our discussions. When you enter into discussions with large organizations, it takes a longer time to come to conclusion, but we're making progress on some bigger prospects that hopefully we will be sharing with you in the second half. With all that said, we've talked about us closing on a number ever opportunities already, and what I'll share with you in the back half, you'll see some more. We have not broken it out because typically what we do, Bill, is we take these opportunities and we fold those into our regions and that's how we can get synergies and we can have advantages for hospital systems working with us. In some cases, we offload some of the hospital test menu and we move them into our closely located laboratories, which allows them to benefit from our effectiveness and our cost structure within that hospital environment. So it's more difficult to tease it out, but we are encouraged by the trend and we think this is something that we've invested in as part of our growth strategy. We feel good that we've put our bets in a good place and there will be more to come on this in the quarters to come. William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : Thank you very much. Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Bill, as we shared, the six deals we closed in the prior year, were about worth $40 million in revenue. I will also mention that some of the first teals we did were smaller. It was kind of our proof point. So you shouldn't assume that that's the average deal we might close going forward. So as we've gotten more learning, we got more confident. We've engaged actually with some deals with the potential to be much larger than the average we've closed thus far. William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : Oh, very helpful. Thank you. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Bill. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Lieberman of Wells Fargo. Sir, your line is open. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just looking at the detailed EPS guidance in the press release. The overall number, the $470 million to $485 million is the same. The components moved around somewhat. Would it be possible just to go through those and sort of get some color on what each line item is moving around for? Dan Haemmerle - Executive Director- Investor Relations : Yes, typically in the press release tables, we update some of the line items around restructuring and some of the adjustments just for the year-to-date impact as much as anything else. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. So for the restructuring we should expect, I guess, that to continue to increase and then the - Dan Haemmerle - Executive Director- Investor Relations : That will increase as we move throughout the year with those adjustments, yeah. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And the diluted EPS, I guess, will be offset by that? So sort of assuming all else being equal, the total number to remain unchanged but the components to move around? Dan Haemmerle - Executive Director- Investor Relations : That's fair. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Any reason you guys do it that way and not sort of put the restructuring where you would expect the spending should be? Dan Haemmerle - Executive Director- Investor Relations : Not particularly. I mean, this is how we've done it historically and it's just based on our latest updates and latest actual results at that point. Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, Gary, as I mentioned earlier, we anticipate a significant gain on the creation of the joint venture, so that will be an adjustment in the other direction. What we also have mentioned is our attempt is to provide better information. That's why we do these adjustments and if you look at a three-year period, from 2012 through 2014, actually adjusted earnings and GAAP earnings are very, very close. So we have adjustments up, we have adjustments down. We're trying to provide clarity and to Dan's point, the reason we do the tables we have, is not that we're wed to anything specifically, but we're trying to be consistent to make it easier and clearer on our stakeholders. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe one follow-up, just on pricing, what are you seeing from competitors? Going back to Theranos, Theranos has put out sort of their very specific test menu with prices. Is that having any impact in your conversation with payers? Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, we're tracking to where we expect it to be for this year and also over the last three years. We have shared our guidance about three years ago, as far as what we expect to be seeing for price impact. We're in that envelope. So we feel good about our visibility on that. We've delivered on what we said it would be to you all. So you should have confidence we have a good handle on this. As far as pricing is concerned for 2016, what we shared is we see less pressure on the government side, based upon what we know about the clinical ad fee schedule and the physician fee schedule. So that's encouraging. And then we already got the question on PAMA what's happening in 2017 and beyond. We'll keep you abreast of what happens there. As far as visibility and pricing in the marketplace, as you know, the way patients and consumers engage with the marketplace, the question is, when do they actually have the out-of-pocket cost? And yes, we have published our own prices in Arizona and we think those prices are very competitive. When you look at our average price per requisition, if you were just to go through our 10-K and you just make an assumption around test per requisition, you see a very strong value proposition from Quest Diagnostics in the marketplace and as you know, most people in this country have insurance. That's a growing percentage over time. So therefore, for diagnostic testing, and as you also know, there's a portion of the Affordable Care Act that was related to screening and diagnostic testing. Some portion of what we do does not have out-of-pocket cost to consumers. So, how this all pans out as far as what the consumer will actually pay and how our prices affect kind of general visible and transparency of pricing in the marketplace, we'll see. The last part of this, I just want to reiterate, if you look at prices in this industry, there's wide disparities on prices. Hospital outreach organizations are sometimes in the neighborhood of two to five times more expensive than our prices. We think transparency around all of that for consumers and for health plans to provide to their membership is very important, and we're right in back of all that because we think that serves us very well, because our quality and our price of that quality is really unsurpassed in our marketplace. And so the more volume we get around that, the better for us, we believe. Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, and I just want to add this important distinction. So the direct-to-consumer prices are really a self-pay price. So for anybody who's got commercial insurance, and depending on your plan, even if you make the decision yourself on a test, there could be coverage and there might be coverage, you'll get the negotiated commercial rate. And in fact, our prices with people who have commercial insurance are not all that different than the competitor mentioned. So we feel pricing is actually an advantage for us. We'd like to see more transparency. Our largest national provider has a tool where people who are a part of their plan can go to their site and can actually shop and we think that's a real positive thing. So we're in support of pricing transparency. But there is a difference between what self-pay price might be and what people have under their commercial coverage Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Got it. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Cherny of Evercore ISI. Sir, your line is open. Michael Aaron Cherny - Evercore ISI : Good morning, guys. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Michael. Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Good morning, Michael. Michael Aaron Cherny - Evercore ISI : So, just one quick housekeeping question. I apologize if I missed this. Did you give the acquisition contribution specifically related to volume in the quarter? Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : We did not because the acquisitions pretty much \u2013 (49:19) anniversaried in Q1 and Summit was at the very beginning of April. So it's just inconsequential, so we didn't tease that out. Michael Aaron Cherny - Evercore ISI : Perfect. That's helpful. I just want to type the model there. And then, you talked a lot about the pipeline related to the hospital businesses, and obviously, also, your M&A strategy. As you think about the moving pieces related to regulatory changes between SCOTUS finally being decided, the upcoming pending decision on PAMA, whichever way that's going to shake out, how does that impact the M&A environment? How does it impact the discussions you're having as part of that pipeline? Is there a rush to get deals done in the face of uncertainty related to the moving piece? Is there a wait and see until we get particularly something like PAMA out of the way? So I would think that either way, whichever way PAMA shakes out, it would probably open up some opportunities in terms of closing down or closing out deals in the pipeline versus what you may have right now. So I'm just trying to get a sense of how that's changed the discussion, if anything, if that's had any impact as well on the types of multiples that sellers want from you. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Well, we just say, in general, it's not changing our pace of our acquisition portion of our strategy. We have always had and will continue to have going forward, as a portion of our Restore growth strategy, of having about 1% to 2% top-line growth from acquisitions. So our growth strategy is both organic and through acquisitions. So, it's an important part of our strategy. And because of that, we've been actively engaged on it. We announced the Memorial deal already. We said that we have more in our pipeline, so you should expect that there will be something else to come. As far as the deals itself, we continue to be very disciplined with how an acquisition would fit into our strategy, it has to be strategically aligned, and we have to meet our financial thresholds. And when we look at that, we continue to be prospective on what we think might happen with payment going forward. And you did mention PAMA and what could happen with the clinical lab fee schedule, but it is an unknown for the whole industry. So, I would say in general, that's not an active consideration right now, and just what's happening in the general environment is not changing our pace or perspective on any of this right now. Michael Aaron Cherny - Evercore ISI : Great. Thanks, Steve. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Whit Mayo of Robert Baird. Sir, your line is open. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey, thanks. Good morning. Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Good morning. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, good morning. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Mark, can you just give us a sense of maybe where you are on Invigorate in terms of realized savings at this point halfway through the year, and what you expect for all of 2015? And then maybe just qualitatively, give us a sense of where you see some of the savings coming from. Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yes, so we haven't broken out the incremental $600 million that we talked about, taking us from over $700 million at the end of 2014 to $1.3 billion over the next several years. So we haven't broken that down by year, having suggested that it's proportional. However, obviously, you can see, as we committed, that some of that Invigorate is now starting to help us to actually grow profitability and not just to offset some of the headwinds. So we haven't teased out the exact numbers at this point, Whit, but you shouldn't expect that it should be skewed heavily in one direction or another. The $600 million is going to be fairly steady over the next couple of years. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then maybe just qualitatively, just maybe where do you see a lot of the savings coming from at this point? Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, so it's the things we talked about. Obviously, you start with some of the things, basic, such as procurement excellence, certainly some of the lab efficiencies that we're driving through our Quest Management System. We did talk about some things that probably are going to be skewed toward the back end in terms of the full savings that Jim Davis referred to specifically, the three planks about e-enablement, certainly getting paid more for the work that we do and the value that we provide, those things. Some of the things are going to take a little longer, though certainly were in the early stages. We've talked about starting to implement credit cards in our patient service centers, starting to put them in some \u2013 inner office (53:46) to actually get payment more upfront, instead of having to chase it after the fact, more similar to what the rest of the healthcare industry has been doing for quite a while. So, it's not as if some of these things are going to not start until the back end, but some of them are just going to take longer to get to their full level of savings. All of those things, along with some of the things that we've been doing for the last several years, are going to continue to help us drive Invigorate up to that next level of $1.3 billion. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): No, that's helpful. And maybe just one last one for Steve. I mean, obviously, CMS has missed the statutory deadline to publish the clinical lab fee schedule. And just any idea why we haven't seen this, and just any updated expectations and thoughts on PAMA and the data collection process? Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: All I can share is when we've engaged with them, and I said this in my remarks, this is very complex. There's \u2013 we're one of thousands of laboratories. We have thousands of tests. They need to \u2013 and we have hundreds of payer contracts, and we're one. So if you go through the math, I mean, the degree of complexity by code is significant. So they're trying to understand how they collect the data in a reasonable way, and then curate that data to be able to make some sense out of it. And so as they got into it, it is a tall order for them to try to accomplish. So that's what I would share as the reason why I believe that they have not, missed the deadline and continue to be silent on when they think they're going to get this done. With all that said, it is what we have to try to figure out, and we do want to continue to work with them in good faith as an industry to get this put together, so we can get the data and have them share with us what they think the clinical lab fee schedule will be in 2017. So that's what I can share, Whit, that's what we know. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, great. I guess, we'll just wait and see. Thanks. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. Sir, your line is open. Jason Michael Plagman - Jefferies LLC : Hey, guys, this is Jason Plagman on for Brian. A question on \u2013 so your organic volume growth has been around flat for the last year or so. Are you seeing anything in the market that would lead you to believe that'll change significantly in either the second half of 2015 or 2016? Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, well, what we have shared is that some portion of that organic volume for us is related to decisions we have made. And some of those are strategic as far as where we're focusing our energy in the higher end portion of our portfolio, and some of it is around customers. And we also have shared in the back half, some of that becomes an easier comp for us. And, Mark, why don't you just share perspective on what we've talked about in the last three quarters or four quarters and then what will happen in the back half with our organic performance on volumes and revenue? Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, well, as I noted before, you've seen that despite some volume declines, we've actually been able to grow revenue the last several quarters. So first off, I want to mention that. But yes, as Steve mentioned, we did have some of that volume, less profitable volume that we walked away from, and that's gotten behind us. And then we did also cite some competitive losses, Department of Defense was one of them that was a while back. A lot of the implementation really happened over the last 12 months. And then there was a large Blue's plan in Philadelphia, Independence Blue Cross, where we were at par with our chief competitor, and they negotiated a rate to exclude us. So we did have that loss. Now, that again largely gets behind us as we go into the back half of the year. So those two large losses combined with the volumes that we walked away from have made volume certainly a headwind over the last 12 months, but those comps get a lot easier in the back half. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Just to underscore what Mark has said, we continue to share with you that our Restore growth plan is both organic and through acquisition. We feel very good that in the first half, we grew greater than 3% growth in revenues. It's a good number. Some portion out of that is organic and some portion through acquisitions. As you know, in the second quarter, we were lighter in acquisitions, and we provided you guidance in the back half of the year. And that 3% growth has allowed us to grow earnings at the level that we have, and it's real earnings. If you look at our operating income, it's up nicely versus last year. We're proud of that. And, also, we've gotten expansion, margin expansion. So, we think we've got the right formula here that we're working, and we'll continue that formula because at the end of the day, as you all know, the way we're going to get our value up for this company is to continue to grow our earnings, and we think we're on the right path to do that. Jason Michael Plagman - Jefferies LLC : Thanks, guys. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Ma'am, your line is open. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Ricky. Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Good morning, Ricky. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah, hi. Good morning, and thank you for squeezing me in. So, a couple of questions, follow-up questions here. First of all, Mark, you highlight the fact that test volumes were actually up despite requisition coming down. So, can you just give us a little bit more detail on, on average, how many tests per requisition you're seeing now, and how does this compares to kind of maybe last quarter or last year? And then also, how does this go over to pricing? I mean, obviously, that should be positive for average revenue per requisition, but just that we get a sense because pricing was positive for the first time in a very long time. I know you talked about esoteric is a positive trend, but if you can just help us kind of like think about number of tests per requisition versus test mix. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, Ricky, your first question, we have provided some visibility on our requisition volume over the years and also what tests we have seen annually. And, Dan, why don't you share those numbers we've shared in the past? Dan Haemmerle - Executive Director- Investor Relations : Yeah, so what we said is in terms of requisitions, we said last year was requisition count was about $156 million. We said that in general, we see, on average, about three to four tests per requisition. When you think about that and on your question about the revenue per requisition growth, just keep in mind, that's a combination of both the pricing and reimbursement pressure that we're seeing, as well as the benefits of some of the test and business mix shifts. So when you think about pure pricing, the reimbursement pressure is a little bit less than 1% for the quarter. And so, how we got to that favorable revenue per acquisition overall is really being driven by favorable test and business mix shifts. Steve and Mark both mentioned gene-based and esoteric testing had \u2013 grew very nicely in the second quarter, grew in the first quarter as well. And so, some of the benefits of those additional tests on requisitions, as well as a richer test in some of the things that we are selling, has benefited that revenue per requisition calculation. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And that outcome is not a coincidence. It is a consequence of our strategy, to steer a larger portion of our portfolio to where we can make more money and where we can deliver value. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then, Steve, a follow-up question on \u2013 just to get your market perspective. In the past, the number of tests that are offered on a menu has been, I think, a limiting factor or a critical factor for a lab to penetrate the provider segment, whether it's ambulatory or hospital. Is that still the case? And what do you think is that critical number? Do you need to have 250 tests on your menu, do you need 1,000 tests, do you need more than that? Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, we \u2013 as one of our elements of our value that we deliver to all our clients, including integrate delivery systems in hospitals, is we have one of the broadest test menu of anyone. So, as you know, we've got the most routine and the most advanced, and we're bringing new science to the marketplace every day. We're proud of that, and we think it will continue to be a differentiator. The hospital market, the referencer (01:02:40) market, is a more concentrated marketplace. It's \u2013 there's no specific number because in addition to the test menu, it includes consideration about quality and service and reputation in the marketplace. And, yes, pricing is a consideration for that as well. So, you have to put all of those elements together to eventually really understand what happens at the end of the day of us getting reference work and more hospital business versus others. So, there's no particular number that we can see. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then just what is self-pay as a percent of your revenues? Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : About low single digits. I think it's about 2%. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Ricky. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. I think we're up on time. So I just wanted to say once again that we believe we had another good quarter. We are making solid progress executing our strategy. We appreciate your time here today and we hope you have a great day. So take care and see you in our travels.

Dan Haemmerle - Executive Director- Investor Relations : Thank you, and good morning. I'm here with Steve Rusckowski, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and also discuss non-GAAP measures. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in Quest Diagnostics 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Our earnings press release is available and the text of our prepared remarks will be available later today in the Investor Relations Quarterly Update section of our website at www.questdiagnostics.com. A PowerPoint presentation and spreadsheet with our results and supplemental analysis are also available on the website. Now, here's Steve Rusckowski. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Dan, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. This morning I'll provide you with the highlights of the quarter, share a few comments on the industry dynamics, and review progress on our five-point strategy. And then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through guidance. We grew revenues, margins and earnings in the third quarter. Revenues grew 1% on an equivalent basis to $1.9 billion. Adjusted operating income grew approximately 7% and operating margin expanded by 130 basis points compared to the prior year, once again reflecting improved operational efficiency. And adjusted diluted EPS increased approximately 7% to $1.28. Before I get into our strategy update, I'd like to talk to you about industry dynamics, starting with the recent CMS proposal related to PAMA. We are currently reviewing the draft and are sharing our perspective with the trade association. As you're well aware, this is an important issue for every lab because it will result in a refresh of CMS' clinical lab fee schedule, which will apply to independent physician and hospital laboratories for their fee for service Medicare payments. We have said all along that PAMA needs to be built on an accurate representative view of the market. We were disappointed that the draft provided as many limitations as it did to the definition of applicable lab. In a recent study, the Office of Inspector General reported that the two largest independent labs represented only approximately 17% of the total Medicare spending from the clinical lab fee schedule, while hospitals and physician offices represented nearly half of the total Medicare spend. PAMA stands for Protecting Access to Medicare Act. It would be a terrible irony if the data collection process demanded by PAMA had the unintended consequence of reducing access to critical laboratory services that could cause some labs to close their doors to Medicare beneficiaries. Additionally, the coding containment proposals recently released by CMS jeopardized the advancement of personalized medicine. These proposals failed to take into consideration the value provided from clinically validated information that further advances more targeted and sophisticated approaches to patient care. That said, we remain optimistic that the proposed rulemaking will result in an outcome that the industry can live with even if it takes a bit more time to finalize. Now, let me shift to the progress we're making on our five-point strategy. To remind you, it's to restore growth, drive operational excellence, simplify the organization, refocus on the core diagnostic information service business, and deliver disciplined capital deployment. Well, let's start with growth. This was the fourth consecutive quarter of organic revenue growth on a consolidated equivalent basis. Let me share with you some key elements of our strategy. First, revenues from our gene-based and esoteric testing revenues continued to grow. We also saw significant growth through infectious disease testing, prescription drug monitoring and our industry-leading wellness business. Our science and innovation team continues to work with our clinical franchises to bring new solutions to the market. In October, we announced the launch of two companion diagnostic solutions for non-small cell lung cancer based on the recent FDA-approved Merck therapy, called KEYTRUDA, as well as Bristol-Myers Squibb's therapy, called OPDIVO. Both diagnostic tests are from Dako, an Agilent company. Second, over the past few years, we've outlined our strategy to partner more effectively with hospital systems. We have shared our view that hospitals will look to partner with us in running their in-patient laboratories as well as their outreach service models, and we expect to announce additional agreements by the end of the year. Finally, over the past few quarters, we've shared additional proof points on our three information solutions that help customers with population health, data analytics and decision support tools. Specifically, our Interactive Insights for physicians, our IntelliTest Analytics Solutions for hospitals and health systems and finally, our Quest analytics platform. In late September, we announced our partnership with Inovalon to deliver our data diagnostic solution. Our data diagnostic solution will provide a real-time point of service suite of analysis to physicians at the patient level. This solution will help physicians improve care through a better understanding of the patient's medical history and review that history gives relevant quality metrics through the use of big data and real-time connectivity solutions. These solutions will help deliver valuable insights precisely when and where clinicians need them most. We believe this value-added information will help drive the transformation from volume to value-based healthcare. The second element of our strategy is driving operational excellence. We continue to make progress with our focus on building e-enabling services, standardizing our processes data and systems, and improving cash collections. We continue to move closer to achieving our Invigorate goal of $1.3 billion in cumulative run rate savings by the end of 2017. We continue to simplify and strengthen our organization, which is the third element of our strategy. We are proud of the professionalism and commitment of our employees, which has enabled us to be included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the past 12 years. Quest Diagnostics was one of only eight healthcare equipment and services companies listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability North American Index and one of only 11 companies listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index in the same category. The fourth element of our strategy is to refocus on our core business. In July, we finalized the joint venture transaction with Quintiles. The new entity, now known as Q2 Solutions, is off to a great start with strong culture built on collaborative strengths of both JV partners. We continue to review our portfolio, look at options for non-core assets and are focused on building value for our shareholders. And then finally, we remain focused on the fifth element of our strategy; delivering disciplined capital deployment. Year-to-date, we have returned approximately $330 million to our shareholders through a combination of dividend and share buybacks. Additionally, we continue to invest in our business and announced two acquisitions. Looking forward, we continue to have a strong M&A pipeline. Now, Mark will provide an overview of our third quarter financial performance and walk you through the details of our 2015 outlook, which is based on our strong operational performance. Mark? Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues, consolidated revenues of $1.88 billion increased by 0.9% versus the prior year on an equivalent revenue basis; that is excluding the third quarter 2014 clinical trials revenue. On a GAAP, or reported basis revenues, were lower by 1.3%. Revenues for diagnostic information services were flat to the prior year. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, declined by 0.2% versus the prior year. Revenue per requisition was 0.2% better than the prior year, marking the second consecutive quarter that revenue per requisition grew compared to the prior year. While reimbursement pressure continued to be a moderate headwind, we were able to more than offset that pressure through test and business mix. This reflects our strategy to grow our esoteric testing business and drive profitable growth Moving to our diagnostic solutions business, which now includes risk assessment, healthcare IT and our remaining products businesses, revenues grew by approximately 18% on an equivalent basis compared to the prior year. That is again excluding the third quarter 2014 clinical trials testing revenue. On a reported basis, diagnostic solutions revenues were lower by approximately 17% from a year ago. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $325 million or 17.3% of revenues compared to $304 million or 16% of revenues a year ago. The improvement of 130 basis points can be primarily attributed to efficiencies from our Invigorate program. In the quarter, adjusted net income grew by approximately 7% compared to a year ago. For the quarter, adjusted EPS, excluding amortization was $1.28, 6.7% better than a year ago. In the quarter, reported operating income benefited from the $334 million pre-tax gain on our contribution to the clinical trials testing joint venture. This benefit was partially offset by net charges related primarily to restructuring and integration costs totaling $28 million. Overall, net adjustments benefited reported diluted EPS by $1.17. Last year's third quarter reported operating income was reduced by $48 million or $0.22 per diluted share principally due to restructuring and integration costs. Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 3.9%, 20 basis points better than last quarter and 10 basis points better than a year ago. Our DSOs were 44 days, two days lower than the prior year and flat to last quarter. As Steve mentioned, we continue to improve our cash collections at a time when there is a growing portion for the healthcare bill paid by patients. Reported cash provided by operations was $212 million in the third quarter of 2015. Adjusted cash provided by operations was $188 million in the quarter, excluding cash tax benefits realized during the quarter, related to the recent debt retirement. In the third quarter of 2014, reported cash provided by operations was $271 million. Cash provided by operations was lower than a year ago largely due to a payment against certain tax reserves in the third quarter of 2015. Capital expenditures were $52 million in the quarter compared to $102 million a year ago. Before moving to guidance, let me share a few comments to help you frame our guidance for the remainder of the year. First, we delivered strong results for the quarter that are in line with our expectations for the full year. Second, through the first three quarters of this year, we have shown steady growth in operating income and will continue to see improvement in Q4. However, this improvement will be largely offset by a higher effective tax rate in Q4. As a result, we anticipate a slower earnings growth rate in the fourth quarter than we have seen throughout the first nine months of the year. Moving to guidance, we now expect full year 2015 results before special items as follows. Revenues are now expected to be approximately $7.49 billion; adjusted diluted EPS, excluding amortization to be between $4.75 and $4.80, basically unchanged from previous guidance with the tightening on both ends of the range. Adjusted cash provided by operations to exceed $850 million and capital expenditures are now expected to approximate $275 million. Now, let me turn it back to Steve. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Mark. While we delivered another solid quarter as many of you recall at last year's Investors Day, we shared our expectation that we would deliver revenue growth of 2% to 5% and earnings growth of 8% to 10% over the next three years. Through the first nine months of this year, we are meeting that outlook. Revenues are up by more than 2% on an equivalent basis and earnings are up by 10% from a year ago. We're pleased with our performance and are on track to meet our expectations for the full year. I'd like to say that 45,000 dedicated employees that work at Quest remain focused on delivering a superior customer experience every day. This commitment is helping us to execute our strategy and deliver on our commitments. Now, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. The first question comes from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Isaac. Operator : Sir, please check your mute button. Dan Haemmerle - Executive Director- Investor Relations : Isaac? You want to move onto the next question, Christine? And if Isaac comes back in, we'll take him. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes, hi. Good morning. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Ricky. Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Good morning, Ricky. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So just had kind of like a follow-up question on the volume and one on PAMA. So we talked a lot over kind of like the first half of the year about the easing comp into second half around the contracts, right, with your anniversary from last year. We haven't really kind of like seen a significant uptick in the third quarter; so can you just kind of like walk us through kind of like what you're seeing in evolving environment and how should we be thinking about volumes for the remaining of the year? Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. So thanks, Ricky. Well, first of all, let me go back and refresh ourselves on where we've come from and the progress we've made. Then, we'll talk about specifically what we're seeing in Q3 and Mark and I will tag team this. First of all, if you recall, back in 2017, we said at our first Investor Day that this had been a company that had declining volumes and we needed to first slow down the rate of decline, flatten that out and start to show improvement and continue to show progressive improvement, and that it would take time. So if you think about the past few years, if you go back to 2013, our organic revenue declined by about 4%. If you go back to 2013, our organic revenues shrank by about 2%. As you know, what we just said is in the last four consecutive quarters, we've seen our organic revenue growing by 1%, so we are making progress. And then if you look at it, what we're doing to grow our business and also grow our margins is to focus on the larger req portion of our business and the richer req portion of our business, which is the more sophisticated, esoteric and genetic piece of our business, which is growing faster. And what you've seen for the last two quarters is nice progress in our revenue per requisition, which is helping us both in revenue as well as profit growth for the quarter. And then also, our growth strategy, as you know, is not just related to organic growth but also grow through acquisitions. We do plan in our strategy 1% to 2% growth through acquisitions with the exception of MemorialCare and what we just announced last night, which is a smaller acquisition in our ExamOne business. We haven't had a material acquisition as soon in the year as we expected. However, what you did hear in my commentary, we do have a strong M&A pipeline and we do expect to be seeing some of that come out in the months ahead. So let me turn now to Mark of what we saw in the third quarter in terms of our volumes and the general environment we're seeing. Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yes, so thanks, Steve. Ricky, as Steve mentioned, we are making progress. We certainly would have liked to have seen even stronger volume in the third quarter. We did see a couple of things, a couple of trends I'll mention. And as we've also talked about in the past, we don't have any sort of independent market data. So our sense is that the market softened a bit in the third quarter based on the utilization basis. And what I would point to is there was some softness broadly across all of our regions, which would suggest it's more market versus class performance, more pronounced in July and August and it rebounded a little bit in September. It was certainly stronger in September. And we've also shared that we have what we call the same account analysis, which is our way of trying to assess utilization. And versus the trend we saw in the first half of the year, we definitely saw a bit of softness in that analysis. We also have been working closely with a couple of potential M&A targets. We saw softness in their volumes as well, which has also slowed down some of those deals to make sure that we understood how much of that was market and how much of that was unique to those potential targets. So, just a couple of data points that definitely make us feel that there was some market softness in Q3. So, yes, we would have liked to have made stronger volume progress. We do think it was largely market-based; certainly expecting to be somewhat temporary. But as Steve pointed out, despite that, we still are continuing to progress and restoring our growth. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. And then just a one follow-up on PAMA; I mean, Steve, obviously you kind of like you highlighted it in your prepared comments. When we think about kind of like the current proposed kind of like rate cuts and when you think about your mix, how should we think about the potential impact if it were to be implemented in 2017 now that you have the data points? Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Well, first of all, the final guidelines are not out and as I said in my commentary, we're not accepting those guidance \u2013 those guidelines and we now are in the comment period. We'll actually meet with CMS in November. I want to say us; it's myself as Chairman of the trade association, American Clinical Laboratory Association with some of my colleagues. We'll meet with CMS to talk through the glaring flaws in their collection of the data. As I said in my commentary, this is supposed to be a representative view of the marketplace to exclude a large portion of the marketplace, which based upon what we understand there are applicable law \u2013 lab definition will exclude a large piece of the physicians' offices as well as some portion of the hospital marketplace. And as I said, that's a large piece of who's providing Medicare laboratory services, so that's a big problem. Second is, if you look to the timing, they're going to receive feedback from a number of people, not just the trade association, but independent concerned parties in the fourth quarter. They need to then finalize the guideline and then start collecting the data. Another inconsistency of what they sent out is a view that we could start providing the data in the first quarter of 2016. While we can't provide the data until we have a final rule, so that's a contradiction in what they've sent out. So we're going to talk to them about that. So as we all know, this has been pushed out. It's already been late and, again, this is supposed to be in a place where we're going to collect all the data in 2016 and refresh the clinical lab schedule by 2017. What I'm sharing with you is, it's already late and my sense is that we're going to have more delays in 2016 with finalizing the rules and then collecting the data and understanding how that does affect the clinical lab fee schedule. As far as the potential reductions of our clinical lab fee schedule, until we collect the data and I've said this all along, we don't know what the results are going to be. Frankly, when we looked at the data we've gathered, we shared the Avalere study from the trade association. There were notable differences when you do a fair representative review of the marketplace and so we need to gather data to see what the results are. Now in their guidance that they've sent out, they did speak to a couple of estimates of what they think the range to be. And we've shared before that it's about 12% of our revenues for Quest Diagnostics. We're not going to speculate of what any reductions there could be because we're not certain about this, but it's 12% of our revenues or whatever reduction there may be would have an effect on that 12%. So, hopefully that's clear. Operator : The next question comes from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. You may ask your question. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Great. Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Hey. Good morning. Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Good morning. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): So I guess, a follow-up on the utilization comment, I was hoping you could just add a little color to the comment around some of the market softness that you're seeing. Was that I guess overall utilization or should we think about that being specific to any particular sub-segment, like drug testing for example? Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Mark, you want to... Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : No, that was overall. That was not segment specific. Generally, when we're commenting it's the largest portion of our business that we're commenting on any \u2013 not any of the unique sub-segments. So actually, we saw some pockets of strength so it seems as if some hiring may have picked up in the economy so actually that business is doing better than the broader business but it's kind of the base overall routine in esoteric testing volumes compared to the trend we have seen earlier seem to slow a bit in July and August especially. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And though we did see, as we said, we did see some pick-up at the end of the quarter and we did see good growth once again in our genetic and esoteric business. We said that last quarter as well. We're encouraged by that and our results on revenue per req is reflecting that. And we think that's an important aspect of our strategy for growth and an important aspect of our strategy for growing earnings, and you're seeing it reflected in our numbers, so we feel good. Prescription drug monitoring needs to be a nice growth opportunity for us and we continue to drive our wellness business which is something that we feel strongly about going forward as a good growth driver for us. So it's really related to the overall base of business. We do the same store analysis we talked about before. We take our existing accounts that we know they're our accounts. We do analytic on that to prepare volumes this year versus last year and there was some softness in Q3 versus what we saw in the last few quarters. So it was notable, particularly at the start of the quarter and strengthened as the quarter continued. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Very good. And then just I guess one more on PAMA. You certainly kind of outlined a number of the limitations with respect to the proposed data collection document. Any way to ballpark kind of where you \u2013 or are what the odds of that getting expanded to including more hospitals? Steve, I mean, you spoke pretty confidently about some of the problems with the document and then mentioned obviously that you're going to be sitting down with these guys, or CMS rather in November, but where do you put the odds of potentially seeing that expanded to reflect a more broader representation of the industry? Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, I can't place odds on what happens in Washington. I don't think anyone can. We're working on this. We want to make sure we get this right. There is a bill passed by Congress. It's called Protecting Access to Medicare Act. It was intended to refresh our clinical lab fee schedule, which hasn't been updated since the 1980s. It was very strongly felt by Congress that the right way to do it is to take a market-based approach; look at the market, understand what our people are paying on the commercial side and then reflect that in the clinical lab fee schedule. To exclude 50% of who's providing Medicare laboratory testing is a glaring flaw in the definition of the relative market. So we're going to be all over this. We have been all over this and we'll continue to work it. And again, it has been delayed. It's hard for us to understand how they're going to be able to collect the data in the early part of 2016 to be able to adjust this fee schedule in 2017, but that remains to be their goal. And we'll see how this evolves but I'm sharing with you exactly where we stand right now. And we have a huge initiative as a trade association but also in reflecting the access comments I made. When you look at the large part of this marketplace being provided for by small independent laboratories and you think about those rates not being included in the market, we know that, that could create an issue for many of them and therefore, Medicare beneficiaries were not going to get the lab test and that's going to be a huge issue for Congress. So we're going to work our way through this but we're going to do this in due course of the process that we have within CMS. Operator : The next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays. You may ask your question. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Thanks, and good morning. I just wanted to ask another question on PAMA, and certainly understand we don't have perfect data today without the survey, but just as you look at the framework that CMS used to lay out what an applicable lab is, it appears, at least based on the definition today, that Quest and lab were going to be a good portion of the survey. I think it's around 1/3. What do you think as you look at some of your rates on the routine side of the business versus what Medicare is today? Do you think the 6.5% cut that they laid out is a reasonable assumption to use? Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Again, I'll repeat what I said earlier. Until they gather the data, it's hard for us to speculate what the results will be. We don't have, along with they, good visibility on the rates. That's why they want to gather the data. We don't know what other analysis commercial contract rates are by code. There's an enormous amount of data here. We have over 3,000 tests. We have multiple contracts. And if you read what they propose, it has to be done by TIN number, which adds more complexity. So if you look at what we have to do, it's a lot of reporting and we're just one of hundreds of labs that are required to report. So we've got to go through the data. As far as what was in that report or in the guidance around an estimate, we're not sure where those estimates come from other than an interesting data point with some cherry-picked results that they've seen. We'll see what the data supports and we'll make sure there is sort of a thorough process to get to our fair rates in the marketplace for the value we deliver. Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : And, Jack, as I'm sure you're aware, when we looked at the Avalere study, even without hospitals, we didn't expect significant reductions in the clinical lab fee schedule. When we shared that, hospitals were included. In fact, in many cases, Medicare was paying less. So you then have the CBO scoring which is another data point which would suggest more reductions than Avalere but certainly not anything overly draconian and then you have what's come out from CMS based on their proposal being even higher. So these estimates are all over the board. As Steve said, until we get some actual data it's kind of hard to answer that question. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes, that's fair. And then just one around the commentary around the M&A pipeline; do you think that some of the discussion around PAMA has either delayed some of the transactions taking place or does that change the way you evaluate targets in the market? Thanks. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, first of all, many hospital outreach labs that we look at and we have purchased have a larger percentage of their business with Medicare. And so we do take into consideration what the Medicare rates will be in our evaluation of the business. Second is if that in fact is true, then we believe this could be a further catalyst of more outreach businesses interested in looking at their options. And what we've said we have a nice M&A pipeline. Many of those assets that we're considering are hospital outreach assets. And we're encouraged by it and we still believe with the projections of what we have for rates that on the cost synergies when you realize by bringing their volumes into our infrastructure, we can build a nice business case related to the cost synergies associated with those acquisitions. So it's been a deliberate part of our strategy. It's key to what we believe will happen in this marketplace that is more hospitals relying on us for their laboratory services. And the second part of our working with hospitals or hospital outreach opportunities where we help them with their impatient laboratory, we are working on a number of very large opportunities there and we hope to share some of that with you in the next few months and going into 2016. So stay posted, but we're encouraged by the progress and I think all the change that we see happening in healthcare in general is going to be a further catalyst for more interest than what we've been talking about for several years. Operator : The next question comes from Amanda Murphy with William Blair. You may ask your question. Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Amanda, how are you? Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: Mark \u2013 good. Mark, I just had a follow-up, I don't think we specifically addressed why you guys expect to be at the lower end of revenue guidance for the year. I apologize if I missed that. Are we to assume it's because of some of the volume commentary you made or is there something else there that we should be thinking about? Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : That's a large driver certainly, Amanda, but the other one is if you recall after the first quarter when we had a little more impact from weather than we had anticipated, at that point I shared that for us to get towards the upper end of the range, we would've had to execute some meaningful M&A. So while we went into the year thinking we could do the 2% to 3% without any M&A after the first quarter headwinds we had based on weather, especially in the Northeast, and in Boston specifically record snowfalls where we have a very important share and a large portion of our business that it was going to take some M&A. So as you've seen that we have announced two deals this year, one of them just last night, Superior, and then MemorialCare. Those are not large enough at this point and we're not done early enough to contribute significantly in 2015. So therefore, a combination of a little bit of unexpected volume softness in Q3 and then not getting a deal done in a \u2013 large enough deal in a timely fashion is really the two drivers. Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. Okay. And then I had a question on Q2. I know it's a bit early there but I'm curious if you can talk about how the two companies are sort of going to market? Is there any evidence yet of any competitive advantages from the combination at this point recognizing it's still pretty early there? Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, it is still early but we're encouraged. We closed in July. We've consolidated our business into one Q2 Solutions. We are now working through the integration that we've put in place. We still believe there's a nice business case of a creation opportunity for the joint venture now that will realize 40% of in subsequent years so we're still encouraged by that. And then second, to your point, the days are still early but this market has consolidated and we're now in a smaller subset of companies who are now addressing the marketplace and we believe that now with Quintiles and us working together, we have a stronger presence with pharma and we're optimistic about the prospects. So as that develops and we have some opportunities to talk about as far as wins within the joint venture, we will and I'm sure Quintiles will as well but it's still early with that but we're encouraged. Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks very much. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Bill Bonello with Craig-Hallum. You may ask your question. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Bill. William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : Great. Good morning, guys. A couple of questions; so for the last several quarters and especially this quarter, you're starting to show some really impressive growth from an operating income standpoint, which is something that we haven't seen for years frankly. And I'm trying to understand as you look forward, whether you think that kind of leverage either through cost savings or other factors is sustainable into 2016 and beyond? Do you think if you don't see an uptick in sort of volume or pricing that it would be, you would have to revert back to sort of lower operating income growth or is there enough on the cost saving side that you can drive growth even if the macro environment sort of doesn't improve? And then I do have a follow-up after that. Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yes, thanks for the question, Bill. I'm sure you recall that at the Investor Day in November, I talked about and Steve talked about the fact that we thought \u2013 we foresaw 2% to 5% revenue growth through 2017; 1% to 2% of that coming from M&A, so on organic level of growth of 1% to 3%, and earnings growth, not earnings per share but earnings growth, of 8% to 10%. And that was going to be fueled by three drivers. One was going to be some of the continued synergies and leverage we would get out of the transactions we executed in 2014 carrying into 2015. The second driver was our Invigorate program which moving our goal from $700 million in run rate savings to $1.3 billion and we didn't lay out how that would drop through by year. But given the size of that growth in savings and efficiencies, we talked about the fact that contrary to the past several years, it would be large enough to not just offset the headwinds that Invigorate had paid for in the earlier years of the annual wage inflation and some sort of price erosion but actually would contribute to the bottom line and that that would be significant. And then yes, the third lever was as we return to organic growth and there's a fairly high drop-through and that would help us to leverage our earnings growth faster than revenue as well. So those are the three levers and while we're a little bit disappointed in the softness of Q3, we have grown. As Steve pointed out, revenue was minus 400 basis points in 2013, minus 200 basis points last year and plus 100 basis points this year. So we are growing and we are getting some leverage and we expect to continue that progress. So a long-winded answer but while we haven't given any guidance for 2016 yet, the outlook I laid out would suggest yes we are confident that we will continue to grow our earnings faster than our top line. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And, Bill, just to follow up with that, I said in my introductory comments we continue to believe that we can deliver on that goal we set out which is the additional savings opportunity. We exited 2014 with $700 million run rate savings. We said there's another $600 million. The goal is now $1.3 billion. We are nicely on our way. We see that reflected in the results. But I'd like to also underscore another thing that you've seen in the last couple of quarters and that is the emphasis we have on our strategy is to continue to focus our energy and our investments on a higher growth portion of our portfolio; the richer portion of our portfolio which is more of the advanced esoteric, genetic based services. We have said that that's growing nicely. You see that's reflected in our revenue per req so that headwinds that we've seen before in last two quarters we haven't seen. So we feel good about the progress we're making on that as well to make sure we get a better yield in our portfolio than what we've seen in the past. So you put all that together coupled with the M&A to just to underscore what Mark said, we believe that that 2% to 5% growth of this business over a three-year period is solid, and we believe the 8% to 10% growth in earnings, real earnings, operating income, is achievable. So we're confident we can continue to do that as we go forward. William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : Great. And then if I can, just one slightly unrelated follow-up. But you talked about potentially we could see some exciting stuff with big deals to manage hospital, even in-house labs, et cetera. Can you talk about as you think about what you're doing on the hospital side, whether it's managing hospital lab business directly or purchasing outpatient outreach business, but particularly the former, what impact that might have in terms of sort of metrics that we're looking at? And in particular, I'm thinking about capital intensity, return on invested capital, et cetera. Is that a higher return proposition for you and how does it fit from sort of just a margin standpoint? Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Bill, I'll begin with this and then I'll turn it to Mark on the returns and how that affects our goals we've laid out. First of all, it's both. And it's both managing hospitals' in-patient laboratories in some form. And in some cases, it might not be entirely, but some portion of it. And then finally is helping them with their outreach business. In some cases, we would acquire their outreach business, which we have done for the last three years. And as so much in healthcare goes, you see one strategy, you see one strategy. So we've engaged with the C-Suite around their lab strategy. When this goes well, we are their lab partner going forward. We've demonstrated this already with a number of our joint ventures we have and a number of the outreach businesses we've acquired. We're clearly their lab partner going forward and I think this is a direction that we'll see more of in the future as this healthcare system in this country continues to evolve. Now with these potential deals around what we call laboratory professional services and also outreach, they do affect our earnings and growth rate differently. And I think you're referring \u2013 or asking the question about return on invested capital. So, Mark, give us some perspective on both sides of the growth with hospitals. Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yes, certainly, and thanks for the question, Bill. Let's start with the professional laboratory services. What we've talked about in the past is this is really organic. There's not a significant capital outlay. There might be a little bit of capital upfront as we transition some of the volumes into our labs and out of their labs, but it's anything of significance. It is lower margin versus buying someone's outreach business where we're capturing all the margin on a go-forward basis. The way these deals work is given our economies of scale and our efficiencies, we can save them significantly enough money to get them to sign a multiyear contract with us to perform that service for them and we basically split that savings with them as part of the negotiation, but we don't have a large capital outlay. So from a ROIC perspective, these deals, while lower margin in our current business, are very attractive on a ROIC basis. And again, as I said, it's a source of organic growth that largely was unaddressable previously. So it's getting into a market and an area, in-patient, outpatient, that is a new source of growth for us on the top line. On the outreach, we certainly expect to continue to pursue such deals. We've talked about how the economics work very well. They're basically paid out through cost synergies. We've demonstrated the ability to do that successfully. We know how to do that and we think it's excellent for our shareholders and it is part of the 2% to 5%. So when we talk 1% to 2% of M&A, it's really those outreach businesses, small tuck-and-fold and outreach or small labs, for that matter, but a portion of that's going to be outreach. And we can fund that within our operating cash flow and still maintain our commitment to delivering majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders. So I wouldn't anticipate any significant shift in capital intensity to drive that strategy. Certainly, the professional laboratory service business is not going to require ton of capital. And finally, on the outreach and any other M&A, we've talked about the three metrics we use. One of them is that these need to be accretive to our ROIC plan of record by year three. So we're very focused to make sure even in the acquisitions that they're growing our ROIC. William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : Excellent. Thanks so much. Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thank you. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Dave Francis with RBC Capital Markets. You may ask your question. Dave K. Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey. Good morning, guys. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Dave. How are you? Dave K. Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC : I'm well. Thanks. Wondering bigger picture, do you guys have a perspective or I was wondering if we could get your perspective on just kind of what do you see overall volume-wise given your results and your perspective here? Just kind of what the puts and takes are from a broader perspective relative to kind of what's likely to kind of resolve some of the softness that you saw in the last quarter? Is there something going on with the mix of high deductible health plans, with the newly insured? Again, your bigger picture take on what's going on volume-wise? Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, sure, Dave. I'll take this to start and I'm sure Mark will add to it. First of all, if you look at the market, there is a bunch of puts and takes as you describe it. First of all, we believe the Affordable Care Act and the number of uninsured decreasing will add more lives to the system. What we've said consistently when people have insurance we believe they need what we do, therefore that would be good for us. Albeit, what we have seen so far for lives in the system for the Affordable Care Act are much less than what we anticipated back three years ago, as we all know. But we've said in the past few quarters that we are starting to see some of those Medicaid lives enter the system, so that is providing some volumes. And most people would agree that there will be increasingly less uninsured in this country in the years ahead, and that's what we have modeled in our expectations going forward. So, that's number one. Number two is, there continues to be a push for higher deductible insurance programs offered to employer-based healthcare offerings in this country. We believe it's about 40% of employer-sponsored healthcare is high deductible and that clearly has put pressure on utilization. I've said before that, those of us that are blessed with being reasonably healthy are paying for the majority of our healthcare out of our own pocket. And so people have thought twice about using the system and most people would agree over the past seven years or so that some portion of the utilization softness has been caused by this effect, and we believe actually that, that will continue. There will be more and more pressure on employers. They'll be pushing more responsibility to employees. The employees will consider when and where they use the healthcare system and that will have an effect on utilization. Now, with all that said, we think that's actually a good thing for our business, because we offer such a strong value proposition and we believe price transparency and the visibility of the wide variation on pricing in this industry is actually a good fact for us given our value and our prices in this industry are so attractive. So, that's the second effect. The third effect is we do have an aging population, us baby boomers. We already see that in our results. We talked about infectious disease growing. We're seeing some nice growth in hepatitis C, as an example, where all baby boomers are encouraged to get tested given the new drugs on the marketplace to cure that. The age of the baby boomer slug of our marketplace will continue to grow. The population grows. So you put all that math together and we continue to believe that in the mid-term to long-term, this industry that we're in should be growing in value 2% to 3%. We believe there will be more value per test going forward given the advancements and the introduction of new genetic-based services that we have demonstrated in our results as well. We believe that there are some submarkets that are growing faster than that, but some of that 2% to 3% is from the dynamics of what's happening overall in healthcare, as well, based upon more people with insurance, higher deductibles for those of us to get our healthcare from our employers, the aging population, and the growth in the population. So, hopefully that provides some perspective you're looking for, for what we see in the macro market overall. Dave K. Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yes, no, that's helpful color and I appreciate that. A quick follow-up. On the Inovalon announcement that you guys had recently; can you talk just very briefly about what your go-to-market strategy is there? Is that a product that your sales guys are capable of selling themselves given the footprint that they have, but the difference in what they're typically selling or do you have to rely on the Inovalon guys? How are you going to go to market with that? Thanks. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, great question. First of all, we're very encouraged about the prospect, the opportunity with Inovalon. The reason why we think this is so encouraging and why Inovalon thinks it's so encouraging is our presence in healthcare. So if you think about our presence, particularly in the work floor of healthcare, we have over 200,000 placements of our quarter entry results reporting system, called Care360. We interface with all the EMRs you can think of on the planet, the large EMR companies like Epic and Cerner and McKesson and also the small homegrown activities. We sell to 50% of physicians in this country; we sell to 50% of hospitals, so we're right in the center of the ecosystem of healthcare, so therefore we have a large presence. And the nice thing about that is, what we will do with Inovalon is attach their capability into the workflow of physicians. So, it's not something they have to disrupt their workflow to get access to. And so we're working on the actual integration of their applications into our applications, so the physician or the administrator when they're working through the workup on the patient and the completion of gathering all the information on the patient, we'll be able to access all that information. As far as go-to-market, like so much in healthcare, it's obviously complicated. We have people that call on physicians, both primary care physicians and all specialists. That portion of our sales force will be informed and we are talking to the customers about this prospect. We also have an information sales force. These are highly specialized people that can get into more of the content associated with this. And Inovalon as well is providing some capabilities on the ground level, as well as broadly to support the sale, as well, from a real specialist perspective. So it's a hybrid sales approach, but we are encouraged about the prospects for us and Inovalon going forward and we have launched this in the fall to get off to a good running start going into 2016. Dave K. Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. Thank you. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Robert Willoughby with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please limit yourselves to one question at this time. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Bob. Robert McEwen Willoughby - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch : Hey, Steve, on that Inovalon deal, I guess my question would be, how did you arrive at a 50%/50% revenue share for it? It seems to me with the connectivity that you have that you cited, the data you have, aren't you bringing a lot more to the table? Can you maybe flesh that out? Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, well, I appreciate you saying that, Bob. We believe we bring a lot of value to the table. On the same side, they bring all the content to the table and there's a lot of content. They've built a nice capability with their quality metrics application, the collection of all claims data real-time. So there's some very sophisticated approaches to gathering the information and serving that up to physicians. So we think the 50%/50% split fairly recognizes the value we deliver and the value they deliver, and it's a good partnership. So we think that's a fair split, but we are happy about the value I think we bring to the table because we think it's a good opportunity for us. Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yes, Bob, just real quickly. I mean the analog might be some small independent lab came up with a new esoteric test, okay, so they created the whole test. They didn't have the ability to sell it to the health plans as well as we could, and then to do the pull-through with, as Steve said, our coverage, that it's going to be ordered basically like a CPT, kind of like a test. And so I think you'd say, okay, yes, 50%/50% is pretty fair. They did the innovation, obviously they've got the IP, et cetera, and we're really the commercial arm to help sell that and educate people on the value and the opportunity. Robert McEwen Willoughby - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch : And just maybe a question on the cost associated with setting this up and then the deliverable itself. It's a one page of report or a two page, and maybe just, can you give like an anecdotal example of what the report might look like? And then, just lastly, how do you get the doc to pay for it? Is the payer going to pay for it? I mean how do we get over that hurdle? Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, well, first of all, the reports vary based upon what you're asking for, so some of the patient history are nice, well-presented summary of patient history. The quality metrics are somewhat of a simple, this is what you need to do to close the gaps in Care related to quality metrics to qualify for stronger HEDIS Scores and your Star Ratings, so that's another report. As far as the pay for here, in many cases it will be the risk-taking organization, the insurance company would be the person that has the motivation to do this. But in other portions of this, particularly related to the HEDIS Scores, it could be the provider organization that's clearly incentive to do a better job of closing the gaps in Care and see the value, and therefore will pay us for this. Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : And in terms of the investment required, Bob, it was a little more complicated than adding a couple of test codes to our compendium. That's kind of the way you should think about it. It's not a significant investment required to get this capability in our Care360. Okay. Operator : The last question comes from Michael Cherny with Evercore. Please limit yourself to one question. You may ask your question. Michael Aaron Cherny - Evercore ISI : Great. Thanks, guys, and thanks for squeezing me in. I'll make it one simple question. It's a clarification question. Just, Mark, on the reported volume for the quarter, is there any way you can break out the M&A contribution? If I'm reading correctly, I believe the only deal that should have contributed is MemorialCare; so any sense on what's organic versus what came from M&A? Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : It's pretty much all organic, Michael. And then the quarter M&A was less than 10 basis points. Michael Aaron Cherny - Evercore ISI : Okay. That's perfect. All right. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And as we said earlier, we expected some M&A sooner. We have got a nice funnel for M&A and you'll see that in subsequent months. But the third quarter was pretty clean, but it was the fourth consecutive quarter of organic revenue growth. Michael Aaron Cherny - Evercore ISI : Okay. Perfect. Thanks, guys. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. So thanks, everyone, for joining. As we have shared, we had another solid quarter. We are making good progress executing our strategy. We do appreciate all your support and interest in our company and have a great day.

Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Dan, and thanks, everyone, for joining today. This morning I'll provide you with highlights of the quarter, share a few comments on industry dynamics and review progress on our five-point strategy. Then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through guidance. Well, we continued to make progress on our path forward, delivering a strong year and positioning ourselves very well for 2016. Before turning to the quarter, let me recap our performance for the year. Revenues grew by 2% on an equivalent basis. Adjusted operating income as a percentage of revenues expanded by about 110 basis points, and adjusted EPS, excluding amortization, grew by 6%. In the fourth quarter, revenues were $1.85 billion, growing by 60 basis points on an equivalent basis. Adjusted EPS, excluding amortization, was $1.19, and this represents our seventh consecutive quarter of year-on-year EPS growth. Before I get into our strategy update, I'd like to talk about our industry dynamics, starting with the recent CMS proposal related to the PAMA legislation, which as you know, stands for Protecting Access to Medicare Act. As you have heard me say before, PAMA needs to be built on a representative view of the market. The current proposal limits the definition of an applicable lab to exclude a large portion of the market. We also believe that a 2017 effective date will be a significant challenge for all parties. With strong support from the American Hospital Association, the American Medical Association, and members of Congress, we remain optimistic that together industry and government can still achieve a reasonable outcome. Second, I would like to discuss the proposed FDA guidance on regulation of laboratory developed tests. We understand the FDA's concerns, but we continue to believe what the FDA has proposed would result in labs being subject to both CLIA and FDA regulations that may be overlapping, duplicative, and sometimes contradictory in their requirements. This has the potential to raise healthcare costs for patients and potentially, hinder medical innovation. The House Draft Legislation is a good first step in the legislative process. We share ACLA's goals of promoting and supporting diagnostic innovations that provide physicians with the insights necessary to advance patient care and save lives. We want to work with Congress to get the right balance in legislation; right for the industry, right for physicians, and right for patients who depend upon our diagnostic insights to make informed healthcare decisions every day. Now, let me shift to the progress we're making on our five-point strategy, which is to restore growth, drive operational excellence, simplify the organization, refocus on our diagnostic information services business, and deliver disciplined capital deployment. So, starting with growth, just three years ago this business was shrinking by more than 4%. We slowed the organic decline to 2% in 2014 and have now grown organically on an equivalent basis for the fifth consecutive quarter. We grew 2015 full year revenues by 2% on an equivalent basis and we are well positioned for 2016. Our gene-based and esoteric testing business grew by approximately 5% to $1.8 billion for the year. We continued to see strong growth in our infectious disease testing and prescription drug monitoring. Additionally, in late 2015 we launched two companion diagnostic solutions for non-small cell lung cancer. This week we announced another complementary diagnostic test for melanoma. Quest's expertise, scale, and collaborations with the top organizations such as Dako and Bristol-Myers Squibb position us to provide companion and complementary diagnostic test services for immunotherapies on a scale other providers can't match. We are encouraged by the progress of our clinical franchise teams and expect to continue to build more momentum going forward. Second, over the past few years, we have outlined our strategy to partner more effectively with hospital systems. We've shared our view that hospitals will look to partner with us to develop and execute their lab strategy. In November, we announced the acquisition of Hartford HealthCare's outreach business. We have been working on detailed integration plans and now expect the relationship to close later in the first quarter of 2016. In December, we announced a professional lab services relationship with Barnabas Health, New Jersey's number one health system. Under this relationship, we will manage inpatient laboratory test services for seven of their locations throughout New Jersey. We are currently working through the transition plans. We expect clinical testing volumes to be fully transitioned by mid-year 2016. These are two strong proof points of our evolving market where hospitals are looking for high value world-class partners. We continue to be encouraged by the robust pipeline of opportunities we have developed. In addition, we are building our portfolio of health information technology solutions. Our capabilities help payers, providers, and patients to improve patient care, lowering cost to manage populations. We're rolling out our new suite of solutions called Quantum internally to our sales force this week. A good example of Quantum solution is our recent partnership with Inovalon to deliver real-time insights at the point of care, which we call Data Diagnostics. We launched this solution in December, are seeing strong interest, and have already begun to sign business. We are very encouraged by the opportunity. You'll hear more about our Data Diagnostics and our Quantum solution later this quarter at HIMSS. The second element in our strategy is driving operational excellence. At our Investor Day in November 2014, we outlined our goal to increase our cumulative run rate savings to $1.3 billion by the end of 2017. To achieve that, we need to deliver an additional $600 million in run rate savings by the end of 2017. And we've made progress on our major objectives of our program, which include building e-enabling services, standardizing our processes, data and systems and improving cash collections. We delivered over $200 million in realized savings in 2015. This enabled us to deliver 10% growth in pre-tax earnings for the year as we continue to move closer to our Invigorate goal of $1.3 billion. Now, we're doing all this as we improve our customer experience at the same time that we lower our costs by removing waste from the system. We continue to simplify and strengthen our organization, which is the third element of our strategy. During the year, we launched our new brand promise. We call it Action from Insight. Our brand promises more than a refreshed logo. It's really about recommitting to a superior customer experience. We recently launched Everyday Excellence, a new initiative that focuses on our customers. We've already rolled it out to more than one-third of our workforce, but it's not just about our frontline employees. Everyday Excellence is for all of us, all of our employees, and it starts with me. We've also invested and trained over 150 senior leaders at our Leading Quest Academy. And we've deployed our Quest management system to create a standard framework for running our business. Our 44,000 employees are key to our success. Actually, in a recent companywide survey we experienced a record rate of engagement from our employees, and the results put us on par or above performance of high performing companies in several key areas. There is a clear link between employee engagement and performance at the most successful companies. Our employees are providing us with valuable feedback, and we are listening. On a recent visit to our facilities in California, as with so many visits with our operations, I came away both impressed and grateful for our employees' passion and commitment to our customers. The fourth element of our strategy is to refocus on our Diagnostic Information Services business. During the year, we contributed our clinical trials testing business into the newly formed joint venture with Quintiles called Q2 Solutions. The JV's performance is on track with our expectations, and we're excited to be part of this growing business. And then finally, we remain committed to the fifth element of our strategy, delivering disciplined capital deployment. In 2015, we returned over $400 million to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share buybacks. We returned 80% of our free cash flow to shareholders in 2015, well in excess of our commitment to return the majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders. During the quarter, we increased the company's share repurchase authorization by $500 million. And then earlier today, we announced a 5% increase in our quarterly dividend; this is our fifth dividend increase since 2011. Along with all this, we continue to invest in our business. We announced the Hartford HealthCare Outreach acquisition in the quarter and closed two acquisitions earlier in 2015. These acquisitions are aligned to our objective of growing revenues through strategically aligned M&A. Now, Mark will provide an overview on our fourth-quarter financial performance and walk you through the details of our 2016 outlook, which considers several of the recently announced relationships I noted earlier. Mark? Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues, consolidated fourth quarter revenues of $1.85 billion increased 0.6% versus the prior year on an equivalent revenue basis; that is, excluding the fourth-quarter 2014 clinical trials revenue. On a reported basis, revenues were lower by 1.8%. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services grew by 40 basis points versus a year ago. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, grew by 30 basis points versus the prior year. Volume grew on an organic basis by 20 basis points. Revenue per requisition was 10 basis points better than the prior year. Reimbursement pressure was moderate in the quarter and for the year, which is consistent with what we shared at our Investor Day in 2014. Both test and business mix continue to have net positive impact, reflecting our strategy to grow our esoteric testing and drive profitable growth. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $288 million or 15.5% of revenues, compared to $283 million or 15% of revenues a year ago. The improvement of 50 basis points can be primarily attributed to efficiencies from our Invigorate program and business mix. For the quarter, adjusted earnings per share excluding amortization was $1.19, or 80 basis points better than a year ago. Fourth quarter 2015 reported income from continuing operations includes a net benefit of $31 million or $0.21 per share related to deferred income tax benefits recognized during the quarter, partially offset by charges primarily related to restructuring and integration costs. In the fourth quarter of 2014, reported income from continuing operations included a net benefit of $27 million or $0.18 per share from the favorable resolution of tax contingencies, offset by charges related primarily to restructuring and integration costs. Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 3.5%, 30 basis points better than last year and 40 basis points better than last quarter. This is primarily due to a one-time bad debt benefit in the fourth quarter. It remains a challenging collection environment and we remain focused on improving our operational activities. Our DSOs were 47 days, one day lower than the prior year and three days higher than last quarter. Reported cash provided by operations was $271 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to $303 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Cash provided by operations was lower than a year ago largely due to an additional payroll cycle this year. Excluding the net cash charges related to the recent debt refinancing, adjusted cash provided by operations was $899 million for the full year 2015. Capital expenditures were $94 million in the quarter compared to $89 million a year ago. Total capital expenditures in 2015 were $263 million. Before moving to guidance, I'll share a few comments to help you think about our outlook. First, a few of you recently asked about the 8% to 10% earnings CAGR shared at our Investor Day in 2014. Reflecting on 2015, we delivered 6% adjusted earnings, excluding amortization. Keep in mind that the compare in 2015 was negatively impacted by amortization and a discrete tax benefit in 2014. These two items reduced our reported earnings growth by about 2%, mostly because we beat our 2014 estimate by $0.05. Taking these items into consideration, we feel we are on track compared to our objectives outlined at Investor Day in 2014. Second, because of the newly formed Q2 Solutions JV, we no longer consolidate the clinical trials revenue. Our clinical trials business reported revenues of $85 million in the first half of 2015 that you should consider as you update your model. Finally, as you think about our revenue projections, we have been on a favorable trajectory, but one that has been building over time. We expect that we will continue to show improvement as we progress through the year. Specifically, you should consider the Barnabas Health opportunity that will phase in over the first half of the year and the recently announced Outreach acquisition which we expect to be completed late in the first quarter. Moving to guidance, we now expect full year 2016 results before special items as follows. Revenues are expected to be between $7.52 billion and $7.59 billion, an increase of 1.5% to 2.5% on an equivalent basis. For comparative purposes, equivalent revenues will exclude the 2015 revenues associated with our clinical trials business. Adjusted diluted EPS, excluding amortization, to be between $5.02 and $5.17; cash provided by operations to approach $1 billion; and capital expenditures to be between $50 million to $300 million. Now, let me turn it back to Steve. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, thanks, Mark. Well, we believe we have the right strategy to restore growth and build value for our shareholders. We delivered another solid quarter and a good year. We're building momentum with our focus on advanced testing. Hospital partnerships are building and our expansion of our health information solutions activities is promising. We have now delivered adjusted EPS growth for the seventh consecutive quarter. We are well positioned to deliver on our commitments for 2016. Now with that, we'd be happy to take any of your questions. Dan Haemmerle - Executive Director- Investor Relations : Operator? Operator : Thank you. We will now open it up to questions. Our first question is from Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: (20:50) ...regarding the underlying assumptions on guidance, obviously you have upped your buyback allocation to over $1 billion. Can you just share with us what's kind of like your assumptions for capital deployment? Are you assuming any buybacks now and if so, kind of, like the magnitude? Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yes. So Ricky, I thank you for the question; good morning. In the EPS guidance, it assumes a flat share count. So at this point, depending as we always talk about, the best value-creation opportunity between M&A and share buybacks, we may end up deploying more towards buybacks. We may end up reducing the share count. But at this point, EPS guidance assumes a flat share count. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And the topline assumes some capital deployment? Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Right. The topline at this point is built based on some organic growth, including the Barnabas Health deal, and then the only M&A that we have explicitly in there at this point is the Hartford Outreach acquisition. But obviously, we give a range, and so within that range there's various scenarios between organic and inorganic growth. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And can I have just one follow-up? Just when you think about kind of like the early hospital partnerships that you've signed \u2013 not this year but the year before and we think about it as case studies \u2013 what type of growth are you seeing from these kind of like early partnerships that we can think about as kind of like a framework for the new deals that you've signed recently? Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, we're building the business, Ricky, so with building any business this is part of our growth strategy, is to focus on these hospital partnerships, and we find the receptivity of hospital systems quite promising. And we've talked about in the past, we now have a number of deals that are already in our revenues in 2015. And we announced Barnabas in the fourth quarter, so that will start to show up in 2016. And again, these are growth rates of our organic revenues that Mark talked about. And then finally, as we have a nice robust funnel, more prospects in 2016. So we believe that this business will continue to build and contribute to our growth prospects for the company going forward. So that's the way we look at it. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, thank you. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Thanks, Ricky. Operator : Our next question is from Jack Meehan from Barclays. Your line is open. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Jack. Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Good morning, Jack. Mitchell Petersen - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, thanks. This is actually Mitchell Petersen calling in for Jack this morning. Last quarter, I know you guys talked about utilization levels and how they are little bit weaker in 3Q, but trending positively. I was wondering if you could call out the trends you've been seeing on utilization per customer throughout the quarter. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, sure. We've talked about it in the past. We do this test where we take a look at our known accounts that are our accounts; we have about 1,000. We look at year-on-year comparison. We did that in Q3 and we said that volumes picked up at the end of the quarter. And we've done that again in Q4, and what we'll say at this time is when we look at that it's feeling like Q4 was stable with the prior year. No notable change in that and that's the best insight we have around utilization in the market that we serve. Mitchell Petersen - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thanks. And then just one more quick one. So obviously, PAMA coming out and then the margin impacts from the esoteric mix shifts. Are there any other noticeable pricing trends that you're seeing in the market? Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Mark, you want to...? Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : No trends per se. I mean, obviously, there's mix we talk about, and that includes test mix; it also includes payer mix. So we have mentioned previously that we have seen some growth in our Medicaid volumes, probably most likely in response to the Affordable Care Act, but also a reduction in our uninsured mix as well. So, some of that was more pronounced several quarters ago. I wouldn't say recently any other thing of note. And as I shared at the Investor Day, we expected 2016 to be more like \u2013 and then 2017 as well \u2013 to be more like 2014. You've seen the results for the past year. You can see that there was some pricing pressure. It was fairly tame, certainly compared to several years ago. And even with PAMA, we're still confident that through 2017, there's not going to be anything noteworthy, and as we said, it should be consistent with the last couple years. Mitchell Petersen - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Hey, Lisa. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning. I was wondering if you could maybe just give us an update. You talked a little bit about the Quintiles' JV Q2. But Mark, can you tell us what you have built into the guidance for 2016 for that? And then maybe, Steve, if you can spend a minute, have you been successful in signing some new deals under the new relationship? Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, sure. So Lisa, to answer your question directly, I'm sure you recognize, nothing on the revenue line since we can't consolidate. On the earnings line, certainly as we discussed, we expected to deliver some significant synergies this year in 2016, and I have that built into our guidance. We don't break that out specifically. It's not large enough or substantive enough to provide specific detail. But that is considered, and we are pleased and looking forward to having more earnings in 2016 than we did in 2015 from clinical trials, and then also having more than we think we would've had had we kept that business as standalone Quest. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Great. And Lisa, to your point about the business prospects, actually I was down there earlier this week with Quintiles' management team. As you know, we started this joint venture Q2 Solutions in the second half. We're very pleased with the integration that's gone on so far. We've built a nice management team. We now have a good integration plan. We feel good about the cadence. And in parallel with the integration, we feel good about the prospects that we're seeing in our funnel and the business that we've retained. We're not going to comment specifically any new business, but we're encouraged about the beginning of the joint venture and the working relationships between both companies \u2013 and between both of us, ourselves and Quintiles \u2013 we'll give you more color as it evolves, but so far so good. Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Is there any way to quantify any of that? The size of the funnel or \u2013 I know that you said it's bigger than what you thought previously on your own. But just as we think about that as being a future opportunity for your business, is it something that could be a key driver over time? Or you just think this is something that's a smaller, incremental driver to your business? Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : I just want to refresh everyone's memory. It was 2% of our overall revenues. What we shared at that point was that its operating margin was fairly representative of the overall enterprise, so nothing materially higher or lower. So therefore, you can kind of frame about what the contribution was, and we expect significantly larger growth on that than we could have done ourselves, but still off a 2% base. So, we're pleased with it and certainly every couple pennies is nice to have, but it's not going to be a game-changer overall. But as Steve said, relative to the expectations going into the partnership, we're very pleased with the first six months and looking forward to 2016. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And since we don't consolidate revenues, we're going to see it back in our earnings growth. And a lot of that earnings growth will come from the cost synergies that's implied in \u2013 or a portion of it's implied in our guidance. Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies. Your line is open. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning Brian. Jason Michael Plagman - Jefferies LLC : Hey, guys. This is Jason Plagman on for Brian. Morning. A question on the Barnabas partnership and the hospital management segment in general. How should we think about the margin profile for that segment, both over the next year or two and then how you're thinking about it longer term? Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, the way we look at this is we believe the market is continuing to look for partnerships. I said this in my opening comments. Hospitals are looking for partners like us to help them with their lab strategy. A piece of this is helping them run their hospital business, but also think about how we could partner with them in their more sophisticated testing \u2013 what we refer to as reference work. And so, then when we engage with clients or customers like Barnabas, we expect that we're going to start working with them and we're going to start to \u2013 continue to build their book of business with us. As far as margins, what we'll say is this. We're driving growth in this company and we're driving better ROIC. And included in our guidance around growth and included in our guidance around earnings growth, we do expect that our build of our professional lab services business will be accretive to our plan going forward. Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : And I'll just add that \u2013 I have shared in the past \u2013 these professional laboratory services agreement come with a couple of different components, as Steve just laid out. Certainly the reference piece, those margins would be similar to our other reference business relationships. And then, in some of these cases there is partnership involving Outreach as well. On the PLS piece itself, which is focused on taking some of the inpatient and outpatient in the hospital testing and partnering with them on that lab work \u2013 which previously was unaddressable revenue, so it's a new source of growth for us \u2013 those margins are lower than our overall book of business because we have to share the value creation with our partner. Obviously, when we go in, it's a supply arrangement, and therefore we have to save enough for us each to make a return. However, as Steve also pointed out, since there's really no significant capital outlay at that point, the ROIC is very attractive. And I also want to emphasize it's somewhat previously unaddressable revenues, so a new source of growth. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Just to close on this, in 2015 we feathered in a number of PLS deals \u2013 so they're in our results \u2013 that help us with growth. But also, as you can see with our results, we expanded our margins by 110 basis points. So I feel good about our prospects of this piece of business along with other businesses growing the company and also making sure that we continue to deliver good return on invested capital. Jason Michael Plagman - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thanks for the insight. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from A.J. Rice from UBS. Your line is open. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, A.J. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Hi, thanks. Just initially, I'm trying \u2013 this is sort of a bigger-picture question. So the revenue guidance looks for 1.5% to 2.5% growth, and I'm just trying to think through the puts and takes and how they relate to the underlying assumptions. Obviously, you've got the headwind of the half year, so the revenues that were contributed in the Quintiles JV. Alternatively, you're anniversarying at this point some lost or exited contracts that sort of impaired growth last year, as well as you've got the St. Barnabas deal ramping up. So I'm trying to get to what do you really think the underlying trends are in terms of pricing, volume, and sort of an apples-to-apples revenue comparison? Any comments on that would be helpful. Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Sure. First off, A.J. \u2013 and thank you for the question \u2013 the 1.5% to 2.5% is on what we call an equivalent basis. So that does not include the headwinds from clinical trials. So this is excluding that. So the businesses that we continue to have or will be adding, such as the Hartford acquisition or new partnerships like Barnabas, are included in that. But that excludes the impact of the $85 million in the first half. So as we look at it, we talked about the price; and we expect price in 2016 to have some modest headwinds. And then mix, obviously, we didn't get to that specifically, but we wouldn't expect a materially different trend than what you saw through 2015. So we continue to grow our esoteric business; so we mentioned 5% growth in Q4. We continue to focus on our most profitable business opportunities. We have cleaned up our portfolio, which certainly you're seeing some of that benefit in terms of our customers. And as we engage with new customers, we're very focused on making sure that we get the value that we deliver through our pricing. So that's really the overall commentary. I would say the 1.5% to 2.5% is a combination of organic growth and we've had five straight quarters of revenue. We mentioned we had some volume, organic growth in this quarter, and an improving trend throughout 2016. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, that's great. And then, maybe just following up on Steve's comment around the LDT question and the FDA. It seems like there's two dynamics going on. The Congress is sort of working with the industry to try to come up with some parameters around what might happen there, and then you occasionally have these salvos out of the FDA suggesting that they may move ahead with guidance around it. Can you give us any flavor? I mean, is there any dialogue with the FDA? Do you get any sense of whether they're going to stand down and let Congress move forward, or are they \u2013 do you have any sense of what they're doing? Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. So, thanks, A.J. First of all, as you know, our position as an industry is the FDA does not have statutory authority to regulate laboratories. We're in the business of medicine and applying a device (35:00) regulation to our industry doesn't make sense. And it's duplicative with what we already have with CLIA. So that remains our position. Now with all that said, as an industry we also believe that the legislative action or process is the best solution to this and we're encouraged with what's been proposed from Congress as a good start. So we're engaging with Congress on their proposed legislation. We're doing this with other stakeholders. And as far as the FDA involvement in this, I trust Congress and their team, and also with the work in our trade association. We have engaged with the FDA as well to see if we can come up with a reasonable solution of what they are trying to accomplish, while at the same time address the issues we're concerned about. So we are working. We think the legislative action is the best action for us, and that would be much better than the current guidance that we've seen so far from the FDA. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks a lot. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Nick Jansen from Raymond James. Your line is open. Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hi, nice job on the quarter with the organic volumes, but a couple questions. First on the SG&A trend, it did look like your SG&A dollars grew faster on maybe an equivalent basis. Maybe it's probably because last year's number wasn't restated. But just want to get a better sense of what you're viewing as core SG&A growth, and how we should be thinking about 2016 in context of the accelerating benefit from Invigorate 2.0. Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yes, thanks, Nick. I'm sure as you can appreciate SG&A will bounce around quarter to quarter, depending on the timing of certain investments and other things that impact that overall expense. There is certainly not a trend to be read from that. You can see for the year we drove not only improvement in gross margin but leverage of our SG&A. You would expect we need to continue that in order to drive the leverage that we're implying for our guidance in 2016, and certainly the leverage we were implying through the outlook that I provided at the Investor Day in 2014. So, some of Invigorate is on the cost of sales line; some of it is on the SG&A line and you should not expect us to deleverage our SG&A going forward. Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. and then secondly, I think you mentioned a bad debt benefit in the quarter. Just wanted to know if you could potentially quantify that and think about what drove the improvement from that benefit. Thanks. Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yes. So what I would say is the bad debt continues to be fairly stable. Mix, as we mentioned, mix is going against us : as we get a larger proportion of our revenues from patients, the bad debt rate on that is significantly, on an order of magnitude, higher than it is from the payers, whether it's commercial payers or the government. So that's something we have to offset. And through some of the good Invigorate work we've been doing, we've held that at bay and held it pretty stable. So that's what I would say is, without that one-time benefit, you should have expected to see some stability in our bad debt. Dan Haemmerle - Executive Director- Investor Relations : Operator? Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Quirk from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Great. Thanks and good morning, everybody. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey Bill. Good morning. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): I guess going back to FDA as well as PAMA, Steve, what are you guys thinking in terms of the final documents coming out? I guess we've been hearing probably 1Q for PAMA and 2Q for FDA. I'm just curious if those are consistent with your expectations. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. So first of all, let me start with PAMA. So, we've been engaged with CMS on this all last year, once we received their draft document. Two things, as I said in my introductory comments, we believe they did not get it right as far as the applicable labs; it needs to include hospitals. We've been quite clear on that and we've got a lot of support now from American Medical Association, American Hospital Association, and Congress to help us with that. So we've made that loud and clear. And then second is the timing. We think the ability for us to get the final guidance out this year, for us to submit the data, and then also for them to go through that data to refresh the clinical lab fee schedule by 2017 is a very, very tight timetable, as you can imagine. So those are the two big issues that we've highlighted. We're hopeful that we'll see something in the first half of 2016. They never commit to what the date is, but we're hopeful that we'll see something after they've digested everything we've provided to them in the last part of last year. So that's where that stands. As far as the FDA, as I just mentioned, we continue to work with Congress on a legislative action. We believe that's the best approach for this issue. We believe it is a good start. And again, as a trade association, we believe they do not have the statutory authority \u2013 the FDA does not have the statutory authority to regulate laboratories. So, we're going to work this in due course. We're hopeful that we can come up with something with Congress, and we'll see where that leads us. But this is going to be done step-by-step and kind of make progress and see where this evolves over the next several months. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Got it. And then if you had to handicap \u2013 I guess sticking on PAMA \u2013 if you had to handicap the option (40:54) of them expanding beyond the labs they've already spoken to, where are you thinking at this point, Steve? Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Oh, the applicable lab? You can't handicap it. All I know is the message has been loud and clear. We got the support of the American Hospital Association, which clearly gets paid the same way we get paid. If they do not include hospitals \u2013 as we all know, those commercial rates are higher than our rates \u2013 so they need to be in the base to get a market view of the codes. Second, is the Senate has weighed in. The House has weighed in. Industry has weighed in. We clearly have done a good job of making sure \u2013 we want to make sure we get this right because it's important to all of us. Again, you go back to the definition of PAMA \u2013 it's Protect Access to Medicare Act \u2013 it's very important that Medicare beneficiaries continue to get the critical testing, and all those Medicare beneficiaries are not just in those large cities where we primarily serve. There's a lot of regional players and there's a lot of hospital outreach players in this marketplace that have to get fair rates from CMS. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Got it. Thanks, guys. Appreciate the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Joel Harrison Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, guys. Thanks. It's actually Joel in for Isaac. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Joel. Joel Harrison Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: You guys touched a little bit on the companion diagnostics market in the prepared remarks. Could you maybe help us think about how you intend to win share in that market? It appears that market's increasingly becoming a more commoditized end market? Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, sure. It's a promising market. If you go back and look at our platforms for growth, companion diagnostics, and sometimes it's connected with precision medicine. It is an important part of our growth strategy. Several things \u2013 one is that we continue to work with the market-leading research organizations. About two years ago, we announced a relationship with Memorial Sloan-Kettering; we're actually taking their research and we are now marketing a product we call OncoVantage, with 34 actionable genes. And we're actually going to expand that panel this year as well with their help. So this is right in the middle of precision medicine, and clearly, we're providing the companion diagnostics associated with that. Second is, we're engaging with pharma. We announced the work this past quarter that we were doing. I talked about in my introductory remarks our recent announcement around melanoma. We continue to be highly engaged with all the pharma companies that have many companion diagnostics associated with their development funnels. So we're very well positioned in that regard. We do work now closely with Quintiles of getting an even better view in the marketplace and better access point for a lot of the smaller pharma companies with the relationship that they have, since they are the world's largest CRO. So, we think we're very well positioned as an innovation player; and now we're positioned even better with our relationship with Quintiles in terms of access to the market. Joel Harrison Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. And then maybe just a high-level question on what you're seeing for M&A dynamics in the market right now. Are there pockets in the market where valuations are more attractive on a relative basis? Just trying to get a sense of whether we should expect to see more deals towards esoteric-geared independents or more traditional full-service labs? Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, we continue to work the market. Our strategy is to focus on Diagnostic Information Services. We're entirely focused on that. All our M&A has been associated around that. We've done some hospital outreach deals, the most notable one is Hartford's Outreach activity in the fourth quarter. We continue to have a nice funnel, and that's consistent with our strategy of 1% to 2% growth through acquisitions. Through our outlook, we believe there's plenty of prospects to support that. And in that regard, we also have been clear that we're going to only acquire when we can have a good business case to make money for our shareholders. And many of the deals we've done so far have justified themselves based upon cost synergies which, in our experience, is the best acquisitions you can do. So, we're still encouraged. We still have a strong belief that we can deliver this portion of our strategy, and we've delivered on that through the past several years. Joel Harrison Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Elizabeth Blake from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Elizabeth Mary Blake - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my question. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Elizabeth, Elizabeth Mary Blake - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. You touched on your Data Diagnostics partnership with Inovalon that you launched in the quarter. Could you provide some color around your plans for reimbursement there? I mean, have you been in discussions with health plans? I guess, how would you characterize the interest you're getting from a payer perspective? Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We said in our comments that we're quite encouraged. We're offering a lot of value. Typically, the payment is through payers or the risk-taking organization, so it could be an ACO; those people that are managing the population and have the financial incentive to provide this information to the physicians that are treating and managing patients' lives. So, in that regard, we've been off and running since the fourth quarter. Momentum is building. We've worked through the integration. The nice part about this is we're providing this capability in the normal workflow of a physician. We have tremendous, tremendous capabilities at the desktop of a physician with our order entry results reporting system which we call Care360. And so when they're in the order entry system, if in fact they want the visibility to this information that we're getting from Inovalon, they can easily access that information. And the payment model is back to, again, typically the risk-taking entity whoever that might be, the payer or in the case of an entity that's taking risk like an ACO. So, we're working both physicians' awareness of this capability along with payer awareness of this. And we're very encouraged about the prospects. Elizabeth Mary Blake - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Donald Hooker from KeyBanc. Your line is open. Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great, good morning. So my question will be simple because it's a follow-up on the last question. So, I'm also interested in this Data Diagnostics relationship you have with Inovalon and appreciate the color. And looking ahead, how long do you think \u2013 if you were to guess \u2013 in terms of how long do you think this relationship would take to ramp to sort of a mature level, I guess, over to a point where, I guess, theoretically it could potentially start impacting and showing up in numbers? I guess, in other words, how long are the sales cycles? Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. Well, first of all, we started in the fourth quarter. We announced this deal in October. We've already signed some business; I mentioned that in our remarks that we signed some business. We're starting to \u2013 we'll start to see some flow in the first quarter and it will continue to build just like building any business. So it's implied in our guidance. We do expect some growth from this business in 2016 and that business will grow into the future. Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And then, what is your dedicated sales force to this product? Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, as you can imagine, you're selling to payers. So we have a hospital \u2013 excuse me \u2013 we have a health system team that calls on and manages our health insurance relationships. So, there's a portion of the sale that happens there. Second, is we have a health systems sales organization that calls on integrated delivery systems, and as I mentioned, some of those integrated delivery systems are taking risk and have ACOs, so we call there. Third, is we're equipping our physician sales force that goes in and talks to primary care physicians and all physicians, including our specialist physician sales forces. And so, we're training our sales force there and we have over 1,200 people in our sales organization. And this is complementary to what Inovalon already does in calling on the health insurance organizations as well. Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Got you, Thank you. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Bonello from Craig-Hallum. Your line is open. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey good morning, Bill. William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : Good morning. I just have a couple of questions about the guidance. So, Mark, you talked about that you felt after puts and takes and adjustments, you were pretty much in line with your long-term guidance range for what you delivered in 2015. If I look at the 2016 EPS guidance, at the middle of the range it's sort of 7%, which I think is still below your long-term EPS guidance range. So I'm just trying to reconcile why that would be and when you might expect to be in that 8% to 10% range? And then I have a follow-up. Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yes, thanks, Bill. So, I appreciate the question. Obviously, we're going to provide guidance that we think is prudent and deliverable. We have provided a range. That range certainly includes some numbers that would put us into that 8% to 10%. I want to refresh people's memory that the 8% to 10% was a compound annual growth rate over three years, so it was not a commitment to do that every single year. And also in my prepared remarks, I reminded people that at that point we were obviously looking at a 2014 number that was a nickel lower than we actually delivered in 2014. And I certainly did not anticipate a reduction in our amortization, which was really driven by the fact that we did not have as much significant M&A activity in 2015. So, we feel in terms of what we committed to that we're on track. We're not behind. Certainly, depending on where we end 2016 within that guidance, we'll either be a little bit slightly below the CAGR or right in the CAGR. So really, what we want to do is provide guidance that we feel is prudent and deliverable, and as we progress through the year, obviously, we'll see where we might end up within that range. But we certainly don't think the guidance implies, given the framing I shared on 2015, that we're materially off of that 8% to 10%. William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : Okay. And then just as a follow-up to that, wouldn't it be logical to think that the growth comp \u2013 assuming PAMA doesn't get postponed \u2013 that the growth comp would actually be a little bit more difficult in 2017 than it is in 2016? Or are there things about either this year or next year that would offset that Medicare cut? Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yes, so Bill, I talked about three levers that would enable us to grow earnings significantly faster than revenue. One of them was the synergies that would be continued to be delivered to their kind of steady-state from acquisitions we had done early in 2014. So you would imagine that probably a lot of that has been delivered. The second piece has been our Invigorate, and it being large enough to offset price and wage inflation, and deliver some margin expansion. And then the third element is the leverage we get from organic growth. And so, we committed to improving our relative performance. As Steve talked about, minus 4% in 2013, then minus 2% in 2014, and then some revenue growth the last five quarters. And certainly, since there's not as much M&A in our guidance this year as there was in the 2% we got last year, which benefited from some carryover on Solstas, we're implying continued strengthening of our organic performance. And as you know, organic volume growth has a high drop-through, and as we get closer and closer to market rates, which we had committed we would do through the three-year timeframe, that's going to also enable us to lever our P&L. So you should expect accelerating organic growth, which will be a driver, and then continued to progress to get to the $1.3 billion of Invigorate, which will also accelerate our earnings leverage. William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : That's really helpful. And then, just one last thing. Is there any way you can tell us what clinical trials contributed to operating income in Q4 of last year on an annualized basis? Just so we have an apples-to-apples comp on the operating income as well as the revenue? Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : We never broke it down by quarter, Bill. So the best I'm willing to do, which I've said in the past, is that it was about 2% of our revenue and its margin was comparable. So, you can kind of frame what that would've contributed in Q4. William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : Okay. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Amanda Murphy from William Blair. Your line is open. Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning, guys. I just had a follow-up actually to one of the points you just made in terms of volume growth. So, what is, would you say, is the market growth at this point? I'm just curious what you're seeing in terms of just base utilization. Obviously, there's been some discussion around the ACA and what impact that has had. So, just curious if you can provide more detail on utilization rates this year and then going into next year as well? Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, well, I'll start and then I'm sure Mark will add something to it. First of all, we continue to build our own market model. In 2014 when we had our Investor Day, we ran our model with a number of assumptions. And we say that the independent laboratory market's going to grow about 2% to 3% in value; and 2% to 3% in value has, as you know, a lot of moving parts. We also made some assumptions about the ACA impact. We've always assumed that as we have more insured lives in the United States that that would be net positive for this industry, net positive for us. But we all know that has been muted. There's some question about what will happen in 2016 around some of those lives. And then also, we assume in that, our advancement of technology. We're continuing to roll out new innovation to the marketplace, which helps with the growth rate assumptions and that was implied in the 2%, 3%. The aging population, for instance, Hepatitis C is a good opportunity for us, which we're taking advantage of, with the Baby Boomers who need to get tested, so all that is in the 2% to 3%. And also what we're seeing, Amanda, is what we refer to as density. We're seeing a continued improvement in the amount of tests we're getting through requisitions. And some of this also might be enhanced with the delays that we've seen since the Great Recession over the last, let's say eight to nine years. That people eventually when they show up to the physicians have more need for more testing per that episode. So, you put that all together and that's why we feel that 2% to 3% \u2013 and that's not in any specific year, but in the longer-term view \u2013 is a good gauge of the market. And we believe that utilization or volumes on a req basis would be slightly less than that, but on a test basis would be slightly greater than the reqs because you're getting an increase in the number of tests per requisition. So, that's what we have right now. As I said, in 2016, we saw utilization being somewhat stable. Like you, we look at all the different indications in the marketplace to get engaged with what's happening on \u2013 going on within the marketplace. But so far, it's feeling as we come out of this year, somewhat stable expectations for utilization in 2016. Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it; very helpful. And then, just one more on esoteric growth. You mentioned a few tests that you've rolled out. I'm curious if you can provide a little more detail in terms of what's driving that growth. Like for example, are you seeing increased hospital send-outs from all the consolidation a couple years ago? Just helping us understand the parts of that growth is helpful. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. So, what we mentioned in our prepared remarks is we have a big business. It's $1.8 billion. I referred to it in my closing remarks as being advanced diagnostics, which include gene and esoteric testing, and it grew by 5%, 5%. So we feel good about that. And I would say it's a number of programs that we have launched in the past few years. It is taking advantage of our investment that we made in our clinical franchise organization. We have invested in a stronger team. We're launching products in a better way. And Dan, why don't you give us the top handful of opportunities that we saw in that number? Dan Haemmerle - Executive Director- Investor Relations : Yes, sure. Amanda, we've seen growth in a number of different categories but certainly saw during the course of the year growth in our BRCA testing; in our non-invasive prenatal testing solution; within infectious disease with HCV and HIV. So, seeing growth in a number of different areas. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So we feel good about that $1.8 billion business growing 5% and we think the prospects continue to be good going forward. Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks very much. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our last question is from Michael Cherny from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Michael Cherny - International Strategy & Investment Group LLC : Good morning, guys. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Michael. Michael Cherny - International Strategy & Investment Group LLC : So I actually want to dig a little bit more into Amanda's question. You gave us a nice breakdown in a follow-up related to the way you look at the market here, low single digits growth in terms of the market. Obviously, it's been a while for a number of factors since you guys have been able to deliver that growth on an underlying basis. As we think about both this year as well as the next few \u2013 and I know there are moving pieces, so this is a bit of a loaded question. But is thinking about sub-1% organic volume growth or 1%-ish, or somewhere in that range, the new normal that we should think about relative to your business? And if it is or whatever that number is, what does that mean in terms of the incremental drop-down that you would expect relative to historical levels on the volume side? Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yes, so obviously we're not going to project our volume beyond this year, Michael. I'm sure you can appreciate that. What we did commit to was getting back to market levels of revenue growth and also then gaining share at some point. But in the three-year timeframe through 2017, we felt it was incumbent upon us to get back to market-level growth and that's what we're certainly striving to do. I think, as everyone recognizes, we talk about utilization in a market that's really a bunch of submarkets. So one of the drivers, certainly, besides the fact that we have outstanding offerings, of the 5% growth in esoteric, is that some of those markets are growing. Certainly BRCA is a growing market; non-invasive prenatal testing is a growing market; hepatitis C is a growing market. And then you've got things that we mentioned and it's not quite behind us, such as paps, which is a declining market. Certainly the impact of some of the safety scares on testosterone has impacted that market in terms of utilization over the last couple years. So, there's really a bunch of markets moving somewhat different directions. And depending on each lab and certainly Quest's share in those markets, it's going to impact us all differently. So it would be really difficult, even if we were willing, to give you a volume number. That's why what we really feel better about is giving revenue numbers. And certainly, if you just look at volume, you miss some of the positive mix aspects that you've seen come through in our results over the last year-plus in terms of mix, higher mix of these esoteric offerings; higher mix of better customer pricing, being more disciplined in those ways. So that's what our focus is on as opposed to figuring out volume. We think the demographics we've talked about are positive, certainly aging population, growing population. We certainly, despite some of the recent negative news such as 40% fewer enrollees in the exchanges; some of the slower growth that we've talked about over the last 18 months in terms of enrollment; you've seen a major payer who has talked about some of the struggles with the exchanges. And despite all that, we still think the Affordable Care Act is adding patients with insurance, and that's a good thing for us. So, we do feel positive about volumes and trends and certainly expect to get our fair share of that. But it would be very difficult to give you some sort of a steady-state volume organic growth projection going forward. Dan Haemmerle - Executive Director- Investor Relations : And Michael, just to follow-up on that a little bit. Keep in mind, we talk about revenue a lot because what shows up as volume versus growth in our esoteric business sometimes falls into the mix category. So revenue per requisition, this year we felt some pressure but we were able to offset that for the last several quarters, more than offset that with favorable test mix that's coming through the gene-based and esoteric. So, I think Steve also mentioned that we're seeing more tests on requisitions as well, so the requisition volume counts don't necessarily get the credit, but you see the credit overall in the revenue line for some of that benefit and some of that strategy. Michael Cherny - International Strategy & Investment Group LLC : No, I appreciate that, guys. If I could squeeze in one more quick one, any updated thoughts related to some of the technological developments, or maybe lack thereof, related to some of the point-of-care testing and particularly some of the microfluidics-linked point-of-care testing? Obviously, there's been a lot of news around a certain upstart that seems to have hit a bit of a wall. So anything related to how that market is evolving; if you see any other technologies that at some point make sense to be suppliers, particularly into the patient service centers? Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, so thanks, Mike, for your question. First of all, point-of-care diagnostics has been around for decades. I've been around for decades, invested in it, and know the market well. Where it has been successful is where there has been a good value proposition that has delivered something to the marketplace. So, chronic disease management, diabetes, it's done well. If you look at critical care in hospitals, if you were to go into a critical care unit with blood gas testing, that's been an example of good point-of-care testing value proposition. And then finally, emergency medicine, if you look at cardiac enzymes and the value of having those cardiac enzymes sooner, when the patient is being transferred to the emergency room, has a good value proposition. But in other areas where it's not quite clear, where it's not compelling, those promises have not really been delivered. With all that said, we're the world's largest diagnostic information services company. We're always looking at ways we can improve our cost structure. We buy from all the in-vitro diagnostic companies. If in fact there is a better platform to do some portion of our routine testing on a much more efficient, effective platform than the current ones that we use from all the suppliers, we're all ears. And so, we never not look at innovation that could be helpful in us delivering on our promise of great quality at some of the best prices in the industry. And our value proposition continues to be very, very strong. So point of care is a part of that, but you need to make sure that you really understand what it's going to do and where the value proposition is strong enough to get some traction. And again, we could be a utilizer of some of that if in fact the facts are compelling. Michael Cherny - International Strategy & Investment Group LLC : Thanks, guys. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. At this time we have no further questions. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Great. Well, thanks, everyone, for all the questions and thanks for joining us on the call today. Just to conclude we had another solid quarter and finished the year strong. We appreciate your support, and have a great day. Take care.

Now, I'd like to introduce Dan Haemmerle, Executive Director of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead, please. Dan Haemmerle : Thank you and good morning. I'm here with Steve Rusckowski, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to share that I will be transitioning into a new role in the company over the next two months. Now, I would like to introduce our new Executive Director of Investor Relations, Shawn Bevec. Shawn? Shawn Bevec : Thanks, Dan. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and also discuss non-GAAP measures. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in Quest Diagnostics' 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K. Our earnings press release is available. The text of our prepared remarks and a PowerPoint presentation will be available later today in the Investor Relations Quarterly Updates section of our website at www.questdiagnostics.com. Now, here's Steve Rusckowski. Steve Rusckowski : Thanks, Shawn, and welcome aboard and thanks everyone for joining us today. This morning I'll provide you with highlights of the quarter will share a few comments on industry dynamics, will review the progress on our five-point strategy. And then, Mark, will provide more detail on the results and take you through guidance. But before I get started I would like to recognize the sad passing of Dr. John Baldwin, a Quest Diagnostics board member since 2004. John provided important independent and thoughtful perspective as a Director and was a responsible steward of shareholder interest. John's life pursuits transcended his work as a practicing physician. Our board will miss him. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Baldwin family. While during the first quarter revenues grew by 3.6% on an equivalent basis. Adjusted EPS excluding amortization grew by almost 7% and this is our eighth consecutive quarter on year-on-year EPS growth. Before I get into our strategy update I would like to briefly update you on PAMA. Late last month 27 members of Congress urged the administration to lay changes to the Medicare clinical IP schedule under PAMA. Due to delays in the rule making process they argue that the January 2017 effective date for the updated fee schedule is not feasible and should be delayed. Our view that PAMA needs to be built on a representative view of the hospital is shared by the American Hospital Association, the American Medical Association, and a number of members of Congress. So we remain optimistic that together industry and government can still achieve a reasonable outcome. But given all that remains to be done we think that the implementation by January 2017 deadline is highly unlikely. Now I would like to shift to the progress we are making on our five-point strategy, which as you know, is to restore growth, drive operational excellence, simplify the organization, refocus on our diagnostic information services business, and deliver disciplined capital deployment. So, let's start with growth. We continue to seek improvement in our diagnostic information services revenues. Diagnostic information service revenues grew by 3.8% versus the prior year. We have now grown organically on an equivalent basis for the sixth consecutive quarter and our organic growth rate continues to improve. Our performance reflects our continued focus on advanced team-based and esoteric testing for our clinical franchise team and expanding our hospital relationships. We delivered solid volume growth across a number of areas but with particular strength in testing for prescription drug monitoring. We continue to drive innovation in the way of testing, what I would like to do is to share a few examples. Well, first as you saw last week, we have been very active on Hepatitis C testing. As many as 3.9 million Americans are chronically infected with HCV. We recently expanded our HCV offering with the launch of a new test that meets a new FDA recommendation to help physicians determine the type, dose, or duration of newly approved HCV drugs from Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb. These new Quest services underscore the central role of diagnostics in delivering precision medicine. The second good example is our new companion and complementary diagnostics solutions for non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma. And then finally, Zika testing. We are prepared to address the growing Zika public health concern in the United States which has been getting more attention and then funding recently. We currently have two Zika test waiting FDA clearance. In addition to advanced testing, our hospital strategy also contributed growth in the quarter. Our acquisition of Hartford HealthCare's outreach business closed at the end of February. Inspiration is off to a good start and we are excited to expand our service offerings in Connecticut. Now in addition to acquiring growth, our professional lab services strategy provides us with a strong growth of organic component of our hospital strategy. Our leanest organic contractual professional lab services relationship with Barnabas Health, New Jersey's number one healthcare system is off to a great start. During the quarter, we began to manage laboratory operations at several of their hospital locations and I'm pleased that all planned locations are now operational. We can now focus on improving operational efficiencies with a great new partner in New Jersey. This hospital professional lab services pipeline remains strong and we continue to be encouraged by the growth opportunities. We continue to make progress on the second element of our strategy, driving operational excellence. Our Invigorate program continues on track and what I would like to do additionally is to share some examples of how we're using technology to improve the customer experience and at the same time drive operational efficiency. So what we have done is installed kiosks in a select number of patient service centers that are benefiting patients with shorter wait times, but also freeing our professional phlebotomist to do what they are trying to do, provide great service to patients. In the area of logistics, our new Pathfinder Software platform is helping customers and driving efficiencies. This platform integrates our dispatching, dynamic route optimization, and specimen tracking systems into one end-to-end logistics solutions. And lastly, more clients are using our QuestConnect self-service portal to get results faster and more efficiently. As adoption has grown we have seen a decrease in calls from clients for the test results. So as you can see these initiatives that we're able to do make us more efficient while at the same time delivering the customer experiences better that allow us to grow faster. We continue to simplify and strengthen our organization which is the third element of our strategy. We are very proud that we will be recognized as one of the Fortune's most admired companies. The fourth element of our strategy is to refocus on a diagnostic information service business. Since our first Investor Day in 2012, we have taken a number of actions including the sale of our HemoCue point-of-care products business, OralDNA, Ibrutinib royalty rights, and the contribution of our clinical trials business to Q SQUARED SOLUTIONS joint venture. And most recently we exited the Celera Products business and announced the sale of our focused products business to DiaSorin. With these moves, we have substantially completed our effort to refocus on our diagnostic information services business which has grown at a 3% CAGR rate since 2013. We inspect the focused sales of both in the second quarter and when it does it will generate approximately $300 million of pretax cash which brings us to the fifth element of our strategy delivering disciplined capital deployment. As you all know, we are committed to deploying our cash in a balanced way between investing in business, our business, and M&A and returning cash to our shareholders through buybacks and dividends. We will deploy the after-tax proceeds from the focused sale in a manner consistent with our strategy. Now, Mark, will provide an overview on the first quarter results and provide you an update on our 2016 outlook. Mark? Mark Guinan : Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues, consolidated revenues of $1.86 billion increased by 1.3% versus the prior year on a reported basis. Equivalent revenues grew 3.6% for the company. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services or DIS for short grew by 3.8% compared to the prior year. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions increased 2.6% versus the prior year. Recent acquisitions contributed approximately 20 basis points to volumes in the quarter. Revenue per acquisition also improved 1.1% versus a year ago with the benefit of favorable test mix. The quarter had favorable compares related to both a milder winter and leap year, partially offset by an earlier Easter. Our diagnostic solutions revenues were lower reflecting the actions taken to refocus on Diagnostic Information Services. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $281 million or 15.1% of revenues compared to $269 million or 14.6% of revenues a year ago. Adjusted operating income benefited from stronger revenues and our integrated initiatives. For the quarter, adjusted EPS excluding amortization was $1.12, 6.7% better than a year ago. The company recorded after-tax charges totaling $45 million in the quarter, $30 million of which is associated with the debt retirement in the first quarter. The balance of charges relates primarily to restructuring and integration costs. These reference charges reduced our reported EPS by $0.32. Bad debt expense, as a percentage of revenues was 4.6% compared to 4.3% a year ago. As a reminder, bad debt expense is typically highest in the first quarter due to increased patient responsibility associated with high deductable plan. The drivers of the increase were a continued shift, a greater patient responsibility, and a change in our business mix as our clinical trials and products businesses had lower bad debt rates. Our DSOs were 44 days, one day lower than a year ago, and three days lower than the prior quarter. Reported cash provided by operations was $143 million in the quarter compared to $52 million a year ago. Excluding the debt retirement impact in both periods, operating cash flow would have been $190 million in 2016 and $130 million in 2015. Capital expenditures were $47 million in the quarter compared to $56 million a year ago. I want to mention a few factors I would like you to keep in mind to help you understand our outlook for the rest of the year. First, after we closed on the Focus Diagnostics sale, we expect to provide an update to our revenue outlook to reflect our exit from our products businesses including both Focused and Tulare products. This update will reflect a change to revenues but at this time we do not anticipate changing our earnings guidance. Second, I would like to discuss the two recent hospital relationships we announced and the impact of each. In February, we completed the acquisition of Hartford HealthCare's Lab outreach business. In this relationship we will be paid on fee-for-service basis by payers at our traditional rates. This is good for patients and payers as our commercial rates are typically more competitive than those of hospital labs. Like any M&A transaction, margins will improve as we integrate the business eventually reaching our historical margins for that market. During the quarter, we began to manage Barnabas health hospital laboratory operations under a new professional lab services or PLS agreement. Traditionally, these agreements which represent organic revenue growth cover management of inpatients and outpatients testing for the hospitals and do not require the same level of services such as phlebotomy and logistics. Here we bill and collect directly from the hospital. Due to the nature of this business, Barnabas will pressure our revenue per acquisition as we move through the year. In addition, keep in mind that PLS margins for any given relationship will improve over time as we implement our processes and protocols that will lag our companywide average. We are very pleased with our first quarter performance which was in line with our expectations. Given that our guidance before special items continues to be the following : revenues to be between $7.52 billion and $7.59 billion, adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization expense to be between $5.02 and $5.17. Adjusted cash provided by operations to approximate $1 billion and capital expenditures to be between $250 million and $300 million. Now let me turn it back to Steve. Steve Rusckowski : Thanks Mark. Well, we are off to a good start in 2016 with a solid performance in the first quarter. Adjusted earnings grew by approximately 7% and our Diagnostic Information Services revenues grew by nearly 4% and we are largely completed with our strategy to refocus our business. So now we will be happy to take any of your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming from Amanda Murphy of William Blair. Your line is now open. Steve Rusckowski : Good morning, Amanda. Amanda Murphy : How are you? Steve Rusckowski : We're doing well. Amanda Murphy : I had a question actually on just given your focus on advanced testing that you talked about and the mix shift that you had this quarter. I guess if you look at Medicare, they've put out some pricing on some of the NextGen panels that maybe isn't so great. And I think the rationale, obviously, is that the older codes are based on Sanger and with NextGen sequencing you gain some efficiencies. So, I just had a question round lot as you move more into that type of testing and it becomes a bigger part of your business. What is your perspective on Medicare pricing and your ability to service that market in a lower pricing environment? And then two, how our private payers looking at those types of tests? And are they recognizing the value-add from looking at more genes in the same assay and the difficulty around interpretation that comes along with that? Steve Rusckowski : Yes, well we appreciate the question. First of all as we all know this is an evolving market. We entered the BRCA market, it's a growing market and we're gaining share and a portion of our growth is coming from our growth that we're seeing from our entry into BRCA, so we feel good about that. At the same time, we also realized this is far from a commoditized market. We offer great solution to the marketplace, we offer great value and yet there is different price points to the marketplace and there is new contributions being added everyday for the panels which I believe will continue to advance the science going forward. So that's not going to stop. With the specifics of Medicare and the codes again one should bring us through kind of the view on the panels and the Medicare and eventually with PAMA, how could this fold out? Dan Haemmerle : Yes, specific to the BRCA coding changes that I think came out earlier this week, our BRCA offering leveraged in different codes, codings getting more and more complex with respect to genetic testing. So it's something that we use some different code based on the methodology that we're following and we're also working very closely with the number of payers on how they would like to see things coded. So there is constant dialogue and it\u2019s not just coding, it\u2019s also about looking at other things that go along with the services how we leverage the information, how we share the information back with providers as well as payers, how we work through prior of processes when necessary because many of the payers have different approaches to approvals and what types of information they require to get paid on these claims. So, as Steve mentioned, it's an evolving marketplace that will continue to move and as PAMA moves forward many of these codes could we would expect to get refreshed as well as part of the whole PAMA data collection process. Amanda Murphy : Great. Okay and then I just had one unrelated question. You've also talked about working with Quintiles beyond the central lab to leverage the diagnostic data between the two companies. Have they moved forward with that or can you provide an update there? Steve Rusckowski : Yes, we have. We continue to work with Quintiles in a very productive way. As I mentioned in the comments that with our refocusing strategy, we are very pleased with our integration of our Central Labs clinical trials business into Q SQUARED SOLUTIONS, that's off and running well, we are very pleased with the first plans that we have in place for integration being completed. So that's all very, very good. And as we said with our relationship there is two other areas that we want to collaborate with Quintiles. One is around deeper engagement with drug discovery and around companion diagnostics and complementary diagnostics. And what we're doing is trying to understand where they engage with pharma and where we can engage, where we have real specific opportunities to work together. And I would say that's opportunity by opportunity. And then second is how we can more smartly use our data and their data and other data to accelerate drug discovery. And again I would describe it this way as we have -- we have the dialogue we put in place and outlined how we will approach it, there is some work underway and we are testing the logic with some potential customers. So work in progress more to come, what we still believe there is still opportunity there. But we are working out carefully because it is like BRCA an evolving marketplace. Operator : Our next question is coming from Gary Lieberman of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Gary Lieberman : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I'm not sure if you said, I'm not sure if you guys mentioned it but where are we on the Invigorate run rate savings and kind of where do you expect to be from here? Steve Rusckowski : Yes, Mark wants to take that. Mark Guinan : Yes, we did not mention it Gary we haven't updated it. Typically we do that at the end of the year. So we talked about $600 million in opportunity around 2015 to 2017 and we did report that we delivered over $200 million in 2015. So we never laid out how that $600 million will break out year-by-year but just by mathematics you we can see that we are certainly not behind and we feel confident that we are on track to deliver this $600 million that we shared at the Investor Day. Steve Rusckowski : Yes, we still feel bullish about the prospects there. What we wanted to share in my opening remarks are the broader technology based innovation that we bring in this thinking about how to become more efficient and how to have a better patient experience. We are finding more and more examples where frankly we can do both and we are pleased about that. So off and running in a good way in the first quarter, we still have fabulous prospects for 2016, and we still have our sites with good line of sight at that $600 million that Mark spoke to. Mark Guinan : And Gary I'm sure you seen that in 2015 we grew our operating margin by over 100 basis points, in the recent quarter we improved it by 50. So, that's as we said certainly revenue growth is helping some of that with the drop through. But Invigorate is a critical component of us continuing to improve our margins. Gary Lieberman : Great. And then you guys mentioned having a Zika test in clearance. Can you give us the timing for that coming to market and then is there any way to quantify your initial expectations for what the volume in that test might be? Steve Rusckowski : No, as I mentioned in my introductory, Mark, we have two solutions with the FDA now where we cannot comment on what the timeframe will be for that. But we are optimistic about that and optimistic about the opportunity. And as we all know there has been a lot of dialogue about the changing nature of the potential risk for the American public. We think we will be very well positioned if we have our test approved to be able to deliver good solutions in the marketplace to deal with that risk. So we are encouraged. Gary Lieberman : And any thoughts from a clinical perspective on how pervasive that test is going to be? Steve Rusckowski : Hard to say. I mean you read the newspapers as do we. We are close to the Center for Disease Control. We are staying close to what the clinical protocol would be and how we can implement that and it's evolving like so much in healthcare every day. So we're hopeful that we can make a contribution like we do so in many areas of the business well. Operator : Our next question is coming from A.J. Rice of UBS. Your line is now open. A.J. Rice: Thanks everybody. Hello. First let me say good luck to Dan and welcome aboard Shawn there. I would like just first drilldown obviously you've shown a nice sequential improvement in both volume and pricing 2.6% and 1.1%. I know you said that volume was held by 20 basis points with acquisition. Can you give us any more color about what the underlying sort of apples-to-apples volume was if there is anything else that needs to be backed out or should we think of that as really sort of the underlying trend and similar on the pricing is there any breakdown between mix and absolute pricing in your mind? Steve Rusckowski : Mark? Mark Guinan : Sure. So A.J. the numbers that we shared are accurate, so 20 basis points organic, so there is really nothing else that needs to be backed out. As we did mention the compares are favorable in terms of the extra day and better weather, although weather wasn\u2019t perfect we did have a significant snowstorm and it really paralyzed DC and Baltimore whole lot, but definitely better than in the prior year, partially offset by an earlier Easter and the holidays and vacations that tend to take place which definitely impacts our business. So that's the only other consideration but there is nothing else in that performance that you should be taking into account. In terms of the revenue per req which is not price, we did have continued price headwinds but they were more than offset to the extent that we actually got 1.1% less in revenue per req really driven by test mix. So test mix not only offsets price but actually it gave us 110 basis points less on revenue per rack and that's certainly an outcome of some of the innovation that we've been driving in the new test that we're introducing and our focus on higher value offerings and really being price disciplined as we continue to negotiate and operate in the market. A.J. Rice: Okay. And then may be just one -- Steve Rusckowski : Let me just add what we feel really good about -- A.J. Rice: Sure. Steve Rusckowski : Progress made on growth. And hopefully you picked up in the script; we thought it would be helpful to highlight our growth in what we define as Diagnostic Information Services which grew by about 3.8%. And the reason we did that is we know there is a little noise, if you will, with our changes with the refocused strategy with diagnostic solutions. So it's a very clean repair and also if you go back and look at the historical growth rate now, three-year CAGR going back to 2013 it grew by about 3%. So as we shared this before we are on march of improvement in growth sequentially and year-on-year and we think this is just another quarter of progress against that goal so. A.J. Rice: Okay, and may be just a follow-up on one area that you don't get asked as much about anymore, but anatomic pathology. I know that that was a drag for a while and it's dropped below 10%. Is that at this point bottomed out or is it even possibly growing again? Can you give us a flavor on that? Steve Rusckowski : Yes, sure. We have a very big business. We made a lot of changes to over the last two years integrate it into our regional operations, we feel good about that. And actually this quarter we actually saw small single-digit increase in tissue this year. So it's becoming less of a drag that, as you say before it was less. So we feel good about the progress we made and improvement of the underlying business. Operator : Our next question is coming from Lisa Gill of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Steve Rusckowski : Good morning, Lisa. Lisa Gill : Good morning, thanks for the question. Just really to follow-up on a couple of things. One, as we think about the impact of the leap day in this quarter as well as the overall utilization, I think in the past, Steve, you've talked about high-deductible health plans having an impact in the first quarter where services are pushed back towards the back half of the year, as well as the impact on the bed debt. But can you may be just talk about what you're seeing in the overall utilization environment? And is it possible to quantify what the impact was from the leap day? Steve Rusckowski : Yes so as you know its complex and we do the press to try to understand the underlying business. So let's provide some perspective I will start and I'll turn it to Mark as well. As we've shared before what we do is we take number of our accounts, so we know our accounts, we go back and do a deficit reading, if you will, on year-on-year comparison of volumes within those existing accounts. Now what we'll share with you is that there is no notable underlying improvement or decrease in those accounts. So we will describe it as stable, the volumes in those accounts. And that secondly is Mark will share what we think extra day would do and also the quality of the days giving some of the holiday effects on the first quarter and then also notable bad winter particularly in Boston last year and that. So, Mark, why don't you go through that once again? Mark Guinan : So as Steve mentioned I don't want to suggest this is precise. However when that said if you take a 13 week quarter time five days you get 60 plus days billing days in the quarter, we have extra day. So basically the math would suggest we got about 150 basis points let all other things equal for the extra day. And then, the weather as we said isn't precise but probably something north of 100 basis points according to our estimate and as we also mentioned the earlier holiday, the Easter holiday had a negative headwind for us this quarter. So we still feel overall that the underlying business grew at 1% in terms of organic revenue for the quarter that is a continued improvement. We feel really good about it and then we have the extra bonus as you noticed of the leap day and also the better weather would certainly help that. Steve Rusckowski : And just to follow-up on -- to close off on this topic and we're happy to that this was our expectation for Q1. We said this in our remarks. We hit our expectation with revenue. We hit our expectation for EPS. We made some investments in the first quarter to continue to invest and accelerate that growth throughout the year. When we get into some of the effect that had on SG&A I'm sure you saw that but we're tracking to our plan for the year and we're consistent with our guidance for 2016. Lisa Gill : And then, if I think about just one other impact, at least versus our model, was the tax rate and the effective tax rate coming in higher than we anticipated. Is there something there that is more one-time for this quarter, or should we think about this being more of a run rate from a tax-rate perspective? Mark Guinan : I would say something in between Lisa. So it wasn't driven by a one-time event but it will not be the run rate for the year. So really each quarter is dependent on some mix items within our business between our international and our domestic, and so again we didn\u2019t break down by quarter, we in fact gave you some guidance for the year and you should assume that the guidance for the year is still appropriate. Operator : Our next question is coming from Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Isaac Ro : I want to talk a little bit about the operating leverage in the business. You've obviously done a lot of restructuring over the last few years, and now you're getting a little bit more top-line growth. And if I look at my model, there wasn't as much operating leverage as I might have hoped for and I'm wondering if you could talk a little more specifically around where you need to be on revenue growth to see better margins. Does it have to be closer to the midpoint of that 2% to 5% target that you have? Or is there -- I know there's some other factors, just seasonally this quarter, but I'm just wondering if you could talk more generally about operating leverage and what it will take to see a little more. Mark Guinan : So thanks for the question, Isaac. Growth provides operating leverage it doesn't need to be several hundred basis points. As Steve mentioned earlier we made a conscious choice to make some investments. So as we put our plan together for the year obviously there is always an opportunity to deliver even more earnings but we want to be long-term focused as well. We have a couple of critical things going on in the company that we think will drive future growth and are important such as launch of Quantum in our data diagnostics initiative. We talked about one of the major pieces in that being our partnership with Inovalon and getting us in a position to drive the growth that we aspire to, we think is possible. We really needed to make some investments. We have also been investing in our we call everyday excellence initiative which is critical around what people do every day in terms of customer excellence and focus on quality and those required some investments earlier in the year just to site a few examples. So it wasn't a question of how much operating leverage, as Steve said, this is the plan we put together, and did involve some incremental investments in the first quarter that we made a conscious decision to do so in that quarter. Steve Rusckowski : Yes, so if you look at the list of gross margins, we feel good about that year-on-year. We despite what we just shared, we will continue to seek improvement in our operating income margin which we feel good about. And as you know we've been on a long track record of improvement in operating income for a number of consecutive quarters. So we feel the growth rate coupled with improvement in EPS is right in line with what we want to get started with the year and we're off to a very good start. Isaac Ro : Got it, that's helpful. And then may be just a little bit more of a speculative question around the state of the managed care sector, given the potential consolidation we're going to see there. Can you talk a little bit about your plan to try and capitalize on that consolidation if and when it happens? And to what extent should we be thinking about the opportunity to gain share? And as part of the conversation, I imagine there is always a conversation about price when you try to get the share. But just curious about how you're planning for it conceptually and from a process standpoint, how we should think about timing if and when those deals go through. Steve Rusckowski : Yes, thanks, Isaac. Well first of all we think conceptually this trend in terms of consolidation in healthcare overall is consistent with where we think we're going to continue to build values across diagnostics. We continue to offer and it's getting stronger and stronger day and a great value proposition in the marketplace. We offer great solutions, we offer great service at very, very affordable and good prices in the market and we continue to work on our presence and our access with all the healthcare insurance companies. And one of the things we invested in first quarter along with what Mark mentioned is improving our team and also our reach into the healthcare insurance portion of our sales force. And so we made some ads there, we've continued to invest in that and we put some of that in the first quarter as well. So I would say that we are now more engaged than never before with this evolving marketplace. Obviously we are very engaged with the national players. We feel very good about those relationships. We have relationships with all the national players. But as I said before in my comments, we can't lose sight, because a large part of this country and this market is also affected by all the other players, the regional players and the other blues and we're as equally engaged on that portion of the market as well. So we think going back to where I started conceptually given where the market is headed, that it plays very nicely into what we're all about which is being the strongest in what we do and very focused on diagnostic information services that offer incredible value to delivering great quality healthcare in affordable prices. So nicely positioned for the short run but also the long-term. Mark Guinan : And the other comment I would make is that to your pricing question, I think it's really related to what are some of the critical things that people are going to ask about in terms of consolidation. And the two areas I would point to are access and value. And I think we do really well on both of those. So as a national lab we can help to ensure that as this consolidation takes place we are partnering with those payers, we can ensure that access remains or improves. And the second piece is as you are aware they already get excellent value from us. So we are part of the solution and certainly that doesn't require in our minds additional price concessions, we already can bring them tons of value by just further consolidation into class. Operator : Our next question is coming from Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Steve Rusckowski : Good morning, Ricky. Ashley Craig : Good morning. This is actually Ashley on for Ricky this morning. Congrats Dan on the new role. Dan Haemmerle : Thank you. Ashley Craig : So you said in the past that and just kind of piggybacking on Isaac's question to start off real quick. But you said in the past that you need 2% volume growth to start seeing leverage down to the bottom-line. So 2.6% for the quarter and you did expand margins are you expecting us to see an acceleration in margin expansion through the rest of the year or is what we are seeing in Q1 more of a steady state? Mark Guinan : So hi actually it is Mark. I don\u2019t believe I have ever made this statement that we need to 2% volume growth in order to leverage margins. What I've talked about was we're going to grow earnings not earnings per share, but earnings faster than our revenue growth and where we've been focused more on revenue than volume because as we've also talked about not volume is credit equal and there is definitely a fair amount of volume in this market that is not value creating. So we're focused on the volume that has a reasonable revenue, reasonable price, and as we do that and we laid out a picture of 2% to 5% growth which 1% to 2% we said will come for M&A. And I also pointed out that I was not counting on significant earnings from on executed M&A when we talked at the Investor Day in late 2014. So really the earnings were coming from the book of business largely that we had at the Investor Day that we would grow that 8% to 10%. And I said there was three pieces to that. One was we would get some continued synergy value early in 2015 for some of the acquisitions we had done in '14 including Solstice. The second piece was our integrated program being large enough to offset price headwinds that we anticipated, as well as wage inflation. And then the third piece was as we did improve our overall revenue momentum and turn to growth that we would get a drop-through and reasonably high drop-through on that. So it doesn\u2019t require 2% as I said a minute ago any sort of revenue growth is going to have and especially in the short-term a reasonably high drop-through. Now in terms of the balance of the year, we have given the guidance. So I'm not going to specifically do the math but you can see what we're expecting in terms of our overall revenue and our earnings. So I think you can see that we are projecting a consistent improvement in our margins and I haven't talked about accelerating or decelerating or anything like that. Ashley Craig : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then just a really quick follow-up on revenues, because they came in a little bit above what we were expecting. Was there any pull through from 2Q or do you expect -- was that just more of a steady-state as well? Steve Rusckowski : It's all straight up business within the quarter. I wouldn't say there is no pull through from this quarter. Mark Guinan : Yes our model we are not a products business, so our model is basically detailed in the services performed. So there is really very little swing at any given quarter from one quarter to another, it's very clean. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question is coming from Ross Muken of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Mark Guinan : Hi, Ross. Elizabeth Anderson : Hi, Elizabeth Anderson in for Ross Muken. You guys have obviously talked about some of the opportunities in hospitals and managed care over the past call and on this call. What do you think the other vertical integration opportunities might be, like for example drugstores or something like that? Steve Rusckowski : Yes so first of all I'm glad to comment on the hospital strategy, it's a big part of our growth strategy and we saw a portion of our growth coming from that in this quarter. I mentioned two aspects of our hospital strategy one is related to what we call professional ad services and a great example of that is what we're doing now with Barnabas and that's off and running in a good way and some portion of our growth came from part of this ramping up and then continuing to ramp up. Second is we do engage with hospital systems and typically in these conversations some consider selling their business to us, their outreach business and Hartford Hospitals is another great example of that happening and we started the inspiration of Hartford, so that's off and running. So our hospital strategy is well underway, we feel good about the growth prospects. And then, your specific question is I will share that over the last several years with healthcare becoming more and more consumer oriented, we're becoming more consumer oriented. And we have brought a lot to the marketplace in a variety of places. Let me comment a few. First of all we now serve up our results with an application called MyQuest. This came out about two years ago and we are approaching 3 million registered registrations for that service which is remarkable. Now people are quite interested in results and we're serving that up and for a small fee, we will be able to look back at their history. Second is, as you know, we have a great and growing wellness business that we invested in over the years and then also augmented with their acquisition of Summit where we are deeply engaged with the players in healthcare insurance companies. Third, is we have unparalleled access around to your specific question. We have over 2,200 patients service centers; we have over 3,500 phlebotomists in physician offices. So we have close to 6,000 access points for testing and we\u2019re trying to understand how we\u2019re going to augment that with pilots that we\u2019re running and we\u2019ve done some work with Walmart, where we have pilots off and running in some of their stores because they are looking at healthcare and how they provide better access to healthcare in their stores. And what I would also share is we are exploring other possibilities with retail in general because I would say retail in general is very interested and they trusted on how they can assist with providing more access to healthcare. It is a fair percentage of ordered requisitions for laboratory testing that go on fulfilled and we believe if there is better and better access, it's an opportunity for us to fulfill those requisitions and provide better healthcare. So more to come on this but we will becoming increasingly more and more consumer focused and oriented and when we have more we'll share with you but work is in progress. Operator : Our next question is coming from Bill Quirk of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Bill Quirk : First off, Steve, on PAMA, thank you very much for sharing the likely delay. I do think that is pretty consistent with many on the line here, our thinking as well. I guess, to think on a go-forward basis, where are you guys thinking about in terms of date for the final regulations or certainly some talk here that will be out before the election? Steve Rusckowski : We really have shared what we know and that is we all know it's been delayed. We have shared our perspective, we think it's highly unlikely given where we\u2019re sitting here in April of 2016, and somehow magically we\u2019re going to get the guidelines and going to get all the date and they are going to refresh the clinical IP schedule by January 2017. That is highly unlikely. With all that said they've missed any dates, and so we don\u2019t want to project when they're back eventually we will come out with a final guidance. But we are hopeful that we will see something this year and if we see something this year that they will play out the exact timetable. What we've been very strong on is when they come out they need to give us enough time and we've been very strong on this with our Trade Association, American Clinical Lab Association, to make sure they give us enough time to understand what they're asking for allows to put in place the systems and then allow us to get the data, send it to them, and then they need them sometime to go through that. And what we shared is once they communicate the final guidance that is at least 18 months for us to go through that whole cycle before they can refresh the clinical IP schedule. But the question you asked me really don't have any more insight than what we have said and that is we\u2019re hopeful that we\u2019ll see something this year and then from that give us enough time to work through and then that will determine the date that they refresh the schedule with. Bill Quirk : Got it. And then just staying on another controversial topic, the FDA LDT regulation, or the final rule rather. Also hearing that this may be out as soon as before the election. Obviously, there's a couple of legislative potential alternatives working their way through Congress as well, and so I would love to hear your latest thoughts there. Thanks. Steve Rusckowski : Yes, well first of all as you know our perspective on this is FDA does not have the statutory authority to regulate laboratories. We would be consistent on that. With all that said, we have been working with the FDA, we have been working with Energy and Congress in house and also with Health Committee in the Senate on a potential legislative solution to this. We do believe that a legislative solution is the best option for this country when it comes to the FDA potentially having some more oversight and also rationalizing how they integrate that work with CMS and CLIA. And we are actually encouraged you might not have seen it but actually this week the House Appropriations Committee just included the new language in their agricultural FDA spending bill that just came out of committee, what they are stating in this bill is that in their view the FDA should support what Congress is doing to trying to put together a legislative solution for this FDA discussion that's going on and not issued their guidance. So that's just come out of committee, we obviously need to go through the House and go through the Senate but we are encouraged by that. We think that's a good piece of work, we are obviously supportive of that, and we\u2019re continuing to work on making sure that this goes through the process in Washington. So more to come but this is the step in the right direction we hope. Operator : Our next question is coming from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Steve Rusckowski : Hey, Brian. Brian Tanquilut : Hey good morning, Steve. So question for you on revenue per requisition is in the past you guys have commented that we could expect a slight decline in that statistics 3 point gain. Given that it's still on the downturn is there any change to that view that we should see that inflect after 2017? Steve Rusckowski : Good, Mark will give this. Mark Guinan : Sure. Brian we wouldn\u2019t expect that trend to change within the core fee-for-service business as we mentioned as we increased our professional laboratory services book of business just based on the mathematics, that's going to reduce our revenue per requisition. We've also talked about the fact that from quarter-to-quarter it could change for instance our wellness business has some seasonality as you might have imagine, it's very heavy towards the back end of the year as employers are getting ready for benefits enrollment plan, a lot of them sponsor that kind of testing later in the year. And that wellness business does have lower revenue per req. So we've also shared it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a lower margin. So other than some of the quarter-to-quarter variability and then the mathematics as we build a book of business in PLS that might grow faster than our core book. Really you should expect that the revenue per req trend is something that as far as we\u2019re expecting we will continue as we continue to come out with new innovative solutions which tend to have a higher price and a higher revenue per requisition. Steve Rusckowski : Some portion of the 110 basis points improvement this quarter for revenue per req is related to what Mark just said around our stronger mix of more advanced diagnostics in the portfolio which is deliver part of our strategy. Now as we shared before we are all about revenue growth and we are all about earnings growth and revenue per req is an interesting calculation but this is a lot as we all know that goes into that calculation with multiple variables. So as we go through our business plan and execute it, there will be some changes in the calculation. And one of those as Mark pointed out already in our comments in our professional lab services business, we think it's a great business, it offers great growth opportunities, great return on invested capital. But on our revenue price basis, it would put some pressure on that calculation but it does not in any way affect our optimism about the opportunity of that business. Brian Tanquilut : Got it, my follow-up for you, Steve, clearly you're very excited at Hartford and Barnabas. So what did the pipeline look like for hospital deals at this point? Steve Rusckowski : Yes, as we said, it\u2019s very robust and it\u2019s encouraging. The more we get into these dialogues the more we understand we\u2019re on the right track, hospitals are quite interested in us helping them with their lab strategy that lab strategy includes what we can do for them, if we don\u2019t do it already around advanced diagnostics for the inpatient environment. What we think could do with us to become more efficient in their hospitals and that's what we are doing with Barnabas. And then finally as many are thinking that's to them to rely on Quest for all their diagnostics needs, and in some cases like Hartford, they sold us, us their outreach business. So typically, when we get in there on any of the three fronts, we have a dialogue with all three and we think it\u2019s a way of the future and we think it\u2019s a great growth opportunity and we think we made the right investment over the past couple of years and starting to pay off and you see it in our growth. Operator : Our next question is coming from Bill Bonello of Craig-Hallum. Your line is now open. Bill Bonello : Great, thanks guys. Kind of a big picture question. Steve, since you've come on board, you've done a tremendous amount to clean the Company up in terms of what it looks like, as strategically obviously divesting a lot of what might be non-core assets. You guys have paid down a significant amount of debt. I think the leverage is pretty reasonable at this point in time. You generate free cash flow. How are you kind of thinking about your use of capital? I would be curious on two things. One, what are your thoughts around any kind of large-scale laboratory acquisitions? And two, about something, I know you've expanded your share repurchase, but about something more aggressive on that front? Steve Rusckowski : Thanks, Bill and I will start and then I'll turn it to Mark. So hopefully what you\u2019ve seen from us and we delivered on it quarter-on-quarter is we do what we say. So we launched a five-point strategy back in 2012 and part of that is to refocus on our diagnostic information services business. We think the business is a good business. We think there is plenty of growth prospects in it and we have our strategies to grow that business and we\u2019re happy actually that if we go back and to do a look back and I said in my remarks if you look at 2013 and the CAGR since then at our diagnostic information services business is up by 3%. Included Bill in that 3% is our delivered strategy to look for acquisitions that are strategically aligned with that strategy and they are accretive that we can make money at. And we said that we believe there is 1% to 2% top-line growth from those types of acquisitions and we continue to deliver on that. And Hartford Hospitals continues to be good example of that this year. And then finally, when it comes to our disciplined capital deployment we\u2019ve been again very consistent with doing what we said we would do returning the majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders. We have been consistent with that in regards to raising our dividend, our share buyback program. And then finally as we and investing in the business which is a big part of what we do every year with the capital budget and then our acquisition strategy is with our growth strategy and yet at the same time looking for those assets that we think we can make some money on. So we are doing what we said we will do and we are tracking well against it and we are very pleased that with the sale of Focus hopefully we will close that in the second quarter as I said in my remarks, our refocusing strategy is largely complete and behind us. So that portion of our portfolio change is in good shape. So let me turn it to Mark to add more color to this. Mark Guinan : Thanks Steve and then Bill thanks for the question. We've been very intense with our strategy. As Steve said hopefully as people look out what you laid out in 2012 that we\u2019ve been doing what we told people we would do. And so therefore while we always have fiduciary responsibility to look at any opportunities for cash deployment that seems like the best way for our shareholders to recognize value and a return. And at this point, we\u2019ve been pretty consistent saying M&A of 1% to 2%, returning majority of free cash flow to shareholders. And so therefore when you do the math, you can see that we could fund a 1% to 2% top-line growth within our operating cash flow. As we've also said year-on-year depending on what opportunities were there, we could always potentially spend a little more and drive a little more growth in one given year where we could potentially buyback more shares. So we\u2019re not going to be led to any sort of formula because as you might imagine as we go for every deal, we want to make sure that any deployment of our cash and our capital is the best opportunity in that window to create shareholder value. So I also want to point out that by increasing the dividend five times in a period of several years, we've gotten to a significant portion that is coming from the dividend and so versus the uncertainty of how much we might buy in given year so on and so forth, we have made a significant commitment to our ongoing shareholders to return a chunk of cash to that dividend. So that gets us most of the way to the 50% and then anything beyond in terms of share repurchases are really going to be driven by in a short period of time a lack of M&A opportunities, we have seen more value creating than buying back shares. So nothing that you should expect in terms of significant changes in our leverage in the near-term, certainly nothing you should expect and I think your question was around more significant share buybacks, I certainly wouldn\u2019t go to the balance sheet to do that. So whatever we do will be driven by operating cash flow or by some strategic asset divestitures such as we did with birdnib in the past. And while we haven't said specifically what we\u2019re doing with Focus we can assure you we will deploy that cash in a manner that's consistent with what I just said. Operator : Our last question is coming from Nicholas Jansen of Raymond James. Your line is now open. Steve Rusckowski : Good morning, Nicholas. Nicholas Jansen : Hey guys, good morning. Just two questions. One on in the quarter you spent $135 million on acquisitions. And I was just wondering, get a sense of, is that entirely on the Connecticut transaction? And if so, what are these types of outreach multiples that you're paying? And then the second question would be on the bad debt. Obviously, it's seasonally always higher in 1Q, but sequentially it was up about 110 basis points. And if I go back in my model the last few years, it's usually 50 to 60 basis points sequentially. So just trying to get a sense of was there anything moving parts here that was a little bit higher low than what you were expecting either this quarter or last quarter? Thanks. Mark Guinan : Certainly I appreciate the questions. So first off on the acquisitions yes that was Hartford Health acquisition. In terms of multiples as I\u2019m sure you can appreciate there is really no multiple that makes sense in terms of the seller's revenue and EBITDA because the business in our hands is completely different. So the revenue tends to be lower as we mentioned as we move the reimbursement to our negotiated rates, but obviously in all cases when we do an acquisition, the EBITDA and the earnings are much better than what the seller had. So really the best way to think about it is that because we apply the financial metrics which we give around a ROIC hurdle, around an NPV hurdle, and really driving earnings accretion in the near-term, the math would make it impossible for us to overpay. And so what I said to people on a pro forma basis if you saw our models, you would see that the multiple what we are paying on an EBITDA multiple is would not be above our overall market multiple, so it would be in the ballpark or lower. So you can feel good about we're not going on buying companies or assets or businesses at a significantly higher -- high premium. And then on the bad debt question, we did have a one-time favorable adjustment in Q4 to look back at what we shared in the quarter. So the bad debt was not a run rate Q4 bad debt, it was favorable given a one-time collection that we had that helped Q4 disproportionately. So the sequential historical sequential would be impacted by that and that's why you're seeing a larger increase from Q1 -- Q4 to Q1 but also the other thing is that we do have this continued increase in high deductible plans and now our Invigorate program is very focused on offsetting a lot of that mix shift through earlier collections, upfront collections, or PSCs and other initiatives we have going on. The reality is that the bad debt rate on patient responsibility is in order of magnitude higher than rest of our business. So we will continue to work on that and we expect to certainly mitigate that impact but it does have some impact. Steve Rusckowski : Okay. Well thanks again for joining our call today. As you can hear, we are making good progress executing our strategy and we want to thank you for your time and have a great day.

Shawn Bevec - Executive Director- Investor Relations : Thank you, and good morning. I'm here with Steve Rusckowski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and also discuss non-GAAP measures. For this call, references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in Quest Diagnostics' 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. The text of our prepared remarks and a PowerPoint presentation will be available later today in the Investor Relations page of our website. Now here's Steve Rusckowski. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Shawn, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. This morning we'll provide you with highlights of the quarter, share a few comments on industry dynamics and review progress on our five-point strategy. Then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through guidance. Through the second quarter, revenues declined 1% on a reported basis related to our efforts to refocus the business, but grew 2.4% on an equivalent basis. Reported EPS grew more than 69%, while adjusted EPS grew more than 7%. Before I get into our strategy update, I'd like to provide perspective on a few key aspects of the final rule implementing provisions of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act, referred to as PAMA, issued late last month by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, referred to as CMS. First, on the issue of timing, we are pleased with CMS's decision to delay the implementation of the new payment system until January 1, 2018, a position advocated by members of Congress, hospitals and hospital \u2013 excuse me, and laboratory trade associations. Second, CMS changed its approach to secure a better view of market pricing. By gathering the pricing data from labs in a different way, CMS will increase the number of labs that provide pricing data. And finally, we continue to evaluate the impact of this final rule, but we won't have a clear view until we see the final pricing data. In the meantime, CMS is estimating a mid-single digit rate reduction in 2018. As you know, the clinical lab fee schedule represents approximately 12% of our revenues. As we've shared in the past, our Invigorate savings have more than compensated for price headwinds in the market. So if there is a fee reduction in 2018, we would be able to manage it. Now let me shift to the progress we're making on our five-point strategy, which, as you recall, is to restore growth, drive operational excellence, simplify the organization, refocus on our Diagnostic Information Service business and deliver disciplined capital deployment. So starting with growth, we delivered solid volume growth across a number of areas including prescription drug monitoring, hepatitis C testing, and Cardio IQ, which provides a more complete picture of patients' cardiovascular health with basic cholesterol testing. We also grew in the second quarter with the help from our new hospital service agreements. Our acquisition of the Outreach Laboratory Service business of Clinical Laboratory Partners, referred to as CLP, and professional lab services agreements from Barnabas Health are helping us deliver the continued execution of our accelerated growth plan. Additionally in this quarter, we announced an agreement to manage the inpatient laboratory operations for six Denver-area hospitals in HealthONE System of HCA Healthcare. We expect to see revenues from this engagement before the end of the year. You know, hospitals continue to talk to us about how we can help them execute their lab strategy, from advanced hospital reference testing to lab management to joint ventures and outreach lab purchases. Our pipeline remains strong and we continue to be encouraged by the growth opportunities. In advanced testing, we strengthened our service offering, which includes gene-based and esoteric tests. During the quarter, we announced that there will be three new Quest Vantage Answer tests. These are designed to provide clinical actionable insight into an individual's risk of developing hereditary forms of cancer. These new offerings will better position us in this exciting and growing marketplace. We piloted a program this quarter for non-invasive prenatal screening to serve women of average risk in select regions. Encouraged by the results, we're now offering the testing nationally. We continued to drive operational excellence, the second element of our strategy. We believe quality and efficiency go hand in hand and we have strong evidence of demonstrated improvement in our customer experience as we make our business more efficient. As we deliver cost savings, we're also able to improve quality and service. This is a well-understood principle of total quality management approaches across all industries. Evidence of this can be seen in a recent independent blinded survey of more than 500 physicians. In the survey, Quest scored highest on customer experience, lab effectiveness and patient satisfaction among national, regional and hospital competitors. Our recent agreement with Safeway will make it easier for people to get tested by locating our Patient Service Centers in high-traffic Safeway supermarkets. By expanding patient access through our relationships with retailers, we will optimize our real estate footprint and have an opportunity to reduce the number of unfulfilled test orders, which some suggest could be as high as 30%. We're also shrinking our real estate footprint by consolidating our corporate sites. In June, we announce the relocation of our corporate headquarters and support functions from Madison and Lyndhurst, New Jersey to a single location when our current 10-year lease expires in September of 2017. By consolidating our footprint, we'll be able to get greater collaboration and performance while realizing savings in operating expenses. Our Invigorate cost savings program continues on track to realize $1.3 billion in run rate savings as we exit 2017. We continue to simplify and strengthen our organizational capabilities, the third element of our strategy. Also this quarter, we were proud to be recognized as one of 100 companies named to Forbes 2016 America's Most Trustworthy Companies list, the only company from the diagnostic services industry to be included. The fourth element of our strategy, to refocus on our Diagnostic Information Services business, was completed in May, following the completion of the sale of the Focus Diagnostic Products business. Proceeds from the sale of Focus Products were used to drive the fifth element of our strategy, delivering disciplined capital deployment. We launched the $250 million accelerated share repurchase program, ASR, with the Focus proceeds. And since 2012, we have repurchased approximately $2 billion of company stock. Additionally, in May, we issued $500 million in debt to take advantage of favorable interest rates and refinance a portion of our debt. We actually look forward to sharing more detail on our market views and strategic outlook at our third Investor Day in New York City on November 11. So mark your calendars, and we'll be providing more data about this as time goes on. Now Mark will provide an overview on our second quarter financial performance and provide you with an update on our 2016 outlook. Mark? Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues, consolidated revenues of $1.91 billion were lower by 1% versus the prior year on a reported basis. Equivalent revenues grew 2.4% for the company. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services, or DIS for short, grew by 2.2% compared to the prior year. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 1.9% versus the prior year. Of the 1.9%, approximately half came from organic growth and the other half from recent acquisitions, including both CLP and MemorialCare. Through the first half of 2016, organic volume is up nearly 2%, a solid increase compared to the slight decline reported in the first half of 2015. Revenue per requisition in the second quarter increased 0.2% versus a year ago. As a reminder, a number of different elements impact revenue per req, including unit price variation, business mix, and tests per req. Price headwinds were in line with our expectations, down slightly less than 1%. As we noted last quarter, our Professional Lab Services, or PLS engagement, such as Barnabas Health and HCA, carry lower revenue per requisition due to the nature of the work we are performing. In Q2 2016, the year-over-year impact of growth in PLS was approximately 120 basis points on our aggregate revenue per req. In the second quarter, PLS was a larger mix of our business and as we move through the year, we expect PLS to grow at a faster rate than the balance of our business. Reported operating income for the quarter was $422 million, or 22.1% of revenues, compared to $301 million, or 15.6% of revenues a year ago. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $324 million, or 17% of revenues, compared to $321 million, or 16.7% of revenues last year. Adjusted operating income benefited from stronger revenues and our Invigorate initiative, slightly offset by lower margins related to recent acquisitions, our growing Professional Lab Services business and our efforts to refocus the company. The impact of our clinical trials and products businesses in the second quarter of 2015 benefited adjusted operating margins by approximately $15 million. As a reminder, the clinical trials business now appears on the equity earnings line. Also, we no longer have operating earnings associated with the Focus Products business and recall that we used the proceeds to repurchase shares. In total, our portfolio divestitures represented $169 million of revenues that were excluded to get to our equivalent revenues for 2015. Reported EPS was $1.37 in the quarter, compared to $0.81 a year ago. The significant year-over-year increase was driven, in large part, by the gain on the sale of our Focus Diagnostics Products business in the second quarter and charges on retirement of debt in the prior year. Adjusted EPS was $1.34, up from $1.25 last year. The company recorded special items with an after-tax benefit totaling $17 million in the quarter, representing a $34 million gain on the sale of the Focus Products business, offset by approximately $17 million of primarily restructuring and integration charges. The net impact of these items increased our reported EPS by $0.12. Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 4.2%, 40 basis points better than the previous quarter and 10 basis points higher than 2015. As a reminder, bad debt expense typically improves modestly throughout the year as patients hit their health insurance deductibles. Note that the year-over-year compare is negatively impacted by the fact that our clinical trials and products businesses had a lower associated bad debt rate. When taking this into consideration, our bad debt rate year over year improved slightly. Our DSOs were 47 days, three days higher than last year and the prior quarter. This was driven by the timing of certain cash receipts and we expect our DSOs to come down to levels similar to the prior year by the end of Q3. Through the first half of 2016, reported cash provided by operations was $464 million versus $337 million last year. Excluding charges associated with early debt retirement in the first half of 2016 and debt refinancing in the first half of 2015, adjusted operating cash flow was $502 million through June 30, 2016, up from $464 million in 2015. Capital expenditures were $104 million in the first half compared to $117 million a year ago. Before moving to guidance, I'd like to mention a few items for you to keep in mind to help you understand our outlook for the remainder of the year. First, the year-over-year impact of the contribution of our clinical trials business to the Q2 [Q Squared] JV on reported revenues ended in the second quarter of 2016. Recall this transaction commenced at the beginning of our third quarter 2015. Second, for the Celera Products business that we wound down toward the end of last year, we recognized nearly half of the 2015 revenues and operating earnings for this business in the third quarter of 2015 as customers executed their last time buys. This will set up a difficult compare in the third quarter this year. As you think about the split for the remainder of the year, last year we had approximately $10 million on a reported basis and $12 million on adjusted basis of Celera Products operating income in Q3 and nothing in Q4. Finally, there are two notable items on our full-year reported operating cash flow projections. The first relates to after-tax cash charges of $29 million from the retirement of debt that will impact 2016 operating cash flow. Second, we will incur a cash tax outlay of $91 million associated with the Focus divestiture that will be recorded in our operating cash flow despite recognizing the associated $275 million from the sale in our investing cash flow. Therefore, our adjusted operating cash flow for 2016 will exclude both items. Having noted these items, our 2016 outlook is as follows : revenues to be between $7.47 billion and $7.54 billion, flat to an increase of approximately 1% versus the prior year on a reported basis, and an increase of 2% to 3% on an equivalent basis; reported diluted EPS to be between $4.18 and $4.33; adjusted EPS to be between $5.02 and $5.17. Cash provided by operations to be approximately $880 million on a reported basis and roughly $1 billion on an adjusted basis. Finally, capital expenditures to be between $250 million and $300 million. Now, let me turn it back to Steve. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Mark. Well, to summarize, we built on our good start in 2016 with another solid performance of second quarter. Revenues grew by more than 2% on an equivalent basis. Adjusted EPS grew more than 7%. We continued to generate strong cash from operations and we've remained on track to meet our commitments for the remainder of the year. Now we'd be happy to take any questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We will now open it up to questions. our first question comes from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Brian. Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Morning, Brian. Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC : On the hospital JVs. I know that's something that you alluded to a little bit earlier in your prepared remarks. What are you seeing in the landscape on the hospitals now, and how do you envision this joint venture with HCA in terms of the opportunity set or the receptivity of HCA and other for-profit hospitals to expand into a similar kind of strategy? Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: well, a couple points, Brian. Thanks for the question. First of all, as I mentioned in my remarks, the interest of hospital CEOs, CFOs and their teams to work with us on their lab strategy is growing, evidenced with what we did with Hartford Hospital and their CLP laboratory. In fact, I was just up there last week meeting with the CEO and meeting with my team. And once we engage and we have this definite relationship, I would say the relationship continues to grow and we are their strategic partner for diagnostic information services. The same continues to grow at Barnabas. We feel good about the progress made there. Again, it continues to expand. And then you asked a question about HCA. HCA is not a joint venture. It is a contract. It's an agreement that we're helping them run their inpatient laboratories and we're hopeful that that will go well and could potentially provide us with more opportunities going forward, but one step at a time. Our job right now is to do a good job at the Denver area in this division and we can take it from there. So this continues to be a growth prospect for us. We've been focused on it for a number of years as you know, and we're starting to see the results. Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC : And then, Steve, you alluded to the Safeway arrangement. So, how should we think about the rationalization of the platform or the PSCs? Is that something that is based in a way to invigorate guidance, or is that going to be an incremental opportunity to reduce cost as you shift all your PSC's into the Safeways? Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Well, first of all, there's three aspects of the work we've done with retailers and Safeway is a good example. First of all, it's to improve the patient experience. If you've seen any of these Safeway clinics or healthcare centers, they're very nice and so it provides a really nice, fresh patient experience for our patients, so we're pleased with that. So again, goes hand in hand with our strategy around improving quality patient experience, at the same time becoming more efficient. And on the efficiency side, we are looking at where these stores are, where we have Patient Service Centers, and where possible, we'll optimize that and take some cost out. But in some cases, we're also augmenting our unparalleled access to the marketplace with some of their locations. So it actually allows us to get greater access. And we think of this market, to the last point I made in my introductory remarks, it's quite important for us to continue to get more and more access for patients where they are. And retail has a great opportunity for us to continue to get more and more access because the data we have is about 30% of laboratory requisitions in the marketplace go unfulfilled. And so our notion is if they have more access, make it more convenient, make it easy for people to go in, get their laboratory requisition fulfilled, it's going to be better for healthcare and it's going to be better for this industry. So that's our strategy. Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, I just want to add in, Brian, that as Steve pointed out, this is not just a cost play and certainly we believe that it's an opportunity to grow our business faster by making our sites more accessible, making things more convenient, making it a more positive experience. But in terms of your other question around Invigorate, you can imagine that our retail strategy's going to work through over time. So at this point we've only given guidance on Invigorate through the end of 2017. Obviously at some point we'll give an update beyond then. So we've got multi-year leases in many cases for our Patient Service Centers. We are not going to dilute our volume and add a lot of incremental sites, so really this is largely going to be replacing Patient Service Centers. So it's not going to be ever 100% of our footprint for a couple reasons. One is for that, because we want to make sure we're located where we need to be and there may not always be a retail opportunity. The second thing is we've got some Patient Service Centers where we might have four, five phlebotomists at a time. And given the limited space in a retail site, we're never going to be able to move those kind of centers fully into retail. So we see it as a great opportunity, but it's not going to be a full replacement. And in terms of its impact on our cost savings and our Invigorate, which also is revenue enhancement, it's going to play out over the next couple years. Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC : Got it. Thanks, guys. Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Ricky. Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Hi, Ricky. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah, hi. Good morning, guys. I have two questions. First one just in terms of clarification around the moving parts around pricing. I think you mentioned that the hospital contracts are a price headwind of 120 basis points. So can you just kind of like walk us through what the headwinds and tailwinds are on the price metric? Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Mark, I think that's yours. Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, sure. So, again, I want to separate price from mix. I think it's really important. So price itself, as we mentioned, which is apples-to-apples price for the same offering on a given test was down a little less than 1% in the quarter. So everything else was mix. So what we did share is the mix impact for Professional Laboratory Services was a headwind of 120 basis points. So you could back into everything else was the positive mix that offset price and offset the mix of PLS to give us a net 20 basis point improvement in revenue per req. Now with that said, the reason we're very careful, Ricky, about separating price from mix is that while price definitely directionally is an indication of profitability, mix is not always representative of profitability, so we caution people, and as we've said over time, don't take math, which is mix driven, as a signal for increased or decreased profitability. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And just to clarify on that impact from hospital, is that something that you expect to improve over the course of the year, over the course of the contract? Or is this just going to be a matter of we have to think about it from a comp perspective? Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So it's a very different business, Ricky, as I pointed out in my prepared remarks, and because of the nature of that business, it happens to have fewer tests and different priced tests than our core business. And those tests are at an attractive margin, so it's not indicative that, again, just because it has lower revenue per req, that that means it's not a profitable test. And in fact, the impact should grow because our expectations are that PLS will grow faster than our core book of business, and therefore that mix impact will increase over time, not just this year, but as our strategy would be going forward, we see more and more of these opportunities. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then my next question is more longer-term nature, really focusing on 2018, which is the first year of PAMA. When we think about the different moving parts and try to better understand the earnings power, obviously there's more clarity on PAMA now, but can you just kind of like help us through to think what are the other variables we need to think about? Do you have any big contract up for renewal in 2018? And also as you think about expanding Invigorate beyond 2017, how much more cost do you estimate you'll need to take out in order to offset the PAMA impact? Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, so first of all on PAMA, as we said in our remarks, we're pleased we have a push-out of the date. Second is we're pleased that they've expanded with the approach of more laboratories in the sample set, and we'll see when we get to 2018 if there is a price reduction and how much it is. And they estimate that as mid-single digits. And then also what we said is if you go back and look at our history, the reason why we have Invigorate and the reason why we continue to drive quality and efficiency is to be able to absorb some of the headwinds. And obviously, true price concessions, and I treat this as true price concessions, as Mark just said, is one of the offsets. So what we said and what we believe is when we get there, we'll have to absorb this, and we will absorb this. So with that said, we've only provided guidance and an outlook for Invigorate through 2017. What I said in my remarks is they continue to be on track for that. It's $1.3 billion, it's an additional $600 million from what we achieved a couple years ago, so we feel good about the progress made on that. And then what we also have said is that in any business, in any industry, you need to continue to drive efficiency and quality going forward past 2017, and we're not prepared at this point to talk about that. But given what I said earlier, obviously, we're going to have to have some efficiency gains in 2018 to be able to offset any kind of price erosion and we feel confident that we'll have those given what we have in our perspective on the future. So that's what I can share this point, but we're encouraged by what we've learned in the visibility around PAMA. We're encouraged by Invigorate and the progress we're making there. And we're not done with that. We'll continue to make progress, and we'll deal with that in due course. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Muken of Evercore. Your line is now open. Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC : Hi. Good morning, gentleman. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Ross. Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC : I guess you talked a lot about some of the improvements across the business. Obviously quite evident first part of this year versus last year and the few prior. Now, I guess, where do you feel like the momentum has been maybe better than you would have expected? Maybe it's on some of the PLS agreements or what bps is looking like? And then is there any part that you would point to as it's trended that maybe you feel like needs to be more of a tailwind for you than it's been? It feels like the business is sort of starting to turn a corner here. So I'm just trying to differentiate where you feel like maybe not you've declared victory, but you're sort of where you want to be versus not. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I appreciate the question. And what we've said for the last four years is that our restore growth strategy is multifaceted. This business, this industry has a number of products, a number of different programs, a number of different services. And we have to work multiple fronts. To answer your direct question about where we are encouraged, we are encouraged about the continued prospects around advanced diagnostics; the genetic offerings that we introduced this quarter are very strong. We feel they're very competitive now with some of the incumbents in the marketplace, particularly around our BRCA offering. We expanded our panel. We have now a very nice comprehensive hereditary-based panel. And as you know, we continue to build on our relationship with Memorial Sloan Kettering in that space. And we offer some nice offerings around colorectal cancer, as well as a comprehensive hereditary cancer panel. So that is good and growing, and a lot of promise in front of it. Second is we talked about the work around hepatitis C continues to be a great opportunity for us. Last quarter, we talked about the companion diagnostics associated with it. That is promising. And then third is prescription drug monitoring continues to be a big opportunity for us. It's growing. We're pleased with our progress. And as you know in this country, there's a lot of renewed interest around pain meds and opiates and misuse of those and we're right in the middle of that whole debate. And we're part of the solution to that problem. And with that, we're coupling that with our Hospital Services business, which we've been working on for the past four years. You're starting to see the fruits of our efforts there. We're very pleased with our announcement of Barnabas. We're very pleased with the acquisition of our Hartford Hospital outreach relationship, which again is a purchase, but at the same time it builds a relationship with Hartford Hospital. We're very pleased with our first work with HCA. And as I said, there's many more prospects in our funnel that we continue to be happy about. Now with that said, the last question is where you think there's more promise. I think this last piece, the strategy around hospitals, is something that I believe will continue to be a great growth driver for us. As I work the country and speak with our teams and speak with hospital CEOs and their management teams, they clearly can't do it all themselves, and they're looking for partnerships. And they realize that all we do every day is diagnostic information services. And where we have these relationships are those organizations that realize they're best served serving their population and doing best in their business by relying on us for their diagnostic information services business. So I think there's a lot more growth opportunities going forward than what we've seen so far, and I'm optimistic about that. Thank you for the question. Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC : Yeah, that was great. And maybe just quick follow-up on the cancer genetic side. There's so much going on and we continue to hear more optimistic things in terms of the companion PD-L1. How is your thought process evolving around how you're going to play there? Obviously you have some existing relationships. And how you size that market versus maybe some of the legacy similar type drugs? Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, well, first of all, it's evolving, it's growing, it's exciting. As you know, reimbursement's always the challenge in this space. While we have focused on those areas where there is good reimbursement, and clearly, BRCA is one of the best examples of the industry seeing benefit from it and now it's getting reimbursed for it. And as we introduced with our new product this past quarter but we now have an expanded channel in that regard for other hereditary markers in that offering. We believe that it looks promising for us and it provides more prospects for growth and we continue to work the reimbursement side of this to demonstrate with good clinical evidence that in fact that that actually delivering value that's actionable because only when you can defend that you have good clinical value and it is actionable, then you will get paid by healthcare insurance companies. So we're continuously working that. So it's evolving but it is exciting and it's a key opportunity for growth for us going forward. Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC : Great. Thank you. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jack Meehan of Barclays. Your line is open. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I wanted to start just on the underlying utilization trends you're seeing. I know, Mark, you mentioned about half the growth was from CLP and MemorialCare. What do you think \u2013 did Barnabas and maybe the movement of Easter add in the quarter? And then just in general what are you seeing in terms of the physician office trend? Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. So I have not, and I wouldn't break out a specific engagement like Barnabas and its impact, but certainly it contributed positively for us. As you look at all the moving parts, Jack, I think the organic growth is a pretty solid number, taking into account the movement of Easter and other calendar shifts and so on and so forth. So you can look at the approximately 100 basis points of organic growth and count on that as being solid and something that's a trend that we're going to build on and continue throughout the balance of the year driven by growth in our core business and also some growth in this new opportunity being our professional laboratory services, most notably Barnabas. But I'm not going to be splitting out specific relationships or engagements each quarter. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah, understood. And then one more on PAMA. I'm just curious now that the final rule is out in the market and is beginning to get digested by the industry, are you seeing any different tone with either hospitals or smaller independent labs in terms of the M&A around whether it's in-sourcing versus outsourcing and just the relationships that you develop there? Thanks. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I can't say that the build, if you will, of interest around building a relationship with Quest is specifically related to what's going on with PAMA. But there might be some correlation between PAMA in that it's another contributing factor. When we have conversations with hospital systems, they talk about the changing nature of their business, they're moving away from fee for service to taking risk. When you move the risk, they need to have a low-cost provider. There's no question we're a lower cost provider than typically their hospital lab is, and they have a lot of other priorities and why would they put the next dollar of investment into laboratory when they have a good national leader nearby? And so that's typically the conversation we have, and they realize that there's going to be price pressure on the commercial rate in every place. And, yes, their laboratory commercial rates will be under pressure, but also they understand Medicare is not going to also provide a lot of help as well. So there could be pressure there. So it's contributing but it's not necessarily, I would say, an overall driver so far. But with all that said, I think people have realized that there will be, with all this analysis for interest in it going forward, it's hard to say beyond what the estimate was of mid-single digits in 2018, how that will affect specific labs. So that estimate is based upon the market basket that CMS says. The fees for all their expenditures from the clinical lab fee schedule, and so when you specifically apply whatever cuts there might be to a specific business, they could be considerable for small operators that are doing mostly routine testing in a small geography. And they're not billing out all the codes like we do for clinical lab fee schedule for Medicare. So it's unfolding, so more to learn, but I think we've got a lot more clarity today than we did six months ago. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Understood, thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks. Good morning, Steve and Mark. Congrats on these results. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Morning. Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Just on the PAMA related reimbursement change delay, it's obviously good news as you mentioned. But it does still seem from some calls that we're getting that maybe there's still a little bit of investor confusion as to whether or not there could be any CMS cuts to the CLFS in 2017 to essentially replace the PAMA delay. I think there was some color in the final rule that suggests this is probably even more unlikely now, but maybe it wouldn't hurt on this call just to give your latest thoughts on that just to clear the air if you are able to. Thanks. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So I think CMS is very focused on getting PAMA right. It is an act of Congress and therefore, any change to PAMA would require another act of Congress. So their entire focus is on this. Clearly, they've got to get it right. They've been told by Congress that they need to do it with a market based approach, and this is their entire focus. So from our view, this is what we should expect will happen in 2017, is really gathering all the data, going through all the data trying to understand it. And as you know, we still have the CPI adjustment and the productivity adjustments as well. And some of that came through in 2016 and will continue to come through as time goes on. So our view is this is going to be predominance of focus for CMS and how we get paid. Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Got it. One other quick one, just if I can sneak one in too. The earlier color on the Safeway retail deal is helpful. Just the one quick follow-up on that is, I'm curious whether that Safeway deal precludes you from entering into other similar large deals with other retailers in those six states that you've entered into so far. And could you theoretically still do a national retail deal like this with any third party if you chose to do so? Thanks. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, we continue to have freedom to operate. It's a great relationship. We could build on it. But we believe there's more opportunities for us to build our patient access. We have unparalleled access, we believe. We have over 2200 Patient Service Centers, they have over 3500 people in physicians' offices, and then we have partnerships with JVs. So \u2013 and it continues to build, and we think this retail opportunity, as I described, has really got those three prongs. One is great patient experience, second is that helps us with efficiency, and potentially, augments that unparalleled access, with nice access to where people go every day which are typically retail stores. So we're encouraged, but we have more prospects as well going forward to expand in even further because we're not limited in our ability to operate with the relationship we have with Safeway. Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yes. As Steve said, the contract with Safeway does not preclude us from other arrangements. But as you might imagine, we're not going to put in redundant space. So if we have a Safeway location in a given neighborhood, it's unlikely, even if we have a partnership with another retailer, that we would put another PSC in the same location. So it's really all about mapping this out, the demographics where our business is, where we draw the businesses from the physician's office, et cetera. So in the partnership in Safeway it's really important, and they're kind of, since they're on the lead here, they're going to be one of the first people to decide, in partnership with us, where we're going to put some of these locations. And so I wanted to stress that while it doesn't preclude us and we certainly are in discussion with other retailers, we highly value the Safeway agreement, and as I said, as the first mover, they're going to going to be the one we're starting with. Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, got it. Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Amanda Murphy from William Blair. Line is open. Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Just a follow-up on PAMA. So I'm not sure if you have an answer to this, but I'm just curious, in terms of using the NPI from a hospital perspective, just given that you have quite a few relationships with hospitals at this point, I'm just wondering how, or if you have any view into how they're looking at that piece of it, particularly if they don't have an NPI as a hospital lab. Is that something you think that hospital labs will have incentives to get at this point? Or is yours the opposite view? Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, well first of all, as I said in my remarks, the movement away from using the TIN, the tax ID number, to a net provider indicator or (44:04) number, is positive. We think there'll be more labs required to contribute their data to CMS with that. But like so many parts of healthcare, we don't fully appreciate the extent of how many more and what percentage that will be. And actually, as trade associations, as American Clinical Lab Association, we're going to sponsor a project to actually do a sampling of hospitals to see if in fact there are \u2013 what this does to the sample. Because our objective, along with Congress, along with CMS is to get this right, and we said it should be market based, and we all agree that the market includes the national labs, the regional labs and hospital outreach. And so we appreciate this new approach, but we want to make sure that this new approach does capture possible outreach. So we're going to run a study to see what it shows us and then take it from there. Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Fair enough. And then just on the Quintiles JV, just wanted to get an update there given their relationship with IMS. I think you had talked in the past about potentially working with Quintiles more broadly than the central lab. So wondering how those conversations are going at this point. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, we continue to focus on our integration of our laboratory operations, and that was the primary focus of the joint venture is to bring both of our businesses together and take out the cost, the redundant cost of both those operations. We're making very good progress on that front. We feel good about it, and as Mark said in his introductory remarks, it's showing up in our results below the operating income line. But we will build value through that relationship. As far as other work with Quintiles, what we shared before is, yes, we will consider working with Quintiles and IMS and others around how we use our data to help with drug discovery. We have nothing really firm in place with any of them, but I'll share with you that we have multiple working relationships, and one of those relationships is with Quintiles. So we continue to look at what the data means and how we could use it and doing some tests with a variety of potential partners in this space. So we're still encouraged about the prospects, but having some type of preferred or exclusive or closer relationship is not what we have today. Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks very much. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Quirk of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Great. Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Bill. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.: So first question I guess is going back to the earlier HCA HealthONE lab management question, and that is in the event that you were able to expand this, do you have any sense, Steve, what time, I guess, the evaluation period would be? I'm just trying to get an idea here. Is this a two-year see if this works and we can expand it, or is this a longer-term sort of project? Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: That would be highly speculative for me to comment on that. We have to be successful at this first project, demonstrate we can save them money. I mean, in the end, this all about making their inpatient laboratory more efficient. We believe we can. When we put those points on the board, we realized that that's going to be very visible to HCA management and we'll take it from there. But beyond what I said, it would be highly speculative for me to comment on how fast it's going to move. Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Just be clear, the relationship itself is not a pilot. It is a firm multi-year relationship that we're committed to. What we were implying is that, as you might imagine, there's a possibility of further expansion. And whether it's within HCA or other hospital systems, seeing the momentum we're getting, hearing from some of the CEOs with whom we have relationships how successful these things are going and how valuable it is to them. So we will save them money. So it's really, in our minds, just a matter of comfort and time before we'll expand these somewhere. Whether we expand it more broadly within HCA or other places, we think the better your track record is, the better opportunity you have to get more people onboard. And it is with the Denver division of HCA, just to be clear, not with HCA itself. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.: I appreciate the color. Thank you. And then secondly, just I guess latest thoughts around the FDA's LDT initiative. It seems like every day that goes by without it getting to OMB or congressional notification suggests that we may see a legislative solution? Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, we're working it. As you know, we believe as an industry that the FDA does not have the statutory authority to regulate laboratories and LDTs. We've been working proactively on a legislative solution with a number of groups. We've made some progress on that front, but as you know, it's the summer months and not a lot will happen in the summer months in Washington. So we will see, when the fall is here, where this goes, but we think a legislative solution is the best option for us. And that's the one that we're pursuing, and we hope we can be able to get to a place that we can accept as the Trade Association and as the company going forward. But it's still there, but it's moving at a very slow pace. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Understood. Thanks for the color. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from A. J. Rice, UBS. Your line is open. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey. Good morning, A. J. A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Oh, thanks. Hi, everybody. How are you? Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good. A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : With the pickup in the pace around deals with hospitals, whether its contract, outright purchasing of business and other structures, can you just maybe comment a little bit on how those structures have evolved and the economics of the deals that you're seeing today versus a few years ago? Are they different, about same? Are you pushing a different type of structure? Is the hospital asking for any kind of different structure? Just give us some flavor on that. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, well, first of all, you see one deal, you see one deal. We've said this before because healthcare is complex. Every deal has got its own nuances as you could appreciate. And you have to separate. When we buy an outreach business, that's an outright purchase of their existing commercial business. And in the case, a good example of that is what we did with Hartford Hospital and CLP, which we closed and we're in the process of integrating. And I would characterize those deals as being similar to the other ones we've done. We take over the business. We reprice it at our rates. We build a business case around taking out cost and we think the returns for our shareholders are quite good. But what I'll also say, and I said this in my introductory remarks, when we typically do that, it typically gets us into a broader conversation about their lab strategy. And so typically they say, wow (51:18), okay, now we're tight with you. Let's talk about our advanced testing for our hospitals, or what's called reference testing, and let's talk about how you potentially could help us with our hospital inpatient laboratory and making that more efficient. So it typically becomes a beachhead opportunity for us to build a stronger relationship. The second type of relationship, A. J., is we have an engagement, a professional services engagement like the one we have with Barnabas. And that's a services relationship. It's multi-year. We're providing service for a fee. We believe that we agree on certain conditions of delivery and payment, and we run it as that. And again, when we get in those relationships, because this is all around their inpatient laboratory, we then typically get in a conversation around their outreach business. Is that something they want to continue to stay in? Could we help them with it? And second is their advanced testing or their reference testing business. So we have that conversation, as well. And I would say the third example is where there is a broader, deeper relationship where we think it might be prudent for us to form a joint venture in some form. And the most recent example of us doing that is with University of Massachusetts Medical Center, where we bought their outreach business but we also help them in many different ways in central Massachusetts. And so they actually have a small minority stake in that joint venture. So we're deeply embedded together in making that work in central Mass. So all different sizes and shapes of how we work with hospital systems, which reflects the marketplace. I think part of our strategy here as well is what we're showing to the marketplace is we're a company and an organization that can manage in this very, very dynamic space. And you can work with Quest in whatever way makes sense. Obviously we want a deal that's going to work for both sides, but we are flexible and prudent in how we put together those relationships. But again, you see one deal, you see one deal. So hopefully that's helpful in providing a little bit more color... A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah, that's great. Let me \u2013 just a quick follow-up on a different area. So you had the asset sale this quarter and you stepped up the share repurchase as you've done before with other asset sales. When you think about capital deployment for the second half and moving forward, should we assume the share repurchase activity sort of settles back to what we saw in the first quarter? Or any other comments on direction of cash flow in the back half of the year? Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, so I assume when you say cash flow, you mean cash utilization, A. J.? A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Right. Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : What you should assume is we'll follow our fifth point of our five-point strategy, so once we get through the ASR, which was really triggered as you pointed out by the monetization of the Focus Products business, we'll continue to either deploy towards M&A or towards share repurchases. Obviously between the dividend and share repurchases we've done through the first half of the year, we've met our commitment of guaranteeing a majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders. So we've met that threshold. So the back half, depending on the timing and probability of executing any sort of deals, the cash flow will either be utilized for that, and if we don't have value-creating deals and we close in that timeframe, then we will \u2013 as opposed to sitting on the cash \u2013 we would do some additional repurchases. A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks a lot. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks, guys. Good morning. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Isaac. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, Steve. First question was kind of a longer-term item regarding PAMA. Just curious if the current state of PAMA legislation has had any impact on the nature of your conversations with private payers when it comes to negotiating your longer-term contracts with them. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No. It's an interesting topic, but frankly they're looking at our relationship, the term of that relationship, where any discussion around pricing should be. So very little relationship, if any, between what's happening with PAMA and the refresh of the lab fee schedule in our discussions with payers. Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, we've gotten that question, Isaac, a number of times. I want to say again that there's very, very few contracts, if any, that are mechanically tied to Medicare rates. Yes, it's a reference point that people use in some discussions, but there's really \u2013 since there's not a mechanistic trigger, as Steve said, it's really not been a topic of conversation. They obviously want the best value. We're having discussions around the value that we bring them and the fact that we already have excellent pricing. That's more the focus of the conversation versus anything going on in the public sector reimbursement. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah, that's helpful. And then just a follow-up question on 2016 guidance, specifically for cash flow. I think your guidance does call for an acceleration in CapEx in the back half of this year just based on what we know you spent in the first half. So I'm wondering what that acceleration is related to, and then to what extent some of those dollars might be one time in nature that roll off in 2017? Thank you. Mark J. Guinan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, so when you say acceleration, we have had a historical pattern of spending more in the back half than the first half, so this year is not atypical. We are slightly lower this year versus last year by a little over $10 million for the first six months of the year. We're guiding to a number that's similar to slightly less than we spent last year, so I think it all fits, Isaac. It really has to do with the timing of some of the work that we're doing where we consume our capital, and certainly a part of that is some equipment refresh. Some of that is tied to our Invigorate program such as the lab standardization work, and it's really driven by when we're executing some of those conversions. So really nothing unusual or atypical, I would say, in our capital spend this year, but I think the good news is that we're expecting to spend less this year than we did last year. And as we move forward, as we've mentioned, we're looking to get some of this high level of capital for Invigorate behind us and really return to a little lower level than we have versus the last couple years as a proportion of our total operating cash flow and as a proportion of risk. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. That makes sense. Thanks very much, guys. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from building Bill Bonello of Craig-Hallum. Your line is open. William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : Thanks. Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Bill. William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : Just kind of a big picture question on the commercial contracting outlook going forward. I think we're coming up on 10 years of some of these preferred national relationships for the large labs and some of the largest payers. Obviously the payer landscape's changing pretty dramatically. At least one of those contracts, I believe, terms in 2018. I'm just curious how you think that situation plays out going forward. Do you think we continue to have a situation where you have certain payers aligned with certain national providers? Or do you think we move into a more open access kind of contracting situation over the next several years? Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Well, first of all, Bill, thanks for the question. We're not going to comment on the specific contracts with some of our largest partners. But as we said before, we have hundreds of contracts so we're potentially working, and what happens every year with some of the refreshes on those contracts. And in that regard, we have our normal cadence of how we'll work through that this year, next year and into 2018. Generally, given our leadership position in this marketplace, we're fortunate to be included in most of the healthcare insurance contracts throughout this country. And I think we're increasingly making it obvious it's good for patients, it's good for them attracting membership that they have Quest on contract. Now despite us maybe not having a preferred national relationship in some cases, we still continue to have strong working relationships with some of those healthcare insurance companies that we don't enjoy those relationships. And also, we continue to see other ways of working together with some of those systems. So I won't speculate on or give specifics on contract dates and timing of all that, but we're managing this in due course. And fortunately for us, we have a very strong position given our strength and position in this marketplace that collectively and collaborately we're part of the network of what's required in healthcare delivery throughout the country in a big way. And we have a good, strong seat at the table. William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : Do you want to elaborate at all, you said exploring alternative ways of working together, on what any of that might look like? Stephen H. Rusckowski - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. I mean, give an example. We have a big business measure around wellness. So our wellness business is a good business, we sell it directly to large employers but we also sell it to healthcare insurance companies. In selling it to healthcare insurance companies, they resell it. An example of that is we sell it to Aetna, we sell it to Cigna, but we also sell it to United Optum, as an example. We also are perpetually asked for data. We test about 50% of adult Americans every year, excuse me in the course of three years. Having that data is quite important to healthcare insurance companies. So we're quite collaborative with the industry of serving up our data to help them manage some of their managed Medicaid or managed Medicare business in a collaborative way. So, two examples. And the third example is with Inovalon, which is our data analytics product which is part of our new product introduction that we made this year around Quantum. We serve this up to all healthcare insurance companies, regardless of what we have for a laboratory contract. And so we're proactively working with all the companies that are taking risk, and so put this again in a different place with all healthcare insurance companies in a much different and broader way. So we often think about our laboratory contract, but our relationship with these systems are much broader than that. William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : Perfect.

Now I'd like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Executive Director of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead, please. Shawn Bevec : Thank you, and good morning. I'm here with Steve Rusckowski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and also discuss non-GAAP measures. For this call, references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in Quest Diagnostics' 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. The text of our prepared remarks and a PowerPoint presentation will be available later today in the Investor Relations page of our website. Now here's Steve Rusckowski. Steve Rusckowski : Thanks, Shawn, and thanks everyone for joining us today. This morning I'll provide you with the highlights of the quarter and review progress on our strategy and then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through our updated guidance. During the third quarter, revenues were up on reported basis and grew 2.1% on an equipment basis. Reported EPS decreased 43%, primarily due to the gain from our 2015 contribution to the Q Squared Solutions joint venture. On an adjusted basis, EPS grew 7%, cash from operations were $301 million up 42%. Now let me discuss highlights of the progress we're making in several areas of five-point strategy, which as you all know is to restore growth, drive operational excellence to simplify the organization, refocus on our diagnostic information services business and deliver disciplined capital deployment. So let's start with growth.. We continue to make progress with our expanded hospital systems relationships. In professional lab services, HCA began to contribute to growth in the third quarter. As we announced earlier this year, we're managing an inpatient laboratory operation for six Denver area hospitals in HealthONE System of HCA Healthcare. Revenues from this engagement will continue to increase throughout the end of the year. Our Professional Lab Services agreement where RWJ Barnabas Health in New Jersey and Clinical Laboratory Partners the outreach lab business we acquired from Hartford Healthcare in Connecticut, both contributed to perform well and grew revenue this quarter. Beyond our hospital systems relationships, we also continue to deliver solid growth in prescription drug monitoring in infectious disease testing including Zika. In prescription drug monitoring we remain and industry leader with strong growth in the quarter. Providers and payers appreciate our unique ability to help manage the epidemic of prescription drug abuse with appropriate test utilization. In infectious disease, we continue to see solid growth in the fourth generation HIV testing as well as Hepatitis C testing for screening and genotyping to help doctors determine the type, dose or duration of treatment. Turning to Zika we complemented our proprietary PCR test with a new antibody test license from the Center for Disease Control. Quest Diagnostics is proud to be among a group of select national reference laboratories, selected by the Center for Disease Control to aid the response of the Zika emergency in the United States. Looking forward we're excited about our new agreement with Ancestry. Quest will become Ancestry's first CLIA approved lab partner to provide DNA testing, enabling Ancestry DNA subscribers to build their family based on the origins. Over time we intend to support additional opportunities with Ancestry to guide people on building and understanding their family health tree. We're also very excited about the recent launch of the IBM launch of genomics from Quest Diagnostics, a new service that helps advance precision medicine by combining cognitive computing with genomic tumor sequencing. The service helps oncologists match patients with cancer therapies and clinical trials based on the tumor's unique DNA. Quest expertise in genomics and cancer as well as our broad market penetration to have the country's physicians and hospitals means Watson power tumor sequencing is accessible for the first time to the community and oncologist to provide 70% of the nation's cancer care. Memorial Sloan Kettering and the Broad institute will contribute their data and research expertise to further augment the offering. The next element of our strategy I'll highlight is driving operational excellence. Our collaboration with Optum will help us reduce cost and complexity of our billing processes and also increase transparency of healthcare cost for patients, physicians and employers. Employee engagement in our Optum alliance has been positive and the integration is on track. Quest employees will transition to Optum team in mid-November. We expect to begin realizing savings from this relationship next year. We view this agreement without Optum as the start of a long-term relationship and it builds on our long-standing relationship with Optum's parent the United Health Group. For decades Quest has served the United Healthcare plan participants to help them take action to improve their health based on insights from diagnostic testing and information services. Also in the third quarter, we opened 12 patient service centers in five states in Safeway supermarkets. In just the first months patients are finding it easier to access testing in a more convenient location and we've seen volume increases in these retail settings. We remain excited about expanding patient access through retail partnerships. We continue to execute on our last element of our strategy was to deliver disciplined capital deployment. We completed our $250 million accelerated share repurchase program announced in May, using the proceeds of the sale of Focus Diagnostic business. Through this ASR we repurchased approximately 3.1 million shares, additionally bought back another $50 million of company stock, bringing the total repurchases of 2016 to $440 million through the end of the third quarter. We look forward to sharing more detail on our market views and strategic outlook at our third Investor Day at the Intercontinental New York Barclay Hotel in Midtown on November 11. Registration information is available on our Investor Relations webpage. Now Mark will provide an overview on our third quarter financial performance and provide you with an update on our 2016 outlook, Mark? Mark Guinan : Thanks Steve. Starting with revenues, consolidated revenues of $1.89 billion were up 0.3% versus the prior year on a reported basis. Equivalent revenues grew 2.1% for the company. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services or DIS for short, grew by 2.1% compared to the prior year. Of this growth, approximately 1% was organic. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions increased 2% versus the prior year. Approximately half came from organic growth including our Professional Lab Services or PLS engagements and the other half from recent acquisitions. Revenue per acquisition in the third quarter was flat versus a year ago. As a reminder revenue per req is not a proxy for price and includes a number of variables such as unit price variation, business mix, test mix and test per requisition. Unit price headwinds moderated in the third quarter, down roughly 50 basis points compared to the 100 basis points headwinds we observed in the first half. Consistent with previous quarters our PLS engagement such as our WJ Barnabas Health and HCA carry lower revenue per requisition due to the nature of the work we are performing and lower the revenue per req calculation. In the third quarter, the impact of our PLS engagements was slightly larger than the 120 basis points we highlighted in the second quarter, which is representative of the strong growth we are seeing in this business. With HCA coming online in the third quarter and ramping up through the end of the year, we expect PLS to continue to grow at a faster rate than the balance of our business in Q4. After considering the impacts of unit price and PLS, other mix elements including test and payer mix contributed nearly 2% to revenue per req in the quarter. Reported operating income for the quarter was $322 million or 17.1% of revenues compared to $631 million or 33.6% of revenues a year ago. Our reported third quarter 2016 results included a $334 million pretax gain on the contribution to Q Squared joint venture with Quintiles. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $320 million or 17% of revenues compared to $325 million or 17.3% of revenues last year. The impact of our former Focus Diagnostics and Celera products businesses in the third quarter of 2015 benefited adjusted operating income by approximately $16 million or 50 basis points. Excluding this impact, margins would have grown by 20 basis points year-over-year. Reported EPS was a $1.34 in the quarter, compared to $2.35 a year ago. The year-over-year decline was driven primarily by the net gain on our Q Squared contribution mentioned previously. Adjusted EPS was $1.37 up from $1.28 last year. The company recorded special items with an after-tax benefit totaling $10 million in the quarter, representing an escrow recovery associated with an acquisition, which was partially offset by restricting and immigration charges. The net impact of these items benefitted our reported EPS by $0.07.  Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 4%, 20 basis points better than the previous quarter and 10 basis points higher than 2015. As a reminder, bad debt expense typically improves modestly throughout the year as patients hit their health insurance deductibles. Note that the year-over-year compare is negatively impacted by the fact that our products businesses had a lower associated bad debt rate. When taking this into consideration, our bad debt rate was flat year-over-year. Quick comment on our new billing relationship with Optum, to reiterate, expense savings from this relationship will not begin until 2017. We expect modest savings on our billing support cost during each year of the 10-year agreement and Optum will work with us to help lower our bad debt rate as well as reduce our denials over time. Income tax expense in the quarter benefited from the adoption of the new accounting standard related to stock-based compensation. The impact amounted to an EPS benefit of roughly $0.02 in Q3. The new standard also results in a change in weighted shares outstanding by increasing the effect of dilutive securities which slightly offsets the EPS benefit. Our DSOs were 46 days, two days higher than last year, but one day better than the prior quarter. The year-over-year increase was primarily attributable to higher levels of patient responsibility. For the first nine months of 2016, cash provided by operations was $765 million versus $549 million last year. Capital expenditures were $165 million through the third quarter compared to $169 million a year ago. Before moving to guidance, I'd like to highlight that operations in our Southeast region were impacted by Hurricane Matthew earlier this month. Our updated guidance reflects the impact we currently know. Additionally, I want to provide some color on a few notable items, which will impact our full-year operating cash flows. The first relates to after-tax charges for the full-year 2016 of $29 million from the retirement of debt. Second, we will incur a full year cash tax outlay of $91 million associated with the focus to register that will be recorded in our operating cash flow, while the associated $275 million from the sale is reported in our investing cash flow. We paid $68 million of this liability in Q3 with the remainder to be paid in the fourth quarter. Third in Q3, we realized $54 million of proceeds from the termination of interest rate swap agreements. In aggregate these three items are adversely impacting our full-year operating cash flow by a net of $66 million. Now turning to guidance, based on our year-to-date results, we are narrowing our 2016 outlook as follows. Revenues to be approximately $7.51 billion, an increase of about 0.5% versus the prior year on a reported basis and an increase of about 2.5% on an equivalent basis. This compares to previous revenue guidance of between $7.47 billion and $7.54 billion. Reported diluted EPS to be between $4.47 and $4.52 and adjusted EPS to be between $5.07 and $5.12. This compares to previous EPS guidance of $4.18 and $4.33 on a reported basis and $5.02 and $5.17 on an adjusted basis. Cash provided by operations to be approximately $1 billion, which compares to previous guidance of approximately $880 million. And finally capital expenditures to be approximately $250 million compared to between $250 million and $300 million previously. Now let me turn it back to Steve. Steve Rusckowski : Thanks Mark. To summarize we continued our success in 2016 with another good performance in the third quarter. We continue to generate strong cash from operations and we remain on track to meet our commitments for the remainder of the year. With that, we would be happy to take any questions, operator? Operator : Thank you. We will now open it up to questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Bill Quirk from Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Bill Quirk : Thanks and good morning, everyone. First question is just thinking about the, final clinical lab fee schedule for 2017, I guess we've been thinking or expecting rather that it was likely to be flat when the final adjustment comes out here in about lesser month now, but recent hearing some chatter that we may actually see a small inflation update to that. Any thoughts on that guys? Thank you. Steve Rusckowski : Yes thanks. So as you know we don't really know and last year we had a small adjustment as well to it. So hopefully your view of what you've heard is right, but at this point we have nothing to add to what you're saying. Bill Quirk : Okay. Got it. And then just a follow-up, I guess kind of bigger picture question, help us think a little bit about some of the health exchanges. Obviously there has been some pressure on managed care. We've seen some people pull out of this and so how are you thinking about this over the coming couple of years here, thanks? Steve Rusckowski : Yeah I think we're all trying to understand how those lives will eventually get healthcare insurance. I think state by state will sort its way out. We can't speculate at this time how those lives will be picked up but as you read and you know as well as we do, that the number of the particularly national providers have decided to pull out of the exchanges, but you would -- you have to believe that those lives that might be impacted will be dealt within the appropriate way state-by-state, but it's too early to speculate on that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Ashley Craig : Hi. Good morning. This is Ashley on for Ricky. I just wanted to -- I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color into some of the partnerships you highlighted in the press release. We noted that PLS agreements are positive to volumes, the headwind to price, the Optum agreement is supposed to help with curving bad debt expense, but could you talk a little bit about Safeway and Ancestry and IBM? Where are we with the impact of those relative to the core business? Steve Rusckowski : Yeah. Thank you very much. Well first of all, we're encouraged with our continued growth that we're seeing in our professional lab services business. We've highlighted two in my opening remarks. One is the relationship with HCA, the second is related to a relationship with Barnabas here in New Jersey. They're often running -- they contributed to growth in the quarter. We're optimistic about their prospects and also we've a good funnel with us. They made one comment that I would like to react to. We've been very, very careful to make sure that we described how this business affects the calculation of revenue per acquisition and what we've done carefully is to talk about in the script and I am sure Mark will provide some color, is that we actually provided in the script the unit price impact of this quarter to our performance and that is when you freeze all other characteristics of our business what the true pricing impact is on our business, where there is other characteristics of our business like and peer mix that affect the calculation of revenue per req. So we feel very positive about the growth prospects for professional lab services business. It's a great growth opportunity. It's great return on invested capital. The report is greater for shareholder value creation, but it does affect the calculation because it's at a lower price point. That is not to be confused with price reductions. So I want to make sure that's clear sure and I am sure what I've done here Mark will comment on that as well to make sure it's absolutely clear. As far as partnerships, we believe that being a company that work with others in healthcare is an important part of what we do. We obviously are demonstrating. We know how to do that. Number of things we talked about already have to do with us former relationships. We talk about professional lab services. I'll also mention that when we buy outreach businesses like I referred to is the Hartford Hospital outreach business that we bought. We're working on building on that to have a strong relationship. Couple that with what we announced this fall with Optum. Optum will allow us to work with one of the leaders in healthcare analytics, leaders in healthcare services to work on understanding what we can do to improve the billing process and thereby helping us with our bad debt exposure as well as making sure we get paid for a lot of the more sophisticated testing that we do. We think of them working with us is better than us working independent and that's a good opportunity for our shareholders going forward. So we're optimistic about that opportunity, but also what you also see in my introductory remarks, we believe this continues to build on a strong working relationship we have with the United Health Group and this new working relationship with revenue cycle management will only enhance that relationship. We actually do the -- we have a strong collaboration to do their wellness work within Optum. We have an existing relationship with some of their physician groups that they're buying in terms of laboratory professional services and then finally as we continue to be a big supplier of laboratory professional services for United Healthcare membership today and we believe that will continue to grow. So we're optimistic about the prospects there. We also announced recently the relationship with IBM. This builds on our relationship and our product that we introduced a couple years ago with Memorial Sloan Kettering. It's a growing new field to Precision Medicine as you know and we provide in this relationship a product called OncoVantage, which basically provides visibility to oncologists what can be known with 34 actionable jeans. From that data we'll say what drugs will work and what drugs will now work, but as importantly what clinical trials that could potentially roll their patience in. This work will expand with the relationship with IBM and also Memorial Sloan. We also mentioned that this is collaborative work once again and the broad Institute is involved as well which we're optimistic about, because as I said at the beginning, healthcare is really a much more collaborative game going forward and quest we're all about working with others when it comes quite clear of the work we've done and is how it's helping our business. So let me just stop there and let me turn it to Mark to make sure I properly addressed the question about the PLS business and how we think about revenue per requisition as a calculation, Mark. Mark Guinan : Thanks Steve. I think it's important we clearly have not done enough to get everybody clear on this. When you think about the work we do, we do tests. Now we use requisitions as a surrogate for volume, but in fact we do test. So if a patient comes forward with a single test and would say a standard routine test and another patient comes forward and has two of those, there is going to be a different value to the requisition, but it has nothing to do with price. So the reason that people have and we have shared requisitions is there is a margin implication to some extent because of the front end and the back end is somewhat of a fixed cost per patient engagement or requisition. So specimen acquisition and billing you say the more testing we can get on our requisition, the more efficient you can be, but again that's on the cost side not the price side. However with PLS as we've explained, the specimen acquisition is incredibly efficient. We don't do the draws and from a logistics perspective, we're picking up dozens and dozens of tests at a single point in time instead of a handful as we want to at an office position park. So the logistics is very efficient. We don't incur the draw cost and then the billing is incredibly efficient because there is no third party billing, there is no patient responsibility of the single bill for a large volume to client. So I just want to make sure we continue to do what we need to do that people are clear that the mix calculation is the calculation and it's not price. We actually call out price very specifically so to understand apples and apples are headwinds and we're actually getting paid less per test. Ashley Craig : Got it. That makes sense. Thank you for the color. Steve Rusckowski : Thank you.. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Ralph Giacobbe of Citibank. Your line is now open. Steve Rusckowski : Good morning, Ralph. Ralph Giacobbe : Good morning. So just going back to the PLS, I just hope and I guess on the two fronts, on volume and price, first on the volume side, just hoping whether you could give a little bit of sense of what it may be contributed specifically HealthONE and Barnabas to volume growth this quarter and maybe help us is it in the run rate at this point. Is there some sort of ramp we should consider in the fourth quarter and in 2017 any help there. And then just on the pricing side as you just explained, I guess I guess what I'm still grappling with is just understanding so on a test by test basis, is the price the same or is it lower in PLS right, because I would think you'd have more tests per acquisition on the hospital test than you would and the normal business. So I guess I'm just trying to reconcile the absolute dollar per test and effects lower because of a willingness to give up on that because of the benefits on the cost side that you explained. Steve Rusckowski : Yes. So thanks for the questions. There were a couple there Ralph. Let me try to address them all. First off Barnabas is pretty much largely implemented. We may expand that relationship beyond the current set of hospitals, but at this point the initial phase of Barnabas is in a run rate and BTA is a relationship that we said is ramping up. I mentioned that half of the volume growth in the quarter was attributable to PLS and we don't call out specific relationships. So we're not going to share Barnabas per se or HCA, but we are hearing what PLS is contributing in total. And then contrary to what you may have thought, the test for req for PLS actually tend to be fewer not greater. When you imagine something ongoing in for their annual physical, which is quite a bit of our volume, obviously some of it is acute conditions that people go into their primary care physician for, but you're doing a battery of tests and your annual physical much more than you might for an acute situation going in as in-patient or an outpatient at a hospital. So there's actually fewer tests. And then finally on price, it is priced differently because it's not the commercial rates that we have for the core business, it's a negotiated direct rate with the hospital where we price it a way that we can save them money, and we can make a margin ourselves. So, it is different pricing, but not necessarily lower or higher, because we have pricing relationships all over the board for any given tasks depending on the situation. So it gets a little bit complicated, but in general, fewer tests per req we have definitely future momentum, we expect from our PLS in terms of its volume contribution, definitely from HCA and so you should expect more of our growth coming from PLS certainly in the immediate future. Shawn Bevec : Ralph, this is Shawn. Just one point of clarification, half of our volume was organic of what some of that was PLS. Ralph Giacobbe : Okay. Very helpful and then just one more follow-up. I was hoping you can give a little bit more detail on the U&H deal in terms of the economics and potential savings, so there anyway to quantify what billing and collection function cost to you guys to run maybe some percentage of what may be saved and may be help us if there is some level of guarantee on the other side. So, if bad debt expense for whatever the reason to actually go up as opposed to go down, are there certain protections in that contract that you that you there are guaranteed savings? And then just any other read through on this relationship and potential for you all to get back in network on the lab side with U&H, have you had any of those discussions at this point. Thank you. Steve Rusckowski : Thanks. Let me start and I'll ask Mark to provide little more color on the back end of this. First of all what we've committed is continued march of making their business better and when we see better, we want to improve our quality service and at the same time making it more efficient. And our goal, as you for that is what we call our Invigorate program, which we have committed to improvement of $1.3 million by the end of 2017 and that's run rate savings if you recall that versus a benchmark of 2011 and as you know we've been on a great march of showing progress on that and what we have shown with this relationship is we're far from done. We have a lot more opportunities to improve this business and we think this relationship with Optum again underscores our commitment to continue to make bold changes in this business to become better. Okay. And so I keep on saying better because it's both quality and cost. So this relationship with Optum will allow us a couple things. One is we're going to become more efficient. So how do we become more efficient? One is that by working together with them our building operation, which is part of our expense structure. Our SG&A cost will become more efficient over time and we have, we do have commitments around improving that together going forward. That is all part of our commitment for to Invigorate. So, it allows us to achieve our goal and also it extends beyond 2017 obviously since this is a 10-year relationship. Second is as I said in my introductory remarks, part of the opportunities we have, is to provide better transparency to the patients, better transparency to patients as far as what prices are and also what is covered and so they can pay us more often, and more and more quickly and we believe by providing that with the help of Optum will serve both bad debt, our denial rate and just generally our cash flow. So that is part of the relationship as well. We don't disclose the specifics of the agreement. You wouldn't to expect that we would, but it's part and parcel of what we -- part of what we believe we need to continue to do, continue to drive progress of this business. The last part of your question is how does this affect our relationship with United Health? What I said when we announced this relationship and I know United Health will say the same, is it can't hurt and again that builds on our existing relationship. We currently do a lot of work for United already. This is substantial piece of building on that. They are very committed to it. It's a big opportunity of us to them in a much broader more significant way that ever. We're obviously going to use this to build on that relationship with Wellness that I talked about earlier, what we could do around their healthcare businesses that they're building with Optum Care. We believe we could do more than help them with their analytic services. So there's a lot more that we can do with them and we'll do with them as we go forward because as you know they're a big player at healthcare and we need to work with all the big players at healthcare. So we're encouraged about what we're doing so far. We're off to a good start. As we said, we're going to move the employees over in the November and we'll start to see savings from this next year. So Mark anything you would like to add to that? Mark Guinan : We have shared that billing is about 5% of our headcount. So it's not an insignificant portion of our cost structure and then just to be clear on the relationship, we're not relinquishing responsibility. So there are a number of initiatives we had already planned to work on but we think are going to improve bad debt and reduce denials. It was part of our Invigorate program in which really generating the incremental value here is that Optum is going to bring incremental or activities and supplement what we're doing to get us to even a better place we could have gotten on our own or certainly faster than we could have gotten on our own. So it's not as if we're just thrown it over the wall and having Optum pick up what we have been working on and what we had planned to do. We're actually going to continue to do that. A lot of that's involved in our IT organization, our commercial organization etcetera and we're going to partner with Optum to make that even better Mark Guinan : Just to round that off once again, if you look at our 2014 debt from our Investor Day, we talked about this as being the opportunities we see. We've been we've been Invigorate and hopefully will review on this one will come to our Investor Day. It's November 11 and we'll provide more color beyond what we've said here about this relationship and how it helps us with our efficiency goal on Invigorate. So next question. Ralph Giacobbe : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jack Meehan of Barclays. Your line is now open. Jack Meehan : Hi guys good morning. Mark wanted to start with the pricing comment that you made, you know the unit price headwinds they moderated 50 Bps in the quarter, were there any notable changes there, just less of a headwind for certain codes. Mark Guinan : Yeah, what it has to do was obviously is the timing of any sort of price changes and so we obviously annualized either in a positive way on some price increases or annualized and got behind us some negative headwinds between the second and third quarter. So it's really just the year-over-year compare and the timing of any price changes from our contractual negotiations. Steve Rusckowski : Jack, I think it underscores what we've said for many years now that we\u2019ve being very disciplined and very thoughtful in our pricing to the market. We believe we have a great value proposition out there in the market. Our value proposition we believe is second to none. Just the value add and the chip price we charge for that and we want to continue to reinforce that going forward. And I think this quarter's performance when you look at really unit price effect of 50 basis points, I think it's a good reflection of the good work we've done to apply that price discipline to our business and the results are shown. Jack Meehan : Great, yeah that\u2019s helpful and then I just had one bigger question for Optum, you obviously have a real wealth of diagnostic data that you have built up over a long period of time, one of the conversation that's been around trying to find ways to monetize that, do you think you could find ways to use it with clinical trials, like one of your peers or are there any other interesting ideas that you had around that front? Thanks. Steve Rusckowski : We talked about in the past however monetizing the data we have. We see about one third of adult Americans in the course of three years. We keep that data for about 10 years and if you go through the map, that's about 20 billion data points of laboratory data. So we have nice bird's eye view of what\u2019s happening with the American population and we\u2019re trying to use that in the most responsible and also the best way for our shareholders. We have talked about them using that to understand how they manage or monitor the performance of what's happening with Hepatitis C by way of an example. We have also have sold that data to Pharma companies. We\u2019re building in that relationship. We have talked about -- we\u2019re trying to bring to the market and possibly with our collaboration with Quintiles and now Quintiles has merged with IMS. We continue to have a dialogue of how we could use that data to help with the recruitment of patients for clinical trials and that's something that we'll talk about once again as we get into our Investor Day in November because there is lot of opportunities for it. It takes longer to get some traction with them but the prospects are good and specifically with Optum, as you know Optum has a broad perspective on the market and they\u2019re helping many integrated delivery systems. One of the products we do provide today for integrated delivery system is around population health and how you can use this data to help manage that population that you're managing and how do we try to identify those patients that are costing the risk taker, the most of about each year and by looking at performance versus laboratory results what we could do about that to help those gaps security that we have. So lot of opportunities again come November and we\u2019ll share more with you. Jack Meehan : Great, looking forward to it. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Isaac Ro : Good morning guys. Thank you. I wanted to start with just a minute on guidance and hoping you could put a little more color around the underlying assumption you\u2019re making around the utilization and volume backdrop in 4Q relative to what you guys expect to show in your own growth? Steve Rusckowski : So we don\u2019t assume a change in utilization from quarter-to-quarter when we look at the guidance we've put out there. We want guidance that's reasonable but very achievable and as we mentioned we did take into account the impact of the Matthew which happened in October. So that\u2019s a fourth quarter even. So with that said, we have basically not changed the midpoint of our earnings guidance and we haven\u2019t changed the midpoint of our revenue guidance despite Matthew. So either -- we\u2019re not assuming any significant changes anything in the marketplace really basing it on what we\u2019ve seen pretty steadily for the first nine months of the year and then our historical experience in Q4. Isaac Ro : Great. And then just may be a second question on margins, you guys have spent a lot of time talking about all the work you have done with PLS and then with outreach deals. Curious as you put those initiatives here in context with profitability, is there a timeline you could share or a path to when we should expect those programs to be accretive to overall corporate margins? Thank you. Steve Rusckowski : Yes, so and when you talk about margins, I want to make sure whether you\u2019re asking dollars or percentages so I'll address both, but typically what we said is an outreach purchase it takes 12 to 18 months to get to its billing or profitability when we can get all these synergies achieved and then outreach businesses are typically at our corporate margin percentage. So we usually get some margin dollars pretty quickly on those outreach, but get to our going percentage and ratio profitability takes 12 to 18 months.  For PLS it's somewhat similar to an outreach and that there is a transition period of time a lot of the savings is driven around moving the test menu partially off the hospitals site to ours. It doesn\u2019t happen in the first day. The second piece is really the procurement savings. So it's either changing out the platform or burning through their agents, which typically are higher cost than ours. So takes it a little while before and we get to that going profitability, but I\u2019d tell you the same thing probably a little closure to 12 and 18, but we get to the going rate of profitability for PLS within the first year to year and half. Those margins are going to be lower than the corporate average slightly, but as I said before still at excellent return on invested capital and they are still double digit margins. Isaac Ro : Got it. That's helpful color. Thank you, guys. Steve Rusckowski : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Nic Jansen of Raymond James and Associates. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : Good morning Nic. Nicholas Jansen : Hey good morning. Two questions, first on operating income growth, I know when you adjust for some headwinds last year tied to Celera, you're talking about 3.5% or so equivalent operating income growth based on the disclosure that you gave on the call and I\u2019m just trying to get a better sense of how that can accelerate absent M&A. It feels like I felt that your Analyst event two years ago you were talking about 8% to 10% operational EPS growth. So there is a pretty sizable delta between that operating income and that kind of operational EPS aspiration. So I just wanted to flush out how we think about -- I know there is no chance for '17 guidance yet, but what are some of the drivers that might help accelerate that organic operating income growth as we think about the next six to eight quarters? Thanks. Steve Rusckowski : So Nic any given quarter, it may bound around. So the outlook that we provided in 2014 and we're planning how do it personally update you that on that comment at our Investor Day on November 11 and so look back at how we\u2019ve done and give you a general idea of what you can expect going forward. It is really a annual basis or a CAGR basis. It's not necessarily what you\u2019re going to see in any given quarter. So, the things that are going to contribute to growing earnings faster than our revenue are unchanged. So it's really going to be as we return to organic growth that has a high drop through and then we have the Invigorate program, which certainly is large enough in this period of time to offset price and our cost pay for us which is our annual merit inflation and things like that and still have enough to expand margin. As you look at some of the PLS relationships that we have talked about, those have really started up this year and as I mentioned earlier to the question that how long does it take PLS to get up and going in its profitability. Its generally 12 to 18 months. So you would expect those deals to be contributing more to the bottom-line and helping to expand our margin more than they did this year. So it really gets down to the fundamentals, which is the growth in the high drops that we get there our Invigorate program which continues to drive efficiency and then all of those things more are on an annual or a CAGR basis as opposed to any given quarter. And year-to-date we\u2019re up 5.4%, so that's a higher number than the third quarter. Mark Guinan : And the other thing is as you're well aware we\u2019re accelerating organic growth and we couple that with our acquisition of 1% to 2% growth and that allows us as they said it through our numbers to also get some lift in the operating income going forward. Nicholas Jansen : No, that\u2019s very helpful perspective and then my follow-up would be on the M&A front, it does feel like you might be a little bit light relative to the 1% to 2% contribution hopeful in every given year and I just wanted to get your thoughts on the broader deal pipeline as we think about your appetite given your leverage profile today is certainly capable to do more. Thanks. Mark Guinan : We have actually contributed about 1%. So at the low end we're re still within the 1% to 2% and in terms of our appetite, it hasn\u2019t changed, but we\u2019re very diligent about the deals that we move forward with and as we've shared, we walk away for more deals than we execute. It's not as if it's not in interest signs that we're not investing a lot of time and valuating assets and potential outreach deals. But we do have a lot of rigor around our financial metrics and we don\u2019t execute a deal. We don\u2019t see a path towards value creation importantly. So really it comes down to our capital allocation strategy, which is once you get beyond the 50% that we grantee of our free cash flow to our shareholders. It comes mostly through the dividend, but also through some share repurchases and the decision is what\u2019s the best value creation strategy and we have to feel very comfortable that we\u2019re going to create more value through M&A than we will with share repurchases and therefore it's really a situation. So it's not a change in strategy, it's not a change in appetite and certainly there has been a number of assets we\u2019ve been evaluating and there is lot of things we\u2019re looking at and we are driving success with 1% growth from M&A within the range and really nothing has changed than we're at the low end of the 1% to 2%. Steve Rusckowski : Yeah, Nic recall we announced our five point strategy back in 2012. Part of that in terms of restoring growth was to accelerate our organic growth, which we are doing and then second is couple that with acquisitions and if you look at '13, '14, '15 and now '16, we\u2019ve been achieving that 1% to 2% growth through acquisitions and so we\u2019ve developed credible track record of being able to do that in the past and as Mark said, prospectively our views haven't changed. And then you couple that with our strong cash position, we feel good about the cash we generated this quarter and our using that cash wisely with our capital deployment plan. So going forward we think we have a solid strategy continuing to build shareholder value and the growth prospects both organically and through acquisition remained encouraging. Nicholas Jansen : Thanks for the color. See you guys in a few weeks. Steve Rusckowski : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Jason Plagman : Hey guys this is Jason Plagman for Brian, just a quick question, can you provide any update on the progress with the Squared partnership and how that\u2019s progressing? Steve Rusckowski : Yeah, sure it\u2019s doing well. We lapped it already one year anniversary in July. The initial work for both companies is to put both of our laboratory clinical trials business together and then operationally integrate those. By integrating those, we'll benefit from that. Our equity earnings we get 40% since we own 40% of the joint venture. So, we believe we've made some excellent progress and there is more opportunities in front of us in terms of the yield we see from that joint venture because it will take some time to get the integration completed, but we're starting to see some of that already this year. Jason Plagman : Great, thanks. Steve Rusckowski : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Bonello of Craig Hallum. Your line is now open. Bill Bonello : Hey good morning guys. I\u2019m wondering if you might be able to give a little bit more color on the collaboration with IBM, obviously in the press release and in the call today, you talked about what it is you\u2019re trying to do, but I\u2019m just curious in terms of things like indications is a lot that this service would be broadly utilized or is it limited to patients where may be first or second line therapies have failed, what type of clinical data you are going to be publishing to support the validity of the information you are providing maybe the regulatory and reimbursement considerations? And then finally whether you\u2019re building out some kind of a service or database where you can connect patients to clinical trial based on what you learn. Steve Rusckowski : Yeah, thanks Bill for the question. Well fist of all as I said, we\u2019re excited about the opportunity and it's an embryonic field, its building, its evolving. The field of precision medicine or personalized healthcare is just -- is very new and it continues to provide opportunities, but it also -- it takes time to develop. So, we believe once again that we in this field need to work together with others. Two years ago, we announced relationship with Memorial Sloan Kettering. We brought a product to the market called OncoVantage. The opportunity we're going after Bill is to get to those community oncologists, which is as I said in my remarks about 70% of cancer care is there and what we realized is that Memorial Sloan is very strong and we have a strong presence in the United States, but by working together with some other once again, we could even enhance what we've done already. And so the IBM opportunity allows us to use their platform and also their data capabilities in a much broader way. Second is as you know IBM is building out their go to market plans for IBM Watson in general, IBM Watson Health and IBM Watson Genomics and we\u2019re hopeful that that sales force coupled our sales force will drive some additional demand as people become more aware of this. And the other part of this Bill, is we believe there is an opportunity for patients to become more aware of what they should gain access to in assessing what they need to do with their cancer care and IBM is a very powerful marketing machine and we\u2019re hopeful that their working -- their visibility around computing and particularly in healthcare will help with this effort. Now as far as future products, we have the existing products today. We\u2019re offering that various plans for us to expand that capability with a number of actionable genes and then also an expanded panel, which will touch close to 400 genes that will look at. Yes we do believe that this will help us in terms of depending diagnostics with those cancer drugs to rule and rule out patients that can affect and also making sure that we can support it the right way in connecting patients to the right clinical trials through their oncologist with this information. So this is works in progress, a lot will be introduced in time and it is a good example of the evolving nature of this real effort across the world, but we\u2019re lining up with some of the best, Memorial Sloan Kettering, IBM. We\u2019ve talk about Broad institute and obviously their relationships they have with them IT and Harvard. So we have a good team working on this and we feel very, very encourage about prospects there. Bill Bonello : Excellent. Thanks a lot. Steve Rusckowski : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Massaro from Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open. Mark Massaro : Hey guys, thanks for the question. I wanted to ask more about the hospital side. You mentioned that HCA started to contribute in Q3, when do you think we'll know to the extent that you can help HCA manage their lab operations in terms of cost benefit to HCA and I guess what I\u2019m getting at is how many quarters do you think it will take before you think you might be able to expand that within HCA and then related to that, can you just discuss how active you've been talking to other hospital systems. Steve Rusckowski : Yeah, well first of all once step at a time. We announce this relationship with HCA with their Denver-based division. They have six inpatient laboratories that we will manage for them. When we do this, we make them more efficient. If you understand how they work and I would argue a lot of hospital systems work for profit corporations. Then we'll see how it goes and we expect to deliver and so we're hopeful when we deliver that we can then expand that discussion to say can we help you in some other areas, but first piece of business right now is to do what we said we\u2019re going to do in Denver and do that well and that we'll grow the account as you grow any account going forward. And we would also say that this discussion around hospital interest and what we\u2019re doing is building what we find is that to [C Suite] of integrated delivery systems and hospitals CEOs and CFOs are quite interested in anything anyone could do to make them more efficient. I personally get engaging in this in a very active way and I could tell you that when we go in and have a conservation with the CEO and the CFO and share with them that we could save them 15% to 20% of their hospital in patient laboratory cost, our batting average if you will, of getting to the next conversation to start sharing some data is quite good. Very few times do they say we're non-interested. Most times they say interested and we should take a look at this and we understand how you can help us and let's see if the numbers work. When we go in there, we also talk about their lab strategy and usually when we have a discussion around their in-patient laboratory cost, we then have a conversation around their reference testing, their most advanced testing that we provide to about 50% of hospitals. We talk about us being able to provide more of that for them and then the third leg of the stool is they then start to question if they\u2019re in an outreach business essentially competing with us do they want to remain in that business and the best interstate for us is to become their lab partner or its Quest inside. So we do all three, We're helping them with their inpatient labs making them more efficient. We're providing the most advanced testing for their hospital operations and then the third is we're their laboratory for their -- for their non-hospital proportion of the care they're provided within their geographic area and we have a number of examples of that and probably some of the best examples is where we've actually formed joint ventures and we have a number of long-standing joint ventures in Pittsburgh Medical Center probably the most recent large one is University of Massachusetts. We have a joint venture up in Massachusetts around that and there is others to that we've build. So I would argue that this is a growing trend. It's a trend that we're head on. It takes a while to grow the services business, we built the capabilities, we're now executing and now we're starting to see the results in our growth. Mark Massaro : Excellent and then quickly on capital deployment, you repurchased almost 0.5 billion of stock for the year, where are you on the authorization and should we think about a similar run rate next year? Steve Rusckowski : Mark, you want to take it. Mark Guinan : Yes so the year-over-year on the -- what you should expect is not -- I can't give you anything specific, we are not giving guidance for next year, but you should expect us to inherit our capital allocation policy, which is basically half of our free cash flow is committed to shareholders and then above and beyond that depends on M&A and/or additional share repurchase. In terms of our authorization $532 million left on the current authorization. Mark Massaro : Great. Thanks so much. Steve Rusckowski : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, speakers. Our last question is from Amanda Murphy of William Blair. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is [Archo] in for Amanda. I was wondering if you could give me some color on the relationship of esoteric testing and routine testing growth and then I guess the pricing in esoteric and what trends have you seen and then I've a follow on question after that. Steve Rusckowski : Yes first of all last year the end of the year, we said that our advanced diagnostics grew by about 5%. It's a sizable portion of our portfolio of $1.8 million. We do not share quarterly performance related to that portion of our business but it continues to grow. There is some of the mention that had in my introductory comments show that we continue to get good growth of some of the more advance testing and particularly our last question around our work with IBM and working genetics and in that field continues to provide nice growth prospects for us. So we're continuing to get growth and once again we'll share the growth from the business in due course as we announce our results. As far as pricing, it's already in that 50 basis points headwind if you. We don't share specifics of what's happening with commercial contracting or what's happening per test but it's implied in the 50 basis points. So it's very manageable that we believe that it's always going to be some ups and downs in our portfolio of test and we're bringing new products to the marketplace as well which have new price points. So it's in that overall aggregate measure that we provide. Unidentified Analyst : Got it and then esoteric testing continues to grow, I was wondering if you had any updated thought for the sales force. I am wondering do you have now and do you think you're the right size to service the market more broadly, particularly as esoteric becomes a bigger portion of the pie. Steve Rusckowski : We continue to build our sales and marketing capabilities and the way we have addressed the market is really to make sure that we capture the right level of focus around accounts and with 65% of physicians now working for hospital systems, we believe it's important to have a geographic orientation to our sales force. And so we have about 108 sales districts and they have full responsibility for the whole portfolio of Quest into the market. The charge of separate hospital business from physician to just given where healthcare is today, how it's organized, at the same time, we all know that healthcare is very specialized and so we also in addition to the geographic orientation to our sales force, at dedicated specialized sales forces. So we have a specialized sales force or for our neurology business we have a specialized sales force for our anatomic pathology business and a specialized sales force for women's health business and we believe we appropriately staff that for the opportunities in the marketplace. And we're always trying to optimize our investment in our go-to-market plan with the opportunities we see in the marketplace and we think we've struck the right balance to deliver on our goals of growth in 2016 and we believe we'll do so also as we go forward with accelerating growth as well in the future. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Steve Rusckowski : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. At this time speakers, we don't have any other questions on the phone. I would like to hand the call back to you. Steve Rusckowski : Well thanks again for joining the call today. As you can see we're making good progress executing our strategy. We look forward to seeing many of you at our Investor Day in New York City on November 11. So thank you very much and have a great day.

Now, I would like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Executive Director of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead, please. Shawn Bevec : Thank you, and good morning. I am here with Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and also discuss non-GAAP measures. For this call, references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in Quest Diagnostics' 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. The text of our prepared remarks will be available later today in the Investor Relations page of our website. Now here's Steve Rusckowski. Stephen Rusckowski : Thanks, Shawn, and thanks everyone for joining us today. This morning I'll provide you with the highlights of the quarter and review progress on our strategy and then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through our 2017 guidance. We finish the year on a high node. We grew revenues, operating income, margins, and operating cash flow in the fourth quarter, capping a strong year in which we achieved our commitments and created value for shareholders. While Mark will take you through the fourth quarter, here are some key highlights for the full year 2016. Revenues were up 30 basis points on a reported basis and grew 2.6% on the equivalent basis. EPS was down 7.4% on reported basis, but grew 8% on an adjusted basis. And cash from operations increased 30% to $1.1 billion. 2016 was the third consecutive year of progress in delivering on our commitments and creating shareholder value. Before I describe the progress we have made what I would like to do is to talk about a few dynamics impacting our industry. First, we are waiting to see what the new Congress administration decides to do with the Affordable Care Act. As we said in the past we never realize the full benefit from ACA that we expected, so we wouldn\u2019t expect any significant near-term impact if it were to be use repealed. We hope that any potential alternative will be recognizes the value of diagnostic information services and healthcare. Second, as you know CMS has begun to execute a process to re-flash its clinical laboratory fee schedule under PAMA. We are preparing to submit pricing data to the CMS later this quarter. Now, having said that, we are working with our trade association to understand the impact on PAMA of our recent -- the recent pronouncements of Trump administration on regulatory review. Progress has also expressed its intent to act quickly on tax reform. We are closely monitoring developments and want to share the expected impact of potential changes. With the majority of our taxable income earned in the United States, we could benefit from any material reduction in U.S. corporate tax rates. We would expect to use a portion of potential tax savings to invest in accelerating growth. Second, with little forward exposure in overseas cash, we are not likely to benefit significantly for changes in repatriation rules. Now, let's review progress made we have made. As I said before we grew revenues, operating income, margins and operating cash flow in the fourth quarter, capping a strong year in which we achieved our commitments and created value for shareholders. As we detail on our Investor Day November, we are now laser focused on our two-point strategy, to accelerate growth and continue to drive operational excellence. We grew revenue in the quarter and park by expanding relationships with possible health systems. During the quarter we enter into another professional laboratory services agreement Montefiore Health System, a premier academic health system in the University Hospital for Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Under the agreement Quest Diagnostics will provide laboratory services for Montefiore Health System to help enhance the quality and the value of diagnostic services to patients and doctors at the systems six hospitals. Quest is collaborating with an increasing number of hospital partners including leading academic institutions like Montefiore that are looking to focus on the core business while taking advantage of our expertise, innovation and scale to help implement their lab strategy. We continue to expand the work we do with other leading hospital systems including RWJ Barnabas in New Jersey, HCA in Denver and many others. Our pipeline for developing new relationships is also strong. In addition, our gene-based and esoteric testing grew mid-single digits in quarter and approximately 4% for the year. Major drivers include noninvasive prenatal testing, hepatitis C, prescription drug monitoring, and SureSwab. Also we strengthened our efforts to grow advanced diagnostics by adding a senior executive to our team. I'm very pleased that [indiscernible] has joined us for General Electric's Healthcare business to drive leadership in this important growth opportunity. We are also making great progress executing our strategy to be the provider of choice for consumers. At the end of 2016, we had already opened patient service centers in 56 Safeway supermarkets. Consumer satisfaction is high, and so is our employee satisfaction. We are track to open a total of 200 patient service centers in Safeway stores by the end of 2017. This improves the customer experience, while also helping us better manager our real estate cost. Also we are on track to start performing genetic testing for AncestryDNA in our Marlborough Massachusetts laboratory later this month. AncestryDNA recently reported it sold 1.4 million DNA test in the fourth quarter, and that's more than all they sold in 2015. And then finally, our emerging data and analytics business is gaining traction. We offer data diagnostics in partnership with Inovalon. The data diagnostics customer list is growing and includes premier health plan payors such as Anthem and Harvard Pilgrim. We're also proud that the independent panel of 50 industry analysts and influential journalists name the Data Diagnostics Service, the most innovative product of the year for healthcare. We continue to drive operational excellence. We ended the year with $1.1 billion in run rate cost savings through Invigorate initiatives as we projected at Investor Day. We are on track to deliver $1.3 billion in run rate savings as we exit 2017. Our revenue services' partnership with Optum is off to a good start. The transition occurred in November and we expect to drive improvements in bad debt and denials in 2017 and beyond. In terms of capital deployment, during the quarter we increased the dividend 12.5% to $1.80 a share on an annual basis and repurchased $150 million of shares. In our December Board meeting we approved $1 billion increase of our share repurchase authority, leaving us with 1.4 billion remaining for future buybacks. We continue to expect to deliver 1% to 2% revenue growth from acquisitions and have an active M&A pipeline. Our 2017 guidance which Mark will discuss shortly reflects expectations for accelerated topline growth and is consistent with the earnings outlook we provided at our Investor Day in November. So now Mark will provide an overview on our fourth quarter and full year financial performance and provide you with our 2017 outlook. Mark? Mark Guinan : Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues. Consolidated revenues of $1.86 billion were up 0.7% versus the prior year on a reported basis, while equivalent revenues grew 1.9%. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services, or DIS for short, grew by 2% compared to the prior year. Of this growth nearly 1% was organic. Volume measured by the number of requisitions increased 1.5% versus the prior year. Acquisitions contributed about 1% of volumes in the quarter. However, note that the impact of hurricane Matthew presented a headwind of approximately 30 basis points on organic growth in the fourth quarter. Revenue for requisition in the fourth quarter increased 40 basis points versus the prior year. As reminder revenue per req is not a proxy for price. It includes a number of variables such as unit price changes, business mix, test mix and test per req. Unit price headlands were slightly less than 50 basis points in the fourth quarter and approximately 70 basis points for the full year. While unit price headlands moderated in the second half of 2016, we know that price fluctuations can vary from quarter to quarter. We continue to believe that in 2017 unit price headlands will be consistent with last few years at approximately 1%. As we highlighted throughout 2016 our PLS engagements such as RWJ Barnabas Health and HCA carry lower revenue per requisition due to the nature of the work we are performing. The strength of our PLS engagements in the fourth quarter continue to impact our revenue per requisition. Other mix elements including test and payor mix contributed more than 2% to revenue per req in the quarter. Reported operating income for the quarter was $276 million or 14.8% of revenues compared to $239 million or 12.9% of revenues a year ago. On an adjusted basis operating income was $305 million or 16.4% of revenues compared to $288 million or 15.5% of revenues last year. The impact of our former products businesses in the fourth quarter of 2015 benefited adjusted operating income by approximately $13 million or roughly 40 basis points. Excluding this impact operating margin would've grown by 130 basis points year-over-year. Reported earnings per share was $1.9 in the quarter compared to $1.29 a year ago due to a one-time tax benefit in 2015 associated with winding down a subsidiary. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.31, up 10% from $1.19 last year. The company recorded after tax charges totaling $18 million in the quarter, represented primarily restructuring and integration costs. The net impact of these items reduced our reported earnings per share by $0.13. Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 3.6%, 40 basis points better than the previous quarter and 10 basis points higher in the fourth quarter of 2015. As a reminder bad debt expense typically improves modestly throughout the year as patients have their health insurance deductible. Note that the year-over-year compare is negatively impacted by the fact that our products businesses had a lower associated bad debt rate. When taking this into consideration, our bad debt rate was flat year-over-year. Income tax expense recorded benefited from the adoption of the new accounting standard related to stock-based compensation. The impact amounted to an EPS benefit of roughly a penny in Q4. Our DSOs were approximately 47 days flat year-over-year. Cash provided by operations in 2016 was $1.1 billion versus $821 million last year, which was stronger than the guidance we provided in October due largely to better than expected earnings and improved cash collections. Capital expenditures during the year were $293 million compared to $263 million a year ago. Now turning to guidance. We are providing the following outlook for 2017. Revenues to be between $7.64 billion and $7.72 billion, an increase of 1.7% to 2.7% versus the prior year on a reported basis and an increase of about 2% to 3% on an equivalent basis; reported diluted EPS to be between $4.65 and $4.80 and adjusted EPS to be between $5.37 and $5.52; cash provided by operations to be approximately $1.1 billion; and finally, capital expenditures to be between $250 million and $300 million. I would like to provide a few items to consider as you think about our 2017 guidance. First, as a reminder, we benefited from favorable weather and an extra day due to the leap year in the first quarter of 2016. This sets up a difficult compare in the first quarter of 2017. We therefore expect our earnings growth will not be proportional, with Q1 coming in lower than the balance of the year. Given this consensus EPS estimates for the first quarter are higher than our current expectations. Second, our revenue guidance of 2% to 3% equivalent growth includes some M&A primarily related to carryover from the CLP acquisition which closed at the end of February 2016. Finally, our CapEx guidance includes an outlay related to the previously announced headquarters move to Secaucus. Now let me turn it back to Steve. Stephen Rusckowski : Thanks Mark. Well, to summarize, we continued our success in 2016 and ended the year on a high note. We are laser-focused on our two-point strategy to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence. Our 2017 guidance is both reasonable and achievable. Now, I'd be happy to take any questions you have. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We will now open it up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Ricky Goldwasser : Yes hi good morning. Stephen Rusckowski : Good morning. Ricky Goldwasser : I had some quick questions on the underlying assumptions for guidance. So, I think you're expecting 1% to 2% of topline growth from acquisitions. Can you give us some more detail on the price versus the volume? And whether you're assuming any buyback in guidance? I know that you have the authorization, but is it factored into the range you gave this morning? Mark Guinan : Yes, sure Ricky, in terms of buybacks, the guidance is based on flat share count. So, there would be some buybacks necessary to prevent dilution based on our equity program for employees, but there's not any lift in EPS based on reduced share count in the guidance that I'm providing. In terms prices, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, while we're not giving specific number saying that 2017, we would expect some continued price erosion and we expect that apples-and-apples price erosion to be similar to the last couple years which was somewhere 100 basis points or less. Ricky Goldwasser : Okay. And-- Stephen Rusckowski : And again when we talk price erosion that's pure price freezing all other variable's one revenue per rent basis, we haven\u2019t really provided specific guidance. Ricky Goldwasser : Okay. And I know you mentioned that you submitted the data to CMS this quarter on PAMA, any updates to your thoughts of how we should think of that PAMA impact and how kind of like the new cost-cutting -- or the updated cost-cutting program could help offset that? Stephen Rusckowski : So, first of all, Ricky, we have not submitted the data yet, we're preparing to do that in the first quarter by PAMA. As you're aware we're all going to submit data in 2017 for the goal of CMS to refresh the clinical lab [ph] reschedule for 2018. But what I said our remarks is, as trade association was spending some time to talk about where are we with PAMA, what has to with administration said. How is Congress digesting that? How that might affect CMS? So, we're not prepared to say anything about that, but we wanted to call that that out in my prepared remarks. And we're considering others might -- where we're right now with the new administration might affect this Bill. Also as we've talked about in the past, about 12% of our revenues, we're well prepared to absorb that given our progress and you see continued progress would invigorate. We have now good line of sight to that $1.3 billion goal in 2017. We haven\u2019t provided exact expectations beyond that. But at our Investor Day in the fall, we clearly showed that there's more opportunity beyond that $1.3 billion run rate, which gives us confidence if, in fact, there's some price reductions on the clinical IP schedule to absorb that in the new course of running our business. Mark Guinan : So, Ricky, I'd take you back to the Investor Day, where I talked about through 2020 view that we could grow revenues 3% to 5% and grow earnings mid to high single-digits. So, that takes into account some level of anticipated potential price reductions as Steve said still to be finalize as we go throughout the year and then our invigorate program and our ability to offset certainly a portion of that and grow earnings faster than revenue. Ricky Goldwasser : Okay. And just one clarification on the 2017 pricing, to your point, you expect continued erosion in organic pricing, but when we think about the revenue per requisition as it flows through the P&L. Should we assume positive price increase based on mix? Mark Guinan : So, again, I wouldn't call it price, I'd call it mix. But if you're looking for revenue per req, you've got two different drivers. So, as we mentioned we got 2% lift in Q4 from test mix and other mix elements separate from our PLS. So, there's no reason at this point to not believe that we will continue to get positive mix as we innovate, bring new test offerings that tend to have higher value. We also have shared that there has been a trend with higher density on requisitions, so we've been seeing an increasing number of tests per requisitions, while it's hard to predict there's no reason at this point to believe we shouldn\u2019t continue to get some minor lift from that as well. But then the one headwind on mix, again as we've explained is our professional laboratory services growing at a faster rate than our overall business and because of the nature of that work, it happens to have a routine testing, fewer tests per req, and therefore, a lower revenue per req. So, how those all come out, we're not providing a specific revenue per req number, but the trends that you've seen, we're not expecting those to change. Ricky Goldwasser : Okay. Thank you for the clarification. Mark Guinan : Thanks Ricky. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question is coming from the line of Jack Meehan of Barclays. Your line is now open. Jack Meehan : Hi. Stephen Rusckowski : Hi Jack. Jack Meehan : Good morning guys. I wanted to just get your outlook on the pathology business for 2017 just -- and whether you thought that could be moderate a little bit? Stephen Rusckowski : Yes. Two sides of what we classify as anatomic pathology, one is on tissues, we would say that business is relatively stable for us. The second is with our path business, we've talked about in the past with the new guidance -- the new guidelines that were established number of years ago, we continue to see a decline in that business, albeit our -- the decline has slowed in 2016 and we expected that will continue in 2017. So, hopefully that's answering the question you asked. Mark Guinan : And Jack just to add a little additional color, I'm sure you're familiar that there were some reductions in the physician fee schedule. So, in terms of our Medicare business for tissue that price headwind is built into our guidance and part of the 100 basis points or so that I mentioned. So, there were some reductions coming out of Washington. Jack Meehan : Great. That's helpful. And then one more for you Mark, just you talked about the unit price expectations for 2017, just how do you think about the magnitude for PLS, the drag on revenue per req there, do you think that gets a little bit bigger in 2017 and how does the ancestry impact the optical numbers as well? Thank you. Mark Guinan : Sure. So, ancestry is not a business that we're going to include in our revenue per req because it\u2019s a separate business. And we're not actually receiving requisitions; it's more of client services business. So, that's going to be separate from revenue per req we share. And I'm not in position to provide a specific number Jack. All I can say its included in the guidance, our best guess of what PLS impact will be and quite frankly, somewhat dependent on additional PLS agreements that we might sign throughout the year. So, it would be hard even to find -- wanted to give you that kind of color, to give you a specific number because the timing and our ability to close these deals with a certain timeframe obviously to be determined. But, again, I want to remind people that revenue per req is not a proxy for profitability and quite frankly, PLS is good profitable business regardless of its revenue per req being lower than our core business and some of the higher revenue per req businesses such as our tissue business are not necessarily the most profitable and some of our lower revenue per req business like Wellness are quite profitable even though the revenue per req is well within our overall enterprise. Jack Meehan : That all makes sense. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from A.J. Rice of UBS. Your line is now open. Stephen Rusckowski : Good morning A.J. A.J. Rice: Thanks. Hello everybody. My first question I wanted to just ask about an update on the Optum relationship. I know the employee transition over to Optum from on your books was I think supposed to happen in November. Are we seeing now the cost benefit of that or is that still the common first to second quarter, and any update on the thinking about their ability to help you with your revenue cycle manage either bad debts or non-reimbursed test and the timing when you might see that side of the benefit? Stephen Rusckowski : Yeah, thanks, A.J. Let me start. First of all, we did transition those employers over in November as you said. We are off to a good start. We are very pleased with how that has gone. We are actually very pleased on both sides that's Quest as well as Optum worked on the change management with their employees. The people that moved over are now employees of Optum that are very much part of the team of Quest. So we feel good about that. We are off to a good start. Now we did this just to reminder everyone because we believe by working with Optum we are going to have a better capability of working on our bad debt, our denials, our reimbursement and we think -- we still believe there is a lot of opportunity in front of us. So Mark, would you like to respond to the specifics of what we might see that. Mark Guinan : Sure. So, A.J. as we mentioned previously there are several elements to this, the billing savings start this year in 2017, we do not benefitted at all last year. And it -- we have tenure contract and may build over the life of the contract. Then the other element which is, you know, the gain sharing agreement around bad debt and now obviously Optum is just starting that work. So we're fully expecting significant benefit from that, but it\u2019s going to take a little time for the additional things that they heading to what we were already doing to accelerate the reduction in denials and accelerator our improvement in bad debt. So yet to come as well. A.J. Rice: Okay. If I am just might follow-up ask you about I know you mentioned on Safeway that you have ramped that up nicely and I know you are having discussions with other people about similar arrangements, some potentially where the nurses either an urgent care or mini clinic type of environment could help you on the drawing the blood. Two aspects to the question, one is, now as you got more of the Safeway's done can you start to quantify on a regular basis what your real estate savings would be? And there any update on the discussions with the other parties about possibly collaborating with them on a similar basis? Mark Guinan : Yeah, so in terms of quantifying the real estate savings, it's not something I'm going to do. It\u2019s another element of our Invigorate program. We don't tease out all the various pieces within Invigorate. What I did do, A.J., if you recall at the Investor Day was a frame for your total expenditures for draws and broke down what portion of that, you know, were impacting with the stately agreement which is less than 20% when you look at the real estate costs and some of the other things such as cleaning and property taxes and utilities and so and so forth. I kind of frame for, you know, kind of order of magnitude in total. Our largest elements of draws is obviously the labor and there is labor arbitrage currently with the Safeway agreement. We're basically paying the same phlebotomist just to do those draws in a different location. So I'm not going to providing specifics around the real estate savings over time, but it's meaningful enough that, you know, it\u2019s helping us, get greater confidence in delivering that on Invigorate savings that we talked about $1.3 billion by the end of this year and then additional room beyond the end of 2017. Stephen Rusckowski : A.J., just to remind everyone that's this work with retailers is part of our strategy to accelerate growth. As I said in my remarks we are now laser focused on accelerating growth. And if you recall, you go back at the Investor Day we laid out our approach is to that one of which is to be the provider of choice for this industry. And we think what we're doing with Safeway is a good proof point of providing great -- a great experience for consumers in a different environment. The feedback has been very strong. When we talked about this at Investor Day there is a portion of requisitions or orders in this industry that go on fulfilled and we believe that having better access and very nice storefronts facilities like what we have with Safeway will benefits our business and benefit Safeway, benefits the patient by giving the testing done, they need to get done. So we see this is a growth platform for us not just a cash savings platform. And then finally is, as we have said at investor day, we continue to work with other potential retailers. Their health strategies, they are very focused on it. They see health as a major platform for their growth and then opportunity for them to get more traffic into their store. So more to come on that. But we are off to a good start. And again, it\u2019s a key strategy for us around the consumer, there is other parts what we are doing around the consumer, Ancestry would be another example of that. What we are doing with MyQuest, a smart app and actually this year as we exited the year without even pushing it really hard. We have over 3.5 million registered users from MyQuest, getting access to the lab results. So a lot of different initiatives underway to build on this growth theme of Quest being the super choice in our space. A.J. Rice: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot. Stephen Rusckowski : Thanks, A.J. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Lisa Gill of J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open. Lisa Gill : Hi. Stephen Rusckowski : Hi, Lisa. Lisa Gill : Good morning. I just had a couple of quick follow-up questions. First, Mark, as we think about the cadence of the revenue growth throughout the year, I know you talked about 1% to 2% coming from acquisitions. Can you maybe just talk about the visibility around the acquisition? Should we be thinking that that will perhaps be more towards the back half of the year? Mark Guinan : Right. So 1% to 2%, as you recall, is a CAGR over a period of time. It is not necessarily any given year when. I talked about guidance for 2017 we don't have any unexecuted acquisitions within that guidance. The only M&A within the current guidance is the carryover from the CLP outreach purchase that we closed last February. So I think that should answer your question. So any other M&A without the CLP executed and would not more loaded towards the back half of the year because the benefit of CLP carryover ends in the first quarter and I'm not counting on any unexecuted M&A in my current guidance. Lisa Gill : Great. So that 1.7% to 2% growth included no incremental M&A, I just wanted to make I am 100% clear on that. Mark Guinan : That's correct. Lisa Gill : Okay. And then secondly, as we talk about the consumer aspect of the business and Safeway relationship, is there a way to quantify the number of reqs or the number of patients that you are seeing, I mean, just to get an idea of the growth going from 56 to 200 stores and the potential opportunity, I know it\u2019s probably pretty small today, but is there metric around this business that you can give us as we start to think to about the growth? Stephen Rusckowski : It\u2019s interesting idea. And we will think about how and if we do that, because it is helpful to get some idea of how much flow we are getting. So we thank you for that idea. Lisa Gill : Okay. Mark Guinan : Lisa, I just want to make sure, look here, most of the volume that's being done in the Safeway was done previously in a patient service center. So it's not all incremental. It is a lower cost and we think a more consumer friendly environment, what Jim Davidson shared at the Investor Day was that the initial and it's early, the initial view was that we were seeing new patients, we're getting some incremental growth and it's hard to be precise and -- but as I pointed even a couple of basis points of difference in an industry that's growing 2% to 3%, we get to 1% to 2% left sound a lot, but all of the small things start to add up. So we said hey, it is really early, we are definitely seeing some incremental growth whether it's sustainable or not we don't know whether it will accelerate, we don't know; whether we will see it at every single site as we move from 50 some to 200 not sure. But we will certainly try our best to give you some color and give you a sense of quantifying that value beyond, you know, just directionally if we can. So as Steve said, appreciate the question and we will think about and see what we can do. Stephen Rusckowski : As we keep on saying the initial results are encouraging. So, in due course we will share more. Lisa Gill : Okay. Thanks. Great. Stephen Rusckowski : Okay. Lisa Gill : I am looking forward to it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Dan Leonard of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Stephen Rusckowski : Hi, Dan. Dan Leonard : Good morning. Thank you. So my first question, Steve, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that if there was any tax benefit from change in corporate tax rate, you would invest a portion of that, can you talk about you how much you will invest of any tax benefit and what some of the key areas are you would focused on? Stephen Rusckowski : Well, first of all, it is all if. So, we are very careful to say it could or if. And we are not going to provide specifics of what we would possibly do, because it\u2019s very hypothetical. But our two strategies that we're focused on is accelerating growth and driving operational excellence and if we get some benefit that we will consider the best way of concerning what we do with that gain. But we're not providing specific clarity beyond that. Dan Leonard : Okay. And just a quick follow-up, but I may have missed it. Did you provide tax guidance for 2017? Mark Guinan : No. We did not. At this point there's no reason to believe that our effective tax rate should be significantly from 2016 or the last couple of years. Dan Leonard : Got it. Thank you. Stephen Rusckowski : Thank you, Dan. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Stephen Rusckowski : Good morning, Isaac. Isaac Ro : Good morning, guys. Thank you. So question on PAMA, as the data collection process goes through and we also to figure out what it mean, I imagine that there will be a lot of smaller labs that are going to struggle with the economics. And I am curious if you have seen any signs of opportunity to take some share smaller facility, you know, because they are looking partner with you guys or they are just not as competitive and can't provide good service. I am just curious if that's something is tangible right now, and if at all, is there anything baked in into your guidance this year, at least to share. Stephen Rusckowski : So, as you know, PAMA usage lands where the goal is which is for implementation in 2018. And if I gather the data and factors and price erosion against the clinical laboratory fee schedule, you know, the smaller laboratories that hospital outreach have a higher proportion of their revenues from the clinical laboratory fee schedule that we do, so they are much more exposed. So as we have talked about in the past we believe this is a good catalyst for Mark to continue to consolidate, and that's we still feel confident around that 1% to 2% growth through acquisitions. We demonstrated in the past four years we\u2019re able to do that. We feel good about prospects or M&A funnel. And then also if you look at the competitiveness of our business going forward with this dynamic in place, I think it just speaks volumes than the opportunity we have in front of us, is a very strong player, they brings a lot of value to our industry, that's good start for years to come. Also as far as PAMA is concerned you probably a lot of seen Inspector General report that was published in the fall as trade association we continue to be concerned with the few facts there. First fact is that from what they have shared is small fraction of total laboratories they think will be gathered in the data collection about 5%. 5% the laboratories that are building in CMS now they represents about 69% of the total Medicare billings, but it is not -- close to 100% so this is not the intention of Congress. We're evaluating that as a trade association. And then second is, in that data I am assuming they make some assumptions around the gathering the data in hospitals knowing what they need to do around that provider number and whether there is an applicable lab or not. So the more data we get into CMS, the more representatives it is market-based pricing and that was always the full intent of Congress. So this is what I am referring to in my commentary that we're evaluating based upon what we heard from Inspector General, what we know is happening in Washington as we speak round reviews of the new regulation and we will decide in due course of what we need to do anything going forward as far as the position as a trade association. Isaac Ro : Thank you. And then just a follow up on the higher tax question. I just want to make sure I understand conceptually if you guys were to get a tax break that the benefit of that would be deployed to reinvestment in the business to accelerate growth, is that sort of your prepared you are trying to say? Mark Guinan : No. Not a portion of it. What we try do, Isaac, is -- we don\u2019t want get out in front of ourselves because, although there's a lot of, you know, press about being a priority for Congress we yet to see when it is for sure and how. But there were a number of other healthcare companies recently that made some comments so we didn't want to be silent. And so in order to have people understand our thinking is as we mentioned any sort of statutory reduction since we earned basically all of our income in United States would be significant, obviously there could be other changes beyond the statutory production that could mitigate some of those savings. So we have to see that. And we just want people understand that we wouldn't necessarily crocked dollar for dollar to the bottom line that, you know, a significant reduction statutory rates when in fact give us an opportunity to look at as we balance short-term, long-term some opportunities potentially to invest. And if and when that happens we will give you more color. But we just wanted people to understand -- get ahead of themselves and do some math that we would necessarily drop every single dollar to the bottom line. Isaac Ro : Okay. Understandable. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Ann Hynes of Mizuho Securities. Your line is now open. Stephen Rusckowski : Good morning, Ann. Ann Hynes : Thank you. I am going to ask one more question on tax because our analysis that we've done, it say, the statutory tax rate dropped from 35% just to 25%, that could imply a 14% increase in free cash flow. And that is such a big increase in free cash flow. So I know you don't want to give details on what the reinvestment would be, but would that actually change your strategy a little bit or I just feel like this is very significant. Would you look at the different business with that amount of more cash coming in? Mark Guinan : So Ann, I wouldn\u2019t say we change our strategy. As we mentioned is that as you said any sort of large statutory reduction would be significant for us. And therefore again as we balance short-term and long-term there could be a decision by us to take a portion of a portion of likely to be a small portion of the and invested in some longer term growth opportunities not a strategic shift, just really expanding some opportunities that maybe are just not making the cost right now because we have to balance short-term and long-term. So that was really all we're trying to imply not a strategic shift, but to your point if it did happen, it could be significant which is what I commented on in my prepared remarks. Stephen Rusckowski : We are going to take a step back and think about the use of that installed windfall for now to get the best shareholder return. As you expect we would do. Ann Hynes : Okay. Stephen Rusckowski : It\u2019s all very hypothetical, I don't want to speculate, but you can trust like we done in the past, we are going to carefully take the best use of any type of additional earnings to do the right thing to get a good return for our shareholders. Mark Guinan : And, Ann, just to closeout we're going to stick to our capital employment synergy. So prior to my start back in our Investor Day in 2012 you have seen we inherent to that and this would not change our very disciplined approach to deploying our capital. Ann Hynes : All right. Great. Can I ask about the UNH contract? I think -- and I could be wrong. I know LabCorp's in a long-term contract that ends in 2018. Do you expect -- since we're coming toward the end of that, do you expect that contract to come out to RFP? And if it does, do you expect maybe a potential opportunity, because I know that you have said in the past that you still process a lot of reqs for them out of network. So, how do you view that contract over the next couple of years? Stephen Rusckowski : Our relationship with United Healthcare Group continues to get stronger. We are a big provider today, already laboratory services. We do have a number of areas where we actually do have carve out if you will, providing services on contract. We have not got specific on that, but we do. And our work without Optum, our revenue services, revenue cycle services this reinforces our relationship. I was asked the question when we did this in the fall, does this help you with United and my answer is it doesn't hurt you, since it\u2019s very visible and we are clearly a strategic partner of United Healthcare Group. And then also we had mentioned that we are partnering around wellness. We are the partner for Optum as they provide wellness solutions to their client base and we're happy about that. And what I will share is that obviously we are trying to get the best possible access as possible with these many healthcare insurers in our portfolio. We are not a national provider for United today and we're hopeful as we go forward we get strong with United as they work through their contract considerations, so we are hopeful that we could be more of a provider than we are today, but we don't have any specifics share with you at this time. Ann Hynes : Okay. Thanks. Stephen Rusckowski : Thanks, Ann. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Bill Bonello of Craig-Hallum. Your line is now open. Bill Bonello : Hey, good morning, guys. Just a question. There's some large properties I think up for sale and some that maybe should be. What is your appetite these days for larger scale acquisitions, but within the lab space? If things are presented, is that something that you would consider, or are you strictly focused on some of the more regional and hospital deals? Stephen Rusckowski : Yeah, first of all, what we said we will continue to do going forward is what we said in 2012. Our business is diagnostic information services. Anything we do in terms of potential acquisition into scope, so everything as pretty strategically align. And the reason why we are so committed to it, we have cleaned up our portfolio to support that. Because we think substantial opportunities in that scope of our market. So with that we said there are a number of smaller acquisitions we can do which are in that 1% to 2%, but we also said over the years is that if something were to come to us that make strategic sense that we could build value creation case for our shareholders, we wouldn\u2019t rule it out. But what I will again share is that we're not do an acquisitions that we cannot have the value creation. And that has been something that we have delivered against in our capital deployment strategy service well. So no matter big or small everything we do is going to create value for our shareholders. Bill Bonello : Okay. That makes sense. And I don't know if you are even allowed to comment on this. But is there a bigger pipeline of bigger opportunities out there than maybe there has been in the past? Mark Guinan : Bill, what I would say is there's always a pipeline and we had -- when you say when we consider we have looked at some larger opportunities in the past that obviously we haven't shared and for various reasons and some of it being what Steve talked about, we have passed. So we're always looking at best path for shareholder value creation and it doesn\u2019t mean a large transaction could not be the best path. So we evaluate those things regularly. I wouldn't say that in today's world there is any more opportunities and sometimes you create opportunities by reaching out the people having a conversation so it's not as if we sit on the sideline to see if somebody's declaring that, you know, they are looking for some sort of transaction. So, we're very actively engaged with a number of people in the industry and geographically around the world. And we are considering capital deploying options all the time. And what comes back to as Steve said as we have some very hard fast M&A metrics and that is our kind of litmus test for evaluation and if we found a larger transaction that make strategic sense and met those metrics and we felt good about the chemistry and integration path, you know, we certainly would seriously consider that. Bill Bonello : Got it. Thanks a lot. Mark Guinan : Thanks, Bill. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Stephen Rusckowski : Good morning, Brian. Brian Tanquilut : Good morning, guys. Hey, Steve, in the past you have talked about you gave a pricing outlook basically through 2017. And I know you are forecasting the 100 basis point decline this year. Where you sit today, take out PAMA, how are you thinking about pricing trends beyond this year? Stephen Rusckowski : Thanks for the question Brian. What I had mentioned is that, you know, through 2020 I would expect the pricing environment to continue to be similar to what has been in the last couple years, separate from PAMA and then if you also recall I did a slide kind of and if PAMA happens, you know, some of it -- especially at some of the lower end possibilities are kind of within the variability. As you look at this year we had about 50 basis points erosion in the back half, certainly higher than the first half, so if PAMA ends up contributing overall another 30, 40 basis points is almost within the variability of what we have seen, obviously if PAMA ends up being at high-end it would be a little more significant, but as you might expect we considered all of that in the guidance that we gave, this will be in the lookout that I gave and view in earnings growth relative to revenue through 2020. Brian Tanquilut : I appreciate it. Mark, just a different question. Cash flow was pretty strong in Q4. As we think about capital deployment, you have said no incremental deals in the guide to buyback. Basically you just offset the dilution from the stock grants. So, is there anything -- number one, is there anything to call on the Q4 cash flow that drove that strategy? And then second, capital deployment for the incremental cash that you haven't baked into the guide being deployed, is that basically your upside driver for the rest of the year? How should we be thinking about that? Mark Guinan : I want to make sure I am clear on the question Brian, so tell me if I am answering what you are asking. Cash flow was stronger than we anticipated this year. We did actually take that as an opportunity to accelerate a couple of capital investments into this year and our free cash flow still stronger than the guidance that I had provided, so we felt we did that responsibly. And that was some strategic decisions and try to accelerate some items that we're working on in our Invigorate program and so and so forth. Going into this year I am guiding to flat cash flow year-over-year. Obviously as you know there's various moving pieces, one time things that could impact positively, so net-net $1.1 million of operating cash flow, $250 million to $300 million of expected capital investment and then the rest of free cash flow, you know, half of that at least is going to be committed to our shareholders through our dividend which again we increased recently on by double-digits and then supplemented by some share buybacks. With the rest of free cash flow back to an earlier question I got it, it is dependent on executing M&A and it's not then we will buyback additional shares, so really that's to be determine. Brian Tanquilut : Got it. That answers the question. Thank you, Mark. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Steven Valiquette of Banc of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Steven Valiquette : Good morning, Steve and Mark. Congrats on the results. So I think just for us, just a quick high level volume question. I guess just to the extent that some in the investment community, let's say rightly or wrongly, try to gauge lab industry volume growth by looking at things like physician office visit data, hospital volume data, it seemed like most of these data points were suggesting that lab providers could see some accelerating growth in volumes in the fourth quarter. I just forgot where you guys stand on how much you also look at these external data points, but also your latest thoughts on how much you think investors should focus on this external data. Since you guys had decent volume growth in the quarter, don't get me wrong. But it didn't correlate to that expectation of accelerating growth and that some investors may have garnered from that external data. Thanks. Stephen Rusckowski : So, let me start with that. We look at it all, Steven. We look at all the different matrices and leading indicators. And what we've mentioned in the past we have an internal measure we will take a look at 1,000 accounts that we know they are accounts and we do seeing how look year on year, and say what's going on with the underlying utilization of patients that those physicians are seeing. And what we have said in the past and we will continue to say because we looked at this in the fourth quarter it's been relatively stable. So -- and this is really good representation of utilization for the market we think. So it's relatively stable. So prospectively that's what we provide in our guidance, but on top of that what you see is everything that's driving the marketplace that is more innovation coming into marketplace, more tests per encounter in the marketplace and aging populations, so that is giving us the growth that we are seeing, but also the market perspective growth that we anticipated as well. So that's what we see. Now I will remind you that in the fourth quarter we did have a hurricane event which affected us in Q4, got up in October, October 4 lot of the industry does have an impact on the business. So Mark, any other color you would like add to volumes in Q4, but also prospectively? Mark Guinan : So, as Steve mentioned and I said in my prepared remarks we got about a 30 basis headwind by our calculation from hurricane Matthew, we do have a significant business in Florida and although really only northern Florida was hit because of the preparations there were a lot fewer office visits and a lot fewer lab draws in the state of Florida while Matthew was going on and then certainly it hit to the Carolina as well significantly and so we have some impact there. So that certainly dampened growth would've been otherwise and without getting into too math there is a difference in the calendar and we don't always talk about this, but weekends we do less business, weekdays we do more, so any given quarter, you know, depending on how many weekends there, weekdays versus the prior year there can be some impact as well. We don't into too much detail, but you can take a look at the calendar to see how Q4 compared to 2015 and see that there were fewer weeks. Steven Valiquette : Okay. Got it. That's helpful. Thanks. Mark Guinan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our last question is coming from Ross Muken of Evercore. Your line is now open. Stephen Rusckowski : Good morning, Ross. Ross Muken : Good morning, guys. It seems like your main competitor is mimicking or getting closer in its strategy on the hospital to what you have been doing. Is that a positive relative to maybe getting more of those types of transition over the goal line just because you have two, maybe forces pushing there, or how do you think about it in general in your ability to execute against what's been sitting in the pipeline? Stephen Rusckowski : Yeah, well, first of all, we have a strategy for years now focusing on what we believe supporting element of what's happening in healthcare in the U.S. that is hospitals of the big influence over laboratory strategy in general. We shared at our Investor Day it\u2019s about 50% of the marketplace. If you look at all the laboratories that are part of inpatient acute care setting and to run those we can help them with those laboratories to make more efficient. And then second is there a big part of the non-hospitals of market were about roughly a third of the market is those hospital systems competing with us. So we three or four years ago -- this is core part of our strategy, back to 2012 we said it was one of our three focus areas. And so we've been investing. It is not something you can just put up a shingle and get it to the market easy. I remind you these three areas we work with hospitals on. One is providing the most sophisticated advanced testing sometimes called reference testing, we are the leader there. Second is we help them become more efficient with their inpatient hospital cost and the deal that we just announced today with Montefiore, is a good example, where they leverage on our efficiency and seems that money makes them more efficient, so they can focus on what they want to focus on is a system. And then finally is outreach. And in some cases we buy outreach businesses where we have an outright purchase. What we announced last year was the relationship of Hartford Hospital in Connecticut is an example of that. The best place for us to be is requesting side of the their lab strategy where we are helping them with reference work, we are helping them with our inpatient laboratory and where they are partner for outreach. Do, it\u2019s all three. So we have been at this for a while, by being added we have invested in capabilities, repeatable methodologies, how do you price them, how do you call on the [indiscernible], what I will share is this is not typical laboratory sale it's not in a physician level, it is not at a lab director level, it\u2019s typically with the CEO and CFO delivery system. This is strategic. And so many of these conversions are at the most senior level. So I think it is a big part of -- has been a big of our strategy for a long time. We're gathering momentum. As you can see with the deals we have announced. Last year we announced Barnabas, we announced HCA, we have yet another one in the first quarter. So we have shown that we are getting momentum and we have a strong pipeline. And as far as others participating in the marketplace I think that's reinforces, the interest in the marketplace. It is a big market, there is plenty of opportunities, there is thousands of hospitals. Do we think we are going to be the only competitor in the space? No. But I think it\u2019s just another data point that this is a good strategy that we have been working on and there is a lot more interest out there than just what we have done in few deals. So it\u2019s getting momentum in general in terms of integrated delivery systems, thinking about the lab strategy. So we are encouraged about the progress we have made and we are very, very optimistic about the future growth opportunities in that investment. Ross Muken : That's helpful. And maybe, Mark, just quickly on Q1 you obviously gave a bit of color. Could you also just remind us on SG&A cadence? I remember, while you did have a bit of a step up, obviously in volume in Q1, you also had maybe a bit more of your SG&A for the year. Just any color you could provide on how that OpEx cadence may look for how to consider what happened last year. Mark Guinan : Sure. Ross, typically we don\u2019t give any guidance -- quarterly guidance or SG&A, but I can assure you that different from last year. You shouldn\u2019t expect a, you know, quarterly differential. Last year we were building some key capabilities, around our data diagnostics and other things, investing upfront, as necessary ahead of some revenues, but I don\u2019t anticipate anything significant similar this year. Ross Muken : Thanks and congrats, guys. Stephen Rusckowski : Hey, thanks. Mark Guinan : Thank you. Stephen Rusckowski : I think that was the last question and we thank all of you for joining the call. As we said at the beginning I'll close with this. We have strong quarter and a solid 2016. We're looking forward to accelerated growth and driving operational excellence this year in 2017. We thank you for all your support and you have great day.

Now, I would like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Executive Director of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Please go ahead. Shawn Bevec : Thank you, and good morning. I am here with Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and also discuss non-GAAP measures. For this call, references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in Quest Diagnostics' 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. The text of our prepared remarks will be available later today in the Investor Relations page of our website. Now here's Steve Rusckowski. Stephen Rusckowski : Thanks, Shawn, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. This morning I'll provide you with highlights of the quarter and review progress on our strategy and then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through updates on our 2017 guidance. We began 2017 with a strong first quarter across the board drawing revenues, EPS, operating income, margins and operating cash flow. Here are some of the key highlights -- revenues were up approximately 2% on a reported basis and 3% on an equivalent basis. Reported EPS of $1.16 increased 63% in 2016. Adjusted EPS grew approximately 18% to $1.33 which includes $0.11 of excess tax benefit associated with the employee stock-based compensation; more on this later from Mark. Cash from operations increased 28% to $196 million. Now before I describe the progress we've made to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence, I would like to briefly discuss PAMA. CMS postponed the deadline for labs to report private commercial payer pricing data under PAMA for 60 days until May 30. We fully support the decision. However, we continue to have some concerns about the current definition of applicable laboratory, which are those laboratories per quarter to report private commercial payer data. According to the office of Inspector General's analysis, the current definition of applicable laboratory would cover only 5% of laboratories, representing only 69% of Medicare payments for lab test in 2015. While we support reform of Medicare payment system, we believe any modification should be market-based and appropriately include all applicable independent and hospital outreach laboratories. Now let's review progress we've made. As we detailed at our Investor Day at November, our two-point strategy is to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence. We grew revenue in the quarter empowered by continuing to expand relationships with hospital health systems. Our existing professional lab services relationships including RWJ Barnabas in New Jersey, HCA in Denver and most recently, Montefiore in New York City are performing better than expected and our pipeline for new relationships remains strong. So in the first quarter we announced the acquisition of an outreach operation of PeaceHealth Laboratories and expect to close in the second quarter. In addition after the close, we will execute a professional laboratory services agreement to manage 11 PeaceHealth Laboratories serving medical centers in three states in the Pacific Northwest. We are hardening with health plans to improve the patient experience by improving price transparency which will also reduce bad debt. Our real-time payment determination which we begin piloting in early 2016 enables us to get patients an accurate picture of their financial responsibility or lab testing while those patients to pay at the point-of-care. We are currently live with Aetna, Highmark, UPMC, Florida Blue, and we expect to have more payers in place by the end of the year. The service benefits Quest and the entire healthcare systems; patients, providers and payers. Avis [ph] Diagnostics which generally includes our genetic and molecular based test grew in the quarter along with non-routine testing. Major drivers included neo-natal genetic carrier screening, prescription drug monitoring, hepatitis C and QuantiFERON TB testing. In the quarter we also announced the launch of the new test service that helps physicians evaluate the patient's response to the drug therapy used to treat infection with hepatitis B virus, HBV; this is the first test of its kind available in the United States. Physicians can use it to tailor more effective treatments for up to 2.2 million individuals infected with HBV. We're also making progress executing our strategy through provider-of-choice for consumers. In late January, we began providing genotyping for ancestor DNA, a service that today identifies and quantifies individual's ethnic origin based on results of DNA testing. We are pleased with the initial execution of this program and look forward to building on a relationship with ancestors. We continue to expand our relationship with SafeLink that are now operating at 65 stores. Consumer and employee satisfaction remain high and we are on-track to open a total of 200-patient service centers and Safeway stores by the end of 2017. We continue to drive operational excellence and remain on-track to deliver $1.3 billion of run rate savings as we exit 2017. Our revenue services partnership with Optum is on-track in helping us to drive down bad debt and denials. As we have often said, quality and efficiency go hand-in-hand. We continue at near Six Sigma levels of many areas and in the quarter of mid year-over-year gains and many quality measures including reduced patient service center wait times and approved test turnaround times. We expect our commitments to enable our processes will deliver results. We expect to cut paper acquisitions by 50% by the end of 2017. It will enable patients to check-in electronically at roughly half of our patient service centers by the end of the year. Additionally, we expect our lab systems to be 85% standardized by the end of the year. We received some meaningful recognition in the quarter, once again being named one of the World's Most Admired Companies by Fortune magazine. Quest was one of only six companies in healthcare, pharmacy and other services industry and the only diagnostic information services company to attain most admired status. Looking forward to the remainder of 2017, we are well-positioned to continue to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence. We have the right strategy and the right team to execute and create value for our shareholders. Now, let me turn it over to Mark who will take us through our financial performance in detail. Mark? Mark Guinan : Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues, consolidated revenues of $1.9 billion were up 1.9% versus the prior year on reported basis while equivalent revenues grew 3%. Revenues for diagnostic information services grew by 3.2% compared to the prior year. Most of this growth was organic with approximately 90 basis points attributed to the 2016 acquisition of Clinical Laboratory Partners. Volume measured by the number of requisitions increased 3.5% versus the prior year, of which 2.6% was organic. The year-over-year impact of weather was negligible in the quarter. Revenue per requisition in the first quarter decreased by 20 basis points versus the prior year. As a reminder, revenue-per-req is not a proxy for price, it includes a number of variables such as unit price variation, business mix, test mix and test per req. Unit price headwinds in the first quarter continue to be moderate in less than 100 basis points. We note that price fluctuations can vary from quarter-to-quarter, but we continue to expect that unit price headwinds will remain consistent with the last few years. Beyond unit price and the impact of growth in our POS partnerships, other mix elements including test and fair mix contributed more than 1% to revenue-per-req in the quarter. Reported operating income for the quarter was $279 million or 14.7% of revenues compared to $257 million or 13.8% of revenues a year ago. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $297 million or 15.6% of revenues, compared to $281 million or 15.1% of revenues last year. Please keep in mind our focused diagnostics products business contribute approximately $8 million of adjusted operating income in the first quarter of 2016. Excluding the impact to focused, adjusted operating income would have grown approximately 9% and adjusted operating margin would have increased 80 basis points year-over-year, consisting of 30 basis point of operating margin tied to focused in 50 basis point of adjusted operating margin growth. Reported EPS was $1.16 in the quarter, compared to $0.71 a year ago. The prior year a quarter included a charge of $30 million after tax or $0.21 per diluted share related to the early retirement of debt. Adjusted EPS was $1.33, up 18% from $1.13 last year. The company recorded after tax charges totaling $11 million in the first quarter or $0.08 per diluted share, representing restructuring and integration cost. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was approximately 32%, compared to approximately 39% last year. The decrease in the effective tax rate was a result of $16 million or $0.11 per share in excess tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation, compared to a $2 million or $0.01 per share benefit last year. Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 4.4%, 20 basis points better year-over-year, but 80 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2016. As a reminder, bad debt expense rate typically increases sequentially in the first quarter due to the reset of payings in health insurance deductibles at the beginning of the year. As in the prior years, we expect the bad debt rate to improve gradually throughout the year. Note that the year-over-year compare was also negatively impacted by the fact that our products business had a lower associated bad debt rate. Cash provided by operations in the first quarter was $196 million versus $153 million last year. Recall the retirement of debt lowered our operating cash flow by approximately $47 million during the first quarter of 2016. Capital expenditures during the quarter were $42 million, compared to $47 million a year ago. Now turning to guidance. We are providing the following updated outlook for 2017. Revenues unchanged to be between $7.64 billion and $7.72 billion, an increase of 1.7% to 2.7% versus the prior year on a reported basis and an increase of about 2% to 3% on an equivalent basis. Reported diluted EPS to be between $4.73 and $4.88 and adjusted EPS to be between $5.45 and $5.60. Cash provided by operations is also unchanged and remains at approximately $1.1 billion, and finally, capital expenditures remain between $250 million and $300 million. Our increased EPS guidance reflects the higher expected level of excess tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation and was included in our previous guidance. Note that our original EPS guidance assumed a similar benefit in 2017 as we recognize in 2016 for the full year which was about $0.06. As you are well aware, our share price appreciated substantially in 2016, which yielded a significantly higher tax benefit in Q1 2017 based on equity vesting and auction exercises. Our updated reported and diluted EPS guidance for 2017 assumes another $0.03 of benefit over the remainder of the year. However, fluctuations on our shared price and auction exercise activity could add volatility to this figure. Going forward, we would expect to experience some level of excess benefit over the next several years. However, the time frame and absolute benefit is difficult to forecast given its dependence on our share price and the timing of option exercises. Now, let me turn it back to Steve. Stephen Rusckowski : Thanks, Mark. Well, to summarize, we delivered strong growth across the board in the first quarter with gains and revenues margins, operating income, EPS and operating cash flow. Our agreement with PeaceHealth will further booster our growth later in the year and we are laser-focused on our two-point strategy to accelerate growth and to drive operational excellence. I'd like to now open up for any questions you might have. Operator, please? Operator : Thank you. We will now open it up to questions. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead, sir. Ross Muken : Good morning, gentlemen and congrats. Underlying organic volume, I know you called out a few other pieces, but certainly better than we would have suspected, even given that relatively to what we've seen in general on volumes across the market. So maybe could you help us understand how much some of those entities you called out sort of contributed to the strain versus sort of underlying market, and how you're thinking about the pacing for the remainder of the year given what's implied. Stephen Rusckowski : You know, so thanks, Ross, certain I'll start and Mark will add to that. Sure, first of all we're off to a good start, we're pleased with our first quarter performance here. Yes, there's up a number of elements that contributed to the growth in the first quarter, we highlighted some of those in our script. First of all we do believe that will continue to get growth from our professional lab services work that we're doing. We saw some growth from that. Second is we continue to get nice growth from our advanced diagnostics portfolio and some of the more advance, what is typically referred to as esoteric testing that we do would call about some of those, and we've mentioned in the past the prescription drug monitoring and the work we're doing with the TV coiffure opportunities drive serious growth for us. We also got some nice growth through some other areas of the business, like our Wellness business, some or other -- some of our other services business. Across the board good balance growth consistent with our strategy that we had to focus at hospitals. That focus on our clinical franchises and bring new products to the marketplace to commercialize those better than we have in the past. And finally just good execution across the board. So let me turn over to Mark, to give some color round this and throughout the rest of the year. Mark Guinan : Sure, thanks for the question, Ross. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks we got about 90 basis points in volume and revenue from M&A, largely that was CLP, work lapping CLP at the end of the first quarter, so we no longer have in that a tail wind. Part of this pretty largely ramped up so that annualize in the first quarter as well. So those are behind us in terms of strong year-over-year drivers of growth. Now what we do have in front of us is continued ramp up of HCA, we are just in the early stages of Montefiore, and then obviously we announced Peacehealth which has an outreach element and also in professional laboratory services element that we expect to execute have not close that yet. When we give our original guidance 2% to 3% to the global in growth. The only M&A included in that was CLP because that been executed, and while we are very optimistic about the closing piece and there's the heat pipeline of other potential M&A opportunities. Given the fact that we got a pretty broad range of 100 basis points in the work, cautiously optimistic after the first quarter we didn't feel this point compelled to change our revenue guidance yet. Ross Muken : Thanks, and maybe just a quick update on sort of how the Optum relationship that sort of progressing and any further thought, obviously a lot of market chatter or at least financial community chatter on sort of that relationship as a whole and just maybe talk about how you're thinking about obviously the longstanding relationship with the United. Stephen Rusckowski : First of all it is going well, we announce it in the fourth quarter of last year. And a big component of it is what we're going round revenue cycle management and our billing operations and as a I said in our opening remarks it's going very well, we're pleased with that. Like you said this is a relationship so there is multiple areas beyond what we're doing around billing, we continue to build on that relationship and it's -- it's going well as well. We have a good relationship around our wellness business, we are their partner for wellness along with other -- other partners that we sell-through. Second is we continue to work with them on what we do with clients around data and population health and if you think about what we're doing with our professional laboratory services business, we're calling on the same people that are trying to become more efficient and better in delivering integrated delivery system and so that areas is promising as well; so often good start, doing what we said what we would do and the relationship will only get stronger overtime. Ross Muken : Great, congrats again, guys. Stephen Rusckowski : Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Dan Leonard : Thank you. I was hoping you could comment further on the yield pipeline whether you're seeing any increased competition for yields of hospital outreach programs or otherwise, and whether you expect that the impact of PAMA timing whether that changes at all would impact the yield pipeline? Thank you. Stephen Rusckowski : Thank you. First of all the pipeline as we said is the support of our long-term goal of 1% to 2% of growth through acquisitions; we're hopeful about that going forward. As far as competition -- I would say the competition is stable versus what we've seen in the past. And finally is in regards to the PAMA, I think PAMA in general is changed that some would argue -- could look more catalyst in hospital outreached business as considered their strategy going forward. So when we engage with hospital systems run their lab strategy, many CEOs that are engaged with do understand that both the commercial rates as well as the clinical lab fees schedule rates will be under pressure. And this is one of the considerations that they think about as far as potentially selling their business or partnering with us in their business going forward. So if in fact there is some price pressure related to the refresh of the clinical fee reschedule that could be a further catalyst to accelerate some of this going forward but as you know, PAMA -- the data submission has been postponed by 60 days, we're still believing based on what they've told us so far that they are committed to trying to refresh the clinical lab fee scheduled by the beginning of '18 but we'll see on that. But there is another fact that we think is helping us with our discussions with hospital systems around their lab strategy. Mark Guinan : So if I could just add two pieces of color to that Dan, one is that -- recall that when Medicare changes reimbursements we're equally impacted. So the buyer and seller are both equally impacted in terms of the value. If they get credit from commercial rates that doesn't matter to us, it doesn't change our evaluation because obviously we value it as our own commercial reimbursement. So while it might be more of a catalyst, it also reduces the value to both the buyer and the seller. And then in terms of competition, if you recall these outreach skills are largely cost synergy value creation opportunities, and so at any given outreach is likely to not be work the same to multiple competitors because it's highly dependent on where your laboratory is located, where your logistic routes are, where your patient services are currently located and there are geographical differences amongst any competitor who might be looking at purchasing an outreach. So in term -- there is always -- you know, larger opportunity likely to be a couple of parties at the table but it's not an auction because quite frankly, we're going to value them differently because it's based on that the infrastructure. Dan Leonard : All of that color is very helpful, thank you. Just one clarification, so if the update of the clinical lab fee schedule were postponed to 2019; would the deal funnel soften or is it not that directly linked? Stephen Rusckowski : It's not that directly linked. I think it's a fact out there that CMS is looking at refreshing -- we couldn't let fee schedule as we often talked and so we get all the data, we don't know what's going to happen with that, but it's just a fact out there that is going to be pressure on rates. And therefore hospital CEOs are thinking about their options for outreach. Dan Leonard : Understood, thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ricky Goldwasser : Hi, good morning and congratulations on a very good quarter. I have two questions; the first one on PAMA. I'm just trying to understand the product from your perspective; one, is there anything that you need to do in order to be prepared if PAMA were to be implemented in January on 2018? So how that uncertainty impact you? And then on PAMA you talked about the applicable lab definition; where is that -- what's the status of these conversations and did you quantify the impact? If you [indiscernible] changed for you and should we assume that if this is something that's really kind of like in process that -- that were to happen the January 2018 start date seems unlikely? Stephen Rusckowski : Yes, so thanks Ricky. Let me give you some color around PAMA, now first of all the data put in all the data has been pushed out for 60 days and yet, CMS still is holding to the goal of refreshing the clinical lab fee schedule by the beginning of 2018. Now with all that said, we just took two months of really tight schedule and the way this will work is they'll get all the data by the end of May - let's call it June. They have to work through that for four months in of which in those four months, two of those months are in the summer months and then publish their rates that they will look to comment on in the September timeframe. And then they'll publish upon the rates in the fourth quarter for that beginning of January 2018. So as you think through this, the two-month delay in data reporting clearly is putting pressure on the schedule and that's why people are saying, 'Okay even that they still have the goal, it's impossible that they can get there.' I'll share with you exactly what we're hearing, but there is more pressure on them to put that altogether. Now with all that said, as trade association, we continue to be actively engaged with CMS. When we're down there for our annual meeting of UCLA several weeks ago, we've met with CMS. This is many members of our industry. They're very, very responsive to us, they listen to our concerns about data. Part of the response to see would postpone of the data collection is because we are engaged with them and we're also having discussions with them and members of congress about the definition of applicable laboratory. In the way CMS is implementing the approach right now is excluding a fair percentage of outreach which is a large portion of this market. So there will be another meeting next week with CMS and this is at the highest level CMS with [indiscernible] to talk about two issues; one is the timeframe and second is applicable laboratory. And we hope to engage as we've done so far as a trade association of being constructive and helpful to get the market-based approach right, which is the intent of the congress with this bill. We continue to work it with them. You also need to understand that this also has the backdrop of them having a lot on their table in the number of positions across the board in HHS and CMS not being filled. We also know that they've got to work through a lot. I'm giving you some of the color, but we're actively working this trade association and we believe that by doing so, it's going to serve this industry well. Mark Guinan : Rick, just to answer your specific question about is there anything we need to do to get ready, the answer is most of what we need to do is behind us. There is quite a bit of work to get the data together and we got it all together by the end of the first quarter when we needed to. Now, really what's in front of us is just once they publish the proposed rates, for us to take a look at it and obviously respond to that if appropriate and then as Steve mentioned, through our trade association, continue to push through what we think is appropriate, which is expanding the definition of an applicable lab. But there's not a lot of work per se between now and when everybody might decide to implement the new rates. Stephen Rusckowski : And just to round this off, we also said in our Investor Day in the fall that if in fact it is implemented in 2018, given the size of this business for us, the effect it could have based upon some of the estimates that we're going to be able to absorb that, given the opportunities we have around operators [ph] going forward in normal course of running our business. That's our position. We believe it's already implied in our outlook that there could potentially be some reduction here, but we don't know for certain until we get all the data collected. But we're managing this proactively going forward and we'll see what happens. Ricky Goldwasser : Okay. That is helpful. One other question just regarding the guidance, a question we received this morning. If you think about the guide, very nice leading the quarter and you had the text benefit, you raised by less than your feed. And I noted you said a little bit earlier in the year to change guidance, but is there anything that you see from operating lines, to the fact of the expense side that is making you wait for time being? Mark Guinan : Well, Ricky, as I said earlier, it's just early in the year. We're cautiously optimistic, but its one quarter and obviously, we're optimistic, we're going to continue with strong performance. At this point, you're correct. The entire change in guidance reflected the excess tax benefit over and above what we have built into our original guidance. Operator, next question? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will now move to our next question from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Please go ahead. Jack Meehan : Hi, thanks. Good morning, guys. Stephen Rusckowski : Good morning, Jack. Mark Guinan : Good morning. Jack Meehan : I want to follow up on the volume side. Just even after you may call the adjustments around M&A and new business, leap day [ph], it appears there is a real step change in the first quarter for the underlying trend. Was there anything else worth flagging or the insourcing, outsourcing tug of war with hospitals? Have you seen any change just on that dynamic as well? Mark Guinan : I don't think there's any step change in the environment. If anything, I think we've comment that utilization has improved directionally over a couple of quarters, so we are seeing some good signs in utilization. We've mentioned in the past that we monitor what we call our same source name account performance and certainly, we're seeing improvement in that over the last couple of quarters into the first quarter. These things can happen as well. We don't know whether that's a trend and it will continue, but in the first quarter, if there's anything I could point to outside of the things we talked about, certainly a lot of good deals we've done including things like Ancestry, et cetera are helping to drive some of that growth. I'd really say it's the utilization seem to be a little stronger than it was in the past year. Stephen Rusckowski : And Jack, just to remind everyone, it's this the march we're on with growth. Back when we started with our strategy at 2012, we simply just restore growth and business that was shrinking organically. We have reduced that decline, we stabilized the business, we started to get some organic growth in '16 and our two strategy focus right now is number one, to accelerate growth. So what you see in Q1 is the continuation of that march of improvement and we believe a lot of the investments and capabilities and focus that we've put over the last several years is due to yield the results we expected. We're pleased with Q1. As I mentioned in my earlier comments, the results are a number of areas that led to the growth that you saw in Q1, but we believe we're off to a good start for the year. Mark Guinan : And the only other thing I'd add is that the timing of Easter probably mitigated in some of the pack that we lost at the extra day from leap year last year, so it's hard to predict how much that's going to impact you because it's not consistent every single year, but definitely the calendar shift on the Easter into the second quarter certainly helped Q1. Jack Meehan : Great. And then as my related follow up, one of your early scenes from earnings has been around payer mix, so I was wondering, have you seen any changes on the government side and just how that impacted the business in the quarter? Stephen Rusckowski : Something notable, Mark? Mark Guinan : No, there's nothing notable, Jack. Jack Meehan : Okay, great. Thank you. Mark Guinan : Operator, next question, please. Operator : Yes, sir. We will take our next question from Amanda Murphy with William Blair. Please go ahead. Amanda Murphy : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Stephen Rusckowski : Good morning, Amanda. Amanda Murphy : Sorry. If I just snap one more on the volume side, just given all the comments because there's a lot of moving parts. But I just wanted to confirm. I thought one thing that PLS volumes, those would be done included in the 2.6% organic? Is that correct? Stephen Rusckowski : That's correct. Amanda Murphy : Okay. And then is there any way just thinking about all the different points you've made around PLS dynamic, Ancestry, et cetera, versus this basic underlying utilization? Can you quantify if you want those into two different buckets, sort of underlying utilization versus everything else in organic, what the impact was in the quarter from both of those sides? Mark Guinan : Amanda, we've decided that we're not going to break out PLS every single quarter. What I did say at Investor Day was that I would expect over the three year period to 20 that we would get about 100 basis points of less from PLS would be our expectation. So we do have a deep pipeline. It's going to vary quarter-to-quarter, given the timing of deals and so on and so forth. We're not quite there yet, but we're building toward that, so we got some good solid growths from our new PLS businesses and over time, we're expecting a keg [ph] around 100 basis point lift, but we're not going to break it out every single quarter. Amanda Murphy : Okay. So I'm going to count that as one. But thinking in one more, this -- just last slide, I guess I just had a question given your comments on the pipeline that you have and how strong it is? How you're thinking about forecasting or guidance this year? Just given PLS growth potential versus sort of the potential operating margin impact there, or is there a right way to think about the pipeline more like the 2018 benefit? Mark Guinan : There are absolutely assumptions just like we would in winning accounts in our guidance for the year. We have to make some assumptions around how we're going to perform. So we've got a deep pipeline of PLS opportunities. Unlike anyone would, we do some sort of probability adjusting against that in terms of getting those complete, the timing and so on. So there's absolutely an element of PLS in that original 2% to 3% organic guidance that we gave on an equivalent basis and depending on how things progress, that's why we give a range. It could be slightly more or less than we assume, but we're confident enough to build in the guidance and then on M&A, just given the fact that that's a lot less in our control. We just thought the prudent thing would be not betting on the com and having any unexecuted M&A specifically in that guidance. Again, the way I would encourage you to think about PLS is like winning a new account, a new hospital system for our core business, something we go out. It may not be quite as co-competitive because there's only a handful of labs that could actually perform the PLS deal, because it really takes economies of scale to drive that savings and quite often, these are so complicated, it's not even more than one part negotiation. It's just us alone talking to a hospital system. In summary, yes, we have some assumptions around our pipeline getting executed this year in that organic growth and we're very confident just like we've done in the past about our ability to hit that. Stephen Rusckowski : Just to make sure it's clear, PLS, it is a business. We're managing a portfolio of professional laboratory services accounts and like for any business, these accounts are different stages of the revolution. In that business, we have a number of accounts that have been with us for some time and like with any business, you're managing those accounts to make sure you have a referable account going forward. That's in our base as well. Second is we're growing new accounts, they're turning on. There might be some more opportunities to expand it into other hospitals so we've got growth within the install base as well with some growing accounts and then we're bringing on board some new accounts. So the highlights we've talked about at those new accounts, you put those three together and that has a business in its aggregate growing, but don't forget, we still have this install base of existing business that we could hear ourselves as well. We need to think about it as an existing business with managing accounts, growing accounts and then executing brand new accounts. But with all those three components, this is a growing business for us, it's a good business for us and it positions us nicely with integrated delivery systems. Mark Guinan : Next question, operator? Operator : Our next question comes from A.J. Rice with UBS. A.J. Rice: Hello, everybody. I'd like to first just ask about the revenue cycle; a couple of aspects of revenue cycle management and issues. You talked about in your prepared remarks an issue around some payers like Aetna for better price transparency and that might help collect a co-pays in deductibles upfront. Can you give us the read on what your experience has been there and then you mentioned Optum obviously, once you go there on the revenue cycle management. I'm understanding if the benefits on the revenue cycle management were probably going to take two or three years to realize. Is that true? But there was also a cost-savings initiative of transference of employees over to them. Is that fully reflected in the first quarter results? Stephen Rusckowski : Let me start. First of all, the relationship with Optum for revenue cycle management has three components. First of all, we believe by working together with them, we can continue to become better and more efficient in our building operations and the efficiency associated with that, A.J. is part of our $1.3 billion bigger rate savings and efficiency goal that we have. So this is parts of many programs we have to drive efficiency. So a portion of our results and a portion of our achievement against that goal will include what we're doing here. Second is we believe by getting smarter with them around the interaction between class and patients and payers, we can go a better job of bad debt and denials and specifically, they will help us with what we talk about as far as real-time adjudication with patients that we've mentioned, four [ph] payers that are initially working with us on that, but we expect with Optum's help, we could get some more. And then finally, it's just completing the data set and their relationship with payers in general we think will be helpful of getting paid both from a standard perspective of bad debt, but also with the denials associated with more advanced diagnostics. Mark, anything you like to add to that? Mark Guinan : A.J., as we've shared before, we signed a 10-year agreement with them to manage our revenue cycle management and we do have commitments for them on cost savings to run that operation and yes, that started in Q1, but it gets feathered in over the life of the contract. And then the second element is Optum helping us reduce denials and bad debt as Steve mentioned. Although we started the real-time adjudication prior to the relationship, Optum is helping us to drive that faster and more deeply and maybe we could have done on our own. We feel very good about what they're doing and I can tell you that early on, we've seen a reduction in patient bad debt in the areas where we roll this out. So we're feeling good about it, we're seeing what we would expect. It's still early because at this point, it's largely just the patients who are engaging our patients service centers. We're working on solutions that will be available in obviously the change managements plan to roll it out in the physician office where about 60% of our volume comes from. So today, it's really patient service centers moving in office phlebotomist and then eventually moving into the physician's office where ultimately we'll get the full benefit. But we're very encouraged and we're absolutely seeing a reduction in the rate of patient bad debt where we've rolled out this real time adjudication. A.J. Rice: All right. And if I might ask you about one other initiative as my follow up. You said you're in 65 Safeway stores. Can you sort of update us, is this mostly having a benefit from the perspective of patients who are getting higher patient satisfaction? Are there other benefits to you and I know there has been on and off discussions with urgent care clinics, medic clinic type of entities. Is there any update about working with them for a similar type of program? Stephen Rusckowski : Thanks, A.J. Safeway relationship, we believe is the beginning of our consumer initiative working with retailers in a bigger way and part of this is around providing better access. We believe we have unparalleled access in the market, we're 2,200 patient service centers, we have 2,800 phlebotomist and physicians' offices, about 6,000 access points, but we believe some of these retailers we could be working with and safely as one had better locations and there is anywhere from 15% to 20% of laboratory requisition orders that go unfulfilled. So we're helpful by having better access. We're going to get more fulfilled requisitions and that's going to help our growth and also help some share if we have better access. We hope when a patient has a choice and who ask the question, 'who do you like to go to?' for their laboratory testing, that the patient will remember a better experience in a more convenient location for that experience and they'll choose Quest based upon our movement here. That's both growth, but also as you would expect as we start to come on board with some of these centers, we rationalize our presence in a zip code and we might shut down some of our smaller patient service centers and saves us some money as well. It's both growth and efficiency. And we do continue to have relationships and we do continue to have pilots with some of the other players in this retail space. We continue to have UBS [ph] as the client and we're optimistic about other retailers as they continue to evolve their health strategy. They see it as a nice expansion from what they do today around pharmacy and also it helps these retailers for getting traffic into their stores as well. It's a multi-faceted program for us that directionally, we're very, very optimistic about and I think we're off to a great start. Operator : We'll move next to Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Good morning. This is Alex Nolan [ph]. I got in for Bill today. I was just hoping if you could - good morning - when you're looking at deals for the future, I was wondering if you could just rank priorities. Between esoteric testing to gain access to different technology, looking at core testing labs to build geographic positions and then finally looking at hospital business partnerships. If you could just rank those three on what your priority is looking for doing a deal with one of those three in the future? That would be great. Stephen Rusckowski : Yes. All that you mentioned are strategically in-lined with our direction. So we have for the last several years cleaned up our portfolio, we're entirely focused on diagnostic information services. Our first filter for any deal is does it fit into our scope of our strategy and from what you just mentioned all do. Second is we do believe that there's our growth strategies and we've outlined in the fall five areas that we're focused on for accelerating growth. One is related to partnering with hospital systems and so, the hospital average deal fits in that strategy as well. Second is to continue to invest in advance diagnostics and bringing new capabilities to the marketplace. So some of the potential acquisitions we could do there would fit there as well. As part of these priorities, what we have shared in the past is we continue to be very, very rigorous in making sure that if their strategically in-lined, that we have the thresholds we expect to make for our shareholders with any acquisition. I would say that's generally more of the cut we have is we're the strategic in-line where they fall out in terms of use of our cash and are they getting acceptable returns of invested capital, providing us with the growth we expect and at the same time, become accreted to earnings in a reasonable period of time. That's generally how we rack and stack acquisitions and it served us well so far. That fits into the strategy that we had or 1% to 2% growth of acquisitions. As you can see from our prior acquisitions over the past four or five years, do you see all those categories and it's more of a matter of when that come in and when we can execute it and less to deal with the sorting of what we'd like more of a priority than others. But we haven't had the problem having not enough cash to execute things. We think we should do strategically and also that we think has a good return for our shareholders. So Mark, anything you like to add to that? Mark Guinan : No, I think you covered it. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. That's very helpful and then just a quick follow up. Could you just remind us what the margin profile is of your hospital relationships and just comparing that to your core business? And then what's the opportunity to expand the margins in the hospital business? Thanks. Mark Guinan : Right. When you say hospital relationships, that's multi-faceted. I think it might be specifically time about special laboratory services where we're actually serving them for the work that is not explicitly billable. So it's the laboratory work they have to perform in order to get paid under the DRG for inpatient outpatient et cetera. Those margins as we've shared are lower than our core, but double-digits. That's as explicit as we've been and then in terms of our relationship and that word is really important, when we have our relationship with a hospital and we do professional laboratory services, we typically get most - if not all of the reference work. So we've talked about the fact that we do reference work for half the hospital in the country. That is the high end at more esoteric type work, but either they are not able to, or have made a rational decision not to perform given limited size and scale, so there's a handful of people that do their work. We have the largest reference work at any laboratory. So that's another part of our relationship with hospitals and then certainly the other part of the relationship is we've got other businesses that [indiscernible] hospitals their large employers, we've got our wellness business so we can help them keeping their population healthy. We've got some of our diagnostic tools that certainly can help them manage everything laboratory spend to benchmarking their clinical practice of utilization of diagnostic. So there's a lot involved in a relationship with a hospital, but specifically on the PLS, its double digits, but slightly lower than our core margin. Stephen Rusckowski : Let me just underscore what Mark just said and remind you what we shared with you in the fall because it's important in our strategy in what we're doing every day. When we're talking about hospitals, it's about 60% of our market if we look at it and we have laid that out in three ways - one is what we could do to help them with their inpatient laboratory cost. These are cross centers that we could save the money. Number two, what Mark just went through as far as the reference testing, the advanced diagnostics to sell the hospital that they can't do themselves, they rely on laboratories like ourselves and then finally is outside of the hospital and some have outreach businesses, but they also are buying physicians and they're looking at serving geographic area and providing the laboratory services with those physicians that they now own or affiliate with. So when we have a discussion, it just was last week with a very large integrated delivery system, their lab strategy includes all three. We talk about our relationship with hospitals, yes it's the inpatient laboratory but it's a holistic view of how we approach the marketplace in a much more progressive holistic view as they build integrated delivery system. S it's all three components when we approach the systems and it's serving us well as you see in our good start of the year. Mark Guinan : And in fact, that PeaceHealth is a perfect example. Stephen Rusckowski : Exactly. Mark Guinan : So as we engage with PeaceHealth, the decision was made to sign with us on PLS deal, they are selling us their outreach and then obviously we have a reference relationship with them as well. Next question, Operator? Operator : We'll take our next question from Donald [ph] with Seabanc [ph]. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Great, I just have one question here. I'm really curious about this. I know it's new but this relationship with IBM. I realized it's new, but how that might play out on what you're seeing and experiencing with them around cognitive computing? Mark Guinan : Yes, appreciate it. In our advanced diagnostics business, we have our oncology franchise and related to that, if you recall several years ago, we formed a relationship with Memorial Sloan Kettering where we put together a product that's called OncoVantage. It's going to take some of their content, some of the research with 34 actionable genes. OncoVantage essentially is a product that delivers on precision. That is [indiscernible] oncology. And what we also realized with Memorial Sloan that we needed a cognitive computing partner. So we at this fall announced now teaming up the two of us with IBM and this is for IBM Health Watson. They are our cognitive computing partner. So collectively now, the threesome is going at the market and the opportunity in front of us is about 70% of oncology here is in community healthcare centers, not in large urban centers like what Memorial Sloan will be serving. This is a big opportunity for us and we have our own dedicated sales force, it's backed up with a brand and the content from Memorial Sloan, but now when working with IBM, we believe that their sales force and their presence with integrated delivery systems and also just in general, public awareness of precision medicine in computing and healthcare is being helped by IBM. You might have seen some of the ads. They have been running and one of those specific ads that need to actually do highlight the work they're doing with us in Memorial Sloan in the field of cancer. So we think it's a step in the right direction and it's often running well. Unidentified Analyst : Great. I didn't see that and I was just -- what would take a reasonable time frame to you at this relationship? How might it evolve? This is a year's process, I assume? Stephen Rusckowski : We continue with all our partnerships, so this is the beginning. There's other things we could do with IBM. I'm not prepared to talk about that, but we believe all our partnerships start with something and they go from there. Mark Guinan : Thanks, Don. Operator, last question please? Operator : Yes. Our final question will come from Steven Valiquette with Banc of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Steven Valiquette : Thanks. Good morning, Steve and Mark. Congrats on these results. Thanks, good morning. Just a question around the PAMA cuts. My view is that if they are delayed beyond January of 2018, it would likely be in that positive request just because of this simple math of how it no longer potentially negatively impact the 2018 revenues. But as I'm talking with investors, I'm kind of surprised I keep getting this view by some that a PAMA cut delay could actually be a slight negative request and the thought pattern is that if the PAMA cuts themselves, we're to theoretically cause some lab provider competitors to either go out of business or want to exit the business, that would obviously help your volume gains and also help your M&A pipelines with PAMA cut delay would potentially delay these types of benefits. So I guess senses just keeps coming up in my discussions and just to have more of a full discussion around this with you guys, I mean how are you thinking about the net impact of the PAMA cut delay on your overall business for 2018? Stephen Rusckowski : First of all, the refresh of the clinical lab fee schedule from PAMA -- I would just argue is a reality that's creating some catalyst on hospital systems; I must say all laboratories to consider their options going forward. And I would argue that as independent of whether any refresh takes place in 2018, 2019 or even 2020, it's just sitting there; that how they get paid for Medicare is being revisited and even though you've said that, its cuts is unclear on what the outcome will be until we gather all the data and we've talked about this before. Until we gather all the data, we don't have the visibility about the data, it's uncertain of what effect it would be. But we review that in general this review and the pressure that's on payment in general and we believe it's on the Medicare side with PAMA, but also on the commercial side is a good catalyst for us having these conversations with integrated delivery systems without the laboratories on the strategy going forward. So that's the first point I'd like to make. The second is the goal is still 2018; obviously if that's postponed or delayed, and if in fact you had a negative consequence associated with how we get paid, it would be helpful in 2018. But right now we're assuming that what they tell us is what they're going to do and therefore 2018 is what we're assuming and we'll see if that does happen. Mark Guinan : So while the other element, Steve, is that if it's delayed because they expand the definition of applicable lab, we would assume that's probably a positive for the industry and certainly for us; and I can assure you that when I laid out the view from 2020 in terms of the 3% to 5% top line growth and mid to high single digit bottom line growth, I was building in some level of COGS on the clinical lab fee schedule into our revenue growth assumptions, but that was not building in some sort of a steep change in the competitive environment where we were picking up significant volume because people couldn't survive in a world where Medicare cuts were made. So I would be cautious about assuming that we're hoping that cuts happen as large as possible, as quickly as possible; we certainly would not -- be disappointed if things get delayed. Steven Valiquette : It's helpful. Well, just real quick housekeeping type question; you mentioned the Easter planning and how that could have helped 1Q '17 just on a year-over-year comparison. And some people have asked, could it actually be a little bit of a volume headwind in 2Q '17? I'm thinking about those year-over-year comps; is that worth flagging or am I just spending too much time thinking about how it is? Mark Guinan : Well, it's absolutely all other things equal going to be a volume headwind in Q2, just like it helps us a little bit in Q1. But you know, there is so many factor that go in, it's just one element of growth in the second quarter. But if you're looking at -- if there is something in the second quarter that would be a headwind, yes, the fact that Easter is in the second quarter is something to factor in. Stephen Rusckowski : Okay, we appreciate all the questions. Thanks again for joining the call. As you heard, we had a strong quarter and we're off to a solid start in 2017. We're looking forward to meeting your commitments by our two-point strategy which is to accelerate growth and to continue to drive operational excellence. We appreciate your support and you have a great day. Operator : Thank you for participating in the Quest Diagnostic's first quarter 2017 conference call.

I am here with Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and also discuss non-GAAP measures. For this call, references to reported EPS refers to reported diluted EPS and references to adjusted EPS refers to adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K. The text of our prepared remarks will be available later today in the Investor Relations page of our Web-site. Now here's Steve Rusckowski. Stephen H. Rusckowski: Thanks, Shawn, and thanks everyone for joining us today. This morning I'll provide you with the highlights of the quarter and review progress on our strategy. Then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through updates to our 2017 guidance. We turned in another strong quarter and are delivering on all five elements of our strategy to accelerate growth. Here are some highlights. Revenues grew approximately 2% on a reported basis and 2.3% on an equivalent basis. Reported EPS of $1.37 was flat from 2016, and adjusted EPS grew approximately 16% to $1.55, which includes an increase of $0.08 over the prior year of excess tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation. Based upon our progress in the first half, we have raised our outlook for revenues, EPS, and cash from operations for the full year 2017. Before I describe the progress we've made to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence, what I'd like to do is briefly discuss PAMA. This month, a number of ACLA Board members met with the executive branch as well as key members of the Senate Finance Committee, that means energy and commerce held subcommittees, reiterating our belief that the current regulation effectively excludes hospital outreach labs, which are a significant segment of the laboratory marketplace. Last month our trade associations sent a letter to CMS recommending postponing the calculation of publication of the new clinical and fee schedule redefining the definition of then applicable laboratory to ensure in a good hospital outreach laboratories and upon gathering data from hospital outreach laboratories publishing new clinical and fee schedule rates effective not earlier than July 1, 2018. While we support reform of the Medicare payment system, we believe any modification should be market based and appropriately include all applicable independent and hospital outreach laboratories. At this point, we have made a strong case to CMS and Congress. While we continue to believe that CMS has not carried out the congressional intent of PAMA, we recognize that a new clinical and fee schedule could be in place by January of 2018 and we will be prepared. Now let's review progress we've made executing our two-point strategy to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence. In the second quarter, we delivered on all five elements of our strategy to accelerate growth. The first element of our growth strategy is to grow 1% to 2% through strategically aligned accretive acquisitions, which we expect to achieve for the fifth consecutive year. We built out our leadership position in advanced diagnostics with our recently completed acquisition of Med Fusion and Clear Point. Under the second element of our growth strategy, we continue to expand relationships with hospital health systems. On May 1, we completed our acquisition of the outreach operations at PeaceHealth Laboratories and began managing 11 PeaceHealth Laboratories serving medical centers in three states in the Pacific Northwest. We began to recognize revenues from this acquisition in the POS agreement in the second quarter. Our existing professional lab services relationships with hospital systems such as RWJBarnabas, HCA, Montefiore, also continue to perform well and drive revenue growth. The third element of our growth strategy is to offer the broadest access to diagnostic innovation. Our acquisition of Med Fusion and Clear Point will not only accelerate Quest growth in U.S. oncology diagnostics but also host the promise of improving cancer care. Quest will become the preferred provider of the U.S. oncology diagnostics for the U.S. oncology network consisting of more than 1,400 independent community-based physicians. In addition, Quest will be a preferred provider of a full range of in-patient and out-patient diagnostic services for 12 hospitals of Baylor Scott & White Health in North Texas. Advanced diagnostics, including genetic and molecular-based tests as well as general diagnostics, grew in the quarter. Drivers of advanced diagnostics growth include Q-Natal, which is our offering for non-invasive prenatal screening, core infectious disease testing and Quantiferon TB testing were part of the growth. Within general diagnostics, prescription drug monitoring and Hepatitis C screening continued strong double-digit growth. We recently expanded our tumor profile offer through IBM Watson Genomics for Quest Diagnostics to include a 50 gene panel. With this enhanced insight, doctors can take more informed actions for treatment and feel more certain about the best path forward. Finally, last week we launched QHerit, a new genetic screening service that provides women and men with insight into genetic risk of passing on heritable disorders on to their offsprings. We also made significant progress executing the fourth element of our growth strategy, which is to be the provider of choice for consumers. Our relationship with Safeway continues to expand as we are now operating in over 100 stores. We still have clear line of sight to be operating in 200 stores and now expect to reach that number by mid-2018. Patient satisfaction and convenient scores are above 90% for our Safeway locations and feedback from these sites remains overwhelmingly positive. We can't say it any better than two recent feedbacks we have received from our customers on our Safeway locations. One from a network member from Alexandria, Virginia recently wrote, 'I really like the location of this Quest center at Safeway, it saves me time, grocery shopping, pharmacy, plus blood test, all in the same location.' And my personal favorite is one from Longmont, Colorado where a customer goes on to say, 'the best blood draw I've ever had, you rock.' Now this is an exciting era of the empowered healthcare consumer. More and more people are taking control of their health and asking to receive their lab results in the palm of their hand. More than 4 million patients are receiving their lab results through our MyQuest mobile application, and we are on track to reach 5 million users by the end of 2017. And then finally, in late June we announced our collaboration with Walmart to help improve access to care and over time help lower healthcare cost of providing basic health care services. The collaboration will initially launch at approximately 15 Walmart stores in Florida and Texas by the end of 2017. These cobranded sites will initially provide laboratory testing services and over time offers are expected to expand to include other basic healthcare services. In the future, these services will help us deliver on the fifth element of our growth strategy, which is to support population health with data analytics and extended care services. Turning to the second part of our two-point strategy to drive operational excellence, we remain on track to deliver $1.3 billion in invigorate run-rate savings as we exit 2017. As we indicated at our Investor Day last fall, we also believe we will be able to generate additional savings beyond 2017. As we drive operational efficiency, we continue to improve the customer experience. We are e-enabling our processes behind the scenes as well as in our patient service centers. More than 600 patient services are now live with e-check-in. We plan to deliver this digital experience to over 1,000 patient service centers by the end of this year. At these locations, patients use a tablet to sign in for their appointment, and are provided with an estimated wait time. They know they are in the system and when they will be seen. So that's good for patients, it's good for us too. On the back end of this system, data provides us real-time insight into patients' flow, enabling us to direct phlebotomists to the locations where they are needed most. Since we introduced this service earlier this year, more than 7 million people have utilized this service to date. Finally, 2017 is our 50th anniversary of empowering better health with diagnostic insights. We've had numerous events around the Company to mark the occasion, and our employees have enjoyed engaging with former leaders and learning more about our history. We are proud of our 50 year legacy and look forward to promoting a healthy world, building value, and creating an inspiring workplace over the next fifty years. So now, I'd like to turn it over to Mark and he will take us through our financial performance in more detail. Mark? Mark J. Guinan: Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues, consolidated revenues of $1.94 billion were up 1.9% versus the prior year on a reported basis, while equivalent revenues grew 2.3%. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services grew by 2.5% compared to the prior year, with approximately 40 basis points attributed to the PeaceHealth outreach acquisition which was completed in May. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 1.8% versus the prior year, of which 1.4% was organic. Revenue per requisition in the second quarter grew by 70 basis points versus the prior year. As a reminder, revenue-per-req is not a proxy for price. It includes a number of variables such as unit price variation, test mix and test per req. Unit price headwinds in the second quarter were less than 100 basis points. While price fluctuations can vary from quarter-to-quarter, we continue to expect that unit price headwinds will remain moderate in 2017 and consistent with the last few years. Beyond unit price and the impact of growth in our POS partnerships, other mix elements including test mix contributed between 100 to 200 basis points, which is consistent with the trends we've observed for several quarters. Reported operating income for the quarter was $319 million or 16.4% of revenues, compared to $422 million or 22.1% of revenues a year ago. Keep in mind, our reported operating income in 2016 included a one-time gain related to the divestiture of our Focus Products business. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $343 million or 17.6% of revenues, compared to $324 million or 17% of revenues last year. Our Focus Diagnostics Products business contributed approximately $4 million of adjusted operating income in the second quarter of 2016, which adversely impacted the growth in our operating income year-over-year by approximately 1% point. Excluding the impact to Focus Diagnostics, operating income grew approximately 7%. Reported EPS was $1.37 in the quarter, flat with the prior year period. As noted previously, our second quarter 2016 results included a large one-time gain associated with the Focus divestiture. Adjusted EPS was $1.55, up 16% from $1.34 last year. The Company recorded after tax net charges totaling $11 million in the second quarter or $0.08 per diluted share, representing restructuring, integration and other one-time costs, partially offset by gain on the sale of an equity interest. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was approximately 32%, compared to approximately 48% in the prior year. The prior year tax rate was unusually high as a result of the Focus divestiture. The decrease in the effective tax rate was also driven by $13 million or $0.10 per diluted share in the quarter of excess tax benefit associated with the stock-based compensation, compared to a $2 million or $0.02 per share benefit last year. The benefit was almost entirely related to the exercise of stocks options which is impossible to forecast. Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 4.2%, flat year-over-year and 20 basis points lower versus the prior quarter. For the first half of 2017, cash provided by operations was $490 million versus $464 million last year. Capital expenditures year-to-date were $107 million, compared to $104 million a year ago. Before turning to guidance, I'd like to remind you that we now have annualized all of our portfolio changes as part of our efforts to refocus the business on Diagnostic Information Services. Therefore, the quarterly year-over-year comparison will no longer refer to equivalent growth, but the year-to-date comparisons will refer to equivalent growth for the remainder of 2017. With that said, we are providing the following updated outlook for 2017. Revenue is now expected to be between $7.69 billion and $7.74 billion, an increase of 2.3% to 3.1% versus the prior year on a reported basis and an increase of 2.6% to 3.4% on an equivalent basis. Reported diluted EPS to be between $4.90 and $5 and adjusted EPS to be between $5.62 and $5.72. Cash provided by operations is now expected to be approximately $1.2 billion. And finally, capital expenditures remain between $250 million and $300 million. Our increased revenue, EPS, and cash from operations outlook is based on first half performance and reflects the completion of two previously announced acquisitions, including the PeaceHealth outreach deal in May as well as the Med Fusion and Clear Point labs which closed last week. In addition to our first half performance, our raised EPS outlook reflects the higher than expected level of excess tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation. Now, let me turn it back to Steve. Stephen H. Rusckowski: Thanks Mark. We turned in another strong quarter and are delivering on all five elements of our strategy to accelerate growth. Based on our progress in the first half, we have raised our outlook and are well positioned to meet our expectations. So with that, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Amanda Murphy from William Blair. Your line is now open. Amanda Murphy : I had few questions on the volume side if I may, so I know that you have said in the past in terms of organic volume growth that you're not going to kind of parse out the specific drivers, but I was just curious as we've seen some weakness in pharma scripts and whatnot, so what are you guys seeing just in terms of basic utilization patterns at this point if you think about per capita usage if you will at this point? Stephen H. Rusckowski: First of all, as we said in the past, we look at a lot of different external measures. Then we do an internal measure where we look at our same account measurement where we do a measurement where we know we have a good account and we look at year-on-year comparison of volumes. And what we've said in the past remains this quarter, we think the underlying volume in the market is stable, is the best way to summarize it. And then to your second point about volume in the quarter, as you know we don't guide on volumes, we do guide on revenues and it's important that we continue to drive revenue growth, it's what we are entirely focused on. So I'll turn it over to Mark to provide a little bit of color around what's in the mix. Mark? Mark J. Guinan: So Amanda, as Steve said, I think we test in our imperfect fashion through the tools we have but the market is pretty stable. We haven't seen significant utilization declines and we certainly have not seem anything significant in terms of [indiscernible]. So, we are pleased with our volume, our advanced diagnostics, as Steve mentioned in his prepared remarks. Certainly volumes, and importantly revenues, wer4e up strong, our general diagnostics was solid, and then certainly POS is giving us some lift. Amanda Murphy : And then I thought I could follow up actually on the POS side, so maybe a bit early to ask this, but you talked about the opportunity potentially to leverage from the POS agreement to sort of expand the relationship beyond that and maybe some reference work and things like that, so wondering if you have any insights there again, recognizing maybe a bit early, but\u2026? Stephen H. Rusckowski: I appreciate that. As we've talked about and raised the case, when we engage with a healthcare system integrated delivery network, we talk about three things. First of all, what we can do to help them with their in-patient laboratory, and that's what we refer to as professional laboratory services engagement. The second part of this is the inside diagnostics that I referenced, testing, and we believe we could be very effective provider of more and also help them with what they do, so a significant part of the discussion. And then the third case is that we are in that discussion to decide what their strategy is from hospital outreach, and [indiscernible] is a good example of that where we bought their operating [indiscernible], we're helping them with 11 of their hospital in-patient laboratories. And to your specific question, in that relationship we are also helping them with the reference work as well. So, in all these engagements, we typically become a stronger presence in that account for reference work. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin Ellich from Craig-Hallum. Your line is now open. Kevin Ellich : Just wanted to kind of follow up on the hospital outreach comments, you guys announced a number of good deals. The one that is more interesting to me is the [indiscernible] has gotten wide. I think you are in 12 hospitals now with kind of partially due to the U.S. [Oncology's] announcements. What potential to expand that since they are still big down in Texas and do you see additional sales in any of those markets? Stephen H. Rusckowski: Thanks for asking. We are quite excited about it as well. There are a lot of different reasons. That goes down there last week, we had our date one [indiscernible] with a town hall meeting and spent some time with the management team. So this acquisition actually kicks four elements of our accelerated growth strategy. First of all, obviously it's part of our growth through acquisition, so that's good news. Second is in terms of innovation, it brings to us a nice [indiscernible] up our portfolio around what we could do around oncology and precision medicine, so we are encouraged about that. Third is to your point, it brought it to present in the second largest state in the country, Texas, where we already have a strong presence. And then with this, it's all about providing better health care at better cost levels, and we think with some of the work they've done in the engagement for instance with U.S. Oncology, we can help with the data and understanding what we would do to form better cancer care, so four elements of our strategy. So we are encouraged by that. And the relationship in Texas is strong, and so we are deeply engaged how we continue on what they built with that engagement and continue to grow from that given our broader presence now with us at Quest Diagnostics. So we're excited about it and we think it's a great acquisition as well. So thanks for the question. Kevin Ellich : Great. And then just a follow-up on Walmart, I might have missed some of the commentary, Steve, but what measures or metrics will you be looking at to [indiscernible] how quickly you want to expand and what other [indiscernible] clients do you guys plan to add as I think it's going to be more toward the more [indiscernible] patient service centers [indiscernible] in the Walmart stores? Stephen H. Rusckowski: Absolutely. So first of all , we study with two of the largest states, Texas and Florida. We also have a strong presence in Florida, so two nice states, second and third largest state now in the country for us to make progress in the large states. Yes, we will look at some of their sectors for our patient service centers, but as importantly, what I said in my introductory remarks is, we are actually going to use this strong metric to provide some of the basic healthcare services that help with what we could do with population [indiscernible] to cost curve. So what are some of those things? Now can we help with people dealing with hypertension and do blood pressure checks, can we make sure that people are staying out their [indiscernible] beyond a diuretic suffering, congested heart failure, that we help you with that by periodically taking your weight, making sure you stay in your diuretic staying range. We can also help with diabetes management. We're also working with some of the healthcare insurance companies where we could close gaps in care to help them with their quality scores so they get reimbursed by the healthcare that we all know is the best healthcare. So those are the basic healthcare services, and fortunately at Quest, we have the world's largest laboratory, so we'll be, absent for the last five years, we are in the field of diagnostic information services. We have over 20,000 health care workers, 10,000 [indiscernible] with 10,000 other health care workers that provide services already for wellness services from Florida that help insurance companies. We are also providing health checks for life insurance pre-qualification physicals and checks. So, we are leveraging those resources and its relationship as well. So, we are excited about it. We think it's a great opportunity for us to just expand our already unsurpassed access to the marketplace, but also engage with the ecosystem healthcare with some of these basic customer services that can in our mind really help them to cost curve for healthcare in populations that are difficult to get access to. Operator : Our next question comes from Lisa Gill from JPMC. Your line is now open. Lisa Gill : I just had a follow-up question on your comments on PAMA. As far as timing goes, when would we learn that they have decided to postpone this as an incremental data on the hospital outreach? Stephen H. Rusckowski: So the current schedule as you know, we submitted the data already. That was delayed by two months because their portal was not available and so we recognized they'd listen to us and postpone it. We have put it in our data. Those people that are submitting the data have done that by the end of May. The current schedule thereon is to publish tentative rates in September, so the schedule that they currently have published. However, we have shared with them that we believe that several things are going on with the data they had collected. One is they haven't included all the data from those laboratories that they are buying from, typically hospital outreach. We believe their approach still limits the size of the sample, and we shared that. And also this has been reinforced by the officer and Inspector General that [indiscernible] that only 5% of the laboratories are being asked to submit data will submit data, which is about 69% of what they actually buy from. The second is what we have heard from some of the smaller laboratory association that affect some of the data input. So we have shared this with them because some of the smaller laboratories did not have good access to retrospective data. And while our concern is that they use that data for the basis of publishing at tentative [indiscernible] fee schedule in the fall, it won't be right. So our strong recommendation to them, and we have got word from Congress broadly, many different leaders of Congress as well as the center [indiscernible], we believe the best thing for us all is to take some time to get it right. So our recommendation is to postpone it. We have made a recommendation of how we believe they could collect the data. That will take some time. We think if they work in that aggressively, they possibly could publish the due clinical and fee schedule no earlier than July of 2018. So that's the path we are on, but the current schedule we have is that they are going to extend the schedule to get out some rates in the fall with the refresh clinical and fee schedule in the first of next year, and as we said in our introductory remarks, we are prepared for that but working hard because we believe it does not reflect the impression or intent to get a full sampling of the marketplace and get that data in a good form and get good quality data to establish a rate for itself. So we are pushing that in a big way across the trade association. Mark J. Guinan: I think the key is there still remains a lot of uncertainty around PAMA. I'm sure you drew that from Steve's comments. And fortunately, we don't have the data to determine what the projected outcome will be, whether it's the timing or the impact. I do think it's good to go back to the final rule periodically and just remind everybody that the methodology is that CPT code by CPT code calculation, and so weighted median based on the data that they have collected compared to the rates that they are currently paying, and that any CPT code can be cut as much as 10% per year for the first three years and then beyond that for 2021 to 2023 the final rule dictates that any CPT code could be changed by as much as 15%. So that is the final rule in terms of the application of the rule and the outcome. I'm sure as you drew, there's still a lot to be answered. Operator : Our next question comes from Donald Hooker from Keybanc. Your line is now open. Donald Hooker : Just kind of a broader question on the POS deals, which seemed to have great momentum over the past year or so, I understand they are all structured differently. I guess on the one hand you have the full service outsourcing where you takeover all the employees and supervisors, and then on the other hand I guess it's just maybe one or two people one side and they are buying off your contracts. How do the deals break across that continuum and maybe can you talk about the different revenue that generates across that continuum for these deals and is there evidence that maybe over time as you add more and more of these that people start on the low end and kind of move up towards the higher end, if you will? Stephen H. Rusckowski: We continue to be excited about the prospect here. And again, to start at the highest level of possible systems, and I have shared in the past their lab strategies are on the shortlist of strategic things they are talking about. And so they welcome meetings with us to help them think through this. And in that context, a big part of this is how we can help them become more efficient with their hospital in-patient laboratory, and it is that spectrum. The broadest capability is we help them manage it, the leverage of our procurement. They also learn from our best practices of running the world's largest laboratory. And to answer your question about across that spectrum, where is that set, I would say it's equally distributed across the lowest level of involvement, the most no predominant necessarily of one end of that spectrum. But to your last question, once we get in the account and we begin to develop the relationship, we do see increased levels of engagement by the customer with us and we do broaden our services broadly and we do spend more time on what we'd do to help with them their reference work, and then also in that context, we do continue the conversation about their outreach strategy if they are in the outreach business. So, the way we see it is we start with an engagement but that's just the beginning of engagement. And then we also use this as a discussion broadly of what we could do for them in terms of what their mission is and their strategy, which gets us into discussion about population health and what we could do in data analytics. We've got a lot of capabilities there, we have talked about that in the past, we've seen a nice value-added. These new extended care services are of great interest, particularly those integrated delivery system, that are taking on risk [indiscernible] they are quite interested and probably can leverage these access points for putting in place with our two [indiscernible] with Walmart is one example. So, this strategy is really a strategy of how we serve possible systems in a bigger way, and one aspect of what we could do with them is around their professional answers is engagement in their in-patient laboratory, but it's much broader than that. Mark J. Guinan: And I would just add, Don, you asked about the revenues and as you implied, directionally, the deeper the relationship, the higher the revenues before actually on-site running their in-hospital laboratory and having those employees work less than we have to build that out for them. So that would be a higher revenue type arrangement. But I'm sure as you can imagine, there's not a lot of margin in that stop. So a greater part of the margin is really driven around rationalized and test menu, moving a subset of that off-site where we can drive not only better costs but shorter cycle time because we are running those tests every day. That's one of the [indiscernible] when we have a POS type arrangement, it's not just about cost, and that's where preponderance of the revenue and the margin comes. It's really just driven by I'd say hospital preference. As you have heard Steve say in the past, we have seen one hospital, lab strategy we have seen one. It's really nothing endemic to the particular hospital structure that dictates the POS arrangements. It's really just our comfort level. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Brian Tanquilut : Congratulations. Steve, when you first came on board, you guys first started the hospital strategy and that was sort of new for the industry and now you're doing the retail strategy with Safeway and Walmart. So, do you think this is the wave of the future in terms of where the lab will be and what do you think, as you look down your pipeline in terms of other retailers or other opportunities to get closer to the end user or the consumer, I mean how should we be thinking about the future strategy as you pull from your traditional [indiscernible] into more retailer or consumer-oriented settings? Stephen H. Rusckowski: Now what we talked about five years ago just for the world's largest laboratory, but the business that we want to focus on is Diagnostic Information Services. And so, the information and the services portion of our portfolio is the big portion of what we've really put our shoulder into over the last several years, and you are seeing some of the contributions in the way of business in the last few years. So let me just walk through what that means and where do we see this going. So in that strategy, we believe that hospital systems were becoming stronger. We knew that hospitals were acquiring physician practices. And therefore it was quite important for us rather than thinking about the hospitals as primarily a competitor, we thought [indiscernible] partner with them with their lab strategy, and that has worked well. They are all over trying to become more efficient. They are trying to understand how they can provide better patient care. And then finally, they are realizing that being in the outreach business is not necessarily something that they all want to focus on and therefore they can team up with us and we're a good provider of that. So it's a nice service [indiscernible]. And then as we get in, similar to what I said to Donald in the last question, it's all about their strategy and their strategy is to be a broader provider of integrated health services within a geography, and we could help them with that. So we have brought out a broad line of information products. We launched this a couple of years ago with the [indiscernible], we call it Quanum. And in that portfolio of products, we offer capabilities to take a look at your utilization for diagnostics, allows the data to be put on the table to ask questions about are we doing a proper work-up to make sure we have an informed decision that happens, that [indiscernible] what happens next in healthcare, which is an important part of delivering good health care at lower cost. Second is we also served up with a nice access to the workflow within the physicians workflow, the ability to look at all past data from our relationship with [indiscernible], and that data we think is valuable to get a full view of what happens to that patient. So those data analytic services I think are helpful. So that's the conversation we also get into. And as we work on this discussion, they are all interested in how they retain their current patients and grow the patient population as well as their membership, and we all see that there is a sea change happening where the consumer is much more engaged and that's why we think it's very important for us and we put a lot of energy on broadening and expanding our brand and what we believe our brand stands for. As a matter of fact, we have talked about our brand and our tagline being action from inside. Our vision is to have better health with diagnostic insight, not just [indiscernible]. So in that consumer strategy, which is part of our growth strategy, there's multiple aspects to that. One is the migrating access. So we believe our retail strategy helps us with that. We started with Safeway, we said we're going to do more, we recently announced our relationship with Walmart. So we think that's expanding our access. Second is to provide products that are consumer-oriented. We have talked in the past earnings call about what we're doing to be a provider of testing directly to consumers. We have launched a pilot, we're doing some of that in Arizona. We are now expanding that pilot of selling testing where states allow it to be done, to Missouri, to Colorado. We have a great business that's growing around wellness. We have a product coupled for wellness. We have expanded that to the field of sports where we have the sport diagnostic product. We have done the work with [indiscernible]. So there's a whole portfolio of more consumer-oriented products that we've rolled out as well. And then we have also improved on the access and consumers remarkably want to have all their health information, and frankly we're quite surprised by the pickup of our MyQuest application, I mentioned in my introductory remarks over 4 million of people have registered with us. We believe we are tracking to be on track to get above 5 million users. So, if you look at all those elements, we believe that this positions us nicely as that diagnostic information services company that's thought of when the consumer will have [indiscernible] the diagnostic testing, and over time we believe with better transparency, because we do offer we believe one of the strongest [indiscernible] proposition in the marketplace, the physician will ask the consumer which laboratory do you want to test and to go to and they will remember this great experience that they had at Quest Diagnostics. They will have information that's provided to them. They will have access to products and they will be able to easily access our capabilities, and so the choice will be given to us, and that's our strategy. We picked up the powerful element of our strategy and it's where healthcare is headed. Consumers will have more choice and consumers will direct more at healthcare. So we are making a lot of progress, we're excited about it and we think that's going to help us with our core business today but over time it will become a larger piece of our portfolio over time that we really do direct healthcare in a better way where it is needed, which is not necessarily only in hospitals but throughout the health care system and communities that are touched not by traditional healthcare but other places like our retail strategy. So that's where we are going with it. Brian Tanquilut : I really appreciate that. Mark, just a quick follow-up, what are your assumptions and guidance for the back half in terms of tax rate and buybacks or capital deployment? Mark J. Guinan: So in terms of capital deployment, it's really dependent on whether we have strategically appropriate deals that create value for our shareholders. So really that will depend on our deal pipeline and what might come to closure. In terms of your expectations for share buybacks, we talked about keeping our way, so pretty flat to the extent that we wouldn't execute more M&A. You've seen more share buybacks but I think you shouldn't consider pretty much flat share count. And certainly from a tax rate, as we mentioned it's impossible for me to predict option exercises. So outside of the stock base comp piece, you should expect the effective tax rate that's pretty much on the historical level that we've seen in the upper 30s as opposed to the rate we saw this quarter in the low 30s, really driven by the stock based comp. Now if we were to have significant exercises in the quarter, that obviously could depress it, but that's why we've been very intentional in calling out what that impact is year-over-year so that you can understand that it's really not operational. Operator : Our next question comes from Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Isaac Ro : Wanted to come back to PAMA for a minute, I appreciate your comments around the idea to caution process. I'm interested in the commercial side of it, in particular how you think the competitive landscape is going to evolve as we approach implementation, whether it's delayed or not? And specifically about sort of overall battle between the in-source labs within hospitals and sort of the commercial labs, is there a material tug of war starting to brew here between where a lot of that volume gets done, I'm interested in what's happening out there in the commercial and [indiscernible]? Stephen H. Rusckowski: Part of our discussion with these hospital systems were on their lab strategy, they see pressure on rates broadly. They are feeling pressure from their commercial insurance relationships, but they also are looking forward and realizing that the clinical and fee schedule will be refreshed. And as we talked about in the past, they have more exposure than we do to that. Roughly 12% of our revenues is a much more meaningful percentage of their laboratory revenues. So, when we engage in these conversations, one aspect of their consideration of what they are going to run [indiscernible] is they are going to be under pressure both on the commercial side as well as on Medicare. But the other aspect as you know is related to what their strategy is, do we want to put more capital and increasing more complicated area, and in some cases they decide not to. Second is they realize that our scale is significant and as we move away from a fee-for-service model to a much more value based reimbursement model, it's still longer to be in activity, it's going to be making sure we have the best cost per service unit and our cost structure is far superior than any other cost structure. So, in many of the cases we are engaged around this and in some cases where we have bought their [indiscernible] business, it's because they see reimbursement changing and they believe that they have to move to team up with someone like Quest that has a very efficient model delivering the necessary diagnostic services, so as part of that overall strategy for the integrated delivery system, a part of this is looking at pressure and range, but it's more comprehensive than that as well, Issac. Isaac Ro : That's helpful. And then maybe as a follow-up to that, if we look at sort of the rest of the commercial market, clearly the majority of your competitors are very, very small. How do you think they are going to react to PAMA over the next say 12 months, is there a meaningful opportunity there to consolidate more share from commercial labs? Stephen H. Rusckowski: Yes, so we shared this at our Investor Day. Look at the market we compete in, ourselves and the nearest competitor, less than 25% share. We have a very compelling value proposition where we offer some of the best pricing and we believe best service and quality on the planet, and we believe we should have more share. We're working hard at gaining that organically but we are also believing that we can consolidate more of this marketplace and that's why we have the strategy of 1% to 2% growth through those strategic [indiscernible] acquisitions. We have announced a number this year with [indiscernible], we're moving forward down with Med Fusion and also we also announced recently [indiscernible] in Massachusetts. So our march continues to drive that strategy. So we think the commercial rate pressure on the rest of the marketplace will help accelerate the strategy we are on and we should over time take up more share both organically and through acquisitions. Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Quirk from Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. William Quirk : So I hate to keep coming back to PAMA but obviously it remains a pretty hot topic. I guess, Steve, certainly understand [indiscernible] position here, help us think about as we get closer to the initial implementation date, or the initial preliminary rate date, how do you handicap the likelihood of [indiscernible] at this point given all your conversations with folks up [indiscernible]? Stephen H. Rusckowski: I can't handicap it, but I will share that we are actively working the communication with CMS, and when I say we, it's the Board of Directors and all members of ACLA are actively talking to our Congress members both on House side as well as the Senate side. We have also met a couple of times with the leadership at CMS. The leadership at CMS understands this well, understands that the current approach has issues associated with it, and our simple messaging on this is take the time to get it right. We continue to support the idea of paying or having CMS pay market-based pricing. To get the right data, take the right approach to bringing on those rates is important for all of us. And what we remind them of is the reason why we have PAMA is reflective of the work that's to protect access to Medicare Act, and it's important for Congress and it's part of their congressional [intent] [ph] not to just pay at the lowest rates but to make sure that they pay for what they use, and the reason for this is there's many parts of this country that are not served by the large national laboratories. And the concern that they are now aware of is if in fact, if this is not done in the right way, rates could be cut, smaller labs that are very necessary in smaller rural areas, in some segment of the marketplace the majority of what the testing is has provided the Medicare marketplace could be substantially cut, and the example of that is what's happening in nursing homes where a majority of their single testing is basically the most routine tests that are done for many small laboratories all over this country. So we remind Congress and we remind CMS of where we started and why we believe paying market based price is quite important. So, what I'll share is we think they are very, very responsive to listening to our concerns. We realize there is an element of administration. They realize that what was put in place was put in place over the last couple of years. They realize there is an opportunity to work with us to get it right. So we remain hopeful but I can't handicap it. William Quirk : Got it. And then just as a follow-up, the pace of deals has increased and obviously you talked quite a bit about that here in the Q&A today. Can you talk to us a little bit about how much capacity both your deal and integration teams have? Stephen H. Rusckowski: We have been at a point where we don't have the capacity to do deals that make sense and we spend a lot of time looking at deals, we say no to more deals than we say yes to. It's important. We continue to go back to our philosophy on doing acquisitions. They have to be strategically aligned and also we have to make money on those deals. And a key part of making money on those deals is making sure we have the right integration plan. And so, as we integrate this, we have a small structural team that helps us with the integration but also a large part of the integration happens in our regions as well. And so, if you look at the distribution of some of these deals, they have been distributed throughout the United States. We have done a number up in the north. [Indiscernible] being one example of that, Harvard Health Care being another example, but most recently we are doing this deal out in our western region with PeaceHealth and we are working on that with enough capacity to pull that off. So, our capacity has not been [indiscernible] at all. It's more the [indiscernible] factor to making sure we have deals that we believe are strategically aligned and we could make money on. Operator : Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Ricky Goldwasser : The first one, if you can elaborate a little bit more on your relationship with Walmart, you talked about 50 stores by the end of the year, so how should we think about the revenue contribution and your earnings contribution between volume and price? And then does the relationship with Walmart preclude you from entering additional partnerships with others and do you think that over time will the market split in two verticals, you have the relationship with Safeway and Walmart and potentially others where your competitor has a relationship with Walgreens? Stephen H. Rusckowski: I appreciate that. First of all, the relationship is getting nowhere near. We said we are going to focus on two largest states, Florida and Texas, and we're going to pick 15 sites that will be our initial pilot sites. And what we'll provide at those sites are some of our patient service center capabilities like we've done with Safeway, but we believe there's more we could do on those sites with basic healthcare services. And what will specifically get done is really dependent upon where we forge relationships with healthcare insurance companies, their integrated delivery systems for ACOs within those geographies where we think there could be some value of providing with basic healthcare services in those great access points that Walmart has. This will be a joint venture. We are the majority holder of ownership in that joint venture. We have not provided visibility or guidance of how large this will be, but we are hopeful that this year we'll be off to a good start and we'll share more in due course as we get into it. The second part of your question, as we said when we announced Safeway, Safeway was an excellent relationship. We are proud of what we have done. We are half way into what fully we can realize, about 100 stores, we've got another 100 to go to get to 200. What we are doing with Walmart we think is complementary and every one of the retail strategies that are \u2013 retail companies that are in our space have a different strategy. So we continue to enjoy a nice good working relationship with [CBS] [ph] [indiscernible]. We believe Walgreens has a different strategy as well. And what we will do is \u2013 Walmart and what we will do with Safeway, we believe there are other ways we could work with other retailers that could be complementary to what we agree to do with these two that we have announced so far. Mark J. Guinan: Just to add, Ricky, the impact this year is immaterial. I mean as you can imagine, it's 15 stores where we're really just going to be ramping up over the balance of the year. The value creation is well in front of us and it goes beyond just having a blood draw center. It's really those additional services that Steve talked about. So Walmart certainly has the foot traffic, millions of people every day. We have not only got the ability to do the laboratory testing, but as Steve mentioned earlier, we've got the on-call specialist and actually do a lot of in-home assessments, biometrics and things well beyond laboratory testing that can supplement our ability to provide additional services. So more to come on Walmart, it's not exclusive. We mentioned that the links with Safeway was not exclusive. There are many, many retail centers available. Even though we have over 2,000 patient service centers, approximately a little over half would kind of be candidates for retail outlook. So it wouldn't be all of our patient service centers, and so if you look at 1,000-plus potential patient service center opportunities, certainly between Safeway and Walmart and potentially somebody else, we are going to barely cover a small portion of their footprint. So this is not looking at blocking up and excluding other people, it's really just partnering and finding a way to get more efficient on our capital deployment and where we will [indiscernible] and other services. Ricky Goldwasser : Okay, thank you. And then one follow up just on your second-half guidance. So when we kind of like look at the contribution from acquisition, is it fair to say that second half acquisition will contribute around 100 basis points, and if so, it seems that you're looking for an acceleration in organic growth rate in the second half of the year, I mean based on our back of the envelope second half is over 3% top line growth, so are we in the ballpark and how do you think about where is the acceleration on the organic side is coming from? Mark J. Guinan: So yes, Ricky, you are correct, the increase in guidance on the revenue side is almost exclusively from M&A. We're very pleased with our organic revenue performance for the first half. It's certainly not out of our original guidance range. So the increase in revenue guidance is really driven by the deals. As I mentioned on the earnings side, we actually strongly enough from the first half that there is some organic impetus in the increased guidance, and then the other piece is really around the stock-based comp reducing our effective tax rate in the first half. M&A, our new deals, is not expected to contribute anything meaningful on the EPS side in the back half of the year. So it's really driven by organic health and by this tax benefit. And then back to the question that was asked earlier about assumptions for the back half, right now that guidance assumes a tax rate that is more in the going-in rate in the high 30s. We shared that there was $0.06 of excess tax benefit last year. That was in our original assumptions and guidance for this year. Obviously we have exceeded that greatly in the first half but I am not counting on any extraordinary excess tax benefit from stock based comp in the back half. So should that happen and it's not really forecast, something we can forecast, then that could lower the tax rate. Operator : The final question on today's conference comes from Steven Valiquette from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Steven Valiquette : So most of my good questions have been asked already, but just curious on that retail strategy, what is the right number of partners over time just from a retail co-branding perspective and is that critical, is this a situation where you might be comfortable having 5 to 10 retail partners over time or do you want to keep the numbers smaller to maximize the co-branding awareness? Stephen H. Rusckowski: We are working our way through that. The Safeway relationship is different than what we're going to do at Walmart and we already have working relationships with some other retailers. I mentioned CBS and Walgreens, different strategies, all these have different strategies. And frankly, I think we'd like to have a handful of strong national brands that we work with. We'd like to make some progress with those before we expand too broadly. So we have two now and working relationships with others. So, we are totally focused on executing against what we've said we would do with Safeway. We feel good about that. We just launched this new relationship with Walmart. We want to make sure we make progress in 2017. And as far as others, in due course we will talk about that as we work with them on their own trend, [indiscernible] how we could be helpful, but a good way of thinking about this, we started with one, we've now moved to two and a handful will be a good number that we could then manage over time to provide what we do and help them with their health strategy. Steven Valiquette : Were you ever in deep discussions with Walgreens? You just mentioned Walgreens and CBS, but was that one kind of a tossup at the end and who would be the partner or is there still a possibility that you could still also partner with Walgreens in addition to the lab provider based in North Carolina? Stephen H. Rusckowski: So we are open to working with others. We want to make sure that what we do doesn't in any way contradict what we are doing with some other partners. But as you know, Walgreens continues to broaden their health presence. They have a working relationship as you know with Med Express. Med Express will provide healthcare services and that strategy will change over time. And as you know, most of these retailers work with all different brands, no matter what category and laboratory services are going to be different. So, they are selling all different bands in their stores, so therefore they are open to different brands and we believe that this strategy is good for us to think about how we could team up with different people in the ecosystem in healthcare and every one of these players has different strategy. So, we think there is an opportunity here as well. Stephen H. Rusckowski: Okay, so that concludes our day. We had a strong first half in 2017. We look forward to continue to meet our commitments by executing our two-point strategy, which is to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence. We appreciate your time on this call and we hope you have a great day. Take care. Operator : Thank you for participating in the Quest Diagnostics Second Quarter 2017 Conference Call.

Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K. The text of our prepared remarks will be available later today in the Investor Relations page of our Website. Now here's Steve Rusckowski. Steve Rusckowski : Thanks, Shawn, and thanks everyone for joining us today. This morning I'll provide you with some perspective on PAMA, highlights on the quarter and review progress on our two-point strategy, which continues to drive results. Then Mark will provide more detail and take you through updates on our 2017 guidance. Well, we delivered another strong quarter of revenue growth in spite of some weather challenges. We completed two previously announced acquisitions and agreed to purchase Shiel Medical Laboratory and then yesterday we announced a strategic relationship with Cleveland Clinic that includes the acquisition of Cleveland HeartLab. Here are some highlights from this quarter. Revenues were $1.93 billion up 2.4%, reported EPS of $1.15 was down 14% from 2016, adjusted EPS grew 150 basis points to a $1.39, which includes an increase of $0.02 over the prior year of excess tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation. Our updated guidance for our full-year 2017 primarily reflects the impact of hurricanes in the third quarter, which impacted geographies where we have a large presence as well as our recently closed acquisitions. Before I describe the progress, we have made to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence, I'd like to discuss PAMA. We continue to urge CMS to delay the implementation of PAMA to take the time to get it right. The preliminary rates that CMS released are not market-based rates as Congress indicated. Unfortunately, only 1% of all laboratories submitted data and over 99% of hospitals and physician office laboratories were prohibited from reporting their rates. Also based on data submitted through CMS, Quest alone represented nearly 40% of all the market data CMS collected. As you're aware from previous days, our estimated share of the Medicare market is less than 15%. Instead of protecting access to essential laboratory testing, this flawed approach could greatly compromise Medicare beneficiaries access to testing. A large portion of the Medicare population receives their services from small laboratories and PAMA could put them at risk. We've been collecting facts that demonstrate the many ways that CMS has disregarded the intent of Congress and we've been finding the receptive audience among legislators and policymakers in Washington DC for our call to take more time to get the implementation right. The clinical lab industry is a critical element in the healthcare and economic landscape of this country, creating jobs, driving economic activity and generating tax revenues for the federal and state governments. Our trade association's recent economic study found that this industry directly and indirectly employs over 600,000 people that contributes $13 billion in tax revenues. The impacts of these proposed cuts are far-reaching to this vital industry. These rates should not be finalized as proposed and this view is shared by 22 respected medical societies and health groups, including the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association and the American Hospital Association is very much back of our plan. In October, we -- on October 6, sent a letter with these leading voices in healthcare, calling for CMS to take immediate action to address the significant deficiencies in its progress to establish new clinical laboratory payment rates. Along with our trade association, we are exploring every option to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries have access to diagnostic information services. In whatever form CMS might implement PAMA, Quest will be prepared and we remain confident in our ability to meet the long-term commitments outlined at our 2016 Investor Day. Mark will touch on this later. Turning to the progress we've made in the third quarter, we delivered on all five elements of our strategy to accelerate growth. The first element of our growth strategy is to grow 1% to 2% per year through strategically aligned accretive acquisitions, which we're on track to achieve for the fifth consecutive year. We had a very productive quarter. We completed two previously announced acquisitions and agreed to purchase Shiel Medical Laboratory, which we will further strengthen -- which further strengthens our position in the New York metropolitan market. Yesterday we and also announced the acquisition of the Cleveland HeartLab from Cleveland Clinic. This lab will become our advanced diagnostic center of expertise in cardiovascular testing, an agreement build on our existing relationship with the Cleveland Clinic. Our M&A pipeline remains very strong and our strategy is delivering growth. With the acquisitions we've completed this year and those expected to close by the end of 2017, we are well-positioned to exceed our long-term M&A objective for 2018 and of course in accretion realized from the deals in 2018 will help offset the potential impact of new Medicare rates. Under the second element of our growth strategy, we continue to expand relationship with hospital systems. Our relationship with PeaceHealth is progressing well. As you recall the relationship includes the acquisition of the outreach laboratory as well as a professional laboratory service agreement to manage laboratories at 11 PeaceHealth Medical Centers in Washington State, Oregon and Alaska. This relationship is fully operational and already contributing revenues and adjusted earnings growth. The third element of our growth strategy is to offer the broadest access to diagnostic innovation. In the third quarter, we completed the acquisition of Med Fusion and Clear Point in Texas forming a national precision oncology center of expertise and we are very pleased with the integration efforts to date. In women's health we continue to be excited about the progress we've made in noninvasive prenatal screening. Our Q-Natal test is providing strong double-digit growth year-over-year. We recently complimented our women's health offering with QHerit, a screening panel that helps both women and men across multiple identify the risk of passing 22 genetic diseases to their children. We also introduced the cholesterol test with an improved method for assessing heart disease risk in aiding treatment decisions. Unlike most lipid tests that does not require fasting and patient's life is added convenience. We all made progress executing the fourth element of our growth strategy, which is to be the provider of choice for consumers. Our relationship with Safeway continues to expand as we are now operating in 128 stores and are expected to open about 30 more before the end of 2017. In addition, our collaboration with Walmart will open new locations in 2017. In this exciting era of the empowered healthcare consumer, are MyQuest mobile application is now delivering lab results into the hands of 4.5 million users. Payers are taking notice of the progress we are making on our consumer strategy, especially with convenience, value and the number of access points we provide. The fifth element of our growth strategy is to support population health and data analytics and extended care services. We're building a solid pipeline with data analytics with a number of partners interested in leveraging our data, including pharma, CRO and health plan customers. Turning to the second part of our two-point strategy to drive operational excellence, we remain on track to deliver $1.3 billion to invigorate run rate savings as we exit 2017. As we drive operational efficiency, we continue to improve the customer experience. Over 950 of our 2,200 patient service centers are live with e-check-in, which improves the patient experience. Our total e-check-in volume is over 12 million encounters to date. We expect to have this capability in most of our patient service centers by the end of this year. Now let me turn it over to Mark who'll take you through our financial performance in detail. Mark? Mark Guinan : Thanks Steve. Starting with revenue, consolidated revenues of $1.93 billion were up 2.4% versus the prior year. We estimate the impact of the recent hurricanes reduced our revenue growth by approximately 130 basis points in the third quarter, which is slightly lower than what we had estimated in late September. Revenues for diagnostic information services grew by 2.8% compared to the prior year with approximately 140 basis point attributed to recent acquisitions. Volume measured by the number of our acquisitions increased 1.6% versus the prior year of which about 60 basis points was organic. However, note that the impact of hurricanes presented a headwind of approximately 140 basis points to volume in the quarter. Revenue per acquisition in the third quarter grew by 1.2% compared to the prior year. As a reminder revenue per rep is not proxy for price. It includes the number of variables such as unit price variation testament and test per rep. Here price headwinds in the third quarter remain less than 100 basis points. While price fluctuations can vary from quarter to quarter, we continue to expect that unit price headwinds will remain moderate through the final quarter of 2017 and consistent with the last several quarters. Beyond unit price and the impact of growth in our PLS partnerships, other mix elements including test mix contributed to the slightly more than the positive 100 to 200 basis point trend we've observed for several quarters. Reported operating income for the quarter was $298 million or 15.5% of revenues compared to $322 million or 17.1% of revenues a year ago. Keep in mind, our reported operating income in 2016 included a gain on Escrow recovery associated with an acquisition. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $325 million or 16.8% of revenues compared to $320 million or 17% of revenues last year. We estimate the impact of hurricanes produced adjusted operating by approximately $18 million in the third quarter, which adversely impacted operating income growth by nearly six percentage points. Excluding the impact of the hurricane, adjusted operating income would have grown more than 7% and adjusted operating margin would have expanded 50 basis points year-over-year. Reported EPS was $1.15 in the quarter versus a $1.34 in the prior year period. As noted previously, our third quarter 2016 results included a gain on Escrow recovery associated with an acquisition. Adjusted EPS was $1.39 up 2% from a $1.37 last year. We estimate the impact of hurricanes in the third quarter reduced adjusted EPS by approximately $0.08 or nearly 6%. The company recorded net after-tax charges totaling $20 million in the third quarter or $0.14 per diluted share, representing system conversion, restructuring, integration and other one-time costs. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was approximately 36% versus 33% last year. Last year's rate benefitted from the previously mentioned Escrow recovery, which was nontaxable. In the quarter, we recorded approximately $7 million or $0.04 per diluted share of excess tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation or SBC compared to $3 million or $0.02 per share benefit last year. Year-to-date we've reported $36 million or $0.25 per share of excess tax benefits associated with SBC, which is an increase of $0.20 year-over-year. Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 4% flat versus last year and 20 basis points lower versus the prior quarter. Turning to cash provided by operations, we generated $852 million in 2017 year-to-date versus $765 million last year. Capital expenditures year-to-date were $170 million compared to $165 million a year ago. Now turning to guidance, we are providing the following updated outlook for 2017. Revenue is now expected to be approximately $7.71 billion, an increase of about 2.6% versus the prior year on a reported basis and an increase of about 3% on an equivalent basis. Reported EPS to be between $4.87 and $4.92 and adjusted EPS to be between $5.62 and $5.67. Cash provided by operations remains at approximately $1.2 million and finally capital expenditures remain between $250 million and $300 million. Despite the impact of recent hurricanes, our full year revenue guidance is in line with our prior outlook and operating cash flow guidance remains unchanged. Our updated EPS guidance reflects the approximate $0.08 hurricane impact noted previously, the impact from recently closed acquisitions, a $0.02 year-over-year increase of excess tax benefits associated with SBC recorded in the third quarter and a small but ongoing impact from hurricane Maria on our quarterly cooperation in the fourth quarter. It's also important to remember that despite these headwinds just mentioned, our updated guidance is in line with or exceeding the outlook we provided to you at the beginning of 2017. While we aren\u2019t prepared to providing 2018 guidance at this time, we want to remind you that we do not expect the same levels of excess tax benefits associated with SBC in 2017 to recurrent next year. Therefore, as you think about 2018, we would encourage you to focus on our 2017 EPS guidance, excluding the $0.20 year-over-year increase of excess tax benefits associated with SBC and assume the same $0.06 we saw in 2016 as a jump-off point for 2018. Finally, I'd like to make a few comments on our long-term outlook, which we had reaffirmed today. Recall at 2016 Investor Day, we provided a long-term outlook from 2017 through 2020, which included a revenue CAGR of 3% to 5% with 1% to 2% growth expected from acquisitions. It also included an adjusted earnings CAGR faster than revenue in the mid to high single-digit range. Note that this earnings outlook contemplated a starting point of $5.15 and adjusted EPS in 2016 and did not include any tax benefits associated with SBC beyond the base level of $0.06 recorded in 2016. This outlook implies adjusted EPS in the range of $6 to $7 by 2020, excluding the impact of excess tax benefits associated with SBC. With regard to PAMA, the cost in the current proposed fee schedule are deeper than expected. If the proposed fee schedule is finalized as its currently stated, we remain confident that we can achieve our long-term outlook, while our earnings outlook is more likely to be at the lower end of the range we provided. That said, M&A activity beyond our 1% to 2% growth target represents potential update to this outlook. Now let me turn it back to Steve. Steve Rusckowski : Thanks Mark. We've summarized a very busy and productive quarter we turned in another strong quarter and are delivering on all five elements of our strategy to accelerate growth. Our updated guidance for our full-year 2017 reflects the impact of hurricanes in the third quarter, which impacted geographies where we have a large presence as well as the impact of recently closed acquisitions. And then finally, we remain confident in our ability to meet the long-term commitments outlined at our 2016 Investor Day. Now we'd be happy to take any of your questions, operator? Operator : Thank you. We will now open it up to questions. [Operator instructions] Our first question is from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Isaac Ro : Good morning, guys. Thank you. Steve Rusckowski : Hey Isaac. Isaac Ro : Hey Steve. So, both questions I had for you were longer term in nature if I may. First one had to do with market share. If we assume that you're not able to convince the regulators to push back timing of implementation, could you talk a little bit about how quickly you think the marketplace will start to react to the new pricing reality and what does that mean for your ability to start trying to take some market share in the next six to 12 months? Steve Rusckowski : Yeah thanks Isaac. Well first of all we've been in the consolidation mode as far as our strategy for the past five years, a significant part of our growth strategy is to get that 1% to 2% of growth through acquisition. What you see from us this quarter is we announced two acquisitions, puts us in that range of 1% to 2% for 2017 and while we said that puts us in a very good place for 2018. So, our acquisition strategy continues to be part of our consolidation strategy. We continue to see interest in companies or laboratories looking at their strategic options and so we believe that's still a good part of our strategy. And then secondly, is we're confident that our guide proposition in the marketplace is really second to none. Our value of how we deliver our services is very strong in the marketplace from a quality and our service. You couple that with what we're doing on our consumer strategy. I mentioned in my prepared remarks about the convenience of what we're doing moving around our enablement of the whole process and are our better and better access for the consumer. Our value proposition of the marketplace is quite strong. And so, I also mentioned Isaac is that payers are taking notice to that and if you look at our assets today through our health plan relationships, it's really much stronger than what we've had in the past that will continue to build and as we get that better access we health insurance companies, we will continue to grow faster than the market place, both through acquisitions and organically. So, tracking well with our plan to accelerate growth and we believe that that is the right strategy for us going into the future. So, thanks for the question. Isaac Ro : Okay. Thanks. And just as a follow-up on I think Mark's comment at the end around long-term guidance and if I go back to your 2015 Analyst Day you talked about EPS growth in the mid-to-high single digits, you're staying with the current outlook maybe more towards the lower end of the range. Could you articulate how much of that you think will come from M&A versus organically and just trying to understand the importance of M&A in achieving that new outlook, thank you. Steve Rusckowski : Sure Isaac. So, I was qualifying that we would be in the lower end if PAMA moved forward under the currently proposed fee schedule. So obviously while the things we've shared we're trying to influence that. So, at this point we're not locked into that. What we're saying is that would be the likely outcome or the cost to be a significant or seeing in the original proposal, but we're obviously commenting on that and there is still some more work to be done to see where that settles down. So, I wouldn't say at this point we're signaling the lower end. We're just saying there is significant impact and impairment while we certainly contemplated that with that outlook in November of 2016. That's why we gave a range. This is in the high end of what we might have expected coming our CMS. So, I would not lock into that at this point. In terms of M&A other than the deal that we have already executed, do not have any earnings projections that are based on future M&A. Certainly in our revenue, we've talked about getting 1% to 2%, but we all know that it takes a period of time generally 12 to 18 months before you get to a run rate level of earnings contribution. So, in that mid to high single digits, so I am not counting on significant contributions from unexecuted M&A on the bottom line only on the revenue side. Operator : Our next question is from Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum. You line is open. Kevin Ellich : Good morning. Thanks guys. Steve Rusckowski : Hey Kevin. Kevin Ellich : I guess I want to go back to PAMA, in the press release you talked about exploring every option in terms of you guys and the lab industry exploring every option to make sure Medicare beneficiaries have access to lab services. What options do you have I guess on top of that more importantly, if PAMA is implemented as written, what impact you think that'll have on commercial rates going forward? Steve Rusckowski : Sure. I'll take this. The first part of that question I'll give to Mark for the second part. So, we're actively working this and we've been working on it for years as we talked about. We've people engaged with the CMS on the implementation PAMA in the quarter and the principles of that we don't disagree which is market-based pricing for the refresh of the fee schedule. But while we've been helping them was but unfortunately, we think with what we've the draft rates they got wrong. We've been helping with the implementation of gathering the data to make sure the data is correct and then working through the competition of the data to establish new rates. So, we've hard at work with them three years, but I'll share with you since we got the draft rates we have provided them feedback on where we see -- where we have questions or where we see some issues with what we see so far with the draft rates and so they listen to that and that's the first part of how we're engaging in this. Second is before we saw the draft rates and now since we see the draft rates for all over our congressional leaders to make sure they understand the difference of what CMS has proposed from those rates versus what the intention was with PAMA and we feel good about the receptivity of that and also, we've been engaged with the administration on that as well. So, hitting all branches of government and that we're very active. We'll cement our formal covenants of the trade association and I'll say trade association all partners and all members of the trade association were actively engaged in that and that will go in before the deadline, which is October 23. I'll also tell you that other trade associations are deeply engaged in this. The device trade association appalment is deeply engaged in this. The smaller laboratories are engaged, the American Hospital Association, American Medical Association, I said that in my comments are deeply engaged and so we have a lot of support broadly, and then also employees are deeply engaged. We have grassroots, mailings going into congressmen and women and centers throughout all the different states telling and urging CMS that they need to take the time to get it right. So that's happening. We'll see what CMS does with this feedback. The schedule says the world then people comments into consideration and to give us the final rates in November, we'll see. They could decide to take the time to get it right and to like the implementation. We're not sure whether they will or will not do that. If they go forward with the rates, we'll see what that means and what the comments to take into consideration and then we would need to consider legislative action depending upon what we see there with the help of the Congress members that we have been speaking to. And then also what we're looking at two of the trade association is what legal alternatives we might have in the event that they go forward with final rates that clearly do not represent the congressional intent of PAMA. So that's what we mean by exploring all options and as you could tell from my commentary we're all over this and I'm not along to get a lot of help from my colleagues in the trade association. So, I feel very good about the effort we're putting into this and CMS is hearing loud and clear that we believe that long and they need to take the time to get it right. So, Mark, do you want to talk about commercial rates? Mark Guinan : So, Kevin, so couple things. First off as we shared previously, we had very little of our commercial contracts revenue tied to floating rates. We've been cleaning that over the last couple years in anticipation for some reductions in MAA. So, it's a very small portion and we very soon not have any contracts that are in any way floating an index MAA. In terms of predicting the future, it's always hard to predict the future, but I can assure you that in the conversations with the large payers recently, they understand the significant impact of those trends in industry and certainly to us and they actually have entity for that, so versus it being an opportunity to take advantage of that and the messaging being we want to keep this ratio to Medicare. Of course, the conversation as you understand the intent of this is to incorporate commercial rates and Medicare rates. So that is an impossibility. So, at the end of the day, you're going to be basically in the same curve as the Medicare rates and given the significant impact and the fact that largely they agree with our premise that we are part of the solution on laboratory spending and pay significantly more to other providers of laboratory diagnostic and patient services. And also, were a part of the solution in terms of overall healthcare spend given the amount of influence that we have our data. Many people say one to two thirds of the other spend that we're actually all of our good guys and a good partner. So, they understand that and they you look for us to be successful and so the tenor of the discussions around price, I can assure you has not gotten worse given PAMA and certainly become neutral or got better in most cases. So, should not expect any significant commercial price erosion going forward and just to remind people, we shared before, all our labs are typically paid one and half to two times but we're paying and then hospital laboratories are often 2.5 times or more the same rate. So, I would expect some evolution in that over time as opposed to looking for credit concessions from the independent national labs. Kevin Ellich : Great. And then just really quickly, Steve any thoughts on the utilization environment and organic volume trends? Steve Rusckowski : Sure. Look what we've said in the past we'll say this quarter again, we feel stable. We look at all the different indications in the marketplace and overall if you look at the amount of healthcare people are using in this country and what we see from our established accounts, we feel stable. We feel good about our organic revenue growth in the quarter. We do look at to the effect that the larger storms over the third quarter had on us and we adjust for that. We actually feel very good about the progress we're making accelerating growth. So, we're making progress in a stable marketplace to accelerate growth. Kevin Ellich : Great. Thanks guys. Steve Rusckowski : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is open. Jack Meehan : Hi. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Steve Rusckowski : Good morning, Jack. Jack Meehan : Mark, I wanted to drill little bit more into your commentary on the commercial pricing environment. Obviously, there's a negotiation of national payer contracts underway. Could you just give an update on your philosophy and those negotiations on price versus value proposition, versus network access and to your comments, you just gave as a low-cost provider, do you think you could actually push on commercial prices and offset if PAMA hold? Steve Rusckowski : Well, yes Jack of course that's our strategy is to push to two-way negotiation. So, at this point, I am not going to speculate our -- I promise where that could end up, but yeah, that is the position that we're taking and you already have excellent rates and there are other people whose services arguably are little better in some cases are as good as we're providing given the fact that for example we provide all of our data to the payers and quite often they don't get the data from other people to provide laboratory services within their network. So that's one argument actually to get a better product. And then some of the things that Steve walked through in terms of the consumer experience that resonates because they're understanding that the outside customer which are your members and when they compete with other health plans there is certainly some value beyond the result of laboratory tests and the services that they provide and it can positively differentiate them if they bring some partner and work with us and see some of the value that we bring and the other providers don't. So that's part of our value proposition that we're discussing with them and I can assure you that over the last couple years we have gotten rate increases with some contracts given our value proposition explanation and that comes part and parcel with what I would call it try spirit of partnership whereas I said earlier, they see what part of the solution. So, the more they can field work to us, the better from some of those higher cost providers who arguably don't have good value given the service they provide, the better they're going to be and the more they're going to solve their laboratory spend. And as I said earlier appropriately drive the use of that data for other healthcare cost. So, I feel really good about the relationships that we've been building and any time of course there is everybody wants to maximize value in their side of the equation. But I think as I said earlier, the tenure of the discussions and the lot more in the spirit of partnerships with the health plan and there are more of more seeing us as part of the solution and that's what's going to help us to defend the value of the price that we offer today and into the future. Jack Meehan : Great. And then if PAMA holds, would you push harder on cost savings in 2018? At that point I would be curious you had any updates on regional consolidation of the footprint and then just auto adjudication rollout to payers? Steve Rusckowski : Yeah. So, we continue to drive on an invigorate despite PAMA and what we've shared and this has been our philosophy for filing out years that we need to continue to get better in what we do and better probably the both in quality and the service as well as efficiency. And as you see in our results we continue to get more efficient and we feel about tracking to that $1.3 billion goal. And if you recall in 2016 Investor Day, we said we're not done yet. So, we got a lot more in front of us. We provided some visibility in color to that in 2016. So, we see more beyond the $1.3 billion and so we were anticipating that there might be some more price pressure going into '18 and '19. So, what you see implied in our guidance is the continuation of invigorate test what we'll do this year and into 2018 along with just driving productivity in general. And when you go through the math based upon what we have said, obviously we feel strong. We've had the convenience of the outlook that we provided in our Investor Day in 2016 because we've been working so hard for years. It's not a new program we're going to the continuation of the existing program and we have more efficiency to get out of this organization. Jack Meehan : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Nicholas Jansen with Raymond James and Associates. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : Hey Nick. Nicholas Jansen : Hey guys. Good morning. Just two questions for me. First just wanted to dig a little bit deeper into margin trends and expectations as we think about PAMA being rolled out over the next two years. Certainly, you're showcasing very nice progress in 2017 on margins, I think up 50 basis points in the most recent quarter ex hurricane. So just wanted to get your sense is 2017 peak margin year and how we think about if you analyze the next three years, how much does margin degrade associated with PAMA, thanks? Mark Guinan : Yeah Nick, so thanks for the question. The outlook that we gave is a CAGR. So that will be put as a CAGR. So, it's not year-to-year, we're not until we see some variability especially depending the way some of the PAMA cuts get rolled out. But with that said what we've committed to is growing earnings faster than revenues. So, by definition that we says that we expect to expand margins. So, then it may not be every quarter, it may not be every single year in the period year-over-year, but over the next several years we're looking for continued margin expansion because we're committed to growing our earnings faster now. Nicholas Jansen : And just a clarification on that regarding the structure of PAMA, does that mean -- my understanding is that 2019 would be a worse year than 2018 as we think about the size of the headwind. Is that the right understanding? Steve Rusckowski : The honest answer this point is I don't know because there are still so many things up in the air regarding how they're going to imply some of their rules and in pricing practices and without getting into too much detail because it's very complicated. But just in summary a lot of the billings to Medicare are panels and the way Medicare pays panel is very, very complicated and the more analyzing the panels, the more it impacts the overall price and it's not the positive fashion. So, they already have historically deviated from what people who are close to the industry might not understand which is you don't get in a way for every single analyze unless you start putting things together in a panel. So, the question we have is how our panels get paid and how we price which is the course to market because in many cases there is not a comparable code within the commercial world with a very, very complicated issue that we're trying to sort through and that's why even if at this point we were in a position to know and really interested in sharing the estimate by year, I don't have that answer. So still more to come. So, I would say at this point, do not assume that '19 is worse than '18 and vice versa. We will tell you as soon as we have people understanding to provide you some reliable information. Nicholas Jansen : That's very helpful and then just one quick -- just a numbers question. I understand the tax dynamics the stock-based compensation benefit you're seeing this year. Any way you can just share what we should be plugging in for '18? Is it kind of the 35 to 37 range, just wanted to get a sense of how we should be modeling tax specifically in '18, thanks. Mark Guinan : Yeah so, I am sure you understand that, what drives that is a couple of factors. As long as the share price is higher than it was at the time of the brand of the equity and that you're going to seek in some value. So certainly, when you see a year like 2017 where we had significant stock appreciation that was versus previous years that was driving a lot of this benefit. The other thing is option exercises, which of course we can't predict. So, we're investing performance shares investing that will drive some level of benefit consistently assuming that the stock price continues to appreciate to some degree, but we can't predict the timing of the option exercises, which is a huge variable. So, what I will say is the sixth sense that we shared when we say the base level assuming that the stock is stable and continues to go up to some degree that is pretty reliable but that's kind of be there, but the large swing is beyond that will be highly dependent on appreciation of the stock movement and the amount of option exercises and that's what we can't predict. So, I would say sixth sense and we'll continue to update if that change is kind of a base level you should consistently expect and anything beyond that is dependent on those other factors. Nicholas Jansen : Thanks for all the detail guys. Operator : Our next question is from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Bill Quirk : Good morning, everybody. Steve Rusckowski : Hey Bill. Good morning. Bill Quirk : So, you addressed the commercial rate in Medicare relationship with respect to Kevin's question. I was hoping you could comment on the percent of Medicaid business that's tied into Medicare rates and how you're thinking that -- thinking about that rather over the next couple of years assuming that PAMA goes into effect? Steve Rusckowski : So, the best of our understanding, Medicaid rates are not largely tied in terms of being an index in terms of a mechanistic fashion. Certainly, they look at Medicare rates to make sense and the states set those rates. But it doesn\u2019t look like there is a formulaic relationship in most cases again to the best of our understanding and we've looked at this pretty deeply and will automatically trigger changes in Medicaid. So that's going to be pretty much up to the states. And again, reminding you only about 2% or 3% of our revenues are paid by traditional Medicaid fee for service. A lot of the Medicaid are removed to management and the one thing that it won't say is that there are rules around the fact that Medicaid cannot pay more than Medicare. So, in any case where there is a state Medicaid rate where the fee for service is close to Medicaid and there is a Medicare reduction, you will see a reduction to ensure that Medicaid is not higher than Medicare. But beyond that at this point still more to learn, but I would not expect this will trigger significant reductions in state Medicaid rate and again given the small portion of our revenue that comes from 3% Medicaid, I wouldn't expect it to be a major headwind for us. Bill Quirk : Okay. No, I appreciate the color around that, thank you. And then just separately can you guys comment on I guess the consumer outreach programs that you have with Safeway and Walmart and help us think a little bit about the relative profitability of those as compared to say your traditional draw station and traditional diagnostics business, thanks? Steve Rusckowski : Yeah Bill thanks. It's our consumer strategy and I outlined the five elements of our growth strategy one of which is to be most consumer oriented laboratory and there are multiple facets as far as that is concerned. One is we're putting a lot of work and e-enabling our whole consumer process and we're talking about e-check-in. So, moving really our experience that we have our consumers to contemporary experiences that people experience in the consumer world. Making a lot of progress there. The feedback is great. It helps patients. It helps our employees and as I mentioned, our healthcare insurance partners feel great about their experience as well because they're working on that. The second is around information. We got MyQuest, we have 4.5 million users, which is a phenomenal number given that we only brought this to the marketplace in a little over two years. So, it's just picking up the volume of users that we have and we put more and more content around that and also want people to navigate into our whole experience through MyQuest, which is a nice consumer touch if you will. The third is around products. We see a lot more from us and we have direct to consumer testing. We mentioned we tested this in our marketplace last year. We're bringing this into Missouri and Colorado. We're actually are encouraged by some of the early returns that consumers are interested in paying out of pocket from their own ordered diagnostic test. It could be cholesterol, it could be hemoglobin, glucose or such are transmitted, but there is a market there and so we're going at that market. And the last place we're investing in which is what you -- and that is a bit part of your questions is what we're doing around access and I'll say access because it's important that we have access for our draw stations. And so, we're looking at how we can augment and in some place, replace our patient service centers with some of these locations at Safeway. We\u2019re making excellent progress of implementing patient service centers in those Safeway stores and also relationship with Walmart. And so, we will open some centers in Walmart in Florida and Texas this year. And so, what they have allowed to do is by zip code is look at where we have access points and in some cases, we can consolidate what we have in those stores. And that allows us to get more efficiency in some cases around the real estate cost but also around phlebotomist productivity. The biggest cost of drawing is not real estate it\u2019s the labor, it\u2019s a phlebotomist. So, if we can have more density of phlebotomists in better locations and convenient locations that serve the consumer better, better off we\u2019re go to be. Remember a lot of our patient service centers even though we have unparalleled access the 2,200 patient service centers and we have over 3500 phlebotomists in physician\u2019s offices so close to 6,000 access points. Our medical office buildings and these are not nearly as convenient locations is where you'll find a Safeway store and where if you find a Walmart with big wide-open parking lots, easy access to the store and ability to do some shopping and other activities around that experience. So, we\u2019re quite encouraged. We think we\u2019re on the track again as we talked earlier, our value proposition to the healthcare value proposition is we want to be the most consumer-oriented laboratory. And we think our value proposition is getting stronger and stronger every day because we\u2019re focused on this. So, we're making a lot of good progress. Operator, next question. Operator : Our next question is from Ralph Jacoby with Citi. Your line is open. Ralph Jacoby : Thanks. Good morning. Steve Rusckowski : Good morning, Ralph. Ralph Jacoby : Hi, just wanted to understand and clarify the jumping off point for 2017, the midpoint of guide I guess is $5.65, we\u2019ve got the $0.10 from the hurricane, so it\u2019s $5.75. We take out the $0.20 for the tax benefit we're at $5.55 and then ex panel we essentially grow that mid to high single digits, is that -- just want to make sure if that\u2019s right? Mark Guinan : Yeah, so the jumping off point shouldn\u2019t be adjusted for the hurricane, but you may argue that the year-over-year growth compare is easier given the fact that we had hurricanes in 2017. So, the jumping off point you're right takes the midpoint of our guidance and take out the $0.20 and that's out of the way we are thinking our starting point given that at this point we would project only $0.06 of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. And that\u2019s how we would build our initial plan for 2018 and certainly taking into account that the hurricane impact this year, that can give us an easier compare to next year. Ralph Jacoby : Okay. That\u2019s fair and then the -- that\u2019s in the same context as the $6 to $7 number by 2020 right. So that's off that baseline that\u2019s how we should be thinking about $6 to $7 for 2020? Steve Rusckowski : Exactly. Not off the guidance that\u2019s includes the $0.20 excess with stock-based comp around. Ralph Jacoby : Okay. All right that\u2019s helpful. And then I guess any help you can give on sort of based on your current mix. Can you give us the impact of the PAMA cuts for 2018, 2019 and 2020? Steve Rusckowski : No as I said earlier \u2013 maybe wasn\u2019t as clear as I intended to be given that there are so many things that have to be sorted out. So many unanswered questions we're still trying to figure out obviously looked at it deeply and we have a huge range of potential outcomes depending on the answers to some of those questions. So, it would not be helpful at this point to share that information as I said in a minute we expect to get more clarity in the not too distant future as soon as we're in a position to share something we\u2019ll certainly do so. Ralph Jacoby : Okay. And then just\u2026 Mark Guinan : With that said we obviously have reconfirmed our views on outlook and the view outlook took into consideration what we saw in the draft rates. And so, our feedback to CMS is that there is a lot of areas that we think they got wrong and therefore we think the rates are too low. So, we think as we contemplate what we just shared with you this morning we are confident we feel with those outlook despite what might happen or not happen given our dialogue with CMS. Ralph Jacoby : Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then just last one, can you give us a sense of multiples you\u2019re paying for deals and maybe how you approach a purchase price just given what likely maybe a lower future earnings stream from whatever you\u2019re acquiring given PAMA? Thanks. Mark Guinan : Sure. We've shared that we have very robust specific metrics around evaluating our deals that involves a return to invested capital metric where it would be accretive by the third year relative to our plan of record and we have a plan of record based on our performance shares. So, every year we put forward our forecast for our return on invested capital for the base business and half of our performance shares our based on that. So, we need to do deal that are accretive to do that by the third year. And we have also have an MPV metric and obviously the MPV level that needs to be exceeded before you will consummate a deal. So, the multiple question is a tough one because their P&L generally has no relationship to our P&L as I shared at the Investor Day. I went through actually Strawman example and in most cases, it\u2019s not all of their revenues are higher than ours. When the business becomes part question, we get paid at the rates at which we negotiated, but the cost structure is so dramatically different than despite that revenue and synergies, we still significantly make more margin typically then the individual. So, taking a multiple of their P&L really does not make any sense as we shared the revenue multiple look like -- they look a great deal based on when it was in their hands and the earnings multiples, or EBITDA multiples look like we way overpaid it, but it's really not meaningful. If you look at our pro forma, you would see multiples that are the opposite, which says based on the earnings it was good and based on the revenue maybe you paid a little bit too much, but we cannot pay significantly more than our current enterprise multiple because by definition the math doesn\u2019t work and then we\u2019re not able to hit that rolling target. So, when we actually use return on invested capital, not our cost of capital, which some other companies use to evaluate deals so in fact we have a risk premium built into our MPV and built into our return expectations that we think make sense that's good for our shareholders. Ralph Jacoby : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Amanda Murphy with William Blair. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : Hey Amanda. Amanda Murphy : Hey. How are you good morning? Steve Rusckowski : Good. Amanda Murphy : Just a quick question on the long-term outlook and obviously there has been discussion around contract renewals repair perspective and I think you gave some perspective there just in terms of pricing over the long-term but I just wanted to clarify in terms of the long-term outlook how you're thinking about some of the major contract changes are you including any assumptions there. And then also just thinking about capital deployment in terms of share buybacks can just help us think about how you're thinking about that over the long-term specially given PAMA? Thanks. Steve Rusckowski : Yes, so let me start the contracting. We obviously want to have the best access as possible and I said in my earlier comments that we should really good about our growing access and it\u2019s helping us accelerate in growth and that continues to be our strategy going forward as you are aware one of the nationals that we don't have our preferred relationship is united what we shared in the past we know that contract expires in 2018 with our nearest competitor. And as we said we would like to be on contract with United and our relationship continues to be strong in building so we did contemplate in our outlook is growing capability for us to have many of your insurances also on network then what we currently enjoy. And so that is contemplated in outlook and Mark second part of the question. Mark Guinan : So, Amanda we\u2019re going to stick with our capital deployment strategy in terms of earnings growth being low to actually mid to high single-digit that is earnings that\u2019s not earnings per share so does contemplate significant buybacks two step earnings-per-share as well as earnings from cash And so, we will continue our strategy which says in the near-term accretive opportunities that used of that cash to do M&A that will be a priority once we satisfy that majority of free cash flow back to our shareholders as we\u2019ve talked about before the dividend gets a long way towards that objective and use of supplemental share buybacks to get at least to 50%. Our free cash flow again with the other 50% of our free cash flow will be opportunity dependent if we have M&A that will be the preference and if we don't have M&A then that is a better use of cash and we will buy back more shares. But at this point the outlook does not include a reduction in our way so to get to higher levels of earnings. The growth rate that I share at the CAGR is real earnings. Amanda Murphy : Got it. And then just one quick follow-up, I think Jack has done some good work in terms of looking at the regional dynamics of PAMA in the first year just given that we're going to switch from a regional to more of a national schedule. So, I don't know if you've been able to look at that yet and if there is any mitigation there for you guys and based on your mix I know early in terms of the data but just looking for some insights into maybe what the first share might look like relative to the reported rate for you? Steve Rusckowski : You're correct. That is a mitigation and any sort of price declines from the NOA because there are some reasons that we're already paying less than NOA. So, by definition there's less of a decrease at least in the first year depending on what the overall cuts might be over a multiyear period. And actually, on that note that is the issue with the panel. So, in the case of any of the panels, if you added up the individual components in there NOA, we've not been getting paid that total amount. So that would also be a mitigation assuming that they don't change into some sort of other methodology. So that's what makes it a little bit complicated, but I did want to acknowledge that if you just look at the fee schedule and tried to say okay if the Medicare revenues are X and it looks like and this isn\u2019t the case. Every code was reduced by 10% if I can do the math. Now it's a lot more complicated than that because in most cases, we're not getting paid NOA for the work that we do for Medicare. Amanda Murphy : Got it. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question is from Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : Good morning, Ann. Ann Hynes : Good morning. So, I don't want to beat the dead horse. So, I am just going to go back to that $6 to $7 answer to 2020. So, I just want to clarify what's included and what's not. So, it includes the proposed rates for PAMA as stated in the rule and it includes only 1% to 2% M&A annually. It includes an increase in your cost entry program, and if it does can you tell us exactly how much just for modeling purposes? It includes some share revolve but not a lot and then whether UNH contract if you're not let in it, I mean I'm assuming that if it's in you have some type of visibility and if it's not, can you let us know the downside risk, thanks? Mark Guinan : So, let me clarify so on the efficiency program, I wouldn't model in a significant change from what we've been doing. I think Steve said that there is more to be done and then certainly we'll continue to deliver significant efficiencies, so that's part and parcel with the outlook that we gave. Now with that said of course depending on the PAMA outcome, the timing of it and how severe it is, we're going to do what we need to do. So, we're going to get to that outlook. We have enough levers to pull that we're very comfortable and we're not reaffirming the outlook if weren\u2019t confident that we have the ability to do that despite where PAMA might come out. And certainly, in this case, where we have the plan and it contemplates the worst-case scenario which is what they proposed. And then in terms about the share buybacks. So, there will be some share buybacks, but I think a lot of that is really just to prevent dilution given our equity program. So, I wouldn't assume that any reduction in ways. So that is not in my outlook for this point. As I said again that growth is in earnings. And therefore, at this point given all other factors you should assume that earnings per share for both earnings and then depending on that's where to create value that could vary because we get more M&A and because we do more share buybacks. And yes, the 1% to 2% is what we're counting on, but while we're signaling back to it's original question is we think although we've been doing consolidation, this could be a trigger for acceleration in the consolidation. So, we are just knowing that there could be an opportunity for an acceleration and for more M&A but I'm not modeling that in the outlook at this point. Ann Hynes : Okay. And then the UNH question, so I'm assuming if you include in the guidance you have some type of visibility, and if you don't, can you just maybe give us some visibility what the downside will be? Steve Rusckowski : Ann, my commentary was that we're working on it, but it's the current status quo is whether it stayed that way or not. We still feel confident with our outlook. Okay. So that's the way you should think about it is your current access is getting stronger. We are working to get it even stronger but our outlook contemplates staying where we are as well. Ann Hynes : Okay. And then with PAMA in Washington, I appreciate all the efforts that you guys have done that you talking to Congressional people. You're commenting to CMS, but I feel like all of that was done beforehand. What do you think can change? Do you think CMS just wanted the common period? Do they need that to make a change? So, I am just trying to figure out like what would change in two months? Steve Rusckowski : The big change let me give you a little color around this. So, when we went off around and talked to our members of Congress and Southerners and the administration, we explained our concern but it was a concern without a lot of facts and a lot of our stakeholders said well, I understand, but let's see what the data says. And so many of them were waiting for these draft rates. And so, the good news is the draft rates are out and the draft rates are severely flawed with the amount of data that was collected a very small percentage that is 1% with a lot of the data coming from ourselves, so the majority of the rates are based upon the large nationals and that was not the congressional intent. So, the data being out there and is helping us now get more momentum with our stakeholders to say well okay what these guys have been talking about before we have addressed, they were right, they really got along and their message around taking time to get it right we now understand. Now the question is what do we do about that. So strange way the draft rates have been helpful to move the dialogue along. Mark Guinan : And one example, Ann, is the OIG in some of the reports over a month ago have said based on the definition of the applicable lab they were expecting about 5% of the labs, but close to 70% of the volume to be reflected. As you heard us say today only 1% of the labs actually ended up submitting for various reasons. So back to Steve's point around okay, I get your concerns, but we'll see where it comes out, certainly those kind of facts are weighing in the conversations we're having right now. Steve Rusckowski : And the vast majority of the data they're looking after these drafts from the large laboratories and we know from Medicare data that roughly 50% of what they buy is laboratory services from hospital at which laboratories as well as physician office labs. And from the two large nationals, it's only 20% of their purchases roughly. So, the sampling is flawed and they need to take the time to get it right and the whole philosophy of PAMA is to make sure that they look at this different cost of served issue in this industry to make sure they're paying market based rates and those market base rates are not the rates of large nationals that generally have the density of large centers. Ann Hynes : Okay. Great. Thank you. Steve Rusckowski : Thank you, Ann. Operator : Our last question is from Lisa Gill with JPMC. Your line is open. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much for taking my question. I just had a question, Steve, you talked a little bit about United and potentially opening that out from the preferred relationship they have today. Would you anticipate that the same would happen with your Aetna relationship that time? Do you think that as you think about the world if you know that may believe preferred relationships don't work quite the way that they were intended back when they were assigned in the mid-2000s? Just how do we think about that dynamic one? And then two, if United has opened up, my assumption would be that you're probably getting some rates today that were non-network rates and so they would potentially be higher. Are you thinking that the volumes help to offset that when you're thinking about this, the equation of getting to that $6 to $7 in 2020? Steve Rusckowski : Well first of all, in Aetna our relationship continues to be strong. Yes, we have preferred national relationship and we haven\u2019t commented where we'll continue or not, but we do have one extended contract, which we feel good about and we've secured. And second, as far as our philosophy with all of your insurance companies, we do believe that it is good to have a smaller network and frankly given our value proposition, we actually like those contracts where we are on contract with other nationals, where we have the opportunity to compete for the business because when we do compete for the business, we do quite well. So philosophically and strategically that's the position we've taken and as you see three out of the five nationals do have both their competitor on par and we feel good about those relationships as there is a different approach. We feel great about that relationship and we're working with United. All of those supplies have different relationships and I'll remind you we spend a lot of time talking multinationals but a large part of our business is not with the nationals. We have a lot of regionals. We have hundreds of contracts and those contracts continue to provide great access for us as well. So, Lisa just to clear, yes, our network rates are higher and in some cases significantly higher than the network rates, but there is also some supplies that don't have that network benefit, typically they're falling short. So, we don't get paid quite the premium being out of network that some people might think because there's some work we receive that we do basically for free because we don't get paid for those full insurance. So, if we get any network in a plan where we're on a network, there is countervailing forces. One is the network rate obviously typically is lower than the other network rates but then for the supplies that didn't have that benefits we actually get paid. So, there will be certainly some pricing headwind offset by what we will consider to be significant volume increase for any time we get into a network where we were previously out of network, but it's not as large a price headwind that some people might come to surface. Lisa Gill : Okay. And then Mark, if I could just ask one question, I know everything said about the future is not about the quarter, but I just want to understand two things, one would be around the pricing environment obviously pricing coming in a little stronger. Is that just a mix element or is there something else going on there would be first and then just second on the nonclinical down 4%, we expect it will be down around 2%. Is there anything else there that's worth calling out from a quarter perspective? Mark Guinan : Sure. So, as I shared in the prepared remarks, pricing continues to be less and on a apples-and-apples price and then we've also shared in the past that there was any mix element that suppresses revenue correct from our PLS business. So really when you look at the revenue per rep, it's the positive mix that we've experienced pretty consistently for several quarters, which is around the tax mix and then also then to the acquisitions where we tend to consistently have been growing our test per rep ratio. So those are the drivers. The other mix elements have been favorable more of our advanced diagnostic testing and then more test per acquisition have all set the negative mix impact of PLS on revenue per rep. When you look at the diagnostic services business, it's largely our risk assessment businesses. There is a couple of other things in there, but that's a big driver. That is the work we do for individuals who are looking to secure life insurance policies and in front of that is how independent on the industry itself and the number of policies that are being written and recently that's a little softer. So, it has nothing to do with the competitive environment per se losing the competition really have to do with the market and the market has slowed in full recently. Lisa Gill : Okay. Great. Thank you. Steve Rusckowski : Okay. So, thanks again for joining us today. As we've said, we had another strong quarter in the third quarter 2017. We look forward to make our commitments and executing our two-point strategy of accelerating growth and driving operational excellence. We thank you for your continued support and have a great day.

I'd now like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Executive Director of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead, please. Shawn Bevec : Thank you, and good morning. I am here with Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and will discuss non-GAAP measures. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS, and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization expense. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K. This quarter we have included a 2018 adjusted EPS bridge on the Investor Relations page of our Web site. The text of our prepared remarks will be available on the site later today. Now here's Steve Rusckowski. Steve Rusckowski : Thanks, Shawn, and thanks everyone for joining us today. This morning I'll provide you highlights for the fourth quarter and full-year 2017, and review progress on our strategy. And then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through our 2018 guidance. Well, we finished the year on a high note by delivering a strong fourth quarter. Revenues grew 4%. Reported EPS grew 67%, and adjusted EPS grew nearly 7%. For the full-year 2017, revenues were up 2.6% on a reported basis, and up 2.9% on an equivalent basis versus 2016. EPS was up 22% on a reported basis, and more than 10% on an adjusted basis. Cash provided by operations was up by nearly 10% from 2016. 2017 was a good year. I'm pleased to announce we are increasing our quarterly dividend by 11%. This is the seventh increase since 2011. Before I describe the progress we have made, what I would like to do is to talk about two dynamics impacting our industry, PAMA and Tax Reform. PAMA represents a significant headwind. In November, we said that we expect the impact of the final rates on the PAMA to be approximately 4% of our revenues from the clinical IP schedule in 2018, and approximately 10% in both 2019 and 2020. As you know, in December, we fully supported ACLA's lawsuits charging that incentives from Medicare and Medicaid services, failed to follow our congressional directive to implement a market-based laboratory payment system, and we believe we could have a decision from the judge by midyear. In the meantime, our trade association will continue to work with Congress to secure a legislative solution. Now turning to tax reform, Quest is a significant beneficiary of lower corporate tax rates, which will enable us to grow earnings per share invested in our business and our people. We will realize approximately $180 million in tax savings on an adjusted basis in 2018. With those tax savings, we are reinvesting roughly $75 million before tax into the business and our people. Some of these initiatives include advanced diagnostic innovations through new test, and the high touch configured services. Investments to deliver consistently excellent consumer experience both online through our MyQuest patient app, and all of our patient service centers. And then, finally we will pay a bonus of up to $500 to about 40,000 employees as the way of saying things. We're playing a vital role in our success. This bonus will be based on the company's performance and accelerating growth in 2018. Now turning to the progress we made in the fourth quarter. We delivered on all five elements of our strategy to accelerate growth. The first outlet of our growth strategy is to grow 1% to 2% per year through strategic aligned accretive acquisitions, which we achieved for the fifth consecutive year. We had another very productive quarter for M&A. We completed our previously announced acquisitions of Cleveland HeartLab, which builds on our position and advanced diagnostics and shield medical laboratory, which will further strengthen our position in the New York metropolitan marketplace. Our M&A pipeline remains very strong, and our strategy is delivering growth. And this is evidenced by originally announced acquisition of Mobile Medical Examination Service or MedXM, a leading national provider of home-based health risk assessment and related services. Our seven announced acquisitions in 2017 will enable us to exceed our long-term M&A objective of 1% to 2% top line growth for 2018. And of course any earnings accretion realized from these acquisitions in 2018 will help offset the impact of new Medicare rates. Under the second element of our growth strategy, we continue to expand relationships with hospitals and health systems. Our professional life services revenues grew by double-digits in 2017, and delivered healthy operating margin as more hospitals benefited from the standardization, scale, and innovation that we bring to these relationships. While the new Medicare rates are headwinds for us, we also believe that rates will be a catalyst for consolidation later in 2018 and beyond as hospital systems face increasing pressure from lower Medicare rates. We've had a number of conversations with hospital C suits that indicate their increased sense of urgency about rethinking their lab strategy. We took a number of actions to deliver on the third element of our gross strategy, which is to offer the broadest access to diagnostic innovation. In women's health, we continue to be excited about the progress we are making in noninvasive prenatal screening. Our Q-Natal test enjoyed strong double-digit growth in 2017. Our contributors to growth in 2017 were prescription drug monitoring with growth in excess of 20%, QuantiFERON tuberculosis testing, Hepatitis C screening which posted double-digit growth of 2017. We also established new advanced diagnostic centers for excellence for cardiovascular testing and precision oncology in conjunction with our acquisitions of the Cleveland HeartLab and Med Fusion. We continue to make strong progress executing the fourth element of our growth strategy, which is to be the provider of choice for consumers. We opened six locations in Wal-Mart stores in 2017; five in Florida, and one in Texas. The early feedback from our patient satisfaction surveys is extremely positive. Our customers appreciate the convenience of being able to get their testing done where they shop. The ease of the check-in provided this easy enablement and the professionalism of our phlebotomists are noted in all the surveys. There is more to come in 2018 as our collaboration with Wal-Mart expands to include basic healthcare services. So we'll keep you posted on our progress. Our relationship with Safeway, which is down in second year continues to expand. We're now operating in 184 stores in 12 states. We have similar positive feedback from both our employees and our customers on their experience in these locations. We are also powering the healthcare consumer with our MyQuest mobile application, which is now delivering rapid results into the hands of nearly 5 million users. This is an increase of more than 1.3 million users in 2017. The fifth element of our growth strategy is to support population health with data analytics and extended care services. We are building a solid data analytics pipeline with a strong number of partner's interest in leveraging our data, including pharma, CRO, and health plan customers. We are very excited about our acquisition of MedXM. This will give us access to more mobile healthcare professionals, which expands our scale and reach into the mobile and home segments, as well as bolstering our overall capabilities in extended care. The second element of our two-point strategy is to drive operational excellence. I'm very pleased to that we have exceeded our $1.3 billion goal of cumulative run rate invigorate savings as we exited 2017. We will maintain our discipline in this area; continue to drive efficiency and effectiveness. Every year, we need to cover the cost of wage inflation and price compression. Given our track record of delivering in this area over many years, going forward we will provide periodic updates on our progress in lieu of a specific run rate savings growth. Quality and efficiency go hand-in-hand. And as we drive operational efficiency, we continue to prove the customer experience. More than half of our 2,200 patient service centers are live with the check-in kiosk, which improved the patient experience. By the end of the year, we expect to have that capability in all of our locations. E-check-in enables phlebotomists to spend less time on clinical tests and more time to deliver the better patient experience. Turning to our outlook, our guidance for the full-year 2018 reflects expectations for continue acceleration of top line growth of 4% to 5%, and more than 20% adjusted earnings growth, driven in part by solid mid-to-high single-digit adjusted earnings growth from operations. Now, I would like to turn it over to Mark, who will take you through our financial performance and our 2018 guidance in more detail. Mark? Mark Guinan : Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues, consolidated revenues of $1.94 billion were up 4.1% versus the prior year. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services or DIS for short grew 4.5% compared to the prior year, with approximately 210 basis points attributed to acquisitions. Volume measured by the number of requisitions, increased 2.4% versus the prior year with acquisitions contributing approximately 150 basis points in the quarter. The impact of hurricane Maria on our operations in Puerto Rico presented a headwind of approximately 20 basis points to volume in the fourth quarter. Revenue per acquisition in the fourth quarter grew by 2.1% versus the prior year. As a reminder, revenue per acq is not a proxy for price; it includes a number of variables such as unit price variation, business mix, test mix, and test per acq. Unit price headwinds remained less than 100 basis points in the fourth quarter, consistent with the trends we observed throughout 2017. Excluding the impact of PAMA, we would expect unit price headwinds in 2018 to remain less than 100 basis points, with PAMA adding an additional headwind of approximately 50 basis points on our DIS segment. After many changes to PAMA, Medicare reimbursement pressure will step-up in 2019 as we have indicated previously. Beyond unit price that we impacted growth in our POS partnerships other mix settlements including test mix was strong contributing more than 200 basis points in the quarter. This trend has remained consistent over the last couple of year. Reported operating income for the quarter was $269 million or 13.9% of revenues, compared to $276 million or 14.8% of revenues a year ago. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $317 million or 16.4% of revenues compared to 305 million or 16.4% of revenues last year. Reported EPS was a $1.82 in the quarter compared to a $1.9 a year ago. The increase is related to a net tax benefit recorded as a result of the recent tax legislation. Adjusted EPS was a $1.40 up nearly 7% from a $1.31 last year. The company recognized in ample tax net benefit totaling $74 million within the quarter. This primarily reflects the tax benefit mentioned previously, partially offset by system conversion, restructuring, integration and other charges. The net impact for these items increased our reported EPS by $0.53. Our reported fourth quarter tax rate is significantly lower than the prior year as a result of tax reform. In the quarter, we recorded approximately $0.02 per diluted share of excess tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation or ETB compared to approximately $0.01 per share benefit last year. In the full year 2017, we recorded $0.27 per share of ETB, which is an increase of $0.21 year-over-year. At this point, I would like to highlight that January 2018; we will exclude ETB from our adjusted EPS calculation. We believe we have changed for providing with better insights into the operational performance of our business. Bad debt expense for the fourth quarter as a percentage of revenues was 3.8% 20 basis points higher than last year and 20 basis points lower versus the prior quarter. For the full year 2017 bad debt was 4.1% flat year-over-year. As a reminder beginning in 2018, new revenue recognition rules will require us to classify un-collectable balances associated with pace of responsibility as a reduction in net revenue as oppose to bad debt expense. As you think about 2018, considering the impact of this change on our revenue for each quarter of 2017 which is shown in no aid at the end of this morning's earnings press release. You should use this adjustment as the basis for comparability in 2018. The reduction in revenue for each quarter in 2017 is accompanied by an equal reduction in SG&A expense with no impact operating or net income. Turning to cash provided by operations, we generated $1.2 billion in 2017 versus $1.1 billion last year. Capital expenditures during the year were $252 million compared to $293 million a year ago. Now turning to guidance, we are providing with following outlook for 2018, revenues to be between $7.7 billion and $7.77 billion an increase of 4% to 5% versus the prior year. Reported diluted EPS to be between $5.42 and $5.62 and adjusted EPS excluding both amortization and ETB to be between $6.50 and $6.70. Cash provided by operations to be approximately $1.3 billion and capital expenditures to be between $350 million and $400 million. Here are some items for you to consider, given all the moving piece as in 2018. First, as a result of tax reform, we expect our effective tax rate in 2018 to be approximately 24%. We expect to realize approximately $180 million in adjusted tax ratings. Of this amount, we expect to deliver roughly $120 million after-tax or approximately $0.85 to our adjusted EPS in 2018. Additionally, we intend to reinvest approximately $75 million before tax as the benefit to support our two-point strategy. From a cash perspective, we expect our lower tax rate to increase cash from operations by approximately $160 million in 2018. Second, we expect unit price reimbursement price shown on our DIS segment to remain less than 100 basis points excluding PAMA, with an additional headwind of approximately 50 basis points including PAMA. In the gone November, we sized the impact of PAMA as approximately 4% of 2018 Medicare revenue from the clinical lab fee schedule and approximately 10% in both 2019 and 2020. Our forecasted impact on the business over the next three years from the fee schedule reduction remains unchanged. Third, our revenue guidance for 4% to 5% growth includes all the M&A that we have closed to date including MedXM. We estimate the revenue impact of recently closed acquisitions as well as carry over from acquisitions that closed earlier in 2017 to be roughly 2.5% in 2018. The earnings accretion from these deals will ramp throughout 2018 and into 2019. Fourth, our 2018 revenue guidance reflects the classification of patient related bad debt against revenue in accordance with the new revenue recognition standard. Fifth, as Steve noted earlier, we exceeded our $1.3 billion goal of cumulative run rate Invigorate savings to the end of 2017. Our efforts around Invigorate will continue indefinitely as we should. Best-in-class organizations take out at least 3% of cost per year. We believe Quest is a best-in-class organization and will continue to drive operational excellence to drive annual efficiencies of this magnitude. As Steve mentioned, given our track record of delivering in this area, going forward we will provide periodic updates in lieu of the specific run rate savings goal. Sixth, as I highlighted earlier and as noted in our earnings release, beginning in 2018, we will exclude ETB from our adjusted EPS calculation. For historical comparisons, our adjusted EPS results for 2016 and 2017 included $0.06 and $0.27 of ETB respectively. Seventh, the increase in our CapEx guidance reflects in large part, the planned start of our multi-year new lab construction in New Jersey. Additional investments in our advance and consumer growth strategies as well as final build out cost associated with headquarters moving to Secaucus. And finally, as you think through your models for the first quarter of 2018, please note that to date we have already experienced nearly as much weather impact as we did in the entire first quarter of 2017. Before I turn it back to Steve, I would like to provide some final comments on our capital allocation philosophy and 2020 outlook. Our capital deployment philosophy has served us very well over the last several years and remains unchanged. We expect to continue to return the majority of free cash flow to shareholders through a combination of dividends and buybacks. We continue to prefer to use the remainder of free cash to fund M&A activity which we believe will be more robust over the coming quarters in light of PAMA. We regards to our 2020 outlook, we remain confident in targets that we have outlined for 2017 through 2020. These targets include a revenue CAGR of 3% to 5% with 1% to 2% growth expected from acquisitions. And adjusted earnings CAGR faster than revenue in the mid to high single digit range. Last quarter, we shared that this outlook implied adjusted EPS in the range of $6 to $7 by 2020. We also shared at that time that we would expect to be towards the lower end of this range given the reimbursement cut associated with PAMA. While the cumulative PAMA headwind to 2020 remains severe, we now believe we will exceed $7 in light of tax reform. I will now turn it back to Steve. Steve Rusckowski : Thanks Mark. Well, to summarize, we delivered a strong fourth quarter. In 2017, we made great progress accelerating growth and driving operational excellence. Our guidance for the full-year 2018 reflects expectations with this continuation of acceleration of the top line and bottom line growth. Quest benefits from tax reform. And we are investing in our business and our people. Now we will be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We will now open it up to questions. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Amanda Murphy with William Blair. Your line is open. Amanda Murphy : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Steve Rusckowski : Good morning, Amanda. Amanda Murphy : Just a question on guidance, so from a top line perspective, it's little difficult obviously given all the moving parts sort of compared to consensus, but it feels like the numbers or the top line growth rates are sort of pretty strong relative to expectations. And I was just curious so you have obviously given a lot of information around M&A and the unit pricing dynamics, but what are you thinking in terms of at least maybe qualitatively how to think about the various dynamics around organic growth? They are just underlying volume growth? The POS contribution that we might expect, is it similar to this year? And then also, I guess, last year technically. And then also how to think about mix particularly given some of the comments you made around investment in new tests et cetera? Steve Rusckowski : Okay. Amanda, thank you. Well, we are pleased to be able to provide the guidance for 2018 we just did which is 4% to 5% growth. We feel good about that. Our strategy historically remains in 2018 is a balance between acceleration of our organic growth and also to achieve at least 1% to 2% growth through acquisitions. And as what I said in my remarks, we have exceeded that high end and that range of 1% to 2% through acquisition, but what I will say in that 4% to 5%, you see both. You see an improvement in organic growth. And you also see an improvement in growth through acquisitions and that's in that 4% to 5%. As far as the growth drivers organically, we continue to see good growth in our professional lab services business. We continue to get good interest. And as we have talked about this - there is a couple of things, one is we have an acceleration in the number of conversations we having with C-suites of integrated delivery system with around their lab strategy. And that hits many aspects of our strategies for growth. First of all, they are quite interested in what we could do with them to make it more efficient and this is our professional lab services business. And so, that has impacted growth in '17 and will continue in '18. Second is we sell them our most sophisticated testing. And so, that acceleration advanced diagnostics will continue as well into '18. And then finally in some cases, like in example of PeaceHealth in 2017, they want us to buy their outreach business. So implied in our guidance is the continuation of that strategy which hits on three aspects of our growth strategy going forward. So, again, a balanced guidance that with both the acceleration of organic growth as well as an acceleration of growth through acquisition. Mark, anything you would like to add to that? Mark Guinan : Yes, I appreciate the comment Amanda that there is lot of moving parts, but on the top line, the restatement of bad debt really should not change the growth in revenue because bad debt is not going to vary dramatically year-over-year. So, the 4% to 5% is a solid number that it doesn't have a lot of moving parts to it. And then in terms of your questions around the future, we would expect more of the same. Continued friendship towards advanced diagnostics, as Steve, said which should benefit our revenue per acq, but also continued strong growth in POS which will offset that - partially from that. And in price, I covered that pretty thoroughly which is more of the same; some headwinds on the non-government side and then the additional 50 basis points coming from PAMA. Steve Rusckowski : Operator, next question? Operator : Our next question is from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : Hey, good morning. Jack Meehan : Thanks. Good morning. Could you elaborate on the volume dynamic in the fourth quarter? So, you delivered around 1% ex-M&A, but I there is probably some POS in there. So what are you seeing in terms of underlying volume and what's the expectation for 2018 there? Steve Rusckowski : Mark, you want to take that one? Mark Guinan : Yes, so we - never volume with requisitions. And what we have also reported is that we continue to see increasingly dense requisitions. So in fact, costs are growing faster than the volume reported. That's really what we do is we do test. So we don't fully understand the trend. We talked a little bit of this, but certainly there is things that are being added. When someone goes in for general healthy checkup whether it's a baby boomer getting the hep C test and that's certainly well back as adding Vitamin B. So, people getting more done when the y go in to get our services in the given encounter. So really we talked about a desire to give you better - inside of the volume was really test, we didn't - found a way to do it yet. So don't read too much into volume as reported by our requisitions. So certainly POS as we mentioned is a double digit grower, but volume trends continue to be solid. We don't see anything that suggests the market shift in utilization. We continue to accelerate our growth and that's what we are expecting during 2018 as well. Operator : Our next question is from Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : Good morning, Kevin. Kevin Ellich : Hey, good morning guys. Hey, guys, thank you for taking the question. Kind of two part here. Mark, you talked about test mix is strong, is there any specific tests that you can call out, or is it really just a function of the more tests per acquisition? And then, you know, manager contracting any updates there on the United and other contracts? Steve Rusckowski : Yes. Well, Kevin as I mentioned in the remarks, we continue to make nice growth out of our Q-Natal testing and prenatal testing, number one. Number two is [indiscernible] continues to grow. We have got long ways to go as far as testing the baby-boomers in this country. That continues to grow nicely. Prescription drug monitoring continues to be a big grower for us. We are the market leader in that regard, and that's growing strong double-digits. So you look across the Board and many of our diagnostic testing categories, we're getting some nice growth. Operator : Our next question is from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Ricky Goldwasser : Hi, good morning. Just going to take a couple of follow-up questions, so one, just kind of like on the pricing; obviously pricing trends look really, really good in the quarter, you are talking about little bit less than 100 basis points of headwind into next year. Is this odd, because of the mix of the acquisition, or how should we think about kind of affect the pricing environment? And then, on just kind of like [indiscernible] just kind of like more big picture, when we think about [indiscernible] deal and focusing on transforming retail pharmacy and healthcare hubs, how do you think about your role, as part of this overall strategy and any update? Yes. Steve Rusckowski : Yes, the first part, Mark will take around what's in our guidance for price, and the second part I will take on where this is all going with transformation of healthcare. Mark? Mark Guinan : Yes. And Ricky thanks for the question. So, on the pricing, I think you are referring to revenue per acq and - which includes mix. Pricing itself well is apples and apples, real price, and it will continue to be less than 100 basis points headwind as we mentioned. Obviously when we narrow the mixed elements, including PLS, including tests, payer mix, density of our acquisitions, we have seen an increase in revenue per acq in that space on mix. So we don't expect any change in trends in 2018 relative to what we have seen in the last couple of years in our business. Regarding M&A, there is really not a mixed element of the M&A for the most part, and in certainly the possible acquisition deal that we do, you know, book of business is very similar to our core book of business. Obviously the reimbursement is going to be somewhat different by payer type, but generally the same pricing. So M&A unless it's a very different business like in MedXM or something like along those lines, Med Fusion had a different mix, but generally our M&A will not change revenue direct dramatically. I will turn it back to Steve to answer your further part of your question. Steve Rusckowski : Yes. News now on these consolidations and particular interest around sponsor health plans and what that segment of the population or the industry could do, we think it's very positive for - the strategy that we've been on for number of years now. So as we've talked about, we as one of our strategies want to be the most consumer-oriented laboratory, we talked about that in our prepared remarks, there are multiple aspects, there is an aspect around our experience, there is an aspect around data, around products, and around information. And I mentioned MyQuest app, and this is making a lot of progress, and 2018 will really be a watershed year of really fulfilling lot of our promises in that space. If we go there, then all of it - it is all about serving the consumer and the customer. And number of these mergers and discussions are all about what needs to do - what needs to happen to get better access for consumers or the consumers getting to be more and more involved in healthcare decision-making. And important to address is we partnered with a number of these players already. So we are in the middle of these discussions. So we are all waiting to see about the merger of CVS and Aetna. We have strong relationships with both. We work with both already. Second is relationship with Wal-Mart. We will continue to extend itself. We mentioned our patient service centers opening up in their stores. And also in that regard, we're going to provide health services. And then third is we have the employer business, we sell our [indiscernible] wellness products into large employers. And as we know, 170 million people roughly in this country get their insurance from their employers. And we've been all over this as an opportunity of working with these employers and working with our healthcare insurance partners to do a better job within the cost curve for those corporations, as well as for their employees. And we've actually done this at Quest. We've been working on this for a couple or three years. We've changed the organizational model. We've got more data, and we're working with a number of partners, and actually what we have seen is we have been their cost curves. So we're quite excited about these new developments, and we believe we're really strongly positioned to take advantage of those going forward. Operator : Our next question is from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Bill Quirk : Hi, thanks. Good morning everybody. Just a couple of quick ones here; first off; Steve; can you just talk a little bit about M&A deal flow and whether or not any valuations have been reset given PAMA or maybe it's just little too early to see those resets at this point? And then secondly, I know that flu doesn't have a big direct impact on the business, but is there any sort of ancillary testing that you tend to pick up just considering that the very severe season that we're going through right now? Steve Rusckowski : Yes. So on M&A, we did seven deals. We're now seven deals. That's reflected in our guidance for 2018. That's beyond the 1% to 2% that we've stated as our strategy; we feel good about that. And as we said, the deal flow continues to be strong, and we're optimistic going forward. And there is a lot more interest in what integrated delivery systems will have in their lab strategy going forward, given potential pressure there will be either with PAMA or commercial rates on the ancillary services side. So that continues to be an opportunity for us. As far as resets, we already in our modeling are prudent as far as how we price things and work out our - in terms of what we've guided business and we restated for that business in our hands. We do take into consideration what might happen with Medicare rates. And we feel past deals and forward looking deals we will take that in consideration because that's a real consideration that we do consider in the model to make sure we are back any of us we make an acquisition for our shareholders. So, Mark you want to drill in the second part of the question. Mark Guinan : Yes. Steve's points recalled that our valuation really is independent of what the business might look like in their hands. When we go back to Investor Day, we went through an example, so the revenue is still adequate because of commercial payers and then the cost, and even more the portion lower given the economies of scale, and that's how we create value. So really our pro forma P&L looks nothing like the P&L that it was in the hands of the seller. So have things changed? Absolutely. Because we're taking into account to change in government reimbursement which impacts both the seller and the buyer, we've been modeling some potential for that for several years now. So it's not lease, and will be taken that into account, but obviously with the new publication of rates, we're building those rates right now as an assumption and to what the future is, ensuring that we pay appropriately for any acquisition. And then on the full piece scale on\u2026 Steve Rusckowski : Yes. We track a number of dynamics in the industry, and we do believe rate is up, that it would impact on - let's just call it activity or utilization into physician's offices. So there's some modest increase from it. But this, as you know, many variables, and as Mark said earlier, when we look at our same-store analysis, we feel that the market is stable. So it's not a big mover, but we did notice the change. Operator : Our next question is from Donald Hooker with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Donald Hooker : Great. Good morning. My question was - I'm interested in your comments around consumerism, and you referenced concierge services a few times or that buzzword at least, and then how that might dovetail with that recent acquisition you did have - I guess it's mobile, medical examination, and I know you have a life insurance business where you're going into people's homes as well. Can you maybe tie that together, does that fit into a consumer strategy or what are you thinking there with all those - maybe elaborate on those themes? Thank you Steve Rusckowski : Absolutely, absolutely. So first of all, when we talked about concierge, we talked about advance diagnostics; there's a lot of science. And it is an innovation business. And we have a new leader that stared about a year ago, [indiscernible], and she's updated our strategy, we're putting more resources in it, and a portion of our incremental investment from tax reform benefit will be invested in our business. And as part of it, yes, there is more science, there is just more capability to do test that will bring to the marketplace but the large part of what you also deliver advanced diagnostics, particularly our genetics. It's that whole experience for the patient and making it seamless and easy for the physician that's ordering that test and so what if it's more resources in that part of it, it's the pre-authorization piece, it's the ordering piece, it's the resulting piece. So my comment in my prepared remarks had to do with that portion of what we describe is concierge services. The second part of your question had to do with a consumer strategy, we've been on this for a multiple years, we made excellent progress in '17 and in '18 I will tell you by the end of '18 we are going to be long ways along with what our vision was. First of all, it's around the whole experience, we are contemporizing bad experience free unit to this new world. So we enabled in a big way, I mentioned the kiosk and now in about half of patient service centers. We are going to that experiences are completely different experience in the old days and I would argue some portion as market where you have labs that are not nearly our size that can't make these investments so we are really excited about that. Second is the whole information flow, so my question is our app that allows the consumer, the patient to get access for the results we have 5 million users that continue to grow and we will provide more and more capability on that app to schedule appointment, to get your results and to do other things in your healthcare going forward. So we are excited about that. And third, as we bring new products to the marketplace, we've tested this over-the-counter, direct-to-consumer models in a number of states will realize there is a market where consumers want to directly order cholesterol testing or glucose testing, hemoglobin A1c or such transmitted diseases without going to physician. So we are going to grow that business as well. So you put that altogether and what you are going to get from Quest Diagnostics is completely different experiences of different set of capabilities in a brand but consumers will recognize and as healthcare continues to evolve, where more and more choice will give to consumer who they use, they can look for the best value and we offer the best value on the planet. We are proud of that and it's getting better every day. Now the second part of this is related to you take all that data and you take that experience and you combine it with healthcare services and retail healthcare services are the basic healthcare services. This is where we have an amazing capability, we have over 10,000 phlebotomists, we have over 10,000 healthcare workers that going home already you mentioned our life insurance business, our wellness business. And so, those 20,000 employees and also with their other let's just call it operational capabilities are 3500 per years and our cost centers can be applied in managing lives in a better way and so the ambition we have with our partner with Wal-Mart and other partners is to take our gain up, point us in direction and provide those healthcare services to surround those lives in a more efficient effective way and typically as we know in healthcare 5% of the population and 50% of cost and we believe with better data, with better oversight over those individuals in a convenient good access location, we can do something about it and we have a lot of assets to bring the table. And so, this is what we called our data in extended care service portion of our strategy and obviously we are going to need some partners we benched in a few and I'm sure there is going to be many others because healthcare is local I mean what we do and different space will be different, so we are excited about the prospects of leveraging our capabilities and we see this is where the market is going. It's all about the consumer, it's all about better quality, lower cost and we are nicely positioned in that respect. Operator : Our next question is from Patrick Donnelly with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : Hi, Patrick. Good morning. Patrick Donnelly : Hi, guys. Thanks. So with PAMA, I'll implement it, can you talk a bit about future pricing conversations with payers and the importance of price discipline from your end. It seems like this will give even more incentive to hold on price with private payer has given, your value proposition with smaller regional payers struggle a bit to deal with PAMA in their best in margin, so curious as to your perspective on that? Steve Rusckowski : Mark, why don't you take that? Mark Guinan : Yes, I appreciate the question. I can assure you with that plenty of motivation to be price disciplined for many years. So it doesn't change that. I think that PAMA gives as I described in JP Morgan is that the payers now are understanding that the market is involving and this world where somehow the commercial rates for though independent labs obviously for a lot of the hospitals and some of the physician mandatories and so on, the rates that are still well higher CMS rates but certainly for the independent lab it's been lower and there is full transparencies that we can go under them and say here is the data that was collected by CMS you know, where the market is and so there is no one certainly around where ratings are compared with the rest of the commercial market and therefore let's talk about what's there, let's talk about how we partner together in the long run you know, that we succeed and failed together. So I might feel good to try to get some sort of price concession in the short run, but you know, that's not your best long-term interest because we are part of the solution, we give the best value you know, that when you drive more volume through one of the national labs, it's much better than it's going somewhere else. Everything from the data we provide to the services that Steve mentioned, which differentiate as per many of the other providers and obviously to the cost. So, much more of an opportunity to talk partnership, get the conversation away from price or if anything, get the conversation towards, we need prices to migrate towards that need. You can't have a subset that's significantly lower and a subset significant higher getting to an average everyone is kind of be in a market price, which ultimately is what CMS wants to get to, so that enables the conversation to enhance the conversation that we've been having for several years. It doesn't change our motivation which has been very strong and if you look at what we've accomplished over the last couple of years, we did significantly mitigate the prices that we are facing four, five years ago through that discipline and when we talked about the fact that some prices aren't sufficient then we will walk away from volume if we don't feel that's appropriate. Not volume at any price it's like greater than therefore we have shown a desire, willingness and descended our value proposition to those payers and I think we are viewing the results. Operator : Our next question is from Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Dan Leonard : Good morning. This is perhaps a somewhat related question, but can you talk about managed care contracting environment and what assumption you have in your guidance for 2018, is that any regarding a large managed care exclusive contracts in the industry and then also if no assumption baked in, what impact you would anticipate could occur? Thank you. Steve Rusckowski : Yes, so for '18 I assume the continuation of our setup if you will with our access through the national players as well as through the regional players. I would argue that our access through healthcare insurance has gotten better over the years and obviously our objective which we talked about is to continue to get a better test 2018 to 2019. So what I'm saying in that regard is we can see you enjoy from a national exclusivity relationship with Aetna that's implied in our guidance for 2018 we feel good about that relationship is potential merger with CVS, we think it is an interesting development that might happen. We have a strong working relationship with CVS as well, so feel good about that and that's assumed in our guidance for '18. Second is we talk about that is how we know that a contract with United, with our largest dependent expires in '18. We love to get access through United as one of the national partners. We've described that we are working on that, we feel good about progress make. We have nothing to share there, but we continue to be hopeful that as we enter '19 we will have strong access and we do have access already with United Lives as another network provider in some states and for some carve-out plans that they have, and as I mentioned, the relationship continues to get stronger. We've announced a strategic relationship with Optum lifecycle management that continues to go well. Optum continues to buy physician practices that depending on our biggest customers in those physician practices so that will continue to build. And then, throughout the rest of our hundreds of contracts we have, you should assume in '18 that we have good expansion of those, and good - continuation of those and the price assumption that Mark talked about is the continuation of the access to our many partners we have throughout the United States. Mark Guinan : And just to add to that specifically interesting question. We gave a pretty broad range 3% to 5%. So 200 basis points, so well I can't tell you explicitly what that means for getting that in the United or any other sort of potential changes. I can tell you that it's likely covered within that range whatever scenario might happen in within 2019 and beyond and then if we do get to appoint where there is something to share as Steve mentioned we will consider some change like that materially offset. We would communicate in a very time with fashion like you know, what's going on at that point and obviously give you some idea of what we think it might mean and then obviously as we got further in the year, we are planning another Investor Day in the call. We will give more detailed update on what the specs are as we near given everything we know at that time. Operator : Our next question is from Ralph Giacobbe with Citibank. Your line is open. Ralph Giacobbe : Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping you can talk a little bit about expectations around, wage growth just given tight labor market. Do you expect pressures there and then maybe what you see is underlying wage growth over kind of the next couple of few years? Steve Rusckowski : Yes. Ralph, we continue to look at our competitiveness of our wages to our broad workforce we employ about 45,000 people many of which are frontline employees. We believe we've been competitive in the past and the expectation for 2018 is the inflation we have on wage bill is about what we've been running at. Matter of fact, we track attrition of our employees and we put a lot of time in energy into retaining our employees. So we've actually spent a lot of time as a management team looking at the other aspects like people come to work around things like scheduling and the environment and their supervisors and so actually we've seen a slight reduction in our attrition of employees so forget about the value proposition we have on employees. And then prospectively, we think employees until has have better and better about working across diagnostics we run an engagement survey where we have a phenomenal participation rate about 90% of employees show up in a survey. And our engagement course for 2017 has never been higher; they are much higher than in '16. So we had nice pickup in engagements course and as you see in our announcement this morning we want to thank all those employees because these are the frontline employees in many aspects, so we have more attrition in other places that has helped us through this journey we've been on and so the $500 recognition that we are going to provide this year that's tagged to companywide initiatives. We think we will again get a lot of this people a good feeling about working at Quest, so we want to thank them for their hard work. So 2018 is above what you see in the past in terms of inflationary pressure on our wage though. Mark Guinan : And to answer I think probably an impressive question, a many of our wage employees earn about, where at the middle of wages are targeted to end up, we also you know, obviously have many week employees who are not in the states or the cities that have this increase in minimum wage. So we are already above that market. If you are thinking about minimum wage and so when we look at the pressure on our wages certainly that's not a huge factor. But, the timing of the labor force is going to bring, unknown. But at this point, we've not experienced any dramatic pressure. To Steve's point certainly wages are one part of the equation, but we also provide health benefits for our employees and it's highly valued. And then the work experience itself is greatly improving. I'll give you one example, a lot of the investments we're making in our peaks and service as Steve referenced through enablement, we are also doing some of significant refresh to those centers, updating them et cetera. That makes phlebotomists work experience much more positive as well. They're really like not having to handle as many of administrative duties, they now can be done electronically and they can focus on phlebotomy, so there're other things that we're doing to offset some potential wage pressure but certainly we addressed where we needed to. So, market adjustments and we're not exposed heavily to inflation from general wage increases because we already generally pay a lot of our people at that minimum wage. Operator : Our next question is from Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum. Your line is open. Kevin Ellich : Hey guys, just a quick follow-up, Mark you made a comment in your prepared remarks about to-date in Q1, you have experienced nearly as much weather impact as you did last year, wondering I mean how should we think about that in terms of volume impact or on year-over-year comp, I mean is it just really due to the cold and minorities or cold throughout the country? Mark Guinan : Yes, well, it's been nature's cold. I mean, we had precipitation events, you had [indiscernible] in Northern Florida, though certainly we had a number of weather events from ice to snow in areas which is unusual to some snow in Massachusetts and then some cold, although we know it's hard to really attribute cold, I mean, there are some times when it's been so cold where everything is closed, schools are shut down and so on. But generally cold, warm I guess some impact, we don't really calculate on our weather. So weather is more we see a day, weather is something going on that it have its travel to the extent that we look at that day's activity, we say, \"Hey, there's definitely an impact, this is out of the norm,\" and so it's - there are some to that calculation, but we've been doing it long enough that we feel it's directionally crap. We just wanted people to be aware as they're thinking about the modeling from a various quarters that we don't know what the next couple months are going to blame, but last year January was pretty benign. We didn't get our weather until later in the quarter, and this year we've already had handful of weather events that kind of puts us already where we were for the full quarter last year. Operator : At this time, we're showing no further questions on the phone line. Steve Rusckowski : Okay. Well, thanks again for joining us today. We appreciate your support and interest, and have a great day. Operator : Thank you for participating in the Quest Diagnostics fourth quarter and full year 2017 conference call.

Operator : Welcome to the Quest Diagnostics fourth quarter 2018 conference call. At the request of the company, this call is being recorded. The entire contents of the call, including the presentation and question-and-answer session that will follow are copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics with all rights reserved. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. Now, I'd like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead, please. Shawn Bevec : Thank you and good morning. I'm here with Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and we'll discuss non-GAAP measures and actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly report on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization expense. As a reminder, adjusted diluted EPS now excludes excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation. Also, net revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses have been restated for the basis of prior-year comparisons to reflect the impact of new revenue recognition rules that were effective January 1, 2018 and were adopted on a retrospective basis. Under the new rules, the company now reports uncollectible balances associated with patient possibility as a reduction in net revenues when historically these amounts were classified as bad debt expense within selling, general and administrative expenses.  Now, here is Steve Rusckowski. Stephen Rusckowski : Thanks, Shawn, and thanks everyone for joining us today. This morning, I'll provide you with some perspective on PAMA, highlights on the quarter and review progress on our two-point strategy. And then Mark will provide more detail on fourth quarter performance. We delivered strong revenue growth despite the negative impact of severe weather and lower Medicare reimbursement under PAMA. Earnings growth was driven by continued strong execution as well as the benefits of tax reform. We also completed our previously announced acquisition of MedXM, which is off to a good start. Now, here are some highlights from the quarter. Revenues were up 3.7%. Reported EPS was up nearly 10% from 2017. Adjusted EPS grew 25%. Before I describe the progress we've made, what I'd like to do is to provide an update on PAMA and our investments in the business using a portion of savings from tax reform.  Turning to PAMA, this was our first quarter operating under the clinical IP schedule, which accounted for approximately 12% of our revenues last year. Since November, we said we expected the impact of the pharma rates under PAMA would be a reduction of approximately 4% in 2018, approximately 10% in both 2019 and 2020. And our actual Medicare reimbursement in the first quarter reaffirms our projected impact for 2018. We continue to support efforts by our trade association to implement a market-based laboratory reimbursement schedule. On the legal front, ACLA has sued CMS and both sides have submitted their initial briefs to the court and we still believe we could have a decision from the judge by midyear. We want to reiterate that ACLA's complaint is not challenging the new Medicare rates themselves, but rather the process CMS followed to arrive at those rates. As the lawsuit progresses, ACLA has continued to seek a legislative fix to PAMA, coordinating closely with aligned trade associations like NILA, AdvaMedDx and other stakeholders. This issue is about ensuring that Medicare beneficiaries have access to critical laboratory services. While the new rates have impacted us, other laboratory providers, including many serving remote and underserved areas, may be forced to close their doors. So, that's why this is an important issue to us all. Turning to tax reform, last quarter, we shared with you that we will realize approximately $180 million in tax savings on an adjusted basis in 2018. We are reinvesting roughly $75 million before tax into the business and our people and much of this is underway. Turning to the first quarter, we delivered on all five elements of our strategy to accelerate our growth. The first element of our growth strategy is to grow 1% to 2% through strategically accretive acquisitions, which were achieved for the fifth consecutive year in 2017. We had a productive quarter for M&A. We completed our acquisition of MedXM, a leading national provider of home-based health risk assessments related services. More on this acquisition in a few minutes. We're integrating the acquisitions announced in the latter half of 2017 and we are pleased by the results. We guided earlier this year we expect to deliver about 250 basis points of growth from M&A in 2018, which is above the top end of our 1% to 2% objective. Our M&A pipeline remains strong and our strategy is delivering growth. Under the second element of our growth strategy, we continue to expand relationships with hospital health systems. In March, we entered into a professional lab services relationship with an integrated healthcare delivery system in New England. We acknowledged earlier that PAMA is a headwind for us. However, reimbursement cuts are bigger headwinds for hospital systems operating outreach laboratories.  Hospital executives are starting to become more aware of the impact of PAMA and we're having more frequent conversations with them about their lab strategy and how we can help. Many of you have asked about the possibility of expanding your access with major health plans. We continue to have productive conversations and make progress with a number of payers. Quest offers health plans and their members' unmatched convenience, access, quality and value. And based upon our recent conversations, it's clear that many health plan leaders agree. We're delivering on the third element of our growth strategy, which is to offer the broadest access to diagnostic innovation. Key growth drivers in the quarter were prescription drug monitoring, QuantiFERON and non-invasive prenatal screening. In advanced diagnostics, we're making strong progress with our new center of excellence in precision medicine oncology in Texas. The center is helping community oncologists determine the most appropriate treatment of patients with cancer. Since we acquired Med Fusion, we've seen an acceleration of growth of their tumor panels. 70% of patients with cancer are treated by community cancer centers and we're excited about the opportunities that Med Fusion is creating with networks of community cancer practices like The US Oncology Network and Texas Oncology, as well as Baylor Scott & White Health, the largest health system in Texas. We continue to make strong progress executing the fourth element of our growth strategy, which is to be the provider of choice of consumers. Our Walmart locations continue to perform well with an increase in patient traffic across the board and outstanding feedback on the customer experience. We're expanding into different markets and we expect to open many more locations throughout this year. We're pleased with the progress and excited about the future of this important partnership with Walmart. The fifth element of our growth strategy is to support population health within analytics and extended care services. The integration of MedXM is going well. Customers are excited that we can help them close their gaps in care using mobile healthcare professionals to reach patients when and where it's convenient for them. So, let me give you one example on this capability, is closing gaps of care. Diabetic eye screening is a key part of diabetes care. MedXM's National Health Plan customers identify at-risk Medicare Advantage or managed Medicaid members.  MedXM call centers then reach out to those patients to schedule health risk assessment to visit the patient and perform a series of tests, which include capturing a retinal image. This program helps identify people at risk of diabetes. It enables health plans to improve their quality scores. The second element of our two point strategy is to drive operational excellence. Earlier this month, we launched the pilot program with Humana MultiPlan, Optum, UnitedHealthcare to use Blockchain technology to improve the quality of healthcare providers data and reduce administrative costs. We look forward to continuing to use our data and expertise for this project, which we believe can lower cost and improve efficiency within the healthcare system. We are continuing to drive efficiency and effectiveness within Quest to cover the cost of wage inflation and reimbursement pressure. So, let me give you a few updates. Our collaboration with Optum 360 continues to perform well. As consumers there, in a pre-share share of cost of their healthcare, more of our revenues come from patients, which poses collection challenges. And despite the pressure from increased patient responsibility, we're succeeding in keeping our uncollectible balances associated with patient responsibility in line with last year. We're collaborating with payers to bring price transparency to healthcare through our real-time estimation tool. This tool enables a health plan member at a patient service center to know before a specimen is drawn if the test is covered and what out-of-pocket cost the health plan member will pay for that test. We're continuing to enable our business to improve the customer experience. Our e-check-in process has been used in more than 27 million patient encounters. Our patients like the convenience and this information helps us place providers where they are needed most based on the patient flow. We have 1,500 sites with e-check-in and expect to deploy in all of our patient service centers by the end of 2018. Now, let me turn over to Mark who will take you through our financial performance. Mark Guinan : Thanks, Steve. Starting with revenues, consolidated revenues of $1.88 billion were up 3.7% versus the prior year.  Please note that due to a change in revenue recognition accounting, we now report uncollectible balances associated with patient responsibility as a reduction of net revenues instead of as bad debt. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services, or DIS for short, improved 4.1% compared to the prior year, with approximately 340 basis points attributed to acquisitions.  Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 2.2% versus the prior year driven by acquisitions, with organic growth essentially flat. Volume was negatively impacted by weather and the timing of major holidays during the quarter.  The impact of weather presented a volume headwind of 60 basis points. The timing of the Easter and Passover holidays this year versus last year weighed on first quarter requisition volumes and created a tougher year-over-year comparison. Revenue per requisition in the first quarter grew by 1.6% versus the prior year. As a reminder, revenue per req is not a proxy for price. It includes a number of variables such as unit price variation, business mix, test mix and test per req. Unit price headwinds during the quarter were approximately 50 basis points from PAMA and less than 100 basis points from all other factors. This is consistent with the outlook we provided in February and is in line with the trends we've observed for several quarters. After many changes to PAMA, Medicare reimbursement pressure will increase in 2019 as we have indicated previously. Beyond unit price, other mix elements remained strong in the quarter and more than offset reimbursement headwinds. Reporter operating income for the quarter was $272 million or 14.5% of revenues compared to $279 million or 15.4% of revenues a year ago. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $303 million or 16.1% of revenues compared to $297 million or 16.3% of revenues last year. Operating income decreased by $8 million compared to the prior-year as a result of weather. The decline in operating margin was caused by a mix of PAMA, weather and acquisitions, which are in the early stages of integration and, therefore, not yet delivering full-margin contribution. Almost, as Steve mentioned, we're using a portion of our savings from tax reform to reinvest into the business and our people. We expect these investments to help us continue to accelerate growth, which also impacted operating margin in this quarter. Reporter EPS was $1.27 in the quarter compared to $1.16 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $1.52, up roughly 25% from $1.22 last year. Note that our adjusted EPS now excludes excess tax benefits related to stock-based comp to provide greater clarity into the underlying operational performance of our business. Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was approximately 23% compared to 32% last year. As I mentioned earlier, our uncollectible balances associated with patient responsibility are no longer reported in selling, general and administrative expense. That said, we intend to provide periodic updates on the progress we continue to make with our revenue cycle management partner, Optum 360. In the first quarter, our uncollectible balances associated with patient responsibility are flat year-over-year. Cash provided by operations in the first quarter was $180 million versus $196 million last year. The year-over-year difference was largely due to movements in our working capital accounts. Capital expenditures during the quarter were $73 million compared to $42 million a year ago, which is in line with the higher CapEx spend planned for 2018. Now, turning to guidance. Our outlook for 2018 remains unchanged and as follows. Revenues to be between $7.7 billion and $7.77 billion, an increase of 4% to 5% versus the prior year.  Reported diluted EPS to be between $5.42 and $5.62 and adjusted EPS to be between $6.50 and $6.70. Cash provided by operations to be approximately $1.3 billion and capital expenditures to be between $350 million and $400 million. Recall that our guidance includes only the acquisitions that we've closed to date and that we closed several acquisitions in the back half of 2017. We expect the earnings accretion from these deals to continue to ramp up throughout 2018 and into 2019. I'll now turn it back to Steve. Stephen Rusckowski : Thanks, Mark. To summarize, we delivered a strong first quarter. We made solid progress accelerating growth and driving operational excellence. And with that, we'd like to take your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead. Dan Leonard : Thank you. Good morning. So, just a quick clarification on the EBIT margins, it sounds like there's a number moving parts between PAMA, weather, acquisitions, and some investment in your people. Can you comment on how EBIT margins arrived in the quarter compared to your internal plan? Mark Guinan : Yeah. Sure, Dan. I'll handle that. Certainly, PAMA was in our plan. The reinvestment to some of tax reform \u2013 again, this is self-evident, but when you reinvest tax, you're going to see a negative impact to the EBIT margins, obviously, offset by tax with the net results, though, obviously, being an increase in net income as a percent revenue. The one thing that, obviously, we hadn't planned on was the weather. And as I mentioned, there was about $8 million impact of operating margin, which, certainly, you can see, that if that had not happened, we actually still would have grown EBIT margins despite PAMA, despite the reinvestment. Kind of worst part of the holidays. We know that the way the calendar falls has impact. We never quite know exactly how to predict, what that impact might be. So, I think as we look at all those pieces, that's probably what I would say. And then, the last piece is acquisitions. That was certainly a part of our plan when we put together a business case and we planned those synergies. We know, as we've shared in the past, that it can take up to 12 to 18 months to get them to be kind of at their going rate of profitability. So, that was certainly in our plans as well. Dan Leonard : Okay. Helpful color. And then, just a follow-up, you commented on tumor profiling in the prepared remarks. Can you comment on how your tumor profiling strategy might evolve, now that there is an NCD from Medicare for FDA-approved tumor profiling tests? Stephen Rusckowski : So, Steve here. This is evolving. It has evolved and, I would say, it will continue to evolve. I think there's more and more interest by the FDA on how they will continue to think about oversight and regulatory controls around laboratory developed tests. And this, I would describe, as one of the areas that they're looking at. So, with the new guidance that's out that did tick a forum that we're actually pleased about because we believe that we do have the process capabilities and the control capabilities to be able to support that. And then second is, with that, it legitimizes through CMS the value that the tumor panels add to the diagnostic workup of a cancer patient. So, it just brings front and center the importance of getting a full workup when you make that expensive next choice in cancer care. I think given my earlier comments with our acquisition of Med Fusion, about our strong work relationship with US Oncology, our working relationship with Memorial Sloan and IBM Watson, we have a strong and growing presence in the whole space. So, we're very well positioned and actually pleased that there is some certain energy around it and some guidance about the controls in general because, I think, it's very important as we go forward that legitimate operating companies like ourselves that bring a lot of value to the marketplace have tight controls around the value of that, the verification of value of that and then the delivery of that. And we do that quite well. And so, therefore, approval for that and some kind of controls around that, we think, is a good thing. Dan Leonard : Appreciate the color. Thank you. Stephen Rusckowski : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead. Ricky Goldwasser : Yeah. Hi. Good morning. And congrats on a good performance in the quarter. So, I have one question and then a quick follow-up. Just if you can give us an update on the United Lab contract and the timing for an Aetna RFP. Stephen Rusckowski : Yeah, sure. So, as the industry knows, our nearest competitor's contract expires in 2018, number one. Number two is we've said that, obviously, we would like, under the right terms, to be on contract with United. We have also shared that we are in dialogue and we have nothing to share about that dialogue. And at the right time when we hopefully will have something, we'll share that. So, we're making progress there. We also make progress with hundreds of others of health plans. Some big and some small. And we feel, as we enter 2019, we'll be in a really nice shape in terms of our portfolio relationships. And these relationships, yes, they're contractual related to being in network, but they're becoming more and more strategic. I mentioned the work we're doing with our Extended Care Services and Population Health, the work we're doing around price transparency and our estimation tool. So, what we're doing is we definitely are showing ourselves as a laboratory. But as we said, we're in the diagnostic information services business. And the last part of this is our consumer strategy is really resonating. That whole consumer experience, we're upgrading our patient service centers. We're e-enabling it with our e-checking capabilities. We're bringing nice information capabilities with our MyQuest application and this resonates extremely well with the health plans big and small. So, making good progress. And when we have something, we'll make sure that you all hear it quickly. Ricky Goldwasser : Great, thank you. And just a quick follow-up on the M&A. Obviously, you're looking for 2.5% growth for 2018. So, in case I missed it, what the contribution of M&A in the quarter? And you said that new M&A is not included in guidance. So, now that PAMA is in place, I mean, have you seen any impact on valuation. Stephen Rusckowski : I'll turn it to Mr. Mark. The question is how much M&A is in the quarter in Q1. And then, let's make more clarity around what we said around what was in the guidance for the 4% to 5% for M&A and what was excluded. So, Mark, you want to take that about Q1 and then the guidance? Mark Guinan : So, in the first quarter, M&A contributed 3.5% of the 3.7% total or the 4.1% of our core business. And we had included 250 basis points or 2.5% in our 4% to 5% guidance for the year. And that, obviously, will be stronger in the first half because we annualized some deals that you work through the year, but there's also potential upside without committing anything for new deals because we do not contemplate that in our guidance.  Now, MedXM, which we had closed early in the year, was contemplated because it was completed by the time we shared our guidance in late January. Ricky Goldwasser : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum. You may go ahead. Kevin Ellich : You bet. Thanks for hearing the question. Good morning, Steve. I guess, first off, can you talk a little bit more about the investments that you're actually making from the tax savings, what impact you expect it to have on the business? And then, just a real quick update on the retail growth strategy. How much contribution is that to your growth and how many more locations you're planning to open up this year? Stephen Rusckowski : Yeah. Okay. So, first of all, on tax reform, what we shared with our fourth quarter results is we're going to take about $75 million in investment in the business and I would say the majority of this is around accelerating growth. What we've said around up and the kind of the outlines of broad categories, and those broad categories, as you would, are some of our growth strategies. So, Quest Diagnostics, the consumer strategy, but also investing in our people. So, we also announced that we're going to provide a bonus for the vast majority of our employees that don't have equity and that will be payable in the fourth quarter. So, all of that has started to feather into what you see starting in Q1 and will continue throughout the year. And with that, we believe this will help us accelerate growth around those five strategies. The second part of your question is around Walmart. We're really pleased with the early returns. We started with the big states \u2013 Texas and Florida. They're going well. The customer feedback is really good. And the joint venture continues to look at prospects for other basic health services that we can provide in those stores. And so, we, as you know, formed the JV. This joint venture was about what we do around blood draws and what we do at Quest Diagnostics and our laboratory business. But more importantly, it's all around Extended Care Services and Population Health and providing basic healthcare services to bend the cost curve. And so, we're excited about those prospects as well. We won't give you a number today about how many stores. We're still kind of working out the details with Walmart around that, but there will be more. We have the initial stores and there will be more because the early returns and progress we're making is quite good. Kevin Ellich : That was good. Thank you. Stephen Rusckowski : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from AJ Rice with Credit Suisse. You may go ahead. Stephen Rusckowski : Good morning, AJ. AJ Rice : Hey, how are you guys? Thanks. So, I'll just ask two quick parts here to questions. You referenced the discussions with hospitals in your prior remarks, Steve. I wonder \u2013 I know a lot of times \u2013 I haven't covered the hospitals for many years \u2013 that they don't always see the reimbursement changes coming. And when they come, they tend to then react to them. And I wonder where we're at in that, sort of appreciating what PAMA might mean to their lab business and where you've seen an uptick in discussions because of that? And maybe it will take till next year when there's a further step up. But I just wondered where you think hospitals are in understanding the implications of that and whether that's changing their thinking in any meaningful way about their lab business. And then, just expand on the last question. With all the consolidation activity at CVS, Cigna, Express. Reports about Walmart as well. I wonder, has that changed either urgency of your discussions with some of your retail partners or has it opened up new people coming to you and asking about maybe potential collaboration? Just curious if it's having an impact to your discussion. Stephen Rusckowski : Okay. So, let me take the first part, which is hospitals. I would say, this is \u2013 the pace of awareness is accelerating. What you find is that we have a number of hospital executives that are aware of PAMA. And second is they're greatly aware of all the other pressure that they have in hospitals. So, if you talk to hospital executives today, there's a lot of pressure, and not just with PAMA. And so, many have cost improvement goals. Many are anxious to understand ways they could become more efficient. And so, our hospital strategy plays nicely into being a program that they can launch with us, to put some point through the board, if you will, particularly around in-patient laboratory cost, which is a key part of our value proposition. So, independent of us, it's accelerating. Second is we are accelerating it as well. So, we're knocking on many hospital executives doors to make sure that they are aware, if they're not aware already, and have a conversation around this and specifically around the lab strategy. So, we've engaged with many systems, particularly those that have large outreach businesses to talk about their lab strategy. So, it's a deliberate strategy of our accelerate strategy to make sure that they're well aware and understand what their options could be and think about the possibilities. So, we are helping with the information out there as well. The second part of your question has to do with our retail strategy. Now, we're working on this retail strategy for years. This has happened overnight. As we said, Walmart departed that. We have Safeway who is a part of that. We do active work for CVS in the MinuteClinic. They've evolved their strategy. We have a great working relationship with Aetna. We'll see if that potential merger becomes a reality, but because of the great relationship with CVS and Aetna. We're actually hopeful that this could help accelerate some of the work we could do with them as well. Number one. And number two is the work with Walmart, I said in my earlier comments, is going well. And speculation what they will or will not do on health is for them to communicate about. But just reemphasizes their commitment and energy around this topic. And as far as other retailers, we're working on making sure that we have the right number and also don't leave any geography uncovered. And as you know, some of these partners we have announced so far, like Safeway and Walmart, have a center of mass that doesn't necessarily cover the whole population of the United States. So, as we continue to work through this, we continue to understand how there might be fitting different retail partnerships that could complement what we already have. But, fortunately, we're early to the table around this. We're off and running. You see the reinforcement of this with some of the deals that are out in the marketplace. So, our strategy is the right one. And it's being supported by the marketplace and this consolidation is interesting. But, more importantly, is try to bring their resources together with the capabilities. Our capabilities of data and services are quite essential to what this is all about, which is to bend the cost curve. And that was a portion of my prepared remarks about what we're actually doing with MedXM in the middle overall. AJ Rice : Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Stephen Rusckowski : Thank you, Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays. You may go ahead. Jack Meehan : I want to stick with consolidation. How are some of the recent acquisitions you've closed, like Shiel Medical Lab performing? In this conversation with hospitals you're having, how much of an appetite is there for PLS versus sale of lab assets? Stephen Rusckowski : I'll start and I'll turn it to Mark for some more color. First of all, when we walk in and have a conversation with a C-suite, as a matter of fact, this week we just had a leadership group of our top 40 to 50 executives that we want to make sure are prepared to have a broad conversation about all the capabilities of Quest Diagnostics. Part of that is around what we described as our hospital strategy. And in 2016, in our investor day, we shared this with you. And this, we have three pieces. One is we ask the question, we want to have a conversation around your lab strategy and is that important to you and you have one.  Surprisingly to us, initially, but not anymore, many of the CEOs and the C suites have it on their list. It's one of the strategic question, what they're going to do around lab. And related to that, there's three pieces. One is what they're doing with their hospital inpatient cost and our simple value proposition there is we have now good confidence, a track record of accounts that are all referenceable that we've actually saved them some money because it is a call center and we do that a variety of ways. When we get into that conversation, then we have a conversation around their sophisticated testing or advanced diagnostics that they send to reference laboratories, we're a player there. We're the market leader in that regard and we believe there's more we could do in terms of consolidation and getting smarter about the diagnostics in the inpatient care setting, classing suppliers and making sure you do the right tests for the right patient at the right time.  And the part of this is a conversation, if they're in outreach, if they partner with us with inpatient, if they partner with us around reference testing, what's their strategy around outreach. And this is where we have a conversation around what's happening with PAMA with their Medicare volumes, the pressure that's going to be on commercial rates given the reality of what's happening in this marketplace. And so, we end with a comprehensive strategy. If you see one, you see one. But we've shared last year with PeaceHealth. That was a good example. We bought their outreach. We're helping with their inpatient laboratories and as well we're helping them with their reference testing. So, when that happens, we're their partner for laboratory services in the integrated delivery system. And that's resonating well given all the pressures they have and all the parties that they have in the current dynamic in the marketplace. So, Mark, specific to the opportunities around consolidation, you want to share a little bit about how that's going? Mark Guinan : Sure, Steve. When you're talking consolidation, you mean within the laboratory industry and specifically us as a consolidator. And, yes, specifically about Shiel, Shiel is early. We're pleased with the initial results. I can share a little bit.  Commercial is fully integrated. From an operational standpoint, largely integrated, including billing, which is critically important. We haven't completely consolidated the entire infrastructure, the draw centers and things like that. That takes a little bit of time. But, certainly, after a few months, we're pleased and on plan. And then, I think, most critically, retention is good. So, if you look at the number of customers that moved over from Shiel to us, relative to expectations and the model, we're doing very well. So, that's what I can share, the point around Shiel. So, feel like it was a very nice deal. And at this point, it's on plan. Jack Meehan : Great. Mark, I had one follow-up for you, which was on accounts receivable. I know there's some seasonality at the beginning of the year, but it took a bigger step up than we expected, not in the first quarter, maybe just comment on that and bad debt. Thanks. Mark Guinan : Sure. So, if you look at the dollars, obviously, we're a larger business, especially with the acquisitions. If you look at the days, 47 and change, that's kind of where we typically are. Last year, we ended at a relatively AR level four a couple of different reasons. I think you may have been asking about year-end Q4 to Q1. And when you think about Q4, that is a ramp down quarter. So, October is much larger than December. And then, if you look at Q1, obviously, it's a ramp up quarter. So, March is much larger than January. So, you're always going to see a dollar dynamic where the end of Q1 in terms of receivables is much larger than Q4. Shawn Bevec : Jack, I'll also add to that. This is Shawn. With the accounting change around bad debt, that's obviously going to impact all of the historical DSO. So, you'd have to go back and recalculate those after you make the relevant adjustment to get a comparison quarter by quarter. Jack Meehan : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead. Stephen Rusckowski : Good morning, Patrick. Patrick Donnelly : How are you? One of the more common topics that comes up in our conversations is just the durability of margins once the heavier impacts from PAMA are felt beyond 2018. Can you just talk through any opportunities you see given that you guys have hit your Invigorate targets? And also, how you're think about that in the context of an environment where we're seeing a bit of a tick up in wage growth. Stephen Rusckowski : Thanks for the question. What was shared in 2016, and we continuously talk about it, we have our two point strategy. First is all around accelerating growth. We talked at great length of our five strategies around that where we made great progress. The second is operational excellence. And what we shared in the end of 2017 is we achieved our goal of $1.3 billion run rate savings. But what we also shared is we have more opportunities in front of us. This is a large, highly complex business and we still have plenty of opportunities to get better. And what we shared is \u2013 one example of that is we're kind of at the final push of harmonizing our processes and standardizing our systems. When we do that, it allows us to streamline our workflow. And then, second is it reduces our IT cost, by way of an example. This will happen in 2018. You'll see that in 2019.  We still have some opportunities around consolidation of our laboratory network. We've shared that we're building a new facility, a new laboratory facility in New Jersey. It's a big project for us. When that is completed, it will allow us to consolidate our physical presence in what we call our east region. So, it will allow us to consolidate some of our regional laboratories into one. We're continuing to see a big opportunity around the e-enablement. When we e-enable the process, we can take cost out. In prior calls, we talked about simple things. For instance, we got a lot of calls that came in to our call centers around results. And so, now what we've done is educated our customers that you can get these results online. And so, what it has done is eliminated a lot of call volume coming into our call centers, allows us to reduce cost. Customers are happy. So, we continuously look at opportunities. And so, we have dialed into our guidance for this year in our outlook. Those opportunities, we haven't given you a specific number. But I'll assure you that it's embedded in those numbers and that allows us to offset the wage inflation and also the reimbursement pressure that we provided you some color around. And that will be clearly in our sights in 2018, 2019 and 2020 and beyond. There's a lot of opportunities. Patrick Donnelly : Very helpful. Thank you. Stephen Rusckowski : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Amanda Murphy with William Blair. You may go ahead. Amanda Murphy : Hi. Good morning. Actually, just had a follow-up to AJ and Jack's questions around your hospital strategy and thank you for all the comments there. When you first outlined the kind of increased focus, you had talked about opportunities to expand relationships over time. For example, getting incremental reference work. I know it's kind of early on some of these deals, but I just was wondering if you could give some comments there in terms of how the conversations are progressing or are there any anecdotal examples of where you've been able to expand relationships over the course of the relationships that you've gotten safe now? Stephen Rusckowski : So, the one I brought up is PeaceHealth. That's a great example. They looked at their hospital -- excuse me, yeah, looked at their hospital strategy. And that's the three aspects that I talked about, how we can help them help them with their inpatients, laboratory cost. Second is, can we help them become more efficient and effective, rather, reference testing for inpatients, ordering of diagnostics and then, finally, is they had an outreach business. And we now acquired outreach business and integrating it into our west region. A great example.  I would share another example. If you recall back a couple years ago, we bought Hartford Hospitals' outreach business. The way we look at all this, Amanda, is these are beachheads. We start there and then we build. We build credibility. We build existing relationships. We manage the account. And in the case of Hartford, we continue to look at how we can help them, consolidate some of their purchases or reference testing. We had a dialogue around their hospital laboratories and should we help them become more efficient. So, a good example where working relationship, even though it starts in one year, it could build. Amanda Murphy : Have you seen actual growth then in reference testing if you think back over last year, for example? Is it actually impacting organic volume growth at this point? Stephen Rusckowski : Yeah. So, interesting enough, what you find is there's two pieces of this. One is, what's happening with our share of the marketplace. And then the second is what's happening in the hospital marketplace. So, actually, what we've seen in Q1 in hospital volumes, given admissions volumes have been relatively flat best \u2013 as we talked to hospital executives and this puts a log in our fire to help them become more efficient. There is a lot of pressure on hospitals, both from a volume perspective of patient admissions and second is reimbursement changes. And so, what we see in our reference testing business, even though we might be picking up some more share, volumes are relatively stable. And then, second is, in that portion of our business, we do see some price challenges. There's more competition. And what we have is a deliberate strategy. When we have a market like that, for the leader should get stronger and this plays into our strategy. So, many hospital systems are looking at consolidating suppliers, having a more comprehensive strategy. So, we hope over time to continue to build share, but probably more of a more challenging marketplace than two to three years ago. Mark Guinan : And just, Amanda, to add, we don't do a POS deal without a reference deal. The only question is how much of the reference business comes. No, we certainly would not just do POS alone. In many of these cases, as we shared, we serve half the hospitals in the country. And so, I'd probably say most of these cases, if not all, we already were doing some reference work. So, there's an opportunity to expand that footprint and do more or, in some cases, all of it. So, that is part and parcel of the relationship. And as we shared, we therefore locked that up in a five to seven-year contract instead of being subject to periodic RFPs and competitive situation. So, it's a nice longer-term relationship between us and the hospital. Amanda Murphy : Okay, thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. You may go ahead. Stephen Rusckowski : Good morning, Ross. Operator : Ross, your line is open. Please check your mute feature. Ross Muken : Hi. Hopefully, you can hear me. So, I'm just trying to make sense of how you are able to essentially hold margins almost flat \u2013 we're down a touch \u2013 considering what we saw with PAMA. And the part that I really would like to dig into is on the OpEx line. It looks like on the restated numbers, OpEx was sort of down even a touch year-on-year or flattish, which given the acquisitions implies the core was sort of down. And, obviously, we know you're doing some investments. So, help us understand just kind of sequentially the cadence and then what is implied to the rest of the year because that seems like really good performance considering all of the sort of things you had to deal with in the quarter on the weather and PAMA side. Stephen Rusckowski : Yeah. So, we'll tag team this. Mark and I again. First of all, as I mentioned in my quote, we did execute well. And I think as we pointed out, there is a lot of moving parts. A lot of moving parts within the quarter. And so, we had to make sure that we managed all those levers. We mentioned, in Mark's comments, we have acquisitions coming in. We have investments for tax reform. And also, there was an earlier comment about what are you doing around our Invigorate program around cost improvements. And so, within Q1, you've got all that going on. Okay? You've that all going on. And so, what we need to \u2013 what we do as a management team is we pull together that integrated plan to continue to sell progress. We get to the outlook that we laid out in the marketplace with those moving parts, with the uncertainty sometimes of what's happening in the market. For instance, you cannot predict the severe winter that we saw, but we had to manage our way through that. So, with that as a high level summary, Mark, do you want to give a little more color of the pieces? Mark Guinan : Yeah, sure. As you know, Ross, price and inflation are headwinds on margin. We talk about our productivity which we've discussed with Invigorate in the past and we said we believe we've got some cost capability. We can drive about 3% a year on a cost base of over $6 billion. So, you can do the math on that. Obviously, we have also shared that we did a substantial amount of M&A. A lot of that was skewed towards the back end. So, we expect margin expansion on that new book of business throughout the year, which will help us. And then, finally, the important piece is organic growth. So, when we grow organically, the way we've been doing, obviously, the drop-through on the incremental revenue is higher than the fully-loaded margin. So, that's another opportunity to offset some of the headwinds in price and inflation. So, when you add all those together, that's where we came out with reaffirming our longer-term outlook despite PAMA being more significant than any of us had anticipated. We still said we're going be able to do by 2020 what we said in 2016, which is topline of 3 to 5, although I did caution more likely to be in the lower end and the higher end if PAMA stays where it is and then growing our earnings. Not earnings per share, but earnings, mid-to-high single digits. But that, obviously, also directionally has correlation with the topline as well. So, probably more likely to be at the lower end than that. So, in terms of the rest of the year, the investments that Steve referenced, the $75 million, some of those are fairly smooth over the year. Some of them are accounting, like the bonus that Steve mentioned. So, we're clearly that pretty equally. And then, some of them are going to ramp up a little bit as we move throughout the year, but we also have those other factors such as strong organic growth and expansion of our acquired revenue that's been offset, that incremental investment. Ross Muken : Helpful color. Thank you, guys. Stephen Rusckowski : Thanks, Ross. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. You may go ahead. Stephen Rusckowski : Good morning, Mark. Mark Massaro : Hey, good morning. Thanks for the question. I wanted to touch on organic volumes and revenue in the quarter. Mark, I know you indicated that organic volumes are flattish. You called out 60 basis points from weather. Looking at last year, I think you actually grew organic volumes by 2.6%. And so, I think embedded in your guidance for 2018 is 1.5% to 2.5%. So, can you help us think of some of the key drivers that will get you to your midpoint of 2% organic revenue growth for the year? Mark Guinan : Yes, sure. So, volume is going to bounce around quarter-to-quarter. There is a number of factors. When you look at early last year, we had a couple POS deals that were fairly new. And then, those were obviously ramping up. We didn't close a significant amount of POS late in 2017. And, remember, our POS is organic. We're not buying anything. So, that is organic growth. Certainly, as I mentioned, the timing of the holidays \u2013 and the floating holidays have significant impact on our \u2013 so, if you have \u2013 when you look at New Year's, when you look at Fourth of July and when you look at Christmas, if those fall on a weekend versus a Wednesday, there's a dramatic difference in that quarter in terms of the volume. And so, when you look at the way this year started out, the previous year, we had New Year's on a weekend and this year we didn't. So, it's not just that day that you get a little spillover from those holiday right before or right after. Certainly, that had a little impact. So, I wouldn't make too much \u2013 read too much into the quarter to quarter slight variation. So, we'll try to share to the best of our abilities what the real drivers are and things that certainly have implications going forward. I'd say, the first quarter, there was a fair amount of noise. And there's significant in terms of utilization or other things that you might be concerned about. And we certainly are very confident of the guidance that we put out and keeping on track with our commitments. Stephen Rusckowski : Yeah. So, just to add to that, one part of reaffirming the 4% to 5%, if you look at Q1 and we go through some of the pieces, and earlier we got a question on what's happening on the hospital side, hospital admissions are stable. But we were very pleased \u2013 we kind of look at all the different pieces of the volumes we see from our physician portion of our business, which is the vast majority of where we get our testing, we are actually, when you think through the different pieces, when you think about what Mark described and some of the headwinds, and you couple with that the offset with PAMA in terms of that price reduction in Q1 and when we look at that physician business, we actually felt okay about our performance in Q1 and we thought it was solid. And therefore, we have confidence in the 4% to 5% for this year, which includes that 250 basis points for acquisition. And as you described it, the rest from organic revenue growth. Mark Massaro : Thank you, very helpful. Stephen Rusckowski : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. You may go ahead. Bryan Ross : Hi. This is Brian Ross on for Brian Tanquilut. I just had a quick one on commercial contract discussions. I know, in the past, you've highlighted the overall value prop that Quest demonstrates during payer conversations, negotiation. I guess, my question is more on how much does the value of Quest lab data play in those conversations? And do you see that becoming a bigger chip in the negotiations as we move forward? And then, secondly, how exactly is Quest currently leveraging and monetizing that data and what further opportunities do you see there as we move forward? Stephen Rusckowski : Brian, it's becoming increasingly more important, particularly as I mentioned in my introductory comments. If you get into Managed Medicaid and Medicare Advantage, when the payers are, obviously, are taking the risk and they're really trying to understand that 5% of the population represents 50% of the cost. So, what we described with our capabilities in Extended Care Services and specifically called out what we're doing with MedXM. The ability for us to have specific programs where we used the data we have to pinpoint and to identify the patient and then they use our call centers and then our onsite services, which could be in a convenient location like a Walmart, but also it could include one of our care professionals going into someone's home. So, a lot of interest around, yes, we are the world's largest lab, but what we are is the world's largest diagnostic information services company, which includes using the data to identify the opportunities and then manage the care in a more active way and bend the cost curve. Bryan Ross : Got it, thanks. Mark Guinan : And I would also add that some of the things Steve referenced, like our real-time estimation, they see the value of that because one of the difficulties that they deal with is patients being surprised about coverage, patient being surprised about cost. And so, this is, as we shared in the past, one of the win-win-win all around. The patient is happier. We're happier. The payers are happier. So, they actually appreciate us rolling out that tool. It's not just for us. It helps them quite a bit as well. So, patients can make decisions ahead instead of finding out after around coverage and cost and so on. So, really, the value that we bring goes well beyond just the data. The other one is our sales force. So, when you look at how they are struggling to control costs, we are part of the solution. The national labs are great value. And the fact that we can deploy our sales force to help them with physicians, we call it leakage or steerage, we are setting work to high cost providers. And with data from the payer, walk in and say, hey, doc, you've got some patients on high deductible plan. You're costing them money when you send them to this laboratory. Let me show you from their insurance company the difference between setting it up and sending it to this \u2013 who you're currently utilizing. That's powerful for the payers. They know that, actually, in that case, we are fully aligned. And then, finally, the retail strategy. They really like that. Yes, they want to control costs, but they want their patients to get their diagnostic work done, especially if you're monitoring a condition, if they're a risk-bearing entity. They've got Managed Medicare, Medicaid. They want those patients to get these things done. And, obviously, if we're putting in more convenient sites, it's more likely the patients will get that critical testing. Mark Guinan : A secondary value we bring to the table, I mentioned in my remarks, is around quality scores. So, if the quality scores are right, they are driving the right care process and to close those gaps in care, we help identify those patients which allows them to score better and get higher reimbursement from payers. So, it all fits together. The value is well beyond our diagnostic testing. Bryan Ross : Appreciate the color. Thanks, guys. Operator : And there are no further questions. Stephen Rusckowski : Okay. Well, we appreciate your time. Thanks for joining us today. We appreciate your support. And you have a great day.

At the request of the company, this call is being recorded. The entire contents of the call, including the presentation and question-and-answer session that will follow, are the copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics with all rights reserved. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. Now I\u2019d like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead, please. Shawn Bevec : Thank you, and good morning. I\u2019m here with Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and will discuss non-GAAP measures. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics\u2019 future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS, excluding amortization expense. As a reminder, adjusted diluted EPS excludes excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation. Additionally, net revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses have been restated for the basis of prior-year comparisons to reflect the impact of the new revenue recognition standard that became effective January 1, 2018, and were adopted on a retrospective basis. Under the new rules, the company now reports uncollectible balances associated with patient responsibility as a reduction in net revenues when historically these amounts were classified as bad debt expense within selling, general and administrative expenses. Now here is Steve Rusckowski. Steve Rusckowski : Thanks, Shawn and thanks everyone for joining us today. This morning I\u2019ll provide you with the highlights on the quarter and review progress on our 2-point strategy, which continues to drive results. And then Mark will provide more detail on second quarter performance. The highlight of the quarter was establishing, our long-term strategic partnership with UnitedHealthcare, I\u2019ll share more on this relationship in a few minutes. We delivered strong earnings growth in the quarter driven by revenue growth and the benefits of tax reform. Here are some key highlights from the quarters; revenues were up 3%, despite some headwinds in the marketplace, reported EPS was up more than 14% from 2017, the adjusted EPS grew more than 20%. Before I describe the progress we\u2019ve made, I like to provide an update on PAMA. We continue to support efforts by our trade association to implement a market-based laboratory reimbursement schedule. On the legal front, ACLA has sued CMS, and both sides have submitted their briefs to the court, we\u2019re awaiting the judge to rule on the briefs or set the date to hear or oral arguments. In the meantime, we continue our outreach efforts to find the legislative solution. Earlier this month we were pleased to learn that CMS is asking stakeholders to provide comments and also improve future data collection and reporting periods on their PAMA. This is a proper step since as we said all along, PAMA\u2019s current reporting requirements undermine any effort to establish a sustainable market-based PAMA model and deliver the care that patients need. But the key will be what CMS does with the requested comments. And moreover the need for change is now. Changing data collection for the future reported periods does not undo the harm caused by the flawed data collection process that was used in connection with establishing the current rates. Turning to the second quarter, we delivered on all five elements of our strategy to accelerate growth. The first element of our growth strategy is to grow 1% to 2% through strategically aligned accretive acquisitions. We completed our previously announced acquisition of the outreach laboratory services business of Cape Cod Healthcare in Massachusetts the leading provider of healthcare services for residents and visitors of Cape Cod. Our integration efforts from acquisitions completed in 2017, continue to drive revenue growth and our M&A pipeline remain strong. As we continued our conversations with hospital system CEO\u2019s from around the country, it\u2019s clear from those discussion there is a growing awareness of PAMA and the impact it has on their outreach laboratory business. CEO\u2019s are increasingly interested in talking more about how we can help them execute their last strategy. As you recall, this can involve improving their hospital lab operations, working with us on reference testing and potentially selling their outreach laboratory business to us. In addition to PAMA, hospital CEO\u2019s are also seeing the trend in health plans like Aetna and UnitedHealthcare partnering with high value providers like Quest to reduce laboratory spend and bring down the cost of care. Under the second element of our growth strategy, we continue to expand relationships with health plans and hospital health systems. In May we announced our long-term strategic partnership with UnitedHealthcare beginning on January 1, 2019, plus we\u2019ll be participating as a national provider of laboratory services for all UnitedHealthcare plan participants. We\u2019re excited about this partnership, as it includes a broad range of value-based programs rewarding high quality, easily accessible laboratory services at the best value and real-time data sharing to drive more personalized health. We\u2019re positioning ourselves to be well prepared to provide UnitedHealthcare members with a first-class customer experience. Our commercial team has already begun proactively reaching out to physician and customers to let to know, we\u2019ll be in that work with UnitedHealthcare on January 1. Additionally, we\u2019ll be fielding inquiries from customers who are committed to selling us an increasingly share of their UnitedHealthcare patient specimens in 2019. We\u2019re delivering on the third element of our growth strategy, which is to offer the broadest access to diagnostic innovation. We continue to see strong growth in prescription drug monitoring, QuantiFERON, tuberculosis test, noninvasive prenatal screening. In the second quarter, we did experience three dynamics which impacted the marketplace. First, the growth we saw in prescription drug monitoring marketplace although strong, it was less than expected because of policy changes opposed by some payers to limit testing. We\u2019re engaging directly with these payers to show the medical necessity of this testing and so far have had success getting at least one payer to reverse its policy change. Second, in the hepatitis C market, we saw a faster than expected decline in genotyping and resistance testing. This was largely due to the rapid acceptance, so that these new hepatitis C therapy which works across multiple genes and does not require the same level of testing as previous therapies. We still see a tremendous opportunity in hepatitis C screening. Our screening business continues to grow and we estimate two-thirds of more than 70 million baby boomers still have yet to be screened. Finally on vitamin D testing, it did slow the quarter due to increased reimbursement denials. We\u2019re working with payers and providers to ensure the appropriate testing is being performed for patients who need it. We continue to make strong progress, executing the fourth element of our growth strategy, which is to be the provider of choice for consumers. Our Walmart locations continue to see increased traffic and the well received by customers. We\u2019re now operating in 12 Walmart locations in Florida and Texas and we\u2019ll be providing more around our consumer strategies including MyQuest, our digital experience and our consumer offering at our Investor Day in November. The fifth element of our growth strategy is to support population health with data analytics and extended care services. I\u2019m excited about last month\u2019s launch of Quest Clinical Trial Connect a new patient recruitment service to help pharma companies and sterile to speed the development of new therapies. We have already engaged several pharma, biotech and sterile companies with this solution. In the area of population health in June, we released a study on employer wellness and screening at the American Diabetes Association Scientific Session showing a strong association between wellness participation and healthcare outcomes. The study showed that a third of the at-risk employees identified by screen who then participated in a behavioural health program to reduce diabetes risk, reduce glucose and hemoglobin A1c to normal levels. Also more than one-quarter participants lost 5% or more of body weight reducing the risk of many of BCD related conditions. This news is catching the attentions of both employers and health plans as they proactively look for opportunities to vendor healthcare cost curve. We\u2019re strengthening already strong position in the marketplace. The second element of our 2-point strategy is to drive operational excellence. We\u2019re continued to drive efficiency and effectiveness within Quest to cover the cost of wage inflation and reimbursement pressure. I referenced to digitize our processes are improving the customer experience. So here are two simple real examples of improving opportunities in front of us. First, as we shared previously, processing a paper requisition takes approximately 4 minutes, the enablement allows us to improve both efficiency and quality. We\u2019re making progress in our efforts to get clients systemic, electronic requisitions today more than 70% of the requisitions we received are sent electronically and this is up from approximately 60% in 2016. Second, we have developed a client from lead application, which allows physicians and their staffs to order specimen pickups. Since the launch of early last year over 5,000 clients have converted to online tick up through what we call, Quanum HCP Portal and we\u2019re adding 200 clients each week. Each day more than 13% of routine on-demand, pick up requests are received electronically through our new application. And we expect this rapid adoption will continue. Well this translates into \u2013 if you recall to our call centre in a significant fewer occurrences of our couriers arriving to find an empty lot box. Now let me turn it over to Mark, who\u2019ll take you through the financial performance. Mark? Mark Guinan : Thanks, Steve. Consolidated revenues of $1.92 billion were up 3% versus the prior year. As a reminder, we now report uncollectable balances associated with patient responsibility as a reduction of net revenues instead of bad debt due to a change in revenue recognition accounting. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services, or DIS for short, grew 3.3% compared to the prior year, driven largely by acquisitions. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 2.5% versus the prior year with acquisitions contributing approximately 200 basis points. Volume was softer than expected due in large part to the specific market dynamics highlighted by Steve earlier. Revenue per requisition in the second quarter grew by 20 basis points versus the prior year. As a reminder, revenue per req is not a proxy for price, it includes a number of variables such as unit price variation, business mix, test mix and test per req. During the second quarter, unit prices headwinds remain consistent with those observed in the first quarter with a headwind of approximately 50 basis points from PAMA and less than 100 basis points from all other factors. After netting changes to PAMA, Medicare reimbursement pressure will increase in 2019, as we have indicated previously. Beyond unit price, other mix elements remained strong in the quarter and more than offset reimbursement headwinds. Reported operating income for the quarter was $305 million or 15.9% of revenues compared to $319 million or 17.1% of revenues a year ago. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $340 million or 17.7% of revenues compared to $343 million or 18.4% of revenues last year. The decline in operating margin was due to several factors including investments using tax reform savings that had a 60 basis point adverse impact on operating margin, some of our larger acquisitions which are in the early stages of integration and therefore not yet delivering full margin and contribution and PAMA. Reported EPS was $1.57 in the quarter compared to $1.37 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $1.75 up more than 20% from $1.45 last year. During the quarter uncollectable balances associated with patient responsibility, which we now call patient price concessions were flat year-over-year. Cash provided by operations year-to-date was $503 million versus $490 million last year. Capital expenditures year-to-date were $151 million compared to $107 million a year ago, which is in line with a higher CapEx spend planned for 2018. Now turning to guidance. We are narrowing our outlook for 2018 as follows; revenues now expected to be between $7.7 billion and $7.74 billion an increase of 4% to 4.5% versus the prior year; reported diluted EPS to be between $5.50 and $5.64; and adjusted EPS to be between $6.53 and $6.67; cash provided by operation continues to be approximately $1.3 billion and capital expenditures continue to be between $350 million and $400 million. In addition, keep in mind that the investments in the business we are making related to tax reform savings will continue to ramp up as we progress throughout the remainder of 2018. Some of these investments are related to preparing to be a national in network provider for UnitedHealthcare. Our narrowed revenue guidance reflects our performance through the first half. As you think about the second half of the year consider the following; first, the actions we are taking in the areas of PDM and vitamin D testing; second, as Steve mentioned health systems are talking to us more about how we can help them execute their lab strategy. We have a few professional lab services agreements we expect to close in the second half. Taken together we expect the benefit of these items will build as we progress through the remainder of the year. Finally, last year severe hurricane impacts should make for an easier comparison this year. The majority of the impact was in the third quarter with some carryover in the fourth quarter as well. To sum it up, we expect growth to accelerate throughout the second half and remain confident in our ability to achieve our 2018 outlook. I will now turn it back to Steve. Steve Rusckowski : Thanks Mark. And to summarize, we grew revenues and delivered strong earnings in the second quarter. We\u2019re excited to build on the strategic relationship that we now have with UnitedHealthcare Group. And we remain focused on executing our 2-point strategy and we are confident, we\u2019ll meet our commitments for the remainder of 2018. Now we\u2019d be happy to take any questions. Operator? Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Patrick Donnelly : Great. Thanks. Steve Rusckowski : Hey Patrick. Patrick Donnelly : How are you? Steve Rusckowski : Good. Patrick Donnelly : When we think about the shifting payer contracts to nonexclusive, can you just talk through your initial discussions with United ahead of the contract opening up in January? How quickly you think you can capture share? And then just from the outside, what are the key dynamics to understand around the ramp up of business and your focus points going into January? Steve Rusckowski : Yes. So Patrick, thanks for the question. We have a tremendous opportunity in front of us. When we had launched the new relationship, we talked about the opportunities that have access to over 40 million lives. And we\u2019ve already started, and we\u2019ve started working on this aggressively. So we have detailed out by thousands of accounts which sales reps and which geographies will engage with customers. First of all, making them aware of the contractual changes, talk about what we need to do to potentially serve them in a broader way. And finally is, to be prepared to ramp this up as quickly as possible. And so what I will share with you is we\u2019ve already left the blocks, we\u2019re off and running. We\u2019re engaging with customers throughout the United States. The receptivity of this is quite good. They\u2019re waiting for someone for some time for us to be back on contract. And the biggest opportunity for us is, for those accounts that might have another laboratory because we were not contract with United, now have an opportunity to continue to bring us more of their laboratory services work. And then second is, we have an opportunity just broadly in many accounts to gain more share. So we\u2019re optimistic about it and working hard at it. Patrick Donnelly : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe just on the capital allocation side, pretty light quarter in terms of M&A activity, can you just update us what you are seeing in the market. Are things developing slower than you anticipate around PAMA driving consolidation or is it more just around the processes inside the hospitals taking a long time to get deal consummated. Steve Rusckowski : Yes. Patrick, just to underscore my comments, the conversations have increased. We\u2019re engaged in many more conversations today with CEO\u2019s of integrated delivery systems around their lab strategy. And in that regard, they are considering given what\u2019s happening with PAMA and given the change they see happening with health plans, for what they \u2013 should they going forward with their outreach business if they have it. So we\u2019re optimistic by the prospect. Again, there\u2019s three parts of our strategy. First is what we call professional laboratory services business. As Mark said, we\u2019ve got a few opportunities in front of us. We\u2019re hopeful in the back half to be announcing a couple of these at least. Second is, it affords us an opportunity to do more other sophisticated testing, which we call reference testing in the hospitals. And usually, when we have those conversations, we then have a conversation around outreach. So there\u2019s more conversation today than a year ago in that funnel and that whole opportunity list continues to build for us. Shawn Bevec : Operator, next question. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Steve Rusckowski : Hi, Ricky. Ricky Goldwasser : Hey, good morning. Steve Rusckowski : Good morning. Ricky Goldwasser : So first of all, a point of clarification. When we think about the guidance for second half of the year, does that incorporate continued weakness with drug monitoring, hep C and vitamin D? Mark Guinan : So Ricky, the hep C impact, we don\u2019t expect to be reversed. So that is kind of a permanent change. So we\u2019ll continue to have some headwinds on that particular part of hep C. But as Steve mentioned, screening continues to grow. So it\u2019s still an attractive business, it\u2019s just that the genotypic testing, which is largely going to go away. So continued headwinds on hep C but certainly, mitigating because there will be some business that obviously will remain in other drugs that do require that testing. On the prescription drug monitoring, we mentioned that we\u2019ve got one payer who changed their position. We are well down the road in discussing that with a couple of other payers who made those changes. We\u2019re optimistic because we think that our view is the medically appropriate approach to this very necessary important area of testing. So we have some plans in place, and we\u2019re counting on not just the one payer being reversed, but there are couple of others we\u2019re feeling like we\u2019re making progress in that space. And then on vitamin D, it\u2019s really a market that has probably not always been coded appropriately. There\u2019s changes in vitamin D that make a lot of people eligible for vitamin D testing. And there\u2019s some practices where people are still using old coding, not understanding that it\u2019s going to have an impact on the providers. So I think there is an increasing education around the appropriate use of vitamin D testing, which, of course, we support but then ensuring that you coded accurately as well to ensure that the providers could pay. So we\u2019re optimistic that some of that will be mitigated as well. And over time, and that\u2019s why we talked about increasing momentum throughout the back half of the year. Steve Rusckowski : So the guidance for the full year does contemplating, obviously, what happened in the first half but what we will address for these three issues that we talked about in our remarks in the second half as well. So yes, it\u2019s in. Ricky Goldwasser : Okay, great. And then two thoughts here. First of all, when we think about a step up in SG&A investment in preparation for bringing on the United volume, should we think about that as incremental to the $75 million in investment that are related to tax reform savings that you talked about in the past? And should we think about this as a new SG&A base that will carry over for 2019 or do you just onetime investments? And then the second thought is just on unit price. In the prepared remarks, you talked about the mix versus the unit price headwinds and you mentioned that 2019 reimbursement pressure will accelerate on the unit price. I know it\u2019s a little bit early, but how should we think about the mix versus the unit price in 2019? Mark Guinan : Yes. So thank you for the questions. First off, the investments that we talked about ramping up are included in that $75 million. So it\u2019s not incremental from the $75 million we talked about. We, in the beginning of the year, we talked about a portion of that being invested in our people in that $500 onetime bonus. We talked about some investments in the areas of accelerated growth, around advanced diagnostics and PBM. Well we didn\u2019t talk about the third piece and we couldn\u2019t because that was really earmarked for United. So it\u2019s still all contained within the initial $75 million we talked about. And then importantly, it\u2019s not all SG&A. A large portion of it is actually cost of sales. And its investment before the volume comes, but then once the volume comes, it\u2019s just cost of sales. So as we add incremental to draw centers incremental phlebotomist, couriers and laboratory tax ahead of that volume to ensure we\u2019re fully prepared for what we expect to come its in investments. But then over time, obviously, it\u2019s just the normal support you need to deliver our business. And then in terms of 2019, Ricky, I\u2019m not yet going to give any guidance for 2019. But I can assure you that when we gave the multiyear outlook when I presented in 2016 and we reaffirmed when PAMA was announced last fall, that all of that is contemplated. So we\u2019ll give you more granularity on that \u2013 on all those pieces at the Investor Day later in the year. Ricky Goldwasser : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Amanda Murphy with William Blair. You may ask your question. Steve Rusckowski : Good morning, Amanda. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is actually Max on for Amanda. Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Steve Rusckowski : Good morning. Unidentified Analyst : Just wanted to follow-up a little bit around some unit price headwinds, I know you mentioned the other 50 basis point headwinds from PAMA and 100 basis points from other factors. Can now we speak around what exactly those other factors are. How transitory do you think those factors are going to be moving forward? And that maybe also just some additional context around the benefits from mix in the quarter in terms of how much that contributed? Mark Guinan : Sure. So the \u2013 we didn\u2019t say it was 100. To clarify, it\u2019s less than 100. So that\u2019s kind of in the normal course of the last couple of years of some of the nongovernmental pricing headwinds that we\u2019ve had. And it has to do with any other part of our business, whether it\u2019s extending third-party commercial contracts, whether it\u2019s the direct business in which we compete through hospital reference testing, or it can even be in the stage where it\u2019s permitted where we are actually billing physicians directly as a client who then mark up that work and then bill it to the third-party. So we have certainly competition amongst all these areas and while we\u2019ve certainly turned the tide of where pricing was some years ago, as we said, there\u2019s still some degree of headwinds in the balance of our business. And that\u2019s generally going somewhere between 50 and 100 basis points over the last several years quarter-to-quarter and continues to be less than 100 basis points. And we mentioned that when you take price and all the mix elements together, with favorable revenue per req of 20 basis points. So obviously with 50 basis points of PAMA, somewhere south of 100 basis points on other pricing, we have significantly lift from the other mix elements. And then finally, we\u2019ve talked about professional laboratory services, which is an increasing part of our growth. It is a business that has lower revenue per req because of the unique nature of what it is. It\u2019s basic testing done for hospital in-patients, where typically, we have fewer tests per req and more basic testing. We\u2019re not doing advanced diagnostics in that business and so on. So revenue per req tends to be lower and so that creates the mixed headwinds, it\u2019s math in terms of our revenue per req. It doesn\u2019t in anyway speak to its profitability. It\u2019s still a very attractive, profitable business. It just has a low req volume and more basic routine testing. Steve Rusckowski : Yes. Just to reiterate something we always say, and Mark said in his prepared remarks, we do this calculation on revenue per requisition. But really, when you get into managing the business and understanding how that eventually yields margins, there\u2019s a lot of other considerations. Some of this lower revenue per req business actually BNP more profitable than higher req \u2013 higher dollar per requisition. So it\u2019s not necessarily a surrogate for margins at all, so something to keep in mind. So in the quarter, we improved our revenue per requisition by 20 basis points, but you saw our margin were quite good in consideration for what we had to do with a lot of the different moving pieces, as Mark outlined. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Appreciate the color on that. And following-up on a little bit of a related note. We saw a little over a week ago with the preliminary physician rule that CMS has proposed, tweaked a few thresholds to define what\u2019s an applicable lab for reporting purposes. Just wondered if there\u2019s been any discussions around what the implications could be of this internally or externally as you continue to adopt PAMA here in 2018? Steve Rusckowski : As I said in my prepared remarks, we\u2019re encouraged that they\u2019re asking us for input related to how to improve the data reporting. Albeit, we still believe what they did with the current Clinical Lab Fee Schedule was wrong and that needs to be corrected and we\u2019re challenging CMS in that regard. Prospective, we do need to get it right. We are pursuing a legislative solution to that. And we\u2019re engaging, as we have all along, with CMS, on how we conclude more labs and how do we get the statistics to really reflective of the market-based approach to laboratory services. So we\u2019re encouraged by that. Second, on the physician fee schedule there will be modest tweaks in that. We think it\u2019s for 2019 not necessarily that notable for our business. That was a small piece of our anatomic pathology business that had billed that way. But nothing that\u2019s material for us. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from A.J. Rice with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. You may ask your question. A.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. First all, just cleanup questions from previous ones. Is there any way that we can quantify the headwind you saw from the drug testing hep C, vitamin D in terms of maybe percentage headwind that represented? Mark Guinan : Yes. So we have been at a pretty steady rate of organic improvements in organic growth over the last number of quarters. And then obviously, we\u2019ve fallen back from that. Really, the things that we talked about are really the primary drivers of that difference, A.J. So I\u2019m not going to give a specific number. What I would say is those are the reconciliation between kind of the run rate organic performance we\u2019ve been delivering consistently and what we delivered in the second quarter. Steve Rusckowski : Yes. So we outlined the three areas A.J., in the remarks. And if you look at the issues that we saw reflect what we thought we could have done versus what we really did do. So those three, we will quantify exactly of the three buckets the total will be broken down from. But they do outline the difference between expectations to the market, our expectations and what we actually delivered. A.J. Rice: Okay. And then my follow-up\u2026 Steve Rusckowski : Now with that said, we are taking actions for a few of those to reverse it in Q3 and Q4. We mentioned the work we\u2019re doing with payers on the prescription drug monitoring, the work we\u2019re doing with payers around vitamin D. As Mark said, the hep C care business, which is the genotyping and resistance testing business will essentially slow down because it\u2019s no longer needed to give the new therapy for AbbVie. But the screening business continues to be a big opportunity and there\u2019s plenty of baby boomers left that need to be screened. So even though it did slow in the quarter, we\u2019re working on things to reverse that in the second half. A.J. Rice: Okay. And then my follow-up, I just want to ask you about a couple of growth opportunities. We talk a lot about United, Optum is in the process of buying DaVita Medical Group. I know lots of that medical group practice that volume tends to go to you. Have you look at opportunity that might present for you and given any sizing of that? And then is there any update on your work with HCA, I know about a year, 1.5 years ago, you started working with them in Denver and the idea was just sort of exploring opportunities and that could extend. Any update on those\u2013 that discussion? Steve Rusckowski : Yes. So first of all, on Optum, when we talked about our relationship with UnitedHealthcare group, it\u2019s well. We currently are now back in network in 2019 with UHC as an in-network provider laboratory services. That\u2019s big. As you know, we have partnered with them on revenue cycle management. We\u2019re one of their biggest customers. Third is, we provide wellness services for Optum. So we are their somewhat exclusive provider of wellness services for OptumCare when they sell those to payers. Also, we\u2019re \u2013 they\u2019re becoming one of our biggest customers. To your specific question in OptumCare, as you said, their buying physicians and they\u2019re buying many of our existing customers. And the opportunity to beat up the physician business supports yet another opportunity. So if that closes, they\u2019ll be close to \u2013 they have close to 50,000 physicians, and we\u2019re actively working with them on how we can better serve all their physicians, the existing accounts but also growing \u2013 their growing list of physicians in OptumCare. So this relationship continues to build, and we see a good growth prospect of building a bigger and better relationship with OptumCare as they consolidate those practices into their business going forward. Second part of the question\u2026 Mark Guinan : On HCA. Steve Rusckowski : HCA. The Denver opportunity which is called the continental division is going well. We\u2019re optimistic that we can leverage that relationship throughout the rest of HCA. We continue to work that. And as Mark said, there will be more professional laboratory services relationships announced in the second half. So stay posted. Mark Guinan : Yes. I would just add, A.J., and certainly you can ask them, but I\u2019m very confident they would tell you that we\u2019ve delivered the quality and the cost savings that they were looking for target up front. So now, of course, the question is what does that mean? Could it mean we expand to other sites? I would think, at the point in time, if we have something to announce, we are happy to announce it. But I think the good news is that both parties are happy with what was delivered and it\u2019s worked out very well. A.J. Rice: Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Steve Rusckowski : Thanks, A.J. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays. You may ask your question. Jack Meehan : Hey, good morning. Steve Rusckowski : Good morning. Jack Meehan : My first question, I was curious if you could weigh in on the Women\u2019s Health Business in the quarter? I think there was some impact in the first quarter from the weather and the flu. Just what were some of the trends you were seeing in the second quarter there? Steve Rusckowski : Yes. First of all, as we\u2019ve mentioned in our remarks, the prenatal testing business continues to grow nicely. So we\u2019re optimistic about that. Second is if you look at just ongoing activity, and we\u2019ve showed this many, many times, if you look at our existing accounts and we do the same account or same-store analysis. And if you look at activity within those accounts that we know we have, we haven\u2019t lost any share. I would say, just in general the market\u2019s stable. And I would say, just in general, that\u2019s true for let\u2019s just call it the more routine portion of our Women\u2019s Health business. We continue Jack to see a continuation of the slow decline in our path business. The change in practice guidelines back in 2013 did affect the marketplace, where women in the past used to go annually for their check, that\u2019s happening less frequently and that continues to be phased in, even though it\u2019s been about five years. But just in general, the general volume from our Women\u2019s Health business continues to be stable. Jack Meehan : Great. And then I had two follow-ups on capital deployment. I caught M&A added 2% of volume, what was the total revenue contribution? And then on share repurchase, I think this is the first quarter with no repurchase since 2011. So just if you could give any color on what you think the pacing is from here and why no repurchase in the quarter? Mark Guinan : Yes. So the contribution from M&A was similar, so there wasn\u2019t a big difference. Obviously what we\u2019re buying, Jack, is a business that\u2019s very similar to our core business. So you wouldn\u2019t see a tremendous mix difference that are differential between the volume and revenue contribution. Jack Meehan : And then on share repurchase. Mark Guinan : Yes. So share repurchases, we actually were quiet in the quarter. We stepped out of the market due to what we thought was the impending announcement of UnitedHealthcare. So going forward, as we said, we\u2019re going to do the minimal level to meet our 50% or at least half commitment of cash returned to our \u2013 or free cash flow returned to our shareholders. Certainly, you should expect that level of activity. But any other share repurchases would be dependent on the amount of M&A activity we have in the back half. Jack Meehan : Great. Thank you, Mark and Steve. Steve Rusckowski : Thanks, Jack. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. You may ask your question. Brian Tanquilut : Hey good morning guys. Mark Guinan : Hey, Brian. Brian Tanquilut : Steve, so I guess, as I think about the recent rule that came out of CMS, the rule proposal, and how they\u2019re still viewing, obviously, PAMA as excluding the hospitals. How do you \u2013 assuming that holds, right? How do you view the recent changes in manage your contracting, with you getting to United, and LabCorp getting to Aetna? How does that impact the repricing of PAMA a few years down the road? Steve Rusckowski : Well, what they used, Brian, for the majority of the data points for what we got in a refresh of a clinical fee schedule, the vast majority of the data points were from the two large nationals. So that was what was used. And we think that was incredibly flawed in its approach. Imagine what CMS buys from all the laboratories they buy it from thousands of laboratories, roughly 20% of what they buy is from the nationals. So the date they collected was a distortion of what they really buy. And so this is one of the biggest points we have. They got to collect more data from more laboratories. And as you know, there\u2019s wide variation in this marketplace and the best value is from a company like Quest Diagnostics. So that was the data they collected. We\u2019re hopeful. Given this current request for more data, now they can collect more data. The advocacy by asking the question, they got it wrong and they need to get it right the next time they collected data. And again, we\u2019re challenging what they did in the first time around lawsuit. It\u2019s still in the court. We\u2019re hopeful that, that will progress, and we\u2019ll have a favorable consideration there. But in parallel with that, we\u2019re also looking for a legislative solution. So we\u2019re currently continue to work this because we believe, at its core, the refreshed clinical \u2013 the lab fee schedule was done wrongly. But given all that, what we\u2019ve outlined in our guidance for this year, what we\u2019ve outlined in our outlook for 2019 and 2020 is assuming worst case. That is if this sticks and it continues to be the case then that in fact will be what we\u2019ll absorb, and we will be able to manage the business and hit our outlook despite it. So hopefully, we\u2019ll have better news in that regard, but we\u2019re assuming the worst case. And then into the future, yes, there will be data points gathered from payers. But again, hopefully there\u2019ll be more laboratories included in data collection process, so therefore, that will move the needle quite a bit. So hopefully, that answers your question. Mark Guinan : Yes. So let me just quickly comment, Brian, on its impact on PAMA. So as we shared, we\u2019re very vocal with all the payers, not just getting United, and I certainly can\u2019t speak for our competitor. But I can tell you that when we go in there and say, hey, now there\u2019s full transparency. We know where the weighted volume median is amongst the national provider, we know we provide the best prices. And the fact that you already get the best prices from us and that we\u2019re going to be paying for potentially twice, with PAMA, means like you\u2019re not getting any better prices. And if anything, it\u2019s an opportunity \u2013 it has been opportunity for us to talk about getting paid for more because these are getting paid more because they think we paid a little bit more than we have been recently or historically, it\u2019s still a less better value than the majority of the people they\u2019re paying. And in fact, in the United contract, when we talk about value-based contracting, as we move volume away from those high-cost providers, part of the contract is what you\u2019d call a bonus rate. So basically, we share the savings with our partner and that will ensure that as we\u2019re saving the healthcare system patients and the payers all money that it doesn\u2019t damage us from a PAMA perspective, but actually, it should be neutral to positive depending on how we\u2019re performing and where that volume growth comes from. Brian Tanquilut : No. I appreciate that. And I guess the follow-up to that is as we think about the networks built around United and Aetna, how do you think about the pace of market share shift? Not necessarily from your national competitor but from the regional\u2019s. What is that opportunity and how hard of a lift or how heavy of a lift is that? Steve Rusckowski : Well, that\u2019s the opportunity in front of us, this relationship with United, and we we\u2019re having conversations with all the payers. Despite the two nationals having strong presence, there\u2019s still an opportunity to pick up share for the rest of the marketplace. We talk about the opportunity, when we talk about United, you have roughly more than 40 million lives, you go quickly through the mathematics of that. We basically have shared that their spend \u2013 laboratory spend is north of $7 billion in that regard. If you look at the two large nationals, it\u2019s still a minority. It\u2019s still the opportunity given the trend in general in healthcare is to move more of those higher cost, more expensive laboratory volumes to us. And so what we\u2019re detailing right now is precisely that. We\u2019re knocking on the doors of many \u2013 thousands of customers, Brian. And they have many laboratories and many of those laboratories aren\u2019t the two large nationals, but there are many others. And in some cases, they have those laboratories because we were not in network with United. They no longer need those laboratories to serve them and therefore, those supporters are big opportunities. So we need to think about this not just between us and the other large national but more importantly, the opportunity to really continue to gain share, particularly for the regional portion of this market. Brian Tanquilut : I appreciate. Thanks Steve. Steve Rusckowski : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Lisa Gill : Great. Thanks and good morning. Steve Rusckowski : Good morning, Lisa. Lisa Gill : Good morning. In your prepared comments, when talking about United, you talked about value-based program. When we think about the contracting for the new relationship, is it a traditional lab relationship when we think about being paid for the req? Or are you seeing changes in the way that your contracting around value-based programs? That\u2019s my first question. And then secondly, if that\u2019s not the case, can you help us understand what some of the opportunities are around value-based programs, especially with United and Aetna as you think about the new contracts? Mark Guinan : Yes. So Lisa, it is a traditional relationship. We\u2019re paid for activity. Generally, obviously, there\u2019s some portions where they\u2019re fully insured where they have an HMO plan. But for the most part, this is a traditional fee-for-service contract. The difference is that the rate is variable dependent on our performance. So when we talk about value-based contracting, and as I referenced earlier, there is incentive payments that we can earn by saving the money. When I say saving them, I\u2019m talking about not just the United but obviously, the healthcare system and especially the patient. So there\u2019s an awful lot of work going to high-cost providers. Some of it\u2019s because they have significantly higher prices. So we\u2019ve talked about hospitals and physician-owned laboratories but even some regional players. The other thing is that the payers are becoming increasingly aware that we don\u2019t all conduct ourselves in the same way. So price is one thing but the level of activity for a patient with for a patient with a given condition is also a driver. So you can have some labs that might have lower pricing with same pricing as we do but they\u2019re actually charging more because there\u2019s more activity for a given condition. So really, the focus around what is the total cost per interaction with a patient in saving money on that by doing things medically appropriate at a good price. And to the extent that, that saves money for the system and overall stakeholder, some of that will come back to us. So there\u2019s incentives for us. A lot more detail will come down the road. We believe that, around the middle of next year or maybe a little ahead of that, United will talk about their preferred network and what some of the conditions are to be a preferred provider. But also some of the structures, including things that we are hopeful about including planned benefit design, where there is actually incentives for patients and others in the decision process financially to drive things towards that preferred network because that preferred network will be at the highest quality and the best value of any of the options within the network. So that\u2019s about what we can share right now. And we\u2019re very excited about it because that is different from, historically, where we would get a network and to a large extent, it would be kind of good luck, I hope you do well because you have great value. In this case, United and certainly we\u2019re talking with other payers about some of the relationships actually is going to be partnering with us, working to drive that, not just sitting on the sidelines and opening we do all of that on our own. Lisa Gill : Great. That\u2019s very helpful. And then secondly, you did comment on the Walmart relationship but is there any update on or any other retail relationships that you have the market? Steve Rusckowski : Well, first of all, Safeway continues to go very well. We\u2019ve said that we\u2019re approaching 200 stores. The results in those stores have been great. So we\u2019re very encouraged there. Second is we continue to build out the presence in Walmart. And the number will be a significantly higher than 12 stores, I can assure you of that. And yes, it\u2019s putting a draw stations in, but it\u2019s also providing better healthcare, more healthcare services, with what we call extended healthcare services. The conversation has become very broad and deep. Matter of fact, today, I\u2019m meeting with a very Senior Executive from Walmart about that about that opportunity. Our JV and specifically Walmart is doing in the healthcare. So we continue to build that out. And then third is we are testing. We\u2019re doing some pilots with some other retailers. As we mentioned in the past, we\u2019ve done work with CBS in the Mediclinic\u2019s with their pending potential merger with Aetna. We have great relationship with Aetna, we have a great relationship with CBS. The opportunity that they see also is what we\u2019ve been talking about here. So we\u2019re optimistic of working more productivity potentially with CBS and Aetna as they expand the potential merger with those two companies as well. So a lot in front of us. We have the right strategy, we\u2019re executing it and we\u2019re making a lot of progress. Lisa Gill : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum. Your line is open. You may ask you question. Kevin Ellich : Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Hey Steve, just wanted to follow-up on your consumer comments to Lisa\u2019s question. I guess, as we think about it big picture and holistically, over time, how much do you think all of these consumer initiatives can really add to your growth, whether it\u2019s to volume or revenue? Steve Rusckowski : Well, we think \u2013 if you take a step back and look at where we\u2019re going. Our access with United would be greater than 90%. So we ought to remove the obstacles of not being in network with many of the majority health plans throughout the United States. And in the big states, as we mentioned, when we announced united relationship, the big states of New York, Texas, Florida and California, our access is greater than 95%, so a very strong access. So when we have access, we have an opportunity to compete for laboratory services and accounts. So that\u2019s number one. So great access, it\u2019s improving every day. Second is the consumer is becoming increasingly important, particularly as employers have pushed more of the cost in healthcare to consumers. Consumers, patients are asking questions of what they could do to lower their out-of-pocket cost and also serve themselves in a better way. And so our consumer strategy addresses that, that is making sure that we have a great experience for that patient and the consumer. So many aspects are factored into that. One is what we\u2019ve done with our electronic, our e-tools, we call it MyQuest. We not only have over 5 million registered users, the application continues to get stronger every day. You now can get to lab results, you can schedule an appointment. You could see late times in a Patient Service Center throughout any area you\u2019re in and there will be more to come. So that\u2019s exciting, looking more and more like a contemporary consumer application every day. Second, our access gets better and better. We\u2019re refreshing over Patient Service Centers. You will see that if you go into a number of your Patient Service Center throughout the United States and then we augment that with the access through retailers, so we\u2019ll have more retail-like settings, making it much more physically easy for consumers to go to Quest Diagnostics. Third is we\u2019ll have products. And we have taken our experience in Arizona and also in Colorado, in Missouri with the direct-to-consumer offering. We now believe that\u2019s close to 20 states that we can go direct to consumers. We\u2019re working on driving that solution there\u2019ll be more to come in that regard in the fall. And with all that, when you take a step back and you say when the physician eventually knows that we\u2019re on network and they ask their patient, who would you like to go to, Quest or someone else? They remember that great experience. We have experiences as far as their data. And they also know that it\u2019s not ordered by the physicians, they can order product directly from us like a check up on their cholesterol or their diabetes and hemoglobin A1c. So we think directionally, it\u2019s going to help us gaining share in the marketplace because healthcare is becoming increasingly more of a consumer marketplace. Kevin Ellich : Got you. That\u2019s super helpful, Steve. Steve Rusckowski : Thank you. Kevin Ellich : And then just a quick follow-up on the headwind that you called out earlier on the call, hep C, drug testing, vitamin D. What \u2013 did that have any impact on your \u2013 or what impact did it have on your revenue per requisition, if any? Mark Guinan : Yes, really not anything substantive. I mean, those businesses are within the same that cover the overall revenue per req. Kevin Ellich : Sounds good. Thanks, Mark. Mark Guinan : Yeah, the one difference is obviously, when you get denials that\u2019s going to have a negative impact. So when you don\u2019t and the tests aren\u2019t ordered like in a hep C case, then it kind of has a neutral impact. But certainly, when we do work and then get denied, obviously, that\u2019s a headwind to revenue per req. Kevin Ellich : Yes, thank you. Operator : Thank you. You next question comes from Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question. Mark Guinan : Hi, Dan. Dan Leonard : Hello. Just one question on the pacing of M&A. So how much of a catalyst you think UnitedHealthcare contract is going to be by itself with its value-based components? And how quickly do you think that could accelerate some of the discussions you\u2019re having with healthcare system CEOs? Steve Rusckowski : Well, the first catalyst is PAMA, okay? So PAMA is a substantial change for hospitals renting outreach businesses. So in many hospital system outreach businesses, their Medicare mix is 25%, 30%, so not insignificant. And when they\u2019re looking at essentially a 30% cut over three years, it\u2019s a notable difference. That\u2019s number one. Second is they are seeing what\u2019s happening with United and also with Aetna. And they there are hearing that what those two large nationals have done will carry over to the rest of the health insurance market place. So they\u2019re realizing there will be pressure on their commercial race going forward for ancillary services and in this case, laboratory services. So with all that, so long as \u2013 we\u2019ve already \u2013 we\u2019ve always had great access around this \u2013 talking to them around their last strategy, but it is accelerating the pace of them considering their options going forward. Dan Leonard : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. You may ask you question. Mark Massaro : Hey thanks guys. So your large lab competitor will be coming in that network lab provider to Aetna beginning in 2018. Is there anything your team can or need to do to defend your share of that business? And then secondly, do you expect a resolution from the PAMA lawsuit perhaps in Q3? Steve Rusckowski : Yes. So first of all, we\u2019re actively detailing out account by account what we need to do. The way we broadly think about is in three categories. One, we have great accounts. And account \u2013 a client might be using an old laboratory that they have to, because we work with the United, and we\u2019re going directly for those accounts and we\u2019ll try to flip those as quickly as possible. So as I said earlier, we\u2019ve left the blocks and we\u2019re running. And we\u2019re detailing our thousands of accounts throughout United States with our sales force and with our regional teams. Number two, there is accounts kind of a mixed model where they\u2019re using multiple labs. And now where we have much more of significant share of their laboratory volume because we\u2019re back in network, it\u2019s an opportunity where they potentially get to a tipping point, and we potentially could become the majority of their lab service providers. So we have a number of accounts that the categories that way. And the third category as we\u2019ve outlined is, in some cases, we are not the majority in our another national competitor has more share. And we\u2019re also detailing out those to make sure we defend what we deliver, our value that we deliver everyday is quite good, our quality gets better, our service performance is outstanding, our consumer strategy is resonating. And so we think we have a very, very strong requisition \u2013 value proposition to defend that piece of our marketplace as well. Operator : Are you ready for the next question? Steve Rusckowski : Yes. Operator : Thank you. That comes from Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities. You may ask the question. Ann Hynes : Hi, good morning. Steve Rusckowski : Good morning, Ann. Mark Guinan : Good morning. Ann Hynes : Just a couple of follow-up questions. One is, your DSOs are up year-over-year four or five days and then up sequentially, is that due to acquisitions? Or is that a lot to do with increased denials for the vitamin D in the drug monitoring testing? Mark Guinan : Yes. So Ann, the denials are not increasing our DSOs. The denials we don\u2019t recognize revenue. So what\u2019s really driving it is handful of things, one of them is we\u2019re doing a significant laboratory conversion in one of our major labs and billing just ends up being a little more delayed. It\u2019s a rhythm of things that we\u2019ve done over time. It\u2019s nothing to be concerned about. In fact, if you look at the aging of the DSOs, the profile has not really changed. So if you look at the key metric and what proportion of our DSOs are over 90 days, it hasn\u2019t changed even though the DSOs have gone up. So this is just a temporary spike and something that we\u2019re not concerned at all about and very confident that we\u2019re going to hit our $1.3 billion operating cash flow guidance that we provided. Ann Hynes : Okay. And then I think in your prepared remarks, you talked about you think the growth will accelerate in the second half and you\u2019re confident, you\u2019ll make your guidance. So is that driven by acquisitions? Or do you think that organic growth will improve from the 0.5% that you reported this quarter? Mark Guinan : So our organic growth will markedly improve. We walked through the drivers. Obviously, it\u2019s an easier compare so that\u2019s part of it. We just to remind everybody about that, the majority of that compares in Q3, but we had a little bit of impact in Q4. So each of the quarters are going to get some lift from that. We mentioned, both Steve and I, that we have some professional laboratory services deals that we feel are very close. That\u2019s organic. And we\u2019re expecting to get some volume for that in the back of the year, with that accelerating sequentially. And then the actions that we talked about that we\u2019ve taken around prescription drug monitoring and vitamin D denials, where we\u2019ve gotten some of those addressed, and we\u2019re optimistic that a couple others are in the cusp that they will help as well. And then of course, as we near the entry to the United contract, we would expect that some of that volume will flip over a little bit early. So when you put all of those pieces together, that\u2019s why we\u2019re highly confident. So we\u2019re not depending on executed M&A but obviously, to the extent that we do some deals between now and the end of the year that would just be additional upside. Ann Hynes : Okay, great. And just one last test. With the hepatitis C testing, I think you highlighted that the drug monitoring testing and the vitamin D should come back once you work with the payers, but the hep C won\u2019t. Is that a huge percentage of volume as a percentage hep C testing? Mark Guinan : No. It\u2019s not a huge percent. It\u2019s a small percentage. But every several million dollars makes a difference in quarterly performance. I think a lot of that is behind us, because we\u2019re not experts, but we believe that AbbVie has more than half the market already. And therefore, a lot of that is already behind us. Steve Rusckowski : And the other part is \u2013 there\u2019s two parts to what we call a hep C care, which is the testing we do if you\u2019ve been prescribed the drug that is going to decline. Second part is the screening piece of this. So we did see a small decline in the growth rate, and we\u2019re hopeful there\u2019s still a tremendous opportunity in front of us that we\u2019re going to work with the pharmaceutical companies to continue to build on the awareness necessary in the marketplace. Because as I said in my prepared remarks, there\u2019s still a majority of baby boomers, 70 million of us, that still need to be screened. So that\u2019s slow as well in Q2. And we\u2019re hopeful in the back half with some of the work we\u2019re doing to build awareness with pharma, that should pick up as well. Mark Guinan : But just to be clear, it\u2019 still growing, it just didn\u2019t grow as fast. Steve Rusckowski : Grow fast. Yes. Ann Hynes : Okay. Okay, great. Thank you so much. Steve Rusckowski : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. You may ask your question. Ralph Giacobbe : Thanks. Good morning. Hopped on a little bit late, so I\u2019m not sure if you gave this, but do you have a baseline of how much drug monitoring, hep C and vitamin D all in makeup of total requisitions? Just a rough ballpark? Mark Guinan : Ralph, we haven\u2019t provided that. We have other franchises, other testing segments that are obviously a lot larger. Certainly, our chemistry panels and our lipid panels and so on. I think these are already \u2013 obviously areas, not Vitamin D as much, but the Hep C and prescription monitoring are major growth drivers for us. And prescription drug monitoring, as Steve mentioned and I did as well, continues to be a growth driver. It\u2019s just slowed somewhat because of these policy changes that we, again, feel are inappropriate. It really has to do everything with \u2013 around covering definitive testing after screening. The traditional practice has been, if you do a screen and it\u2019s positive, you move automatically or revert to the definitive on the same day with the same sample. And some of the payers for reasons that we are pushing back on deciding they would change that and make the patient come back in for a second trial. We don\u2019t think that\u2019s medically appropriate. So that was a big headwind in PDM why we slowed our growth. And then on hep C, certainly, we expect that to continue to grow. It\u2019s a nice business, but certainly, it\u2019s nowhere near some of the routine testing or other requisition volume that we see within our business. Steve Rusckowski : Yes. So what we did is we outlined three areas that caused us to have less than what we had expected in Q2. We started working already on Q2 on some of the remedies for that slow down. And so the ones that we outlined particularly around prescription drug monitoring, the growth rate was strong but not nearly as strong in the past, and again, what we talked about with Vitamin D. So we\u2019ve already started to work on these in Q2 that will carry over and will have some rebound in the portion of this. But what we want to do is provide visibility where we thought we were going to do \u2013 have a stronger performance in Q2, we did not. And we outlined those in the three that we provided to you. Ralph Giacobbe : Okay. And is there anything separately \u2013 is there anything with the timing of the UNH contract we need to be aware of? In other words, I know the contract starts Jan 1, 2019. So you remain out-of-network for this year with UNH and sort of still charge the out-of-network rate or have you agreed to sort of annual network rate sooner even without the open network? Mark Guinan : Yes. So I\u2019m not going to comment on any specifics around rates, but we remain out-of-network, we\u2019ve been adjudicated out-of-network for the balance of the year. And then as we said, starting January 1, we\u2019ll be in for majority of their plans, there\u2019s still some HMO plans that we are working for the details. But for the vast majority of United, we\u2019re going to be in network as of January 1. Ralph Giacobbe : Okay. Last one if I could squeeze it in. Just \u2013 and I know you\u2019re going to guide for 2019 at this point, but can you give us a directional sense of margin as we think about next year? There\u2019s a lot of moving parts, obviously, with PAMA headwinds, UNH coming on, Aetna opening up, the investments you\u2019re making. In your mind, does that mean that make there\u2019s sort of a revenue boost and we should think about margins as generally flat? Or do you think you can get margin expansion or vice versa? Do you think there could be some margin contraction as we think just directionally of the margin trend for 2019? Mark Guinan : Yes. So Ralph, as I am sure you would expect, I can\u2019t comment on 2019 in any way specifically. But what I did talk about was on a multi-year basis that we would grow earnings, not earnings per share, but earnings faster than the top line over multi-year. So certainly, from a given year-to-year, that formula might be a little bit different. So we \u2013 that obviously implies continued margin expansion. Now margin \u2013 net margin, so obviously with tax reform, we took advantage of that and made some investments, which actually reduced our \u2013 before tax margin slightly this year, had some impact on that. But we would expect to continue that over multi-year look, and we\u2019ll give an update on that in November on our Investor Day. Ralph Giacobbe : Okay. All right, thank you. Steve Rusckowski : Okay. Well, thanks for joining us today. We appreciate your support, and have a great day. Operator : Thank you for participating in the Quest Diagnostics Second Quarter 2018 Conference Call.

The entire contents of the call, including the presentation and question and answer session that will follow, are the copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics with all rights reserved. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. Now, I like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Please, go ahead. Shawn Bevec : Thank you, and good morning. I am here with Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and will discuss non-GAAP measures. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics\u2019 future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS, excluding amortization expense. As a reminder, adjusted diluted EPS excludes excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation. Additionally, net revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses have been restated for the basis of prior year comparisons to reflect the impact of the new revenue recognition standard that became effective January 1, 2018 and was adopted on a retrospective basis. Under the new rules, the company now reports uncollectible balances associated with patient responsibility, which we will refer to as patient concessions, as a reduction in net revenues when historically these amounts were classified as bad debt expense within SG&A expenses. Now, here is Steve Rusckowski. Steve Rusckowski : Thanks Shawn, and thanks everyone for joining us today. This morning, I\u2019ll provide you with the highlights of the quarter and review progress on our two-point strategy. Then Mark will provide more detail on third quarter performance and give you an update on our outlook for 2018. We grew revenues and continued to deliver strong earnings growth in the quarter. Revenues were up nearly 2%, despite the effect of industry headwinds we called out last quarter. Reported EPS was up more than 32% from 2017. Adjusted EPS grew more than 25%. As you saw, we have revised our full-year revenue guidance to reflect lower than expected revenue performance this year, which was affected primarily by two factors. First, as we detailed in the second quarter, we faced headwinds in the areas of prescription drug monitoring, hepatitis C, and vitamin D testing. While we made some progress, these testing areas continued to impact revenue growth in the third quarter. Second, in the third quarter, we also saw a rise in patient concessions, which Mark will touch on later. Before getting into the details of the progress we\u2019ve made in the quarter, I'd like to provide context on some market trends, starting with an update on PAMA. Last month, a US District Court judge dismissed on narrow procedural grounds our trade association\u2019s lawsuit over the implementation of new Medicare pricing for lab tests under PAMA. The Court\u2019s opinion, however, acknowledges that ACLA\u2019s arguments on the merits raise important questions, about HHS\u2019s actions. This is, of course, disappointing for our industry; and it is potentially harmful to Medicare beneficiaries. Last week, ACLA appealed the District Court\u2019s decision, demanding a hearing on the merits. At the same time, the industry continues to pursue a legislative fix. Additionally, CMS and our industry continues to work together on addressing the current PAMA issues. So, as we sit here today, PAMA is having an impact on Quest and the rest of the lab market. Increasingly, smaller independent labs and hospital outreach labs are struggling financially, due to lower Medicare reimbursement, not only directly due to PAMA, but also under contracts with pricing indexed to Medicare. Some have begun to exit the business, citing PAMA as a factor. We\u2019re continuing to plan and manage our business as if PAMA is here to stay. At the same time, there has been increasing scrutiny of the wide variation in health care pricing in the popular press. Consumers and employers, who pay for most of healthcare, are becoming more price sensitive. Last month, the Wall Street Journal reported that health plans that exclude costly providers can be much less expensive for consumers and employers. Quest offers a great customer experience, and coupled with our scale and efficiency, it makes us an exceptional value in the market, compared with hospital outreach labs, which often charge two-to-five times more than Quest. So, in short, there are three reasons we believe the market will continue to consolidate and therefore afford us an opportunity to accelerate growth. First, reduced reimbursement through the Medicare Clinical Lab Fee Schedule is beginning to have an impact on the laboratory industry. Second, health plans are embarking on a new strategy, looking to national labs to help drive efficiency in lab spending. And the finally, consumers and their employers are more attuned to the variation in healthcare pricing. Turning to the third quarter, I\u2019ll review our execution against the five elements of our strategy to accelerate growth. The first element of our growth strategy is to grow 1% to 2% through strategically aligned, accretive acquisitions. We announced three acquisitions in the third quarter, which strengthen our capabilities in several key areas. First, our acquisition of PhenoPath, which has a strong record of innovation, provides several capabilities that complement and extend our own, particularly in the area of pathology and molecular oncology. It also expands our presence in the Pacific Northwest. Our acquisition of the U.S. laboratory services business of Oxford Immunotec will extend our capabilities in infectious disease diagnostics. It will also bring us greater choice to physicians who seek innovative blood-based tuberculosis and tickborne disease testing. And then finally, our acquisition of ReproSource expands our expertise in reproductive diagnostics. Since the third quarter close, we have also announced the acquisition of Hurley Medical Center\u2019s outreach lab operation in Flint, Michigan. In this case the seller indicated reimbursement pressure as a factor in deciding to exit the business. Additionally, we acquired the assets of Provant Health to strengthen our employer wellness business. So, the acquisitions we have announced and will close in 2018, already position us within our 1% to 2% revenue growth target for next year. And, as I indicated, PAMA should further contribute to our strong M&A pipeline. Under the second element of our growth strategy, we continue to expand relationships with health plans and hospital health systems. We continue our preparations to take advantage of the opportunity to offer a first-class customer experience for UnitedHealthcare providers and their members when we become an in-network lab provider on January 1. Our commercial team has already been proactively reaching out to educate physician customers about their ability to use Quest for their UnitedHealthcare members. The revenue opportunity presented by the United contract will ramp over time. We do expect some portion of this new work to transition quickly. However, the larger opportunity to help UnitedHealthcare drive lower lab spend is expected to be realized over the next several years. The third element of our growth strategy is to offer the broadest access to diagnostic innovation. Our announced acquisitions in the quarter mentioned earlier will enhance our capabilities in advanced diagnostics, especially in the areas of Women\u2019s Health and Infectious Disease. We continue to see strong growth in prescription drug monitoring and Quantiferon tuberculosis testing. Additionally, this quarter we saw solid growth in Cardio IQ, as well as testing for sexually transmitted diseases. On our second quarter call, we highlighted several market headwinds that impacted growth in prescription drug monitoring, hepatitis C and vitamin D testing. We saw modest improvement in the third quarter. For example, PDM denials have steadily improved each quarter this year. We\u2019ve also started to lap hep C headwinds we began to experience roughly a year ago. In aggregate, the issues we have mentioned related to these three tests contributed approximately 100 basis points of headwinds this year against our original revenue expectations. We continue to make progress executing the fourth element of our growth strategy, which is to be the provider of choice for consumers. Quest Walmart locations continue to see increased traffic and generate great feedback from our customers. In fact, for locations open more than 6 months, we\u2019ve seen an uptick in volumes compared to the patient service centers they replaced. We are currently operating inside 21 Walmart stores in Florida, Texas and now Illinois. We combined with our partnership with Safeway, we expect to have well over 200 patient service centers in retail store locations by the end of 2018. Consumers continue to embrace our digital experience. We now have more than 6 million users on our MyQuest app that lets them view and analyze test results, schedule their appointments, see patient service center wait times, and then finally pay their bills. The fifth element of our growth strategy is to support population health with data analytics of extended care services. We\u2019re seeing continued interest in Quest Clinical Trials Connect, which we launched in June. This is a new patient recruitment service to help pharma companies and CROs increase the speed of commercializing new therapies. We\u2019re working with several pharma, biotech and CRO companies with this new solution. The second element of our two-point strategy is to drive operational excellence. At the end of September, we launched a new appointment scheduling system for our patients. This new system utilizes best-in-class technologies to help patients schedule appointments at a convenient location. In the second week of deployment alone, we saw appointment-related calls into the National Customer Service center drop by more than 10%. Our Online Specimen Pickup option has been a big hit with our physician customers with nearly 20% of routine pickup requests now handled electronically versus making a call. Physicians have given us positive feedback on the ease, efficiency, and simplicity, compared to waiting on the phone and writing down those confirmation numbers. And then finally, our Invigorate program remains strong, and we\u2019re on track to over-deliver on expected savings for 2018. Overall, we continue to make excellent progress on our operational excellence strategy and our leaders will be sharing more insights, successes, and plans with those that attend our Investor Day, which will be held November 29, in New York. Now, let me turn it over to Mark, who will take you through the financial performance. Mark? Mark Guinan : Thanks, Steve. Consolidated revenues of $1.89 billion were up 1.8% versus the prior year. As a reminder, we now report patient concessions as a reduction of net revenues instead of as bad debt, due to a required change in revenue recognition accounting. Revenues for diagnostic information services, or DIS for short, grew 1.9%, compared to the prior year, driven by acquisitions and an easier compare, due to the hurricane effect last year. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 2% versus the prior year. Excluding acquisitions, volumes grew approximately 70 basis points in the quarter. Revenue per requisition in the third quarter declined by 80 basis points versus the prior year. As a reminder, revenue per req is not a proxy for price. It also includes a number of variables such as unit price variation, business mix, test mix, and tests per req. During the third quarter, unit price headwinds remained consistent with our expectations for the full-year with a headwind of approximately 50 basis points from PAMA and approximately 100 basis points from all other factors. As we\u2019ve shared previously, Medicare reimbursement pressure will increase in 2019, due to PAMA. Other mix elements remained positive in the quarter and partially offset the impact of reimbursement headwinds, as well as growth in our professional laboratory services business. Reported operating income for the quarter was $304 million, or 16.1% of revenues, compared to $298 million, or 16.1% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $311 million, or 16.5% of revenues, compared to $325 million, or 17.5% of revenues last year. The decline in adjusted operating margin was due to several factors, including: investments related to tax reform savings, which had a 60-basis point adverse impact on operating margin; integration efforts of acquisitions, which take time to deliver a full margin contribution; and the impact of PAMA. Reported EPS was $1.53 in the quarter, compared to $1.15 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $1.68, up approximately 25% from $1.35 last year. During the quarter, patient concessions, previously recognized as part of bad debt, were up as a percentage of revenue year-over-year. We continue to see an increase in patient revenues as a percentage of total revenue, due to the ongoing trend of rising patient deductibles and an uptick in uninsured patients. Cash provided by operations year to date was $905 million versus $852 million last year. Capital expenditures year to date were $232 million, compared to $170 million a year ago, which is in-line with the higher CapEx spend planned for 2018. Now, turning to guidance. We are updating our outlook for 2018 as follows. Revenue is now expected to be approximately $7.62 billion, an increase of approximately 3% versus the prior year. Reported EPS to be between $5.57 and $5.64, and adjusted EPS to be between $6.53 and $6.60. Cash provided by operations continues to be approximately $1.3 billion; and capital expenditures continue to be between $350 million and $400 million. Our updated guidance reflects the industry headwinds we\u2019ve experienced versus our expectations in 2018. While we aren\u2019t prepared to share 2019 guidance, there are some elements I\u2019d like you to keep in mind. First, we have a significant opportunity to grow with our new UnitedHealthcare contract. However, moving in network comes with lower reimbursement versus the out of network services we provide to UHC patients today. Second, as Steve mentioned earlier, we are already on track to deliver 1% to 2% revenue growth from M&A next year. Third, as you are already aware, the impact from PAMA is expected to increase from a headwind of approximately 50 basis points this year to more than 100 basis points in 2019. And finally, we expect approximately 150 basis points of reimbursement pressure beyond PAMA from our third-party payers, which includes the impact of becoming an in-network provider for United and other health plan contract changes; as well as hospitals and physicians that we bill directly. After considering all these headwinds and tailwinds, we are well- positioned to grow revenue and earnings in 2019. We look forward to sharing more detail with you at Investor Day. I will now turn it back to Steve. Steve Rusckowski : Thanks, Mark. Well to summarize, revenues grew and we delivered strong earnings in the third quarter. We're excited about our M&A activity in the quarter, and are well-positioned for top and bottom-line growth in 2019. Finally, we look forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming Investor Day on November 29. Now, we\u2019d be happy to take any of your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Ross Muken : Hi, good morning, gentlemen. So, it seems like one of the incremental updates, Q-on-Q was sort of the concept of patient concessions being an incremental headwind, could you just give us a little bit more color, just sort of how that\u2019s playing out and why that sort of incrementally was sort of a surprise that popped up? And then, as we think about, sort of, in the next year, just a little bit more color, I know you don't want to give guidance on sort of the headwind you are expecting vis-a-vis sort of some of the network pricing pressures, inclusive of sort of the added networks United business getting repriced just kind of put the full picture together on, from what you were trying to get across in maybe those two points? Mark Guinan : Well, Ross, on patient concessions, you know we have a larger percentage of our revenue coming from patients. And as we\u2019ve shared in the past, the un-collectability, so it is bad debt for other sources what we call patient concessions from patients proportioned is much, much higher from patients than it is from any others source. So, we all have almost 0 bad debt from all the other revenue sources. So, really what was previously bad debt and now is patient concessions is largely a factor of collecting bills from patients. And again, a little bit of it is from the uninsured and most of it really comes from patients who have insurances, who are in the deductible and so they are paying a large proportion on all of their medical cost or it is from their coinsurance. And so, as that mix changes, unfortunately even though we are improving and continue to improve the bad debt rate or patient concession rate, through some of the things we\u2019ve done such as putting in our Easy Pay in our office phlebotomist and also our patient service centers also giving more transparency of price ahead as we talked about with our transparency tool with large amount of payers or patients know the cost, know the responsibility they have and it gives us a chance to collect upfront. Just because of mix that has been a headwind and as you know now with the accounting changes it\u2019s not just a headwind to operating margin, but it\u2019s a headwind to revenues as well. To your question why we couldn\u2019t see this coming, I mean we really don't know until we start doing collections and so given the cycle itself of performing the service, and then billing the payer, potentially having some back-and-forth claims on the adjudication, and ultimately billing the patient and seeing our collectability, you know it takes some time. And so, we obviously don't know if there is any definition of what\u2019s driving this, but when you look at some of the recent information that\u2019s come out from several sources around deductible, amounts are actually going up on average, so patients are paying a greater proportion of their healthcare, especially the patients that use a lot of our services because large majority is for healthy patients who go to the physician for a regular checkup. Therefore, we believe that that\u2019s a factor and a second one, there has been a small increase in the number of uninsured patients that we\u2019re serving. Obviously, we don\u2019t know whether that was driven by some changes in the Affordable Care Act recently or what\u2019s driving that, but we definitely have seen that. So that\u2019s on the patient concessions. On the pricing, that\u2019s what I was trying to do, was to give you all the moving pieces. So, when you look at the totality, obviously we\u2019re looking at a very attractive volume opportunity from network access with United, and it does come with a lower price, it comes to more of a market price for in-network laboratory. So, it\u2019s a good price, but it is lower than we were being paid previously. We just wanted to make sure people have that understanding in their models and then the other price, which we talked about of being 100 basis points or less will continue. A fair proportion of that is not from third party payers it is coming in very competitive hospital market, and also from physicians where we client bill or directly bill that physician and they bill the third-party as opposed to us billing the third-party. So, we wanted to make sure that people understood all the dynamics that are driving price. So, when you add all those pieces up, they said, PAMA is going to be approximately 100 basis points and we\u2019ll have about 150 basis points from other sources in 2019. However, given the M&A pipeline that we have and the deals that we\u2019ve already signed and have closed recently, and along with the access and continued improvement in some of the market headwinds that are hitting competitors, as well as I ended that section we\u2019re very confident of our ability to grow revenue and to grow our earnings in 2019, and I\u2019ll shed some more color on that at the Investor Day. Steve Rusckowski : Yes. And this is something on the patient concession thesis. I\u2019m reminding everyone that close to two years ago where we teamed up with Optum and UnitedHealthcare around our revenue cycle management or building operations. So, we're working hand-in-hand with Optum on what we could do to affect bad debt, as well as denials. We have really enjoyed the working relationship. Matter of fact, this week I\u2019ll be with that team. We\u2019ll talk about what we\u2019re seeing and how they can help us here as well. So, that relationship continues to be strong and that\u2019s going to help us as there is more and more pressure on this side of our business. Ross Muken : Thanks. And maybe just quickly on the offset side, you had some incremental investments you made this year that offset some of the tax benefit, and there is also the potential to maybe push back a bit on the supplier side, so I guess how are you thinking about, you know those are the pushes, the pulls that you have to try to maybe recapture some of that margin you are seeing hit by both PAMA and the other [indiscernible]? Steve Rusckowski : Well, I will take that at the beginning of this which is related to investments. We continue to make those investments we think are prudent for the capacity we're going to need giving what we anticipate is volume increases in 2019. This is as we would expect at the real granular level thinking about where we are at present, where we are going to pick up lives with United and therefore where we will pick up some shares. So, that\u2019s happening and it\u2019s in our numbers. Second it is we continue to honor our commitment to our employees paying out a bonus that will come up in November, that is an investment to share with our employees, we feel good about making sure we have a good workforce that feels good about working at Quest and that continues. And then finally, the opportunity to continue to grow the business in the five growth strategies outlined continue to be a promising opportunity for us as we come out of this year and we enter 2019. So, none of that is changing and we\u2019re making excellent progress on all those elements. Mark Guinan : Yes. So, Ross when you walk through those three, you know the bonus was a one-time bonus, so that\u2019s not going to repeat in terms of the investments for network access expansions. Those become cost of sales. So, when you\u2019re adding [indiscernible] people from the laboratory adding patient service across centers then all of that is investment ahead, but then it becomes our cost of sales. And then finally, on the other investments that Steve referenced, we will make those decisions along with everything else. We decide in terms of long-term, short-term results and also affordability to get into that year. And of course, I\u2019ll turnover over to Steve the most important piece. Steve Rusckowski : Yes. You asked also about the offset of working with our providers, excuse me, our suppliers and yes, this is all in an ongoing approach we have had with our invigorate program. As I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we exceeded our goals for this year, part of that is what we do with our suppliers. Our suppliers are well aware of what\u2019s happening with PAMA, matter of fact they are working with us on a legislative solution. This is through the AdvaMed organization, which is the device trade association. So, they are actively working this with us and are very much aware of the pressure there will be on this industry. And beyond what we do with our suppliers, we continue to look at efficiencies and we hope that many of you will come to our Investor Day, because we\u2019ll be outlining more of the opportunities we see beyond 2018 into 2019, 2020 and 2021 with more efficiency gains, because as we shared over the past several years, even though we did hit that $1.3 billion goal, we see more opportunities in front of us to continue to run a higher quality more efficient operation going forward. So, we look forward to you joining us to secure more about that. Mark Guinan : And just very quickly, two of the items that Steve referenced in his prepared remarks about appointment related calls dropping by more than 10% and specimen pickups being ordered online versus call, those are part of the efficiency and obviously we expect to continue to reduce the amount of phone calls we get and actually drive you the more efficiency going forward. Shawn Bevec : Operator, next question. Operator : Our next question comes from AJ Rice with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. AJ Rice : Hi, everybody. Maybe I will ask about the retail initiative. I know Walmart recently had an Investor Day where the just talked about the 15 locations that you work with them on expanding to the Midwest and envisioning over 100 location, ultimately in place, any comments you guys have about timing of that? And then also I know you're working on some pilot stuff with Aetna CVS, any update on that? And then how much is the retail? At this point, is it enough to move the needle in terms of its contribution to revenues, how would you describe where you are at on that? Steve Rusckowski : First of all, AJ thanks. I mentioned in the script, we continue to add stores. We're happy with the progress there. We are at 21 stores now and it continues to build and I tell you that that number will be much higher than that by the end of this year. And we focus on the big states of Florida and Texas and also, I said that we moved into the Illinois as well. So, there will be other states beyond those throughout the rest of this year. So that continues to build. So, what you heard from Walmart is aligned with our view. Second is, the experience has been quite good. It\u2019s been good for our patients; those patients are also Walmart consumers. Walmart likes the volume in the stores or volume is like the experience as an employee serving their customers better. And in fact, when we look at the volumes that we see in those sites that have been open long enough, we think it actually does have an effect on our market share within that geography. So, all around good presence, but we're not stopping there, the opportunity we talked about continuing to work with this joint venture with Walmart is how we provided other healthcare services and some of those locations, in fact we were detailing that out with Walmart and you will hear more about that. We hope to provide more color around those services at our Investor Day in November. And then equally, what CVS, now with the planned merger with Aetna will do with their strategy is a continuation of what we\u2019ve done with them in the MinuteClinic, and we're hopeful, as well as they continue to walk on those integration plans with Aetna given our great relationship with Aetna, great relationship with CVS, they do see an opportunity with the brick and mortar they have and with some of our capabilities of providing basic healthcare services. So, when we come to Investor Day, what we will do is, walk you through what we call our diagnostic services, which includes how we use our data and how we use the services and capabilities of Quest to help bend the cost curve. And some of that will be done with our Walmart joint venture and some of it will be done with other partners like CVS, but we do believe it\u2019s a great opportunity for growth in the near-term, but also for the long-term because we're just getting started frankly. So, more to come on that and we hope that you show up for the Investor Day in November. AJ Rice : Alright, thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Mark Guinan : Hi, Patrick. Patrick Donnelly : Hi, how are you? Maybe just on the three headwinds, PDM, hep C, and vitamin D, you know headwinds persisting here throughout the end of the year, can you maybe just update us on the trends and visibility on that turning around, I'm just trying to figure out how much that could leak into 2019 as we think about numbers kind of going forward for next year? Mark Guinan : Sure. On the hep C as we mentioned, that is starting to mitigate because we\u2019ve lapped year when, you know the [indiscernible] drug started to take significant share. So, at some point, most of that business goes away or it stabilizes or maybe even the drugs make a comeback, I know there is some pricing competition and an area that might change the competitive landscape. So, that should not continue to be significant into 2019. On PDM, I want to be clear as Steve mentioned, it continues to be a growth engine for us. Unfortunately, we\u2019re doing more volume than we are - revenues. So, revenue is growing, the following is growing faster and that\u2019s because of some of these denials. I can't put a stake on the ground at this point as how quickly we\u2019re going to address that. I guess the important thing is that even though that headwind may or may not get addressed in the near-term future. As Steve also referenced, it\u2019s stabilized. So, we're not growing in denials. So, we are reaching a point where the denials are still much higher than it should be and much higher than we find acceptable. It\u2019s not going to be continuing to be a year-over-year headwind. And certainly, we make some progress there could actually be a tailwind moving forward. And then on vitamin D, I\u2019d say it\u2019s still early. As we mentioned, we still believe that a number of these denials are because of miscoding based on a long history of physician coding practices, and not necessarily denials to patient eligibility. And so, how many of these things will be rectified when the physician community understands. For instance, either of these patients is now eligible for vitamin D and I need to use the appropriate code versus now this was just a screening and now it\u2019s other others including, as we mentioned, Cigna starting to apply Medicare type of approaches to their coding that this actually would be a denied task. But at some point, again, as you mentioned, you get that behind you and it all continues to be a headwind once the market adjusts and patients are appropriately getting prescribed with the right diagnosis code and then vitamin D continues to move with the market as it has been doing historically. Steve Rusckowski : So, as just to reinforce what we said in the script is that, we have the three together, we looked at our expectations for this year and how it has affected us. It\u2019s about 100 basis points and that\u2019s our business and I\u2019ll just to remind everyone, we\u2019ve talked about this before. We are the market leader on prescription drug monitoring. So, very strong in that category, continues to grow, but we clearly have more exposure than a lot of people on that space. So, therefore, any effect of those three have a bigger impact on us. So, the 100 basis points is our estimated. And as Mark said, we continue to work this. We started working this in Q2. We\u2019ve made some modest progress. As I said in my remarks, we will continue that throughout this year and then again as we start to lap it, we'll have less of impact year-on-year, but different than what we expected, but still growing in these three categories. Mark Guinan : And then just to add to what Steve mentioned, those three had about 100 basis point negative impact versus our expectations and then the patient concessions were another 30 basis points. Patrick Donnelly : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And maybe just a quick one on the payer shifting with United, you\u2019ve talked about a few different buckets of customers, just framing that opportunity, I guess now that we're a few months in, and you\u2019ve done more work on the market on United itself, what fragment of that market do you think you're kind of viewing as early adopters, you know shifting quickly in 2019, just trying to frame that opportunity? Steve Rusckowski : Yes. The business opportunity we have is, those customers of ours that have the majority of their laboratory testing coming to us already, but might just have another laboratory because we are not in network with United. So, those are the accounts we\u2019ve already knocked down their doors, we have shared with them the great news that we\u2019re going to be in network starting January 1. We have worked on what we need to do of anything in terms of IT integration, we get those orders in-house and those will come to us early in 2019. Those types of customers. The second group of customers that I\u2019ll broadly put in this category is that might have multiple laboratories, and our job is to make sure we gain share. And given the access that we have starting in 2019, which is really remarkably better, we believe there is also an equal opportunity for us to gain share beyond those great customers we have for all customers to pick up share. Particularly some of the large states we\u2019ve talked about this, when you look at Florida, Texas, California, New York, our access is going to be north of 95%. So, great access in the marketplace, great value proposition or quality service, and also pricing, we believe we have an opportunity to pick up share in those accounts. Shawn Bevec : Operator, next question. Operator : Next question comes from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Derik de Bruin : Hi, good morning. A couple of questions. One, first on housekeeping, if I missed it, my apologies, but what is the all-in organic revenue growth number for the quarter and the specific contribution from M&A? Mark Guinan : So, the revenue growth was pretty much all M&A in the quarter. Derik de Bruin : Got it. Okay. And if you \u2013 two follow-up questions, I guess, did your volumes get effected this quarter by some seasonality and consumer genomics testing? I know that\u2019s been a tailwind for the business, I know there is some \u2013 this is a weak quarter for that one and then follow-up on that one is going to be just on deal valuations, are things coming in? Thanks. Mark Guinan : Yes, so we didn\u2019t experience any meaningful change, due to seasonality in the quarter around genetic testing. And then, sorry your second question Derik? Derik de Bruin : Basically, just valuations on deals in the fact that people \u2013 people are they getting involved a more bit attractive? Mark Guinan : Yes. No, I think the valuations really haven\u2019t changed materially. Obviously, you\u2019ve got to price in the PAMA headwinds. Although, we are hopeful that we can positively impact that at this point. More pricing things as if those PAMA cuts will happen, that\u2019s the way we are valuing things. So, therefore, if anything, valuations have come down, and the seller, or potential seller recognizes that as well. Steve Rusckowski : Yes, just, I believe your question is around consumer genetics. Just to remind everyone, we do have a relationship with Ancestry and we provide a genotyping for their ethnicity offering. It\u2019s a modest portion of our business and continue to get growth, but it is modest for us. We\u2019re optimistic about the opportunities with the Ancestry because we still believe it is an opportunity for us to work together with that around building awareness overall, around the importance that everyone knowing our family health history, and that\u2019s an opportunity for the future, but just with the context, in terms consumer generic testing it is a small portion of business with modest growth this quarter. Shawn Bevec : Operator, next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is open. Jack Meehan : Hi, thanks. I wanted to dig in a little bit more on the volume commentary, so I think you mentioned that it was around 70 basis points when you excluded M&A, how much did weather contribute to the year-over-year growth? And I guess just my math would suggest the underlying utilization was down year-over-year? I know you have talked about some of the issues, but what\u2019s your level of conviction that that can improve in the fourth quarter into 2019? Mark Guinan : So, most of the fourth quarter \u2018improvement\u2019 is really coming from the M&A we did, so that\u2019s giving us some lift. We don\u2019t expect a step change improvement in utilization what we call same account volumes. And then in terms of weather, we have some impact, but it wasn\u2019t material enough to call out, but certainly it was a slight headwind to us in the quarter. Jack Meehan : Sorry, weather was a headwind? Mark Guinan : Sorry, I was talking about the hurricanes this year. So, we talked about the fact that versus last year we had a favorable compare, I thought you were asking us weather the hurricanes that took place in Carolinas in the third quarter were significant factors? So, we did call out that we had a favorable compare and it was about 150 basis points in the quarter, but there was a slight negative impact this year from hurricanes in 2018. Jack Meehan : Great, and then just as my follow-up, I wanted to see if you could elaborate a little bit more on your pricing comments at the end of the script Mark? Can understand the PAMA stepping up, but the 150 basis points beyond PAMA, I know in the past you\u2019ve talked about 100 bips normal unit price, is that 50 bips kind of incremental related to United and then as you size it all up just do you think mid-to-high single digit earnings growth is doable for 2019? Mark Guinan : Yes. So, the 50-basis point isn\u2019t tied directly to the United, but certainly directionally United is one of the major drivers there, and I\u2019m sure you are familiar with the way pricing works. So, we had significantly higher reimbursement from United as an out of network provider than what typical in-network takes on and what we negotiated with United. So, yes that\u2019s a big driver, but it\u2019s not entirely United. And at this point, I\u2019m not going to give any guidance for 2019. So, what I will reconfirm is that the Investor Day outlook that we provided of having a 3% to 5% topline CAGR, and a mid-to-high single digits EPS CAGR from 2017 through 2020, we still stand by that. Obviously, we have got one full-year and three quarters of a year behind us and when you look at our guidance, it so puts us within that range and so what we\u2019re saying is that we work through the next two years. We are certainly still confident that we can deliver within that CAGR range without giving any specific guidance for a given year. Steve Rusckowski : Yes. Just to reiterate, we will grow topline and bottom line in 2019. We have said that. What we have also said is that, the M&A that we have already shared will get us to comfortably in that 1% to 2% growth in 2019 and when you couple that with the United opportunity that we\u2019ve speaking about gives us confidence on our ability to say, yes, we will grow top and bottom line next year. Jack Meehan : Thank you, Steve. Shawn Bevec : Operator, next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Bill Quirk : Great. Thanks. Good morning everybody. Steve Rusckowski : Hi Bill, good morning. Bill Quirk : Good morning. First question, Mark, just not to beat a dead horse here on 150 basis points that you signaled for 2019, but is any of that related to additional plans kind of following or trying to follow some of the PAMA rates down, I know historically you\u2019ve indicated that you don\u2019t have a lot of contracts that are tied to Medicare, but just trying to tease any nuances out here? Mark Guinan : No, it isn\u2019t. There are some small changes in some Medicaid rates that states have made, specifically Ohio. I mean, you can argue whether that was in any way related to PAMA. I think they actually had a budget issues, they wanted to fund some Women\u2019s Health initiatives and they slammed the laboratory reimbursement rates. There certainly was some dialogue around where Medicare was going in some of the states, if not many of them look at Medicare as a signal for where the Medicaid rates should be, but in terms of commercial plans, no, there isn\u2019t any incremental headwinds because the commercial plans are trying to take advantage of PAMA. In fact, as we have shared the dialogue we\u2019ve been having with the commercial plans as they see that as an issue for them because the more pressure we get from other sources, the more we need to get from them, and therefore it\u2019s in their own best interest not to see that because they know in the next collection period that the potential recalculation could be even more severe if we give lower commercial rights. And so, they are very sensitized to that and I can assure you that we are holding very firm in those discussions and make sure that they understand the world where you have a significant difference between commercial rates and government, and certainly Medicare rates is going to go away. The whole intent of PAMA is to move go rates to a market type rate, which says that we need to talk about other ways to create value beyond price and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. Increasingly, we\u2019re walking in and talking about all the other ways we differentiate ourselves positively, but then I fully appreciate and then some of the things that Steve highlighted in his remarks, around the patient experience, the technology we\u2019re putting in our patient service centers, the ability to build a relationship through the MyQuest app schedule appointments make things easier. Because at the end of the day, the payers want their patients to get appropriate necessary testing done, and so therefore that\u2019s definitely a good thing. It\u2019s also our data the way we feed data and the more critical mass we have the easier it is one them to do the analytics in a world where data is increasingly important for population management. So, there is a lot of ways that we talk about our value proposition. And then finally it is as Steve mentioned or where they recognized that they have a cost curve. They need to start working with the best value providers and certainly will want those and starting to move volume as a high cost less attractive value providers into the better laboratories and that\u2019s the way they are really going to save money and drive better value for their members versus continuing to look to extract price out of those who already have the best prices in the market. Bill Quirk : Got it. Thank you. Shawn Bevec : Operator, next question. Operator : Question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : Good morning, Ricky. Ricky Goldwasser : Yes, hi, good morning and thank you for all the details. So, one question that I have, if we go back Steve to your comments about the UnitedHealthcare converting from out of network high price to in network lower price, I think something that would be very, very helpful for us is we think about the opportunity next year in longer term, if you can give us some sense of your share as an out of network provider with United ?And I understand that you might not be able to give us the United data, maybe some sort of a framework for us to think about, what type of share do labs typically have in an out of network relationship? Steve Rusckowski : Yes, so let me do this. I remind many of you on this call of what we talked about of the opportunity we see with the United, which if you go back and you recall, we\u2019ve talked about the opportunities that many of the health plans see, it is by working with one of the nationals as ourselves we can do a better job of helping them reduce their laboratory cost. And what we talked about with the United define the opportunity in front of us is, we have talked about Untied estimates that they spend anywhere from $7 billion to $8 billion in laboratory spend a year, and most people have estimated that the nationals maybe providing about a billion of that. So, therefore, there is a big opportunity as they think about how they do a different job and a better job of serving their membership with Quest and at least one other national provider to reduce that spend. So, when you look at that 1 billion versus the 7 billion or 8 billion you see the opportunity in front of us. And the biggest opportunity in the short run is, as I said earlier is to go after those great Quest accounts, we will do that early, but this is why we believe that this affords us a nice growth opportunity, not just for 2019, but for 2020 and 2021 because it\u2019s going to take some time to gain that share and move that work away from the more expensive labs, and this is true for United, but I will also argue, we will be doing this with other health plans as well. So, it\u2019s an opportunity to continue to pick up share. So, we will again be coming back together in November, we'll help \u2013 provide more visibility to what we believe the opportunity would be within reason, but hopefully at least those remarks will help you kind of size the opportunity in front of us given where we sit today. Mark Guinan : And Ricky, it's a little more complicated being with United and Quest because we had some in network volumes. So, as we shared historically, in our pathology business, we had a couple of states that have been in in-network. And then obviously if you're trying to look at a model for out of network labs' share within large national payers, the fact that it's such a strong business of United a decade ago, we never lost all of that because of the loyalty of some of the providers, and the fact that they could look even out of network, our prices were still better than hospitals and many others. So, it's a little bit different than if you want to look at other payers and say, hey, how much volume is there out of network. I think Quest had a disproportionate share of volume relative to what other labs might have out of network, but it's still not huge because you are an out of network provider, certainly when they have only insured patients, we don't get paid at all. So, it's really only their administered plans when they have out-of-network benefits where it makes sense for us to keep that volume and continue to try to compete. Ricky Goldwasser : Understood. So, just as a follow-up, and I understand that you had more share than a typical out of network, but it would be really helpful for us if you can give us a data point for a typical out of network is, at least it will help us establish a floor from which you can build on. That's one. And then the second question that I had is regarding the acquisitions, can you remind us how long does it take for an acquisition to reach company margin? And if you can quantify what was the negative impact on margin from acquisition integration? Mark Guinan : So, let me answer the acquisition question. We've shared in the past 12 to 18 months. I'd say on the outreach purchases, they tend to happen a lot more quickly. They're more simple and straightforward. It's really just integrating them into our local laboratory, and then the cost of serving those patients is basically the cost of serving all the other patients we currently do in those markets. So, those might even happen a little quicker in the 6 to 12-month window. And some of these other, I'll call them technology acquisitions, and that could involve site shutdown, it could involve moving the test menu to multiple locations. Obviously, it's working through the sales force issues, reimbursement issues and so on and so forth. So, those tend to be on the longer end, and you'll notice that number of the deals that we did in the latter part of 2017 were more like that as opposed to outreach purchases. So, we take a little bit longer. And then on the volume question, Ricky, I know you'd like some great specificity. All I can share is that typically there is a tiny share for an out of network lab in terms of their share of volume within a national payer and we were not tiny, but we certainly were not large. Steve Rusckowski : And just on the acquisition, remember, we had this feathering going on that we have a nice slug of acquisitions in 2018. We're again giving you some perspective on the outlook that we have for 2019. The acquisitions would definitely be in that 1% to 2%. Those 2018 acquisitions, another year under their belt, 2019 where we get some of the integration done that helps us, and you layer that on top of the new acquisitions we bring in 2019. But we're hopeful we have a more regular cadence around that 1% to 2% that you already see in our numbers. So, as they come in, they take some time to mature with the integration coupled with the ones that are just showing up, that's already in our numbers for past years as well. Shawn Bevec : Operator, next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : Hi, Lisa. Mark Guinan : Good morning, Lisa. Steve Rusckowski : Lisa, we can't hear you. Lisa Gill : Sorry about that. Can you hear me now? Thank you for all the detail. I just wanted to follow up on a couple of things. You've talked a lot about revenue growth as we think about 2019, you talked about having EPS growth. When we think about some of the efficiency gains that you think about in 2019 and beyond, how does the retail strategy fit into that? Can you remind us if that is more economically better for Quest versus your own patient service centers? And two, are you seeing incremental test volume through that? I just want to better understand how you're thinking about the retail setting as we think about 2019, 2020 and beyond. Steve Rusckowski : Yes. So, what we said about the retail strategy, it's a better location in these sites. So, it serves our patients in the market better and therefore it's beneficial to the patients, it's beneficial to our employees, and our partners. In one case, it's Safeway; in the other case, it's Walmart are happy as well. Now, with all that, we've shared in the past, from a rent perspective, the cost of using that space, there is not a big difference between the two. However, we're getting much better space. Many of our patient service centers that we could collapse or patient service centers with one or two phlebotomists. This affords us an opportunity to take down those locations and put them into a better location, and that's better again for all stakeholders. And so, it's not a cost savings, but what it provides us is a better quality and better patient experience. And what I said in my remarks, what we do now have enough data points where we look six months of what we close versus what we open, we believe the volumes are better in those locations. So, it is positive financially for us and it's one of the ingredients of us gaining share. Now, we said, again, this is for our core business. We also believe this is an opportunity for us, particularly with the Walmart JV to tag on to those physical locations more healthcare services that we'll be working with Walmart, with local partners to be able to bend the cost curve for whatever partner we're working with. So that just affords us another opportunity beyond our core diagnostic service business. So, hopefully that's helpful. Mark Guinan : Yes. And just to add, we have shared in the past that in Safeway, because we've leveraged some of the overhead, there is some cost savings, the greatest cost is the phlebotomists and that doesn't change when we go into a retail setting, but there is some cost savings despite the fact that the rents generally is somewhat comparable, smaller space, higher rates for more attractive market, but the overall footprint costs us relatively the same. But this is a business with small details. So, little bit of cost savings combined with, as Steve mentioned, some volume upside certainly can make a difference, especially as we continue to expand. And then Walmart is a JV. So, it is different. It's not just putting a phlebotomist draw center within a retail outlet versus one of our independent patient service centers, and what we are starting with phlebotomy, we are definitely intending to add more healthcare services together with Walmart to build their presence within the healthcare. And it is a JV. So, therefore we've got a majority position to who are going to be sharing the economic value creation of that venture with Walmart. Shawn Bevec : Operator, next question. Operator : Next question comes from Donald Hooker with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Donald Hooker : Great. Yes. I'll just ask one real quick question here. Maybe just a little bit more elaboration on the M&A environment. I know you guys target 100 to 200 basis points of inorganic growth annually. It sounded like from your comments, just to clarify, you are already there for next year. And we still have obviously a lot of time. So, maybe kind of an update on your acquisition pipeline. Is there potential for you to potentially exceed that 200 basis points of growth next year? Thanks. Steve Rusckowski : Yes. So, what we said is what we've announced so far, puts us in that 1% to 2%, which, you know it is a good place to be at this point. We also said that given the environment and given the pressure that we see on hospital outreach operations, we think that's a catalyst to afford us a nice pipeline. We just announced another deal of buying an outreach business this week, an outreach activity called out of the Hurley Medical Center in Flint, Michigan, and there will be more to come. So, yes, we will share this point 1% to 2%. We're comfortably there for next year, but we do have a funnel that can add to that going into 2019. Shawn Bevec : Operator, next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : Good morning, Ann. Ann Hynes : Good morning. Hi. So, two quick questions. One, obviously in 2019, you said you expect top line in EPS growth and that is in the face of 200 basis points of, I guess, incremental pricing pressure. Can you let us know how much market share gain from the UNH contract and some of the Aetna loss you're assuming in that to get to that? And I guess my second question would be around cash flow and share repurchase. Obviously, your stock is very weak today, but it's been down since the last earnings when you had to reduce guidance slightly. You have a great balance, you did enhance cash flow. I guess, at what point will you go into the market and do some incremental share repurchase? Thanks. Mark Guinan : Sure, Ann. So, first off, let me clarify. We don't have an incremental 250 basis points of price going into next year. What we talked about was a total of 250 versus something that's more in the lines of 150 this year. So, I want to make sure that I'm clear on that. And about 50 basis points of the increased pricing pressure is PAMA related and the other 50 basis points related to other things. In terms of share, obviously we don't get into that level of detail. We're very cognizant of the need to retain our Aetna business. We've got people who have been actively working for the last several months. We continue to work to make sure that we serve those customers appropriately and we retain as much of that Aetna business as possible and certainly have United, as we mentioned earlier. We're very excited about the opportunity. Steve mentioned, we expect that in some of these very loyalist accounts who would be sending us to United, if we were in network and would have been sending it to us, we'll flip very quickly. There are those accounts that have multiple providers and we believe together with our value proposition, all the things we've walked through, which does differentiate us from almost all the other providers in a meaningful way around the patient experience, with our app, with certainly the pricing transparency, which is a huge win-win for the physician and the patients to be able to go into one of our draw centers at no upfront, whether something is covered and how much of cost, it\u2019s just there aren't many labs that can do that. And therefore the \u2013argument around simplicity, why we want to do business with multiple labs, you got five or six labs you're sending work through today, we could do almost all that if not all of that, we've got more lives covered in a given geography. So, you don't have to worry about problems with the patients for the high cost out of network work. And we think that's pretty compelling, but that's not going to happen as quickly as the first piece. And then obviously the third piece is where we don't have business today. So, now we feel very strong with that same value proposition that we can go in and we can compete more strongly than we could have in the past and flip some of those accounts where we may not have any or very much work at all. So, that's going to take even longer. So, this is a multi-year growth opportunity. It's not all about 2019, and we have plans in place and we have strategies to go after each of those, and we're working hard to make sure that that all comes. So, certainly excited about that and very confident about that. Shawn Bevec : And just to clarify, that incremental 50 basis points of price pressure next year outside of PAMA, that's primarily going to be coming from the United price headwinds. Ann Hynes : Okay. So, the total incremental is 50 or 100? Steve Rusckowski : 100. Shawn Bevec : 50 from PAMA and 50 from primarily United. Ann Hynes : Okay. And just on share repurchase question, please. Mark Guinan : Yes. So, obviously I can't talk about any specific plans around share repurchases, but given the fact that we have announced and are closing a number of transactions this quarter, we're going to be spending a fair amount of cash on those deals and we certainly are excited about the pipeline coming up. So, at this point, we haven't announced anything specific. We'll continue to follow our strategy, which says with half of our free cash flow that's not committed to our shareholders every year, we're going to make situational decisions depending on the M&A opportunities and the attractiveness of those returns versus share repurchases. Shawn Bevec : Operator, next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Your line is open. Brian Tanquilut : Hi, good morning. Mark, just a quick question on United. Thanks for all that color. So, as we think about 2019, putting it all together, out of network, going in network and then the volume expectations that you have in the ramp, is United a net positive revenue contributor in 2019? Mark Guinan : Yeah, absolutely. Brian Tanquilut : Okay. Got it. Alright. Thank you. Shawn Bevec : Operator, next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum. Your line is open. Kevin Ellich : Hi, guys. Just \u2026 Steve Rusckowski : Good morning. Kevin Ellich : With the strong M&A pipeline, hi Steve, given what you've done, do you have any, I guess, strategic focus at things that you'd like to add, Steve as we think about your pipeline? Steve Rusckowski : Yeah. Continue with what we've been focused on. One is, the opportunity to run hospital outreach. We think it's a \u2013 of course it's a nice opportunity to continue to consolidate the market and we do believe that we'll continue to build. And as I said, we just announced another deal this week. Number two, you saw that we just announced a number of acquisitions that afford us new capabilities. The Immunotec acquisition gives us blood tuberculosis testing capability with tick-borne capabilities. That was a nice add. ReproSource gives us nice women's health capability and then we also talk about PhenoPath up in the Pacific Northwest that has some capabilities around pathology and molecular. So, we'll always look for new capabilities. And then the third piece is, there's still regional laboratories that we believe we are going to have difficult times than \u2013 more difficult time than hospital outreach, and you'll see some regional opportunities. So, if you look back in the last five years and you look at the acquisitions, they fit in those three categories. There's been ebbs and flows of each of the three, but generally, that's what we continue to look and they're all strategically aligned to what we do and we have to have a path to value creation and hopefully you agree with us that we've built up credibility around that. So, we will continue to work on that and go into next year. We already hit that 1% to 2%, and we've got a nice funnel to continue to pursue ideas that we can make money of. Shawn Bevec : Operator, next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Dan Leonard : Thank you. Just one final one on the UnitedHealth volume opportunity. I think previously you talked about some potential increased volumes flipping into 2018. Is that something you're contemplating in your guidance for the year or no? Mark Guinan : Yes. So, there is certainly some early transitions. It's not significant enough to call out, but I didn't want you to think we're waiving on everything till January 1. So yes, we absolutely already have some accounts that have moved and some accounts that are committing to move, but at this point, it's still relatively small. Dan Leonard : Okay. Thank you. Shawn Bevec : Operator, last question. Operator : Our last question comes from Eric Coldwell with Baird. Your line is open. Eric Coldwell : Hi, thanks. Most of mine have been covered, but there is one in your footnotes, which is, obviously M&A is a big piece of the call today and I'm seeing that you're writing off the fair value contingent consideration on MedXM. I'm just curious if we can get an update on that acquisition and then maybe just kind of a broader swath on how other acquisitions have been doing. You've announced quite a few here in the last few months. Thanks. Mark Guinan : Sure. So, we're happy with MedXM. As I'm sure you're familiar, the reason you put in an earnout into a deal was when the buyer and the seller have markedly different views of the potential, it's one way to get two transactions coined that shares the risk appropriately. So, at this point, not quite 9 months into the acquisition, we feel from an accounting standpoint that it's highly unlikely to pay out the earnout. That doesn't mean that we haven't achieved what we were expecting to achieve. It just means that the seller had a very different view of where that might go. And so that's all you should read into there. We're very happy with MedXM thus far. It's been a great addition to our portfolio, and I can tell you that as we're talking to payers about our laboratory testing, this is another opportunity to talk to them about ways that we can really help them beyond just the laboratory testing we're doing with great reach and population health and so on. So, it's another point why they want to do business with Quest. Eric Coldwell : That's great. Thanks very much. Steve Rusckowski : Okay. I think we've handled all the questions. We thank all of you for joining us today. We appreciate your support. You have a great day and hope to see many of you at our Investor Day in November.

The entire contents of the call, including the presentation, and question-and-answer session that will follow, are the copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics with all rights reserved. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. Now, I'd like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead please. Shawn Bevec : Thank you, and good morning. I am here with Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and will discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables through our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS, and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization expense. Also, growth rate associated with our long-term outlook projections including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth, and adjusted earnings growth are compound annual growth rates. As a reminder, the company now reports uncollectable balances associated with patient responsibility, which we will refer to as patient concession as a reduction in net revenues when historically these amounts were classified as bad debt expense within SG&A expenses. Now, here is Steve Rusckowski. Steve Rusckowski : Thanks, Shawn, and thanks everyone for joining us today. This morning, we'll discuss the fourth quarter and full-year 2018, and review progress on our two-point strategy. Then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through our 2019 guidance. For the fourth quarter, revenues decreased 1.4%, reported EPS was $0.92, down about 50% from the same period of 2017, and adjusted EPS was $1.36, down 2.9%. Performance in the quarter reflects increased reimbursement headwinds as well as softer organic volume than we expected at investor day, and the change in estimate of reserves for revenue and accounts receivable, which Mark will cover later in the call. For the full-year 2018, revenues grew 1.7%, reported EPS declined roughly 4% to $5.29. Adjusted EPS grew approximately 17%, to $6.31. In 2018, we grew revenues, adjusted earnings attached from operations despite some challenges in the marketplace. Mark will update you on the quarter, and share our perspective on 2019. Quest is well positioned in 2019 to grow share, and deliver revenue growth as our in-network status now extends to approximately 90% of commercially insured lives in the United States. Volumes are off to a good start this year. Our guidance for 2019 reflects our expectation that strong volume growth will continue throughout the year. It also reflects significant reimbursement pressure partially offset by our continued execution of our Invigorate program. As we discussed at our investor day, in November, we are poised for growth based on three fundamental changes in the marketplace. First, panel-driven reimbursement pressure is a catalyst for structural change. In 2019, we expect about a 10% reduction in Medicare reimbursement rates, and a similar reduction in 2020. The impact of these cuts will be more significant on smaller independent hospital outreach laboratories which we believe could eliminate the majority of their profit, and will provide a catalyst for market consolidation. Second, payers are more focused than ever of driving better value in their [indiscernible], which supports our plan to gain share. And finally, nobody cares more about the variation in healthcare cost than employers and their employees, the country's largest payer. Increasingly, patients are motivated to find the high-value low-price providers, like Quest. So, we are very well-positioned to benefit from these trends. Our strategy to accelerate growth has five elements. Now, I'll share the progress we've made. First, we aim to grow more than 2% this year from M&A. In 2018, acquisitions contributed more than 3% to revenue growth. The nine deals we announced and closed, since the beginning of 2018, position us well to meet our 2019 target. Earlier this week, we completed the acquisition of a clinical laboratory services business of Boyce and Bynum, a leading provider of diagnostic and clinical laboratory services in the Midwest. The second element is to expand relationships with health plans and hospital health systems. First on health plans, we're entering 2019 with the best assets this company has had in over a decade. We've added 43 million lives, which represents about a billion dollar opportunity for Quest as a result of our in-network status with UnitedHealthcare, Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey, and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Georgia. As I said earlier, we have already seen encouraging volume growth early in 2019 resulting from this expanded network access. Hospital health systems are facing unprecedented financial pressures, and are therefore motivated to discuss ways we can help them with their lab strategy. We recently signed two new professional laboratory services agreements in the Southeast region. In both relationships we will provide full lab management employing technical lab staff, providing operational lab oversight, and maintaining responsibility for the laboratory supply chain. As we outlined at our investor day, most hospital CEOs and CFOs are still not fully aware of PAMA which impacts hospital outreach labs. We believe that this impact of PAMA becomes increasingly more visible, hospital will be more motivated to work with us on their laboratory strategy. The third element of our growth strategy is to offer the broadest access to diagnostic innovation. We made key acquisitions to expand our capability and enhance our service offerings in 2018. We saw strong double-digit growth in 2018 from a number of key test categories, including prescriptive drug monitoring, tuberculosis testing, and Cardio IQ. In 2018, we made significant progress executing the fourth element of our growth strategy, which is to be the laboratory provider of choice for consumers. Before arriving at a patient service center, patients can check in electronically through MyQuest and view estimated wait times before making an appointment. At the patient service center or in the physician's office, our enhanced real-time estimate let's patients know their financial responsibility before we collect their specimen. And then, once the results are available, patients can view them through MyQuest digital platform, which is now available for more than 6.5 million users, or they could review them on the Apple Health app. Next, we continue to build out our industry-leading retail strategy. At year-end, we'll be in more than 200 Safeway and Walmart locations. In 2018, we launched QuestDirect, a service which enables consumers to have a test without a doctor's script in the continental United States. And we're pleased with the volumes we've seen so far. The fifth element of our growth strategy is to support population health and data analytics and extended care services. Payers understand the value of the lab data and how it can help them improve their members' health outcomes. This has strengthened our value proposition as well. We're also growing revenues from pharmaceutical customers. Quest Clinical Trials Connect, which we launched in 2018, is helping pharma and CROs recruit patients for trials faster, better, and more efficiently. The second part of our two-point strategy is to drive operational excellence. Our Invigorate cost-cutting initiatives has been successful, and we see more opportunities ahead. We are confident there's an opportunity to continue to improve and save roughly 3% on a cost structure or about $200 million per year to offset increases in our wage bill as well as reimbursement pressures. At a recent investor day, we identified a number of areas for improvement, such as reducing denials of patient concessions, further digitizing our business, continuing to standardize and automate and optimize their lab and patient service center networks. Given the increased reimbursement pressure in 2019, we're also closely managing our cost structure. We are rebalancing our resources by reducing expenses in some areas while ensuring we have the operational resources needed to deliver on the volume increases we expect this year. Now, let me turn over to Mark who will take you through our financial performance and our 2019 guidance in detail. Mark. Mark Guinan : Thanks, Steve. In the fourth quarter consolidated revenues were $1.84 billion, down 1.4% versus the prior year. Revenues for diagnostic information services declined 1.5% compared to the prior year, primarily due to a change in estimated adjustment to increase reserves for net revenue on accounts receivable that we previously highlighted in November. I will share more on this in a moment. Volume measured by the number of our acquisitions increased 3.4% versus the prior year. Excluding acquisitions, volumes grew 1.1%. Revenue per acquisition in the fourth quarter declined by 5.5%, versus the prior year, driven primarily by the reserve adjustments and increased denials in patient concessions. For the full-year, price headwinds were consistent with our expectations of slightly less than 1.5%. Now, I'd like to provide color on the reserve adjustment we made in the fourth quarter. You'll recall we discussed this at Investor Day. We recorded a change in estimate to increase our accounts receivable reserves by approximately $35 million. We did this based on the following : Unexpected increases in coverage denials and patient responsibility and a billing system conversion in one of our regional labs that resulted in timely filing denials and impacted our ability to precisely estimate reimbursement rates. Because these items were not typical with our historical experience we monitored them in accordance with our process increased our reserve levels. I am confident in our process and we have timed the level of precision around this complex estimation going forward. Before moving on, I'd also like to provide an update on the headwinds to our prescription drug monitoring hep C and vitamin D test categories that we've been testing over the prior couple of quarters. In prescription drug monitoring, we saw an increase in restricted payer policies that impacted both volume and reimbursement, but we lapsed denials for two of the more significant payers in the fourth quarter. In 2019, we continue to expect PDM reimbursement challenges as payers seek more clinical evidence to support coverage. Turning to hep C, as we noted previously, as these hepatitis C therapy reduces the need for genotype testing, while market share of this therapy continues to grow modestly, we expect to lapse the most significant headwinds by the second quarter. And finally, in vitamin D testing higher payer denials impacted both volume and revenue in 2018. One national payer implemented a more restrictive policy last March which we expect to lap in Q1, but we expect continued pressure on vitamin D testing in 2019. Moving on to the remainder of our fourth quarter results, reported operating income was $220 million or 12% of revenues compared to $269 million or 14.4% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $271 million or 14.7% of revenues compared to $317 million or 17% of revenues in the prior year. Reported EPS was $0.92 in the quarter compared to $1.82 a year ago. Note the prior-year quarter included a tax benefit recorded as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Adjusted EPS was $1.36 down approximately 3% from $1.38 last year. Cash provided by operations was $1.2 billion in 2018 versus $1.18 billion in 2017. Capital expenditures in 2018 were $383 million compared to $252 million a year ago. Now turning to guidance, we are providing the following outlook for 2019. Revenue is expected to be between $7.6 billion and $7.75 billion, an increase of approximately 1% to 3% versus the prior year. Reported EPS expected to be greater than 516 and adjusted EPS to be greater than 640. Cash provided by operations is expected to be approximately $1.3 billion, and capital expenditures are expected to be between $350 million and $400 million. Now, there are several considerations that I will now review for you to think about in 2019. First, as we've shared previously, we are facing more than $200 million of reimbursement pressure this year. This headwind is expected to be relatively and evenly spread throughout the year. Second, based on the factors I discussed earlier, the fourth quarter of 2018 should create an easy compare in the fourth quarter of 2019. Third, our revenue guidance includes more than 1% revenue growth from M&A that has already been announced and executed. Fourth, as Steve mentioned, our volumes are off to a good start this year, and we expect them to continue to build throughout the year. Finally, we are incurring incremental costs in the first quarter to support the volume growth from our expanded network access. We're also tightly managing our cost structure, and have undertaken a restructuring in the first quarter of 2019, and will begin to yield savings starting in the second quarter. As you think about the first quarter, we have approximately one less revenue day. And to remind you, denials in patient concession increased throughout 2018, and we are assuming these headwinds carry into 2019. Taking these into consideration with some of the items I just highlighted, we expect revenue to be flat to down in the first quarter, while adjusted EPS is expected to be similar to the adjusted EPS we reported in the fourth quarter. I will now turn it back to Steve. Steve Rusckowski : Thanks, Mark. Well, to summarize, Quest is well positioned in 2019 to grow revenue and earnings. Our in-network status now extends to approximately 90% of the commercially insured lives in the United States, and volumes are off to a good start. Our guidance for 2019 reflects reimbursement pressures offset by strong volume increases, and continued execution of our Invigorate program. Now, we'd be happy to take any of your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We will now open it up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Ross Muken with Evercore. Your line is open. Ross Muken : Good morning, guys. Steve Rusckowski : Good morning, Ross. Ross Muken : So, as we look at sort of the fourth quarter and kind of what's implied in the first part of '19 and then over the balance of the year, I guess as you think about sort of the state of the lab market in general and some of the reimbursement headwinds you're dealing with, and then the flexibility of your cost structure, I guess in terms of your thesis for the business, obviously there's a lot of things that occurred toward the end of the year that were challenging for you guys, but yet there's a lot positive happening on the volume side. I guess how do you sort of put it all together for us so we can be confident that clearly the challenges we saw in the back part of this year you've sort of dealt with and now are reflected accurately so that we sort of found a rebasing side? And then what could you point us to kind of over the balance of this year that we should be looking for to kind of judge that the jump off into, hopefully, '20 and beyond, I guess, is going to be better? Because obviously you had a tough fourth quarter, the Q1 is supposed to be a bit weaker, and Mark you walked through that. And then we're sort of recovering. So I'm just trying to get a sense for confidence in some of the moving parts and your sort of evolved thesis here. Steve Rusckowski : Yes, let me start, and then I'll turn it to Mark. And thanks for asking the question. So start, we'd go back to what we shared with you in investor day. We still believe as the market leader we have a tremendous opportunity to gain share. And I think we just announced the kickoff of our journey to pick up share, and it starts in 2019. We also couple 2019 with the most significant reimbursement that this industry has ever seen, so in reimbursement costs, and so it's muting some of the share gains that we're going to pick up this year. But what we told you at investor day, there's two parts of our market share gains, is one is we do believe we can accelerate M&A, and we're actually targeting for 2% growth through M&A. What we said in our guidance, we only will put in our guidance what we have seen so far closed, so it's roughly 1% in the guidance for 2019. Second is, we will see organic growth, and we have to pick up the volumes to be able to offset that reimbursement pressure. But when you go through the math, we believe there's an opportunity for us to pick up share in '19, and that will continue in 2020. The second part of this is what's going on in the industry, and I'll come back to those three points again. One is, PAMA is hurting all of us, but it's going to hurt the non market leading laboratories much more significantly. We believe this will be a catalyst for further consolidation. Second is, with our better than ever access changes payers are working proactively with us in how they do a better job of managing our category of spend. And then finally, as consumers are pushing back on their physicians, pushing back on their employers and asking questions about the best value in the marketplace, and we are the best value in the marketplace; the best quality, the best service at the lowest price. So, Ross, we have really kicked off '19 with the beginning of a journey here to pick up share. And we believe with confidence that we can deliver that outlook that we outlined at investor day. Mark, would you like to add to that? Mark Guinan : Yes, sure, Steve. Ross, as I mentioned, and we've talked about several times, including the investor day, this year saw more dramatic changes throughout the year than certainly any one I've experienced since I've been at Quest. Denials were a big part of that. I'll start with the vitamin D change back in the second quarter, we saw more and more state Medicaid programs making decisions on cystic fibrosis, we've talked about prescription for monitoring and payers both tightening policies around same day of service for presumptive and definitive testing, which we think is clinically appropriate but they've put in policies to deny payment for one of those tests. We've seen them squeezing panels saying that they're going to pay for fewer and fewer analytes [ph], and again we don't think that's necessarily clinically appropriate but that is the way many of them are paying now. And even in the area allergy, there was an NCCI edit that was put in last year that resulted in significant denials in our allergy space. So, it was a tough year from a denials perspective. We have built all that into our 2019 guidance. And so when I talked about carrying the fourth quarter business into Q1, we fully accounted for all that in our thinking in the guidance we're providing. The other area of surprise was patient concessions. And we, based on what we knew going into the year, we're expecting a similar level of patient concessions. I'm sure you've seen and we referenced the Keiser Report that came out about the middle of the year that informed us and others that actually the average deductable went up significantly, so there was more being borne by patients. Obviously that meant more of our revenue was coming from patients, and we were just starting to see that in our collections because there's obviously a delay in the adjudication process to the payers, and then we -- as we send the bills out to the patients so we start to get an experience of the collection rate that may or may not match our historical rate, and was actually finding that it was being negatively impacted. The other thing I mentioned was we did have some issues with one of our lab conversions. We have done a number of these that we've shared. We're getting close to the endpoint in the standardization process. This particular lab was not a legacy Quest system, it was a system we had acquired a couple of years ago as part of an acquisition. We therefore did not do as well with this conversion as we did historically, and therefore we struggled, as I mentioned, with some filing deadlines and other things. The other issue is this is in a geography where historically there's higher rate of payment concessions versus other geographies. So, as we got delays in our ability to send out bills and as we looked more and more to patients and less directly to the payers, that definitely created a headwind. The good news on that one is we fully expect that to be behind us. And so that's more of a temporal issue versus the denials, which as I said. And the overall level of patient responsibility will carry into 2019, and is fully baked within our guidance. Operator : Our next question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question. Patrick Donnelly : Great. Thanks, guys. Steve Rusckowski : Good morning, Patrick. Patrick Donnelly : Good morning. Steve, maybe just on the United trends, I know you gave some color. You guys are expecting a first tranche to move pretty quickly. Can you just talk through how it's come in relative to expectations? And then any way you can frame the expectations for the year would certainly be appreciated in terms of what's\u2026 Steve Rusckowski : Yes, sure. So, what I said in my prepared remarks, it's off to a good start. And we expected that it would be off to a good start, so it's on our expectation that we expected to be able to pick up some of the volume early in the year. But what we also said is that it will continue to build throughout '19, and also this provides us a growth opportunity beyond '19, into '20, into '21, okay. So, when I talk about a billion dollars worth of opportunity, we'll see a portion of that in '19, and that's contemplated in our guidance. But there is a large portion of that billion dollars beyond '19. So it's tracking well. We're happy with the early volumes we see. And it will continue to build throughout the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. You may ask your question. Ralph Giacobbe : Thanks, good morning. Steve Rusckowski : Good morning. Ralph Giacobbe : Just lab equipment size, an incremental $30 million headwind from Medicaid related to PAMA. Are you seeing similar -- I think you said over $200 million of reimbursement headwind, seemed a little bit worse than what you previously estimated, so wanted to understand that. And then if you could, real quick, you talked about incremental cost in the -- I think you said in the first quarter, hoping you can just size that, and whether that does go away for the rest of the year. Steve Rusckowski : Yes, Mark? Mark Guinan : Sure. Ralph, the $200 million is actually consistent with what I shared at investor day. The amount of PAMA headwinds outside the clinical lab fee schedule, where we're directly reimbursed from Medicare on fee for service, is not large. There's some Medicaid programs that have reduced their rates, they may have justified it or cited PAMA changes. It's hard to know whether these Medicaid rates are directly tied to PAMA. You can look across all the states, there seems to be potentially some direct relationship. Not all of them have changed the rates. So yes, there's a little bit of headwind in Medicaid as there typically is, that's not unusual, certainly not to the magnitude of the amount that you asked us about. And then, we're not going to size the investment specifically, but what we wanted people to understand is when you look at the rhythm of the quarters coming to the year, on the cost side, not only do we not benefit from the restructuring of our cost base that we announced at the end of this quarter until Q2, but we also are actually spending more in Q1 as we're making people aware of our new access in all of the geographies where we need to inform patients and providers. We're adding [indiscernible] by adding patient service centers, extra couriers, doing all the things to ensure that as this volume comes the customer and stakeholder experience is outstanding. And obviously, we'll continue to monitor that as we see the volume, and either add more or less, but initially when you add that a little bit ahead of the volume it's cost versus cost of sales. So, that's really what we wanted to make sure people understood. And then the other significant item in terms of the quarterly cycling, as I mentioned, is one fewer revenue day that it is significant. We pick it up in Q3, but losing a day billing Q1 versus last year is going to be a significant impact in the year-over-year comparison. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : Morning, Bill. Bill Quirk : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. So, a couple of questions here, so first off, on vitamin D, real quick, just want to confirm that this is lower volumes versus, say, pressure on reimbursement levels. Also on the Medicaid denials, was hoping you could expand on that a little bit because it's pretty much universally covered, at least based on our due diligence. And then lastly, just big picture question for Steve, based on your conversations, how much volumes from the hospitals do you think could be play for M&A over the three-year PAMA period -- initial PAMA period? Thank you. Steve Rusckowski : Got you. Mark, why don't you take the first two? Mark Guinan : Yes, so the Medicaid denials, and I'm not sure what you're referencing, Bill, but a combination of managed Medicaid where they put in more restrictive requirements, including preauthorization that often can result in denials. Also, some of it arguably clinically appropriate where they put in new intelligence to ensure that we only have this once in a lifetime. They may have had this done by a different lab. Historically we obviously weren't aware of it. We get an order, we think it's legitimate, we do the work, we provide it to the payer and they deny it based on it -- once in a lifetime policy. So those things are absolutely tightening in the cystic fibrosis. And we have had a couple of states, I don't have it at my fingertips, we'll circle back and do that actually, the state programs with traditional Medicaid that have stopped reimbursing cystic fibrosis as well. And vitamin D, as I mentioned, it was a combination. So certainly, we still continue to get and got orders with screening codes. Quite often vitamin D is ordered as a part of a bunch of other common laboratory testing. So we don't choose to not perform that test. Even if a diagnostic code initially is not one that suggest to get reimburse, so and absolutely the headwind to our revenue, revenue for rack. And has resulted in significant denials with the change in this national payer, but also as physicians have gotten educate them with the appropriate use and certainly, we're driving that. The industry is driving that, you have seen a fall-off because some of the vitamin D that was being ordered was prescreening and clinically that has been determined not to be appropriate. But there still is a number of vitamin D tests are coming to in the screen codes that really are not screening. The doctors just are not coding them appropriately, and unfortunately, those are resulting in denials and headwinds for us. Steve Rusckowski : Yes. So Bill, on your question about the opportunities around hospitals, let me start by reminding you and everyone that, what we said in the Investor Day is in 2018, we have a strong year for M&A. It's about 300 basis points roughly. And if you recall, you go back to one of those Investor Day slides up for use and charts we use, if you look at the distribution of the M&A, we've done past few years, it's really been a balance of acquiring hospital outreach, acquiring some outreach deals. Excuse me, some laboratory regional deals and they are finally buying some capabilities and services and advanced diagnostics. And if you look at the hospital deals, it's been, a good part, but not a majority of what we have acquired. And then, second is we still pick up let's say one regional app for year. And that, in fact, we just said in our prepared remarks that we closed on voice and vitamin Missouri. So it's a good example of doing that once again. And what we also indicated is prospectively, we do believe it's obviously for all three categories, is that M&A should be north of 2% going forward. And we also said we've only contemplated in our guidance, something around 1%, which are those deals for 2019. So some portion of that is the acceleration in the discussions we're having with hospitals around their lab strategy. And we have those discussions Bill, we also have discussions around professional laboratory services and that's an organic growth opportunity. And we announced again in our prepared remarks that we picked up two engagements in the back half '18 that we feel good about and we have more engagements in the pipeline as well. So you need to think about our hospital strategy really from a contributor to M&A because of that 2% but also equally the opportunity organically to pick up organic revenue growth through these professional laboratory services engagements that we continue to announce. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. You may ask your question. Steve Rusckowski : Good Morning, Lisa. Lisa Gill : Good morning, Steve. Good morning, Mark. I just really wanted to just make sure that I understand how we're thinking about the cadence of earnings this year. If I look at 2018, it looks like roughly 52% of earnings came in the front half, 48% in the second half. It sounds like it's going to be vastly different in 2019, am I thinking about that correctly that we're going to see a lot more of the earnings come in the third and fourth quarter just based on all your commentary whether we think about the incremental day in the third quarter, we think about anniversary in hep C, as well as vitamin D as well as some other things, so that would just be the first part of my question. And then secondly, also, along those lines, Steve you made this comment around the volume to build throughout the year as it pertains to the managed care contracts, can you maybe just give us some color, is that you are educating the physicians that are being in networks, is it what are some of the things that will have to happen throughout 2019 to give us comfort that you will see that volume? Steve Rusckowski : Okay, Mark. It's for you. Mark Guinan : So I'll start with the quarterly cadence Lisa. Yes, you're correct. So as we look at 2019, as I mentioned Q4, should be in we expected an easy compare to 2018 given the significant change enhancements that I referenced also and Steve will comment more color when we submitted, but we expect volumes to build. So while we certainly moved a bunch of offices and got incremental access volumes you know at the beginning of the year, we are continuing to compete that we expect to build more and more over time. And we also have referenced and are anticipating and hopeful that United will announce this preferred lab network. And we're hoping to be included that and we're expecting to be we're all waiting that announcement. We think that will benefit us as well, certainly with United patients. And yes, we have probably not gotten as much into the calendar impact on quarterly cycling in the past, but it is so significant, we're going to provide more transparency, so losing a day in the first quarter, getting a day in the third quarter, certainly well, change the year-over-year impact that is not insignificant. And then finally as you mentioned some of the timing of what we incurred some of the headwinds last year and when we left those and that will not happen in Q1. So therefore, we have some a topic compared to year-over-year in Q1 combined with the cost items that I mentioned earlier, so for all those reasons that compares much tougher in Q1. Last thing I would add is patient concessions. As we mentioned the beginning of the year, we did not anticipate a significant shift to patients away from the payers directly on where revenue would come from. Now that we saw what happened last year, we are building in a higher rate of patient concessions from day one. Obviously, over time as we look at our collections, we will adjust that, but that's certainly going to be a headwind in the first quarter as well. All of those things are built into the guidance that we provided for the year. Steve Rusckowski : Yes, so just to fill out the question around volume growth throughout the year and the first tranche of the first quarter, so what we shared in 2018 is when we announced that we're going to be back in network with United and Horizon and with anthem in Georgia. We started to communicate that to our customers. And so, what we will see in the first quarter is the first tranche, if you will, of those really good customers's request that they wanted us to get back into network and we're ready to flip those accounts as quickly as possible. So you'll see that and second part of this is, why it's going to continue to build, it's not everyone is flipping on day one. I mean, they provide us an opportunity for the rest of '19 and then into '20 and '21 and some of this is that some of the market is still hearing firsthand from us that we're back in network. So the answer to your question what do we need to do is we continue to work on communication. We do this with our sales force, it takes multiple calls to the customer and to be able to flip those accounts typically, sometimes we need to work out some of the IT integration issues to make sure we can get those orders and as a result of those some customers that might be relatively new and that just takes some time. So if you take the state of New Jersey we are essentially we're back in network with the Blue Cross Blue Shield system in New Jersey and with United. We picked up a lot of access, so we've got a number of accounts that were detailing to pick up the gun and a chair for those taking more time than maybe where we only had -- did have 10% of the volume of those loyal customers in that first tranche. So that's what we're going to need to do and we'll do in backup and that will continue in 2020 and 2021 where we still see more opportunities to pick up shares. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays. You may ask your question. Jack Meehan : Thanks. Hi, Steve. Hi, Mark. Steve Rusckowski : Hi, Jack. Mark Guinan : Hi, Jack. Jack Meehan : I had a couple of just hoping for some details on both the rev per rack and volumes in the quarter. So on rev per rack down 5.5% by my math, the accounts receivable change was about two points. So if you could reach us on the remaining, what some of the factors are? That will be helpful. And on the volume side, how much did M&A contribute and the moving pieces between weather in calendar would be helpful? Steve Rusckowski : And you're asking weather in calendar in Q4 Jack, or just? Jack Meehan : Yes, all related to the fourth quarter. Steve Rusckowski : Okay. So the other drivers of revenue per rack include things like mix, so for instance, our PLS business which, as we explained in the past had higher as lower revenue per rack at a higher growth rate than our overall core business. So that created some headwinds on a rev per rack. And then, what I referenced in terms of the fact that the business experienced an increasing level of denials throughout the year and also patient concessions relative to the prior year. So those things all maybe the tough compared year-over-year Q4 2017 versus Q4 2018, so it wasn't just the change in estimates but it is actually a recognition that that business have revenue per req as we are exiting the year. So those are some of the contributors. We certainly had a little bit of weather impact, it wasn't significant but it was a headwind in that as well. In terms of days, that was a small impact, small negative impact as well. And the other thing was that we had some price changes in the back half of the year that will annualize in 2019 before the end of the year. So you combine all those things and those certainly were the drivers in the year-over-year decrease in rev req. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. You may ask your question. Kevin Caliendo : Good morning, guys. Steve Rusckowski : Hi, Kevin. Kevin Caliendo : Thanks for the call. So I just wanted to go over the United the preferred network. You made the comment that you hoped to be included. And I would assume that you're planning on being included given that you're now part of your now in network but if you can clarify that that comment a little bit that would be helpful but also I just want to understand what you think is going to actually happen within the United Network come July 1, like what actually changes within the United behavior within their member behavior. You can sort of quantify that? That would be really helpful. Steve Rusckowski : Sure, sure, first of all, one would think when we announced in May that we're back in the United and we're the Nation's largest commercial laboratory that if in fact United were to go forward with a preferred migratory network that we would be included. Now it's up to them to announce that. But we're clearly hopeful and planning on being one of the shortlist of laboratories that are included and in that, what we share with that in the past is that all payers and particularly United I think in my mind is taking the lead on this, is realizing that they could do more to do a better job in laboratory spending and by doing, by having a preferred laboratory network, they're going to tighten up the network and they will work with us on things that we can do to make sure that we drive market share gains. And that would include things like working with your customers that are so customers on benefit designs, it could include working with us on our hospital strategy where it could be in the best interest of all parties to think about a different network strategy within the geography. It also could include things that we're proactively going after certain geographies where we know there's an opportunity for us to gain share. So can announce it before it's announced but we're hopefully, we'll be included as you would expect, we should be given we're the largest national and given that we just announced that network and there'll be a lot of strategies within this to help us with our market deep plans that we've outlined through the course of the last six to nine months. So Mark, you would like to add to that? Mark Guinan : I think that covers and obviously we're respectful of United's desire and right to announce, we've applied for that lab network, there is a certain set of criteria as we looked at it, we're very confident. But ultimately we need to wait for United and then in terms of what the particular aspects are I think Steve has captured it well, largely it's leverage preferred, you preferred for a reason obviously it's better value but it's also quality metrics and other things that United is looking for their members and therefore United, the patients and everybody is in the ecosystem who is in that preferred lab network will all benefit if there's more work sent to those better value providers. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question. Mark Guinan : Good morning, Ricky. Ricky Goldwasser : Good morning. So two questions, let me start with the payer one, so when you listed the factors that had a negative impact on price in 2018, you talked about payer denial that started in March when national pay is going to lab into first quarter. So what gives you confidence that other national payers are not going to follow the lead of the specific one, you have had conversations with payers and have you factored in that risk in your guidance range? Mark Guinan : Ricky, thanks for the question. Actually a majority of the payers are already there and in the managed Medicare space they've been following MLCP for a while and that's really where this emanated from, Cigna adopted it in 2018, the labs remaining significant payer who have to do early on, we obviously have a very close relationship with Aetna, we expect Aetna to move in that direction and certainly that is built within our assumption, we don't know exact timing, we don't know for sure but certainly in our assumptions and our guidance we are expecting Aetna to go there as well and therefore all the national payers to be there. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities. Your line is open. Mark Guinan : Good morning, Ann. Ann Hynes : Good morning. So where you get your free cash flow guidance, it looks pretty strong despite the reimbursement headwinds, can you let us know what is embedded of that free cash flow guidance, is it how much share repurchase on this embedded, how much is slated to M&A and then secondly and typically you provided guidance range and you just doing minimum this time, is it a reason for that and maybe what are the biggest swing factors that could get you higher than that minimum range? Thank you. Mark Guinan : Sure, Ann. So the guidance on operating cash flow of $1.3 billion is obviously commensurate with our pacing around earnings, it is not a significant change in working capital assumes within those number, there is other puts and calls around some tax items and so on and so forth that impact our operating cash flow, that we take into account. But largely the change year-over-year is based on our net earnings. In terms of cash deployment, I talked about the 350 to 400 for internal capital which obviously we view somewhere between 900 and 950 of free cash flow, our dividend now gets us to long way towards our majority commitment to our shareholders but certainly we need to do some share repurchases to get ourselves to that at least 50% commitment and that is built in our expectations to basically this point preventing dilution given our equity program. We're now anticipating in that guidance that I provided a pick up from any reduction in ways down. So with the remaining free cash flow is going to be situationally dependent. So as Steve talked and I mentioned we have an main strategy we're expected to deploy chunk of that cash we're coming into the year with some good carryover based on deals that we've already executed but we just announced the closing of item beyond that we believe there's opportunity deploy more M&A but we're going to use the same financial discipline we always have and if we have a deal that with our money will create more value for shareholders we're going move forward on that deal and in a given point in time we don't have any excusable deal that meets our expectations then we will buy back shares as we have historically. So this point I don't have a specific plan or the balance of the year beyond our majority commitment and others and that's beyond the cash but we are deploying for the -- acquisition. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies. Your line is open. Brian Tanquilut : Hi, good morning guys. Steve, just a question for you as we talk about the payer consolidating market share to the top layers on your competitors call they talk about Blue Cross of Florida is a payer that they're having conversations with so. Is that something that we should start thinking about and if you just could give that goes in detail on that contract in terms of exploration and the set up that you have with them right now. Thanks? Steve Rusckowski : Yes. So, Brian, honestly we down pass some record due to specific comment on the specific payer. But what we have said is that were very nice shape. With 19 with our relationships, what we what we will say is that you know going into 19 we should have most of the nationals are in good shape, obviously they are with United where they would got out and the others will it will be a nice shape as well and then also these big states matter of fact, we talked about in their Investor Day, we pick up new strong bigger states United States. If you look at California with New York, Florida and Texas, about 110 million lives are shared very strong and our relationship with the other payer most states are quite strong. So we feel good about that and we're in nice shape in those states. And that is true to go back to your specific question about Florida. We feel good about our cousins in Florida, we have a strong working relationship with Florida Blue Cross Blue Shield and we feel we're in a nice position to deliver on good income share that we talked over all about doing at Quest Diagnostics in the state of Florida because of that relationship, and our great access that we have in Florida. Mark Guinan : If I could just jump in real quick, I didn't hear the second part of Ann's question, my apologies, we jumped to Brian, so Ann and others, the reason we've chosen [indiscernible] this year is given some of the uncertainty this year, obviously, to make the call on how quickly we grow the volume, we move access, it's not a negative uncertainty, it's just more variability than we've experienced historically in terms of how the volume might come, where it will come from, et cetera. And so the guidance we're providing with the floor obviously is towards the lower end of our revenue guidance and to the extent that we hit the upper end of our revenue guidance, or even potentially surprise ourselves and beat that. Those would be the upside. So I think we've got our costs down pretty good. Really, the question is around the overall volume growth, the pace at which it comes and the source of which lies because obviously there's variability in the pricing and margin depending on which payer they come through. So that would be the opportunity to do better and hopefully that answers your question on why we chose to [indiscernible]. Shawn Bevec : Operator, next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Derik de Bruin : Hi, good morning, thanks for taking my call. Steve Rusckowski : Hey, good morning. Derik de Bruin : I certainly have seen my out-of-pocket diagnostics costs creep higher now that I'm getting some work done on a regular basis, but I may not have noticed this if I was doing a one-off or annual visit. I guess, how do you drive consumers that shop around for their diagnostic vendor when they're at the hospital and if you're told to go to a hospital lab to get a sample, at what point can you intervene or can they intervene to ask Quest to run the tests since basically, it's like how do you give that consumer the choice to send it to the lower cross provider if the hospitals aren't telling you to go there? Steve Rusckowski : Yes, that's a good question. So we've been on raising awareness for consumers around the wide variation, and medical costs broadly, and related to that is a multi-pronged approach. First of all, in some states, we actually provided this at Investor Day. The states are actually providing visibility of a wide variation for consumers. So the state of Massachusetts, they're actually providing on their Web site and if you go on that Web site you'll see the wide variation of what the average commercial rates for Quest Diagnostics are versus hospital outreach laboratories. And the hope is in that state since consumers are picking up a fair share of the costs in health care that consumers will start to become aware of this and bring that information to their physician. And the second part of this is physicians are the advocate, typically, for the patient, even though they have this relationship with the hospital systems and in some cases they sold their practice, but still they realize that this is coming out of their patients' pocket, they realized it could be a wide variation which for a number of a patients it's a considerable sum of money. And for those of us that are reasonably healthy might be once a year, but for many it's not once a year. So it's a considerable portion of our out-of-pocket cost. So we're making sure that the physicians are aware of this as well and then also you know that when you look at what we're doing with the payers the payers increasingly make it visible. And so the payers all reach out to their membership and have campaigns with simple messages like why pay more, and related to that it's not just the lab, you know -- I know many of you realized there's other ancillary services that you have the same issue. So for instance, radiology is getting a lot of visibility. So the help we're getting here as well is this topic in general is getting -- visibility from payers but equally from physicians and then with consumers asking questions. And then once they realize they can ask a question they demand that they [indiscernible] we are in network and therefore it's unacceptable that you tell them they can only go to the hospital lab. And they simply point to -- it's going to cost you extra money if they don't go to Quest, so Doc, why does this make sense? So that's what we're doing about it. Operator : Thank you. Our final question today comes from Matt Larew with William Blair. You may ask your question. Matt Larew : Hi, good morning. Steve Rusckowski : Good morning. Matt Larew : I wanted to ask about your referral partners. You mentioned, Steve, that volumes had traded nicely through first quarter. I just wanted to get a sense for what of that you attributed to potential share gains versus increasing health care utilization at the end market level, thanks? Steve Rusckowski : Yes. First of all, yes, we're here and we're only -- I guess, February 14th, happy Valentine's Day, but what we see in the first five or six weeks of the year as we said we're off to a good start. We haven't been asked about it, but I'll share, you know, we think utilization volumes are stable. We're not seeing big pickups or drops in our good customers. So therefore, we think utilization environment out there is relatively stable. So therefore, the volume is coming from share gains. And that's what we expected. So, good start. We're picking up share, and that's going to build throughout the year. Shawn Bevec : Operator? Operator : You're showing no questions in queue. Shawn Bevec : Okay. So thanks everyone for joining us today. We appreciate your support and questions, and have a great day. Take care.

The entire contents of this call, including the presentation and question-and-answer session that will follow, are the copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics with all rights reserved. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. Now I would like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead, please. Shawn Bevec : Thank you, and good morning. I\u2019m here with Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and we\u2019ll discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics\u2019 future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS, and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS, excluding amortization expense, references to adjusted operating income for all periods now excludes amortization expense. Finally, growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings growth, are compound annual growth rates. Now, here is Steve Rusckowski. Steve Rusckowski : Thanks, Shawn, and thanks everyone for joining us today. Well, this morning, I\u2019ll discuss the first quarter and review progress on our two-point strategy. And then Mark will provide more detail on the results. Well we\u2019re off to a good start in 2019; for the first quarter, we grew revenues despite one less revenue day and significant reimbursement pressure. Reported EPS was $1.20, down 5% from the same period of 2019. Adjusted EPS was $1.40, down 8%. We\u2019re pleased with our revenue and adjusted EPS results given the expectations we shared with you in mid-February. Volume growth was very strong at 3.6%, so Quest is well positioned in 2019 to grow share and deliver revenue growth. Performance in the quarter reflects volume growth from expanded network access, acquisitions, improving performance in our hospital reference business, and favorable weather. We\u2019ve made progress in the quarter despite significant reimbursement pressure and higher patient concessions. As we shared before, Quest is poised for growth based on three fundamental changes in the marketplace. First, PAMA driven reimbursement pressure is a catalyst for structural change. Reimbursement experience in the first quarter is in line with the expected 10% reduction in Medicare rates and we expect a similar reduction in 2020. We also said the impact of these cuts will be more significant on smaller, independent, and hospital outreach laboratories. We believe the cuts could potentially eliminate the majority of their profit and will provide a catalyst for market consolidation. Just in this quarter, the nation\u2019s largest nursing home lab operator filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. The company provided clinical laboratory testing services to more than 12,000 facilities in more than 35 states. According to the press reports, PAMA was cited as a major reason for bankruptcy as the Medicare cuts wiped out the company\u2019s slim profits and caused it to cut back services. Second, payers are more focused than ever on driving better value in their lab spend, which supports our plan to gain share. This is clearly evidenced by the opening of major health plan contracts at the large national laboratories, which provides the best value and quality for patients, physicians, and payers. We\u2019re very pleased to be named a UnitedHealthcare Preferred Lab Network provider effective July 1, 2019, meeting exceptional criteria for access, costs, data, quality, and service. Quest and our AmeriPath subsidiary were two of only seven labs selected to participate in the Preferred Lab Network. Finally, nobody cares more about the variation in healthcare costs than the employers and their employees, the country\u2019s largest payers. Increasingly, patients are motivated to find high quality and service providers with low prices like Quest Diagnostics. More and more we\u2019re seeing evidence of increasing price transparency in the lab marketplace. Massachusetts has been a leader in price transparency by launching its own website to help consumers understand the wide variation in healthcare cost. During Governor Charlie Baker\u2019s recent visit to our Marlborough lab, we pledged our continued support to Massachusetts\u2019 efforts to help consumers understand the true cost of care. We are well positioned to benefit from these trends, which will serve as a catalyst for Quest to continue to gain share. Our strategy to accelerate growth has five elements : Grow more than 2% per year through accretive, strategic in-line acquisitions; expand relationships with health plans and hospital health systems; offer the broadest access to diagnostic innovation; be recognized as the consumer-friendly provider of diagnostic information services; and then finally support population health in data analytics and extended care services. Let me take you through several highlights from our strategy to accelerate growth in the quarter. Recall, we shared in our initial guidance that we carried over 1% growth into the year. The nine deals we announced and closed since the beginning of 2018 positioned as well to meet our M&A growth targets in 2019, including our recently completed acquisition of the clinical laboratory services business of Boyce and Bynum. Our pipeline remains strong, and we\u2019re having several conversations with health systems evaluating their hospital outreach lab strategy. We delivered strong organic growth through the quarter, thanks to the best access to insured lives this company has had in over a decade. In January, we saw a rise in volume attributable to health plans, where we recently gained access and the year-over-year growth rate accelerated throughout the quarter. We\u2019re working hard to educate a whole new group of physicians on the Quest value proposition, but it does take time. As we said, gaining market share through expanded network access will be a gradual process.  So we\u2019re pleased by the progress we\u2019re making in our access improvement as well as we\u2019re making progress in our hospital reference testing, which reflects our recent PLS relationships and reference testing wins. Trends in our reference testing business has shown improvement relative to last year. Key test growth drivers in the quarter included tuberculosis testing, Cardio IQ, drug monitoring, and hemepath blood cancer testing, all of which showed strong revenue growth for the quarter. QuestDirect, our consumer initiating testing service is being well received by consumers who are looking to take charge of their health. Our offerings are popular across the entire demographic spectrum, with the largest percentage of consumers coming from the 25 to 34-year-olds. Earlier this month, we launched three new STD test packages allowing with consumers to get tested at their discretion. The second part of our two-point strategy is to drive operational excellence. Construction of our new flagship laboratory in Clifton, New Jersey is well underway. The lab builds on the success of our Lab of the Future at Marlborough, Massachusetts, incorporating innovative uses of building design and automated technology to provide a broad range of advanced diagnostic and information services to more than 40 million people. We expect the lab to be operational in 2021. We also continue to drive increases in productivity. We have rebalanced resources and reduced expenses in some areas while ensuring we have the operational resources needed to deliver on the volume growth that we see. Productivity gains have enabled us to effectively manage our headcount growth. So here are a few proof points. We\u2019re seeing improved electronic order rates as we increase volume from the expanded network access which improves our lab productivity. We continue to re-enable our enterprise workflow, which has allowed us to reduce the number of specimen pickups and the number of client calls through acquisitions to our call centers. We\u2019ve also driven increases in our supplies efficiency. And then finally, our labor productivity gains have enabled us to reduce our labor cost per acquisition in the first quarter while providing salary increases for our front-line employees. Now I\u2019d like to turn it over to Mark, who will bring you through the financial performance. Mark? Mark Guinan : Thanks, Steve. In the first quarter, consolidated revenues were $1.89 billion, up 0.4% versus the prior year. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services grew 0.5% compared to the prior year, driven by strong volume growth and favorable weather, partially offset by increasing reimbursement pressure and higher patient concessions. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 3.6% versus the prior year. Excluding acquisitions, volumes grew 2.4%. Favorable weather in the first quarter provided a tailwind of roughly 50 basis points. However, there was approximately one less revenue day in the quarter that negatively impacted volume growth by roughly 120 basis points. Revenue per acquisition in the first quarter declined by 3% versus the prior year, driven primarily by increasing reimbursement pressure and higher patient concessions. Year price headwinds were consistent with our expectations at approximately 2.5%. This concludes the impact of PAMA, which amounted to a headwind of slightly less than 120 basis points. Note, the PAMA impact includes both direct cuts to the current lab fee schedule as well as modest indirect price changes for Medicaid and then small number of floating rate contracts. Reported operating income was $248 million, a 13.2% of revenues, compared to $272 million or 14.5% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $286 million or 15.1% of revenues compared to $325 million or 17.2% of revenues last year. The year-over-year decline in operating margin was attributable to one less revenue day in the quarter, higher reimbursement pressure and higher patient concessions. Reported EPS was $1.20 in the quarter, compared to $1.27 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $1.40, down approximately 8% from $1.52 last year, which is roughly in line with the expectations we shared last quarter. Cash provided by operations was $275 million in the first quarter versus $180 million last year. Capital expenditures were $47 million compared to $73 million a year ago. Now turning to guidance. We are reaffirming our outlook for 2019 as follows. Revenues expected to be between $7.6 billion and $7.75 billion, an increase of approximately 1% to 3% versus the prior year. Reported EPS expected to be greater than $5.16 and adjusted EPS to be greater than $6.40. Cash provided by operations is expected to be approximately $1.3 billion, and capital expenditures are expected to be between $350 million and $400 million. I\u2019d like to leave with a few reminders as you think about the remainder of 2019. First, we continue to expect more than $200 million of reimbursement pressure this year. This headwind should be relatively evenly spread throughout the year. Second, we continue to expect that volumes will gradually increase as we progress through 2019, just as we saw through the first quarter. Third, the Easter and passover holidays falling entirely in April will create a modest year-over-year headwind in the second quarter. Fourth, we have approximately one extra revenue day in the third quarter. Finally, we expect the strongest revenue and earnings growth in the fourth quarter of 2019 because of an easier comparison. I\u2019ll now turn it back to Steve Steve Rusckowski : Thanks, Mark. Well to summarize, we\u2019re off to a good start in 2019. While our industry faces significant reimbursement pressure. We are pleased with our results in the quarter. We\u2019re driving volume and market share based on being a network of approximately 90% of the commercial insured lives in the United States. We believe we are well positioned to meet our commitments in 2019. With that, we\u2019d be happy to take any of your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Dan Leonard : Thank you. So, for my one question\u2026 Steve Rusckowski : Good morning. Dan Leonard : Good morning. Steve, you made the comment that the volume growth accelerated throughout the quarter. I was hoping you could elaborate on the monthly performance, I\u2019m thinking that it will maybe help us as we think about volume growth accelerating throughout the year. Steve Rusckowski : Yes. Thank you, Dan. Well, first of all, as we said going into the year, we expect that we\u2019ll have initial pickup in the first month in January given all the work we did in 2018 to get the word out about our access changes, and we did see that. And then also what we said at the beginning of this year is we do expect that it will continue to build, and it continued to build in Q1 so we saw an improvement in February and also in March. But equally, we expected it to continue to gradually build throughout the year, so as we\u2019ve said, this is a nice growth opportunity for us in 2019, but we see an opportunity in 2020 and 2021. Dan Leonard : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : Hey, Ross. Mark Guinan : Good morning, Ross. Ross Muken : So maybe starting on United, obviously, pretty exciting news yesterday you highlighted in terms of getting selected in their PLN. I guess one, now that this sort of is formalized, I guess, how do you think other payers will look at this given sort of the known savings someone like yourself can kind of drive for consumers, members, plans, all included, given your scale and sort of cost advantage? And then, how would you sort of characterize the conversations you\u2019re having with some of the other Managed Care peers and some of the blues who could probably easily do something similar to what United is doing today? Steve Rusckowski : Yes. Thanks, Ross. Well, first of all, we\u2019re excited to be part of the Preferred Lab Network. As we mentioned in our comments, we\u2019re two out of seven. So very tight network and this will start on July 1, however, the word is out. And as you all know, the word was out when we announced that we\u2019re back in network last year. So we\u2019ve had quite a lot of interest from other national payers about what this means to some of the large regionals. And needless to say, we think it\u2019s the beginning of a trend that we would like to continue to see in other relationships that we have. What this means will become more clear as we get into it, but what we indicated clearly there will be incentives for physicians and patients in the benefit designs to move more of the volume through the high-value lab providers like Quest Diagnostics. Second is we need to continue to perform. So, we are high-quality lab, both in service and in quality, we\u2019ll be providing statistics quarterly to demonstrate that. And then finally, we\u2019ll continue to move with the opportunities we see in the marketplace to consolidate the marketplace and pick up share, which will include continuing to work on our hospital strategy, picking up share for some of those hospital outreach labs. So, we think this is a good first step in a trend that will continue. It\u2019s not going to be just with United but other payers will follow. Mark Guinan : Yes. So Ross, if I could just add quickly because I think it\u2019s certainly important. In the past, there were health plans that had preferred providers in the lab space, and obviously in other areas. And a lot of that was generally around price, so who\u2019s willing to give me the lowest price and I\u2019ll call them and provide a preferred provider. In this case, contracts were negotiated separate from this decision that United just made. Obviously, everyone\u2019s prices are determined by individual negotiations. And this is really about evaluating the value that you bring. So yes, price is an important component. But when we looked at the application and, as Steve shared, access, service and quality are the things that drive value. And as we\u2019ve been talking about for a while, we feel we are positively differentiated versus most of the market and here is an acknowledgment by a large payer, obviously, agreeing with that and then getting behind that by naming us as one of those preferred providers so that consumers of our services, both the patient and the physician, will recognize that. Because obviously, it\u2019s hard for them to know and see and compare across the various options that they have. So we\u2019re very excited about this because this is not a price play. This is about the value you\u2019re offering on many parameters, and we are well down the road in conversations with several other nationals on similar concepts and so they recognize as well this is an opportunity to bring better value into the members. Steve Rusckowski : And Ross, one of the things that I wanted to make clear, just based on some questions that I was receiving last night, is that we are \u2013 there\u2019s no additional contracted change or price change for us to be in the Preferred Lab Network. We have contracted rates with United and those are the rates that we\u2019ll live with them in the Preferred Lab Network. So there\u2019s no additional step down. Ross Muken : And maybe just quickly as a follow-up, I mean what does this do to the competitive landscape? I mean, you talked about a bankruptcy, obviously, between sort of the PAMA pressures and maybe volumes narrowing to fewer and fewer players on the lab side with yourselves and maybe your largest peer probably benefiting the most. I guess, how do you see this landscape kind of evolving competitively at least among the independents over maybe the next three or five years? Steve Rusckowski : So Ross, it just comes backs to, we think we have a unique setup in our industry to gain share. PAMA is the big change and it changed the underlying profitability of the industry. When we were at our Investor Day, we talked about roughly half the profit coming out of the industry and whenever you take half the profit out of any industry, you\u2019re going to see consolidation and we\u2019re the market leader and we\u2019re going to consolidate. Second is you do see now with the Preferred Lab Network for United and what Mark just said about other payers following, there will be tighter purchasing with the payers. And then finally, this is driven in part by members pushing back on the high cost of healthcare and the movement to more transparency with much more visibility and wide variation in health care cost. And Quest Diagnostics is really second to none in terms of our quality or service and at very, very competitive prices. So we believe this is a different place at a different time and we\u2019ve gotten an opportunity to pick up share. Operator : Our next question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Patrick Donnelly : Great. Thanks, guys. Maybe just one on M&A. Can you give us an update on some of the recent larger acquisitions like Shiel? How that\u2019s trending against your deal model? And then just on the pipeline, can you talk about how that\u2019s trending versus maybe late last year? Are you kind of seeing that long-awaited inflection point in the consolidation pieces on the lab side? Steve Rusckowski : Yes, Mark, why don\u2019t you take the Shiel? Mark Guinan : Yes. So Shiel \u2013 I don\u2019t know you referenced [indiscernible] since we closed Shiel more than a year ago but we don\u2019t specifically comment on individual deals. But what we have said is that we\u2019re very confident in our ability to integrate acquisitions especially around the core lab space whether its outreach or regional lab like Shiel. So we\u2019re pleased with our progress and certainly, it\u2019s contributing to some of our growth. So this is something we\u2019ve gotten really good at over the last several years. We\u2019ve got it institutionalized in our organization. We\u2019ve got a team that spends time dedicated on these integrations. We got a playbook and we roll out every time that we do one of these deals. And largely what we\u2019re really doing is we\u2019re just moving that volume into our existing infrastructure be in our draw centers or logistics or laboratory. So as we\u2019ve said before, it\u2019s pretty much always a cost play, it\u2019s the easiest one to deliver. So we\u2019re very confident in our ability to deliver those synergies and then importantly, because of all the things we talked about around our service and our quality and the amount of attention we pay to these integrations, we have been successful in maintaining a vast majority of that volume. So we\u2019re confident in what we do going forward based on our ability that we\u2019ve demonstrated over the last couple of years. Steve Rusckowski : And Patrick, the second part of your question has to do with our funnel and activity and just in general is more interest of particularly, I think, you\u2019re referring to hospitals \u2013 hospital outreach laboratories selling their business. If you go back a year ago, what we\u2019ve said is PAMA was announced in the first year of payment cuts and what it says in our travels is that very few hospital CEOs were aware of PAMA back a year ago. That has changed, made more are aware of it, it\u2019s been getting much more visible. What we continue to push in terms of having to think through our \u2013 their lab strategy is continue to get traction. And so we\u2019re in active dialogues, as I said in our prepared \u2013 my prepared remarks with a number of systems around their lab strategy, which includes outreach. Now you couple PAMA with what you\u2019re hearing about the payers putting pressure on the Preferred Lab Network and as you know, the most significant price differential is typically with hospital outreach labs. So when we have this conversation, clearly you hear about PAMA, it\u2019s certainly \u2013 potentially a 30% cut for their Medicare business, which will also see pressure on the payer side. And then thirdly is they are hearing from their physicians that their patients are pushing back on their high out-of-pocket cost. So in general, this is putting more logs on the fire of consolidation and our hospital strategies is in the works of getting more and more opportunities in front of us. Operator : Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : Hi, Ricky. Ricky Goldwasser : Hi. Good morning. So I have a follow-up question on the United network. Just to clarify, did you factor in any contribution from the preferred network in the second half guidance? And the second part of the question, kind of, like, when we look at all the other labs that are included, most of them seem to be focused on specialty testing. So are there also economic incentives to patients who would opt to come to Quest on their routine side? Just kind of, like, trying to understand the incentives that United is providing consumers to come to Quest over some other regional routine providers. Mark Guinan : So Ricky, let me just address the guidance and then I\u2019ll turn it back to Steve. As you know, we have a pretty broad range of 1% to 3%. So there\u2019s a lot of different things that come to play in that. So what I would say at this point is in order to meet our guidance, certainly, somewhere in the middle, we\u2019re not counting on significant volume coming from the Preferred Lab Network. Obviously, at this point, we don\u2019t know yet know the details. United has not announced those details. So we\u2019re awaiting that. We\u2019re optimistic and hopeful that it\u2019s going to be something that\u2019s going to have some significant impact. But you naturally expect that would grow and certainly probably more in 2020. We could get some benefit in 2019. But we need to wait until they announce exactly it\u2019s going to work, what those details are and so forth. So we\u2019re not counting on a kind of volume lift in the back half from the Preferred Lab Network. Steve Rusckowski : Yes. If you look at the seven, what we mentioned as two are Quest and that\u2019s Quest in general and then our AmeriPath subsidiary, which is our anatomic pathology business. If we see \u2013 you see two from Bio-Reference and so if you look at the list of seven, essentially what you find is two national laboratories broadly and Bio-Reference within reason for, let\u2019s say, the general diagnostics and then all of us for intensive purposes compete in the what we refer to as advanced diagnostics. The specifics of incentives around that are still to be defined by United. And when we have more that we can share with you, we will. But clearly, it will drive at least incentives in place to drive volume from the general diagnostic side as well as the advanced diagnostics side. Operator : Our next question comes from Ann Hynes with Mizuho. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : Good morning, Ann. Ann Hynes : Good morning. Good morning. So I just wanted an update on some of the operational trends from last year that were issued, maybe bad debt, drugs or abuse and vitamin C testing, it seemed to have stabilized. And also quickly, can you let me know how much of the one less day impacted organic volume growth? What it would have been without that headwind? Thanks. Mark Guinan : Yes. As I shared in, we estimated about 120 basis points of impact from one less day and I also shared, we\u2019re going to \u2013 it\u2019s not precise but pretty much picked that up in the third quarter. So there\u2019s the offset for the year. In terms of bad debt, I think you\u2019re referring to patient concessions. Our bad debt actually was slightly up. This year, we had one bankruptcy within our client bill business that impacted our bad debt in the quarter. Certainly not a trend, it\u2019s kind of a one-off. But patient concessions, probably about a 50 basis point headwind. And what we\u2019re really seeing is some of the patient responsibility trends that we saw in the latter half of last year, we\u2019re now carrying it forward with the expectation that, that ratio will continue. So therefore, our expectation would be in the first half we have some headwinds around patient concessions and then assuming that things don\u2019t change dramatically within the marketplace in 2019 that in the back half maybe we get some of that back. So that\u2019s what I would frame the \u2013 some of the trends. Around drugs of abuse, we did get some recent news that the national payer that had been denying same day of service were the presumptive and definitive testing and the reimbursement has changed and we haven\u2019t got the definitive date when that\u2019s going to be implemented. But we have got a confirmation writing for them that they\u2019re going to change that. So that was certainly good news. And then in terms of lapping some those changes, we are beyond when they started. So from a year-over-year comparables, they\u2019re behind us. And then the big payer change last year in Q2 on vitamin D, obviously, we\u2019ve lapped that as well now that we\u2019re in the second quarter but it was a headwind in Q1 certainly for us. We\u2019ve also shared that Aetna is going to move to that similar approach for screening of vitamin D. However, with Aetna, there is a difference because we can bill the patient. Whereas with the other payer, we just had to do the test for free, which is just something we\u2019re working on with that payer. But as per the contract, we were not able to revert to a patient bill. So while Aetna certainly were not thrilled that they\u2019re moving to a similar policy, it\u2019s not going to be as much of a headwind as it was with the other payer. Operator : Our next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : Good morning, Jack. Mitch Petersen : Thank you. This is actually Mitch Petersen, on for Jack this morning. Just being curious where volumes fell relative to your expectations in the quarter in \u2013 both from a share gain perspective but also just from a utilization environment perspective? And in your view, do you think that utilization environment in the first quarter actually picked up relative to 2018? Steve Rusckowski : Yes. Well, I\u2019ll start with utilization. As Mark talked about where volumes fit in with what we expected in the quarter, but utilization is stable. As we said in the past, we look at this on a different directions as you all do and from what we can tell, utilization in general is stable and that\u2019s \u2013 I would argue for our physician business and not hospital business as well as our hospital business. Mark, volumes relative to what we expected? Mark Guinan : Yes. So as you know, we had guided to flat to down, we actually grew revenue. So volumes were slightly above our expectations. I would attribute a large part of that to weather. As we\u2019ve talked about in the past, we can\u2019t predict the weather. So we always kind of take an average level of weather and build that into our expectations and into our guidance, and we had 50 basis points of favorable weather this year. So as Steve said, we\u2019re very pleased with volumes. We had expected a significant lift. If you adjust for the one fewer day, even more impressive volume growth, certainly, something we\u2019ve not seen in a long, long time at Quest, especially on the organic side. So meeting our expectations and finally, a little bit better literally because of the weather. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum. Your line is open. Kevin Ellich : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Steve Rusckowski : Hey, Kevin. Good morning. Kevin Ellich : Good morning, guys. So kind of just following up there. If we net-net for the weather and the one less day, it looks like underlying organic growth was about 3.1% even though reported was 2.4%. Did I do my math right there, Mark? Mark Guinan : Close enough, Kevin, yes. Kevin Ellich : Okay. Good. And then just wanted to see if you can help us quantify how much of the organic growth came from expanded network access to United and BlueCross BlueShield of New Jersey? And then did you see any volume loss from your Aetna business? Mark Guinan : Sorry. any volume loss from what? Steve Rusckowski : Aetna. Kevin Ellich : From Aetna. Mark Guinan : Yes. So obviously, we\u2019re not going to get into specific payers but the lift didn\u2019t all come from the new access. We certainly have seen growth in some of the other payers really across the board in the regions that are growing as one might expect because as we go in and talk about our broad access, we\u2019re winning accounts. And so those accounts obviously are bringing with them volume from the payers with whom we recently gained access but obviously we\u2019re getting some volume as well. We did expect and we did see some losses in Aetna. It\u2019s within our expectations and our outlook, and actually it stabilized throughout the quarter. So we saw something early and then since then, actually we\u2019ve won some of that back and it\u2019s not only not that gotten any worse but actually got a little bit better. So that\u2019s about as much detail, Kevin, as I can go into in terms of the access changes. Steve Rusckowski : Next question, operator. Operator : Next question comes from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Your line is open. Kevin Caliendo : Hi, it\u2019s Kevin Caliendo. Thanks. I wanted to talk a little bit about gross margin that was a little bit lighter than we had anticipated despite a little bit better pricing. Was it mix? Was it patient concessions? It\u2019s not hugely meaningful but it just caught my eye. Mark Guinan : Yes. So I don\u2019t know what your expectations were, Kevin. To be fair, gross margin wasn\u2019t significantly different than what we were expecting. The actual \u2013 the only area that was a little bit off our expectations was in SG&A. But there\u2019s actually a geography issue in there that I want to make sure people understand. We have some portfolio investments related to the retirement plan that we have and the accounting dictates that if there\u2019s gains or losses in that portfolio that you can either have expense or offset to expense above or below the line. We actually had $9 million of expense above the line. There\u2019s an offset in other expense below line. So there\u2019s no impact to our net earnings and our EPS and so forth. It\u2019s a geography issue. But that didn\u2019t inflate our SG&A $9 million relative to what we would have expected based on these investments. And last year, we had about $0.5 million actually decrease. So it\u2019s a significant change year-over-year, about 50 basis points of impact. So I just wanted to make sure people understand, naturally geography, it\u2019s not any sort of a trend in our SG&A. But from a gross margin standpoint, we were pretty much where we expected. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Your line is open. Brian Tanquilut : Hey, good morning, guys. Congratulations. Mark, just to follow-up on that. As I think about the ramp in earnings over the course of the year, how should we be thinking about gross margin? And then I know, last quarter, you laid out a cost-cutting initiative that I think kicks in the second quarter. So if you don\u2019t mind just walking us through the progression of that over the course of the year. Thank you. Mark Guinan : Sure. So when you think of the determinants of gross margin, obviously, it\u2019s price, which is pretty much set for the year. As we\u2019ve said that $200 million of pricing headwinds should cycle pretty at least proportionally over the four quarters. Obviously, not every quarter is equal in terms of the volume. In terms of mix, we\u2019ve had a trend but we will see if that continues in terms of better test mix as our advanced diagnostics grows faster than our routine business. But we also have some of that offset through our PLS business as well. So mix can be a driver that goes both directions, we\u2019ll see. And then the other one that I\u2019d point to is certainly volume within a quarter. So when we talk about one fewer day having about 60 basis points of impact in the first quarter on our margins because in a short period of time, a lot of our costs are fairly fixed. That\u2019s not all SG&A. Some of that is in cost of sales. When you think about our Patient Service Centers within a short period of time, that\u2019s a fairly fixed cost. Our logistics and even somewhat some of our laboratory expense, although obviously reagents and some labor are variable. So other determinant certainly as we get that extra day back in the third quarter, that\u2019s going to be a tailwind to our gross margin, not just our overall margins and so we have one fewer day in the first quarter was a headwind to that. Operator : Our next question comes from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Erin Wright : Hi, thanks. How much of the outcome units Preferred Lab Network was previously contemplated and or any of the labs are number of labs included surprise relative to your initial expectations. And then on the PAMA side, is there any sort of update on the industry efforts around PAMA release. And I guess any sort of meaningful movement on that front? And should it be assumed that any sort of relief would occur in 2021 or how should we be thinking about timing? Mark Guinan : Let me take the Preferred Lab Network and then Steve will address the PAMA. So as I mentioned, we didn\u2019t contemplate significant change and that obviously would be positive for 2019 in our guidance because we don\u2019t have the details yet. In terms of the number of labs that have been included, we didn\u2019t know. Obviously, we knew the bar was pretty high because we filled out the application, and we certainly have enough sense around the industry, and we knew it would be difficult for a lot of people to meet the criteria around service, access and quality So we were, I guess pleasantly surprised but not completely surprised that it\u2019s a fairly short list because of what United\u2019s looking for in terms of the requirements. So that\u2019s kind of where we stand and once we hear from United, some of the details, we\u2019ll be able to comment more about exactly what this means and how quickly we think it will become a tailwind and to what extent. In terms of PAMA. Steve Rusckowski : Yes. So we are \u2013 as far as PAMA, as we\u2019ve said, we are planning on the worse and working to get a better outcome. So what we\u2019ve planned in our guidance and what we\u2019ve planned in our outlook assumes the full impact of PAMA through 2021. Excuse me, 2020. And what\u2019s happening as we speak is actually today, they\u2019re hearing of a oral argument of our appeal. If you recall the District Court that saw on our case, decided not to rule on it because of jurisdiction issues, we appealed that and so we\u2019re having our oral argument today. That will be heard. They will digest that and make a decision. But if it\u2019s a favorable outcome in our behalf then we\u2019ll be able to court begin, the senses that we\u2019ll hear something this year and our argument and then the case will follow thereafter. Second is we don\u2019t get a positive outcome then we could appeal in the Supreme Court will cross that bridge when we get to it. In parallel to all that, we continue to push with members of Congress that CMS got it strong. We need to take the time to get it right. We need to make sure that given all the data, because that was what was intended, that was the congressional intent and so we\u2019re working with members of Congress on the legislative fix to make sure that we take the time to get it right. And essentially, what that would mean is push out the data collection period for some period of time to get the right amount of time for everyone\u2019s future to submit the data. And again, that\u2019d be 2019 data. So the data for first half of 2019 will be what is submitted, but we\u2019re pushing to make sure that\u2019s delayed. So that\u2019s where PAMA stands. Operator : Our next question comes from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Ivy Ma : Hey, good morning. This is Ivy Ma for Derik today. So just wanted to, Steve, if you can get an update on the QuestDirect consumer-facing program there. So any order impact this year or beyond that you can characterize there? And then can we also get an update on the extension into retail partners so far this year. Thank you. Mark Guinan : Can you speak up with \u2013 on your question regarding QuestDirect? Sorry, we couldn\u2019t hear you. Ivy Ma : Sorry, just wanted to get an update on that program. Just trying to see if there\u2019s any order impact that we can characterize this year or beyond? Steve Rusckowski : Yes. So I would just say, we introduced our new offering for the fourth quarter last year. It\u2019s off to good start. We\u2019re seeing a nice month-to-month progression of growth. Nice adoption in the number of test categories. We did mention in the prepared remarks, our inclusion of a few bundles around sexually transmitted diseases. So we\u2019re pleased with progress so far, and we did contemplate that in our guidance for the full year. Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Bill Quirk : Great. Thank you. Good morning everyone. Mark Guinan : Good morning. Bill Quirk : Couple questions. First off, Steve, you talked about pricing transparency in your prepared comments. And this is a topic that you\u2019ve touched on couple of times in the past. I guess bigger picture question here is, how should we think about this rolling out beyond Massachusetts. And then secondly, I guess following-up on Aaron\u2019s question, given that we are into the data collection period second around PAMA, how should we think about the expanded number of participating labs and what that impact might have in the 2021through 2023 period? Steve Rusckowski : Yes. First of all, transparency in general. So the number of national payers, and I would say regional payers too, have pushed on educating their membership on a wide variation of healthcare costs. And yes, it\u2019s about lab and it\u2019s about everything. So a lot of visibility around radiology, a lot of visibility about every kind of procedures. So depending upon who you might have your insurance with, you probably have seen some of us. So that drum has been beaten and that it will continue to beat. In parallel to that is employers are hearing a lot of pushback from their employees about the cost of health care. We hear it at Quest Diagnostics, and we haven\u2019t talked about it but we actually have done a lot of work to prevent the cost of Quest Diagnostics with their \u2013 our health care costs. And in doing so, where we\u2019ve managed about 50,000 lives, we\u2019ve actually built the cost curve. And the reason for that is employees are pushing back on their employers what they\u2019re paying for out of pocket. So this is a premium cost. It\u2019s a high deductible. So it\u2019s the co-pays and full insurances. And so they give you a lot of noise and also those patients are pushing back on their physicians and physicians or pushing back on administration. So what I\u2019ll say is this has picked up a lot of steam, and we are encouraged because when you look at the facts, you look at our medical quality, you look at the service performance and you look at our price points, we\u2019re really second to none. And that\u2019s reinforced with the Preferred Network with United Healthcare and there\u2019ll be other payers that follow. So it will continue. We talked about Massachusetts as the state that has really put more out there, but we think more states will follow and more payers will follow and as more payers go down this path of a Preferred Lab Network, part of this will be around you can get the best quality, best service at the lowest prices from a company like Quest Diagnostics. So it\u2019s going to be one of the opportunities that we take advantage of to pick up share. Mark Guinan : And I just want to add to that, Bill, that the data collection period is actually in the fall. It\u2019s the work that we do in the first half of 2019 but actually the submission and the collection is later in the year. And as Steve mentioned earlier, we\u2019re working to try to get that delayed because we\u2019re not clear on the changes, the impact of those changes and how much it\u2019s going to expand to the hospital and others that did not submit last time. But we do know and agree that it\u2019s going to be challenging for many of them to comply. And therefore, that\u2019s why Steve mentioned for the trade association we\u2019re lobbying to get that delated to give them a chance to do that and make sure that it comes in because we see that as the benefit to be more representative of the overall commercial market but also that they can get it done in a quality fashion. So there\u2019s a lot of rationale for slowing this thing down. But it doesn\u2019t happen until later in the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Stephen Baxter : So as part of the support act passed late last year, it looks like there\u2019s some provisions that would impact the lab industry\u2019s ability to pay incentive compensation based on sales goals. Can you help us provide some context on how that\u2019s impacting your business today? And whether any changes to your compensation structure would be required if the law remains in effect for the foreseeable future? Mark Guinan : Yes. Thanks for the question, Stephen. We recognize what you said that it could imply potential impact to the lab industry. At this point, based on the conversations we\u2019ve had, I believe that, that was unintended. So we\u2019re in dialogue around addressing that. So we have not changed anything to our compensation program in response to that, and we\u2019re feeling comfortable. We\u2019re obviously doing the right things to ensure that, that gets amended. That was not the intent. Operator : Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Lisa Gill : Just a couple of quick follow-ups. So Steve, when you talked about utilization being normalized in the first quarter, I think many of us have seen United report and MLR below expectations. So can you just maybe define what you think normalizes on a percentage basis? Steve Rusckowski : Yes. The term I\u2019d use is stable. We keep on doing our same-store or same-account measurement when we look at 100 accounts. You know they\u2019re accounts of Quest Diagnostics, and we look at their volumes year-on-year. And we\u2019ve tracked this for years. And what we see is it\u2019s a stable environment, and this is for the nonhospital portion of our market. And equally for the hospital portion, we believe that\u2019s stable as well if you look at the volumes that we see out there in the marketplace. We believe both are stable. Lisa Gill : Is there a number you can put around that? Steve Rusckowski : NO, no. Because I would say that it bounces around a little bit. But in general, we\u2019re feeling that, that \u2013 it is within the range of a normal variation that we\u2019ve seen historically. So stable is a good way of characterizing what we see. Mark Guinan : And I mean, Lisa, I guess the tightest I could quantify it is that we\u2019ve talked about a market that we think volumes are growing about 2% based on demographics and so on, which the given price headwinds pretty much take the revenue growth in the lab market to flat. And so as we look at the overall performance in the first quarter against our expectations and all the factors that play into it, including our competitiveness, there\u2019s nothing that we saw in the first quarter that suggested a significant deviation from what we were expecting in terms of if you would call utilization, the overall market consumption of laboratory services. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Larew with William Blair. Your line is open. Matt Larew : Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask in terms of the retail strategy, if you can update us in terms of where the footprint stands today. Any plans for additional expansion here in 2019? And then the extent to which you see this strategy actually driving incremental growth and profitability? Steve Rusckowski : Yes. Several things. One is when we started with takeaway stores, we\u2019ve shared in the past that, that\u2019s going well. Good results from those stores. Second is we\u2019ve started a joint venture with Walmart. That has been progressively building and results have been very good. As you\u2019ll recall, we started with Texas and Florida, we\u2019re now beyond Texas and Florida. We\u2019re in multiple states. We\u2019re greater than 50 stores, approaching 75 to 80 stores throughout the United States. Again, what we\u2019re finding is that it benefits all stakeholders. We think it\u2019s good for Quest Diagnostics. And we\u2019ve shared in the past that this is not about our savings in real estate. It\u2019s actually an opportunity for us to get more productive with our phlebotomists as we consolidate those in one location. Second is its better location. So it\u2019s better for employees, it\u2019s also better for our patients that we serve. So they walk again for other purposes to get your script filled, do some grocery shopping, by the way they can stop at Quest. We give them a locator. They walk in the store. They come in conveniently. Many of those people are fasting. So they would like to eat before they leave. So good patient experience. And then finally, Walmart likes it because it\u2019s more patient volume and it\u2019s a good experience in their stores. And what we\u2019re finding in those ZIP codes where we\u2019ve done this, we do have an opportunity to pick up some share because it\u2019s \u2013 again it\u2019s a much more convenient location for us in that marketplace. So the patient has the choice they\u2019re going to be going to the convenient location. And so what we\u2019re driving to is if you look at the 2,200 Patient Service Centers that we have throughout the United States, we\u2019d like to have about 50% of those Patient Service Centers eventually in more of a retail-like setting. So it gives you an idea of the extent of our strategy. And when I say that, we already have a retail-like strategy beyond Safeway and the Walmart locations because we\u2019ve already had some of our Patient Service Centers in more of a retail environment than a medical environment. So of \u2013 the progress so far is \u2013 continues to be a good one. We\u2019re encouraged by it and there would be progress made this year. Mark Guinan : And so just to add to that, Matt, it\u2019s not as much a cost play around the fixed cost because the phlebotomist obviously gets paid the same regardless of where we put them and the overall rent is not that much different. But really is it\u2019s the volume leverage we get. So these are highly productive sites, especially in Walmart. And some of the reasons for that, obviously, as Steve said, it\u2019s great access and convenience but some of our key stakeholders, the payers and the physicians, like that when they hear about, hey this can bring further patient because actually you want them to get the testing done. So as we talk about being positively differentiated from a vast majority of the market, certainly our retail locations, it\u2019s not all about cost. Some of it is really around getting more volume and being more attractive commercially. And from some of the key stakeholders, we\u2019re influencing or driving those decisions where they want to get their lab work done. Steve Rusckowski : Yes and as you\u2019ll recall, as part of our strategy, we\u2019re using our data to support population health with extended care services. And so what you\u2019ll hear more of is basic health care services that we\u2019re also providing in those stores to manage a population. More to come on that but it\u2019s beyond draw services for Quest Diagnostics as we go forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open. Mark Massaro : Good morning, Mark A -Mark Guinan Hey. Mark. Mark Massaro : Good morning. Thanks guys for the questions. When I strip away the headwind of one less day in the quarter and the benefit from weather, I come up with organic volumes of 3.1%. That is above the long-term guide you have of 1% to 3%. So can you just help us think about the sustainability of this trend, especially given that you\u2019ve got one additional day coming in the back half, you have volumes building throughout the year? And then second part of my question, is there any update to the work you\u2019re doing with HCA in Colorado? And what do you think they need to see the potential to expand that? Mark Guinan : So the \u2013 to answer your question, Mark, remember the outlook \u2013 four-year outlook I provided was revenue, not volume. And while our volume, if you adjust for the weather and the days, was north of 3%, our revenue was obviously in the single-digit basis points, 10s of basis points, not as high. So I think as we\u2019ve mentioned, we expect that to continue to build. And obviously, in the four-year time frame, we\u2019re expecting to get some of these pricing headwinds significantly lowered, if not eliminated, which will help the revenue relative to the volume. So I think that \u2013 hopefully that answers your question around the outlook and our performance in the first quarter. On HCA, Steve? Steve Rusckowski : Yes. On HCA, we believe that it\u2019s going well. We believe if you ask HCA that question, they would give you the same feedback. Remember, this is in their Continental Division. So it\u2019s actually one of our Professional Lab Services engagements where we help them become more efficient with their hospital laboratories. So we now again demonstrate, now that we\u2019ve been into it for a couple of years, that we are saving them money, and they\u2019re pleased by that and the quality has not anywhere \u2013 way deteriorated. So we\u2019re hopeful, given the success there that we could take that model and try it in some other locations throughout HCA. We\u2019re actively discussing that possibility as you would expect. But no firm indication that they will expand beyond it. But it is a success story for us within very large core profit system. Mark Guinan : And just to add quickly, I know you all can do the math. With about 40 basis points of revenue growth, if you adjust for the two factors you mentioned, that gets us north of 100 basis points. So in the year when pricing headwinds are obviously extreme, where it hits the low ends, but within that three-year CAGR of revenue growth that I provided at the Investor Day. Operator : Our last question comes from Eric Coldwell with Baird. Your line is open. Mark Guinan : Hey, Eric. Eric Coldwell : Hey, good morning. Thanks very much. Kind of a three-parter here on Trident and the bankruptcy that you mentioned. First off, I see that they have debtor and possession financing that are still operational. But would you expect to gain volume in a situation like that when a bigger player announces a bankruptcy? Second of all, you did mention a customer bankruptcy in your prepared remarks, if I heard you correctly. I\u2019m curious was that Trident since they are a diversified holding company? And then third, how have you \u2013 just remind us how you\u2019ve generally planned or modeled for higher customer bankruptcies in 2019? Have you taken a more conservative approach this year, given what\u2019s going on with PAMA? But I\u2019m just curious if you could just remind us what you\u2019ve done there. Thanks so much. Steve Rusckowski : Yes. I\u2019ll take the beginning of that and then turn it to Mark to tell us what\u2019s in our guidance, if you will. So yes, it is Trident. What we referred to is what you can read yourself related to their lab business where they served the nursing home marketplace. We have very little exposure to the nursing home business. It\u2019s a tough market. We have a little bit of nursing home business. It\u2019s not a big market opportunity for us. So the answer to your question, it all depends whether we pick up some of the volume. If we can make money out of it and we can serve the marketplace, well we would consider it. So it all depends on where the volume is and at what price points and whether we can serve the market well to really define the presence of our laboratories and where their facilities are. Mark, you want to\u2026 Mark Guinan : Yes. So our remaining bad debt, and that will be separated from patient concessions out of bad debt and into revenue, is pretty small and you occasionally have a blip here. But we don\u2019t have any expectations that we\u2019re going to have significant headwinds on bad debt. A vast majority of that is hospital \u2013 our hospital business and then certainly, a chunk of that is actually physician client bill where in the States it\u2019s permitted. The physician is actually marking it up and billing the commercial payer, and we are charging the physician. So assuming that they continue to get paid by the commercial payers, we\u2019re certainly not at risk for any lack of payment ourselves. So when you said are we getting more conservative, are taking any steps in anticipation of payment driving more bankruptcy, I wouldn\u2019t expect it to be within our customer base, our client bill base that you\u2019re going to see that impact. So there\u2019s really not anything we should do or can do beyond. We\u2019re very diligent around monitoring collections from our client bill and that\u2019s the easiest one. It\u2019s not anywhere near as complicated as the third-party billing and involving the patients. So nothing necessary and certainly no significant headwinds expected or built into our contemplated guidance. Operator : Yes. We have no further questions.

Please go ahead. Shawn Bevec : Thank you, and good morning. I\u2019m here with Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer.During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and will discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics\u2019 future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS from continuing operations, and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations, excluding amortization expense. References to adjusted operating income for all periods exclude amortization expense. Finally, growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projection including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings growth, are compound annual growth rates.Now, here is Steve Rusckowski. Steve Rusckowski : Thanks, Shawn, and thanks everyone for joining us today. This morning, I\u2019ll discuss the second quarter and review progress on our two-point strategy. And then, Mark will provide more detail on the results.Our volume growth accelerated in the second quarter and we continued to build momentum through the first half of 2019. Our expanded network access continued to accelerate volume growth and our strategy to drive operational excellence improved efficiency. Both have helped to offset the significant reimbursement pressures we are experiencing this year.For the second quarter, we grew revenues despite significant reimbursement pressure; reported EPS was $1.51, down about 4% from the same period of 2018; adjusted EPS was $1.73, down about 1%; volume growth remained very strong at 4.4% as the expected volume continued to accelerate in the second quarter. Year-to-date, volume growth is now at 4%.Now, let me briefly update you on three fundamental changes in the laboratory marketplace. They are PAMA, our expanded network access, increased consumerization of health care. First, PAMA-driven reimbursement pressure remains a catalyst for structural change in the marketplace. Our Medicare rates in the first half of 2019 were down by 10% from the prior year, which is in line with our expectation. The next data reporting period remains scheduled for the first quarter of next year. However, we are encouraged by the introduction of the Laboratory Access for Beneficiaries Act or LAB Act introduced in the House last month.The LAB Act would be the first step towards ensuring clinical laboratory service rates under PAMA are sustainable and Medicare beneficiaries have adequate access to crucial laboratory services. By delaying the next round of PAMA data reporting by one year, the Lab Act will provide all applicable laboratories with additional time to report private payor data. A second provision in the Lab Act would require a neutral third party to produce recommendations to Congress and how to improve the PAMA data collection and rate setting process.The second structural change affecting our industry is our expanded network access, and PAMA is becoming more focused than ever on driving better value in their lab spend.We're partnering with UnitedHealthcare to reduce access cost created by other network labs, the further value to our customers and members. On July 1st, we became the UnitedHealthcare preferred lab network provider and have begun an aggressive outreach campaign to physicians and UHC members.Beginning August 1st, providers referring members to out-of-network labs will be able to complete an online approval process. In addition, Anthem has begun to implement its own strategy that lowers laboratory rates to hospital-based providers, aligning them better with the rates currently paid to the independent laboratories. Also, we continue to have conversations with other health plans on value-based care initiatives and PLN like elements. Some of our recent contract extensions contain these features.Finally, we continue to see increased attention on the variation in health care costs. Last month, the White House released the health care executive order designed to bring more transparency to the health care system. As consumers of health care get more information on the disparities in the cost of care, we believe this trend favors high value providers like Quest.Now, turning to our recent progress and our strategy to accelerate growth, which has five elements : Grow more than 2% per year through accretive, strategically aligned acquisitions; expand relationships with health plans and hospital health systems; offer the broadest access to diagnostic innovation; be recognized as the consumer-friendly provider of diagnostic information services; and then, finally, support population health in data analytics and extended care services.Now, let me take you through a few highlights of our strategy to accelerate growth in the quarter. As I said earlier, we continue to see revenue and volume growth as a result of our expanding network access. With the exception of Aetna, this growth is occurring across all of our major health plan customers. We recently signed a new professional lab services agreement with Catholic Health Services of Long Island, a large, integrated health care delivery system in New York. Under the agreement, Quest will provide laboratory and supply chain expertise as well as perform laboratory reference testing. We continue to believe hospitals will be increasingly more motivated to work with us under lab strategy as they feel the impact of PAMA and lower commercial reimbursement. And the area of advanced diagnostics, Quest is now participating as a designated laboratory in the National Cancer Institute\u2019s MATCH precision medicine trial. This is the largest of its kind.The trial seeks to provide better outcomes for rare cancer types for which there is no standard treatment. Key test growth drivers in the quarter included tuberculosis testing, with straight to both QuantiFERON and T-SPOT, Cardio IQ, and mutual testing. Each of these categories drove strong revenue growth.Our QuestDirect consumer testing business continues to gain popularity. Earlier this month, we launched a new consumer initiative Lyme disease tests. We also drove sequential volume growth in consumer testing in each month in the second quarter.The second part of our two-point strategy is to drive operational excellence. We remain on track to deliver 3% cost efficiencies for 2019 by continuing to drive increases in productivity. Some examples are using digital technology to enhance the customer experience, drive growth and reduce our carbon footprint. We have begun to eliminate paper documentation for Medicare beneficiaries who have financial responsibility for non-covered services. This has reduced denials and contributed to our invigorated savings.We're also working to help patients follow through when their physician orders a lab test. We started sending reminder emails to patients whose physicians have ordered tests for them electronically. We're now sending text messages that remind them to nearly one third of our patients who scheduled appointment online, which reduces the no-show rate. Both of these initiatives are expected to help reduce the number of lab orders that go unfulfilled.Now, let me turn it over to Mark, who will take you through the financial performance. Mark? Mark Guinan : Thanks, Steve.In the second quarter, consolidated revenues were $1.95 billion, up 1.8% versus the prior year. Revenues for diagnostic information services grew 2% compared to the prior year, driven by strong volume growth and acquisitions, partially offset by higher reimbursement pressure and patient concessions. Volume measured by the number of requisitions, increased 4.4% versus the prior year. Excluding acquisitions, volumes grew 2.9%.As we said before, not all volume is created equal and we regularly emphasize our strategy to be price disciplined. Recently, we had a few of our capitated contracts open for renewal. These contracts, while profitable in the past, represented large volumes at very low margins. In the competitive contract renewal process, apparently one of our competitors was willing to offer lower rates that were prospectively very unprofitable for us. Therefore, rather than accept the rate cut, we walked away from the business. Walking away had very little top and bottom line impact, but did create a 70 basis-point headwind volume to our organic volume growth and will do so throughout the balance of the year. We believe this is important for you to understand as you assess our relative volume performance. Despite that headwind, organic volume growth accelerated in the second quarter, consistent with our expectations.Revenue per requisition declined by 2.3% versus the prior year, driven primarily by higher reimbursement pressure and patient concessions. Unit price headwinds were approximately 2.3% in the second quarter. This includes the impact of PAMA, which amounted to a headwind of approximately 120 basis points. As a reminder, the PAMA impact includes both direct cuts to the clinical fee schedule as well as modest indirect price changes from Medicaid and a small number of floating rate contracts.Reported operating income was $307 million or 15.7% of revenues compared to $305 million or 15.9% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $352 million or 18% of revenues compared to $362 million or 18.9% of revenues last year. The year-over-year decline in operating margin was primarily attributable to higher reimbursement pressure and higher patient concessions, largely offset by strong volume growth and ongoing productivity improvements related to our Invigorate initiatives.Reported EPS was a $1.51 in the quarter compared to $1.57 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $1.73, down approximately 1% from $1.75 last year. Cash provided by operations was $596 million year-to-date versus $503 million last year. And capital expenditures were $132 million year-to-date compared to $151 million a year ago.Now, turning to guidance. Our outlook for 2019 is as follows : Revenue is expected to be between $7.6 billion and $7.75 billion, an increase of approximately 1% to 3% versus the prior year; reported EPS is expected to be greater than $5.29 and adjusted EPS to be greater than $6.40; cash provided by operations is expected to be approximately $1.3 billion; and capital expenditures are expected to be between $350 million and $400 million.Before closing, I would like to review a few reminders as you think about the remainder of 2019.First, we continue to expect more than $200 million of reimbursement pressure this year due to PAMA, our new in-network health plan contracts in 2019, and the modest reimbursement pressure we typically experience each year from other sources. Second, we continue to expect that volumes will gradually increase as we progress through 2019, just as they have through the first half of the year. Third, we have approximately one extra revenue day in the third quarter. Finally, we expect the strongest revenue and earnings growth in the fourth quarter of 2019, due to an easier comparison.I will now turn it back to Steve. Steve Rusckowski : Thanks, Mark.To summarize, our growth accelerated in the second quarter due to our expanded network access, and we continued to build momentum through the first half of 2019. Our strong volume growth combined with our strategy to drive operational excellence enabled us to help offset the significant reimbursement pressures we're experiencing this year. We're excited to be back for being a new Preferred Lab Network status, with UnitedHealthcare, and the opportunities to extend this approach through other players in the marketplace are with us. And then, finally, we believe we're well-positioned to meet our commitments in 2019.Now, we'd be happy to take any of your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now open it up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Your line is open. Ralph Giacobbe : Thanks. Good morning. Can you maybe help on how volume progressed through the quarter, if you're still seeing a build sort of month to month there, if it has stabilized? And then, I just wanted to kind of clarify what you said around sort of the capitated contract that you lost? Is that a regional or a national contract? And then, just help us on kind of the timing on when it happened? And just broader thoughts, obviously, there's a lot of discussion around the open network approach and sort of structural changes there. So, this goes sort of against that tide. So, maybe flush that out a bit for us. Thanks. Steve Rusckowski : Sure, Ralph. So, because we have these artificial conventions called fiscal years, months, quarters, et cetera, there is going to be some noise. So, if you look at our volumes throughout the quarter, they didn't accelerate each month because of the calendar. However, when you look at -- there is something else to look at, which requisitions per day on an apples to apples basis, they did absolutely continue to grow throughout the quarter. And as I noted in my closing comments, that is our expectation for the balance of the year. So, throughout each month, the beginning of the year, in the first quarter, we saw accelerate volume growth; and then throughout the second quarter when you look at an apples and apples comparison, absolutely, we continue to strengthen, despite that 70 basis-point headwind. The headwind itself was actually a handful of regional capitated contracts, they were exclusively capitated. There was no fee [ph] for service element in those contracts. And as said, they were very large volumes and low margins. And they started feathering in beginning of the year, really fully hit us largely in the second quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Your line is open. Adam Noble : Hey, guys. Great. Thanks for the question. This is Adam Noble in for Kevin. I just wanted to see if you could size, in the second quarter, what the benefit to the organic volumes was from managed care access versus just general market growth? And did you expect to have further penetration of those contracts in the back half? Steve Rusckowski : Yes. Let me start and then I\u2019ll pass it to Mark. First of all, we continue to talk about we\u2019re always looking at the marketplace and trying to understand what's going in the marketplace. And with all our measurements and metrics that we have, and we've talked about for many years now the same store analysis, we still believe the market is stable. We see stable volumes in our physician accounts and also our hospital business seems to be stable versus the prior year. So, Mark, can you add some color beyond that? Mark Guinan : So, it\u2019s hard to tease out specifically. I think, to Steve\u2019s point, we don\u2019t think the market has been accelerating in terms of its growth. So, we say market access, if you're asking specifically around United versus more generally, as we shared in the prepared remarks other than Aetna, we\u2019re obviously -- we had a major competitor who entered that contract. We were the sole national. And we\u2019re growing at every single major health plan. So, in terms of market access, it\u2019s not just United. Obliviously, it just makes us more competitive; it enables us to win the office. And so, therefore, we\u2019re seeing growth across the board, not just limited to United or Horizon. Adam Noble : Got you. If I could just sneak in one more, just any update around the M&A pipeline. Neither you or your main competitor announced any acquisitions year-to-date. Is that a more function of a elongated conversion time line or are you seeing any change to the size or nature of the pipeline? Steve Rusckowski : Yes. So, you saw in our results that we inched up a little bit Q2 versus Q1 in terms of the amount of our revenue from some acquisitions. So, we're feathering in some of the acquisitions and they are delivering well. Second is, as we said before and we\u2019ll continue to say and our funnel remains strong. We have a number that support our ambition to be close to 2% this year and into future. So, we keep on working on that. And just what I said in my remarks, the pressures that we see are now becoming real and becoming more visible. And those pressures are with PAMA cuts, some of that does extend itself, particularly for hospital outreach businesses and for Medicare rates, and then the commercial changes that I talked about in my prepared remarks are clearly going to impact the hospital marketplace and the independent lab marketplace. And so because of that we continue to have a lot of conversations around integrated delivery systems, lab strategies. And you again saw that we announced this new deal with Catholic Health systems out of Long Island, which is another supporting proof point that we continue to advance our strategy in that front. And the pipeline will be there to support our strategy, as we indicated. Mark Guinan : As Steve highlighted and as you noted, we did the transaction in the second quarter. As Steve commented, we did get more growth from the M&A, we closed a deal, regional acquisition, Boyce and Bynum in the first quarter. So, obviously, we\u2019ve got the first full quarter of growth from that in Q2. And I would say, there is no attitudinal change in terms of people\u2019s view around potentially getting out of outreach, hospital customers. And certainly, some of the regional labs are feeling the PAMA pain. I think, the interesting dynamic that we\u2019ve seen has been actually more of the conversations with hospital systems are getting broader. So, it\u2019s not just about outreach but actually about doing a PLS deal, doing a reference deal and potentially selling the outreach, like we did with PeaceHealth last year, and that\u2019s a positive. But on the other side, those take longer. And an outreach deal can be done much more quickly. So, that dynamic has emerged a little bit over last year, so, which adds a little bit to the timeframe to get these transactions completed. Operator : Our next question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore. Your line is open. Ross Muken : On the cost side, I mean, it seems like pretty strong sequential OpEx management. I know that you called out in Q1 it\u2019s a pull forward. But, give us a little color, it looks like restructuring tick up a bit, your depreciation came down, how you are tracking on your cost plan and sort of some of the realization of the main program versus some of the other timing elements that played out. Steve Rusckowski : Yes. So, I\u2019ll start again and Mark will follow. We continue to execute our plan for 2019. We indicated in our first quarter that we have planned for a number of restructuring efforts to start to kick in, start to kick in, in the second quarter. That will continue in the back half of the year. So, we feel good about that. So, we think we have our handles on the levers of cost in the right way. And then, second, Ross, is we continue to drive our operational excellence program. I did say in my remark, it\u2019s 3% of our cost saves, and I'll remind everyone, that's about $200 million. And we continue to yield good results from that. We continue to see good productivity across the board. And yes, that's expense areas but also in cost of sales. And we will continue that into 2020 or 2021. So, Mark? Mark Guinan : Yes. Ross, I thank you for reminding everyone. There were really the two drivers, if you look into Q2 versus Q1. One was the investments that we did at the beginning of our new access in terms of some marketing, adding some commercial resources, et cetera. Certainly, we haven't stepped back on the commercial resource. We have stepped back on some of the marketing campaign information. There were also some things that were expensive because we were betting on the commanding [ph] patient service centers, adding some logistics, assuming the volume would come, making sure we were in position. Now, that volume is coming, it just became kind of the classic typical cost of sale. So, it\u2019s not incremental expense. And then, the other key driver was the restructuring that we completed at the end of the first quarter, which had taken out, on a run rate basis, a substantial amount of expense. That will continue throughout the balance of the year and going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Stephen Baxter : I wanted to try to understand the sequential improvement in the decline of revenue per requisition. So, obviously, PAMA is a known quantity at this point. So, I was wondering if you could update us on some of the other moving pieces there, whether it's commercial pricing or bad debt. I guess, the other potential is, maybe this capitated contract, you just got -- had some kind of impact. Any color you can give there is very helpful. Steve Rusckowski : Mark, why don\u2019t you take him through the math? Mark Guinan : Yes. So, typically, in terms of commercial pricing, typically those contracts run on the calendar year. There's been a couple of exceptions where we've done things in the midyear. So, there really wasn't anything in terms of commercial price changes between Q1 and Q2, nor, as you know, is there anything different than PAMA? So, this was really driven by mix. Some of it was some test mix as have some seasonality that can drive things up or down in the rev per req. But as we\u2019ve noted, that doesn't always necessarily directionally align with profitability, even though it does drive changes in rev per req. And then, of course, losing some of the capitated revenue certainly is a lift from a mixed perspective. And then, finally, PLS is a driver as well. Because as we shared in the past, those tend to be more basic requisitions, got a lot of complex testing, and, certainly as the PLS grows, business grows disproportionately; to the rest of the business it can add or put a drag on our revenue per req.And then finally, patient concessions. When you look at the patient concession rate in the second quarter versus the first quarter, it was improved. And, a lot of that is really the result of the efforts that we've had to really improve the collectability of a lot of the tools that we put in place at our patient service centers with our real time adjudication to give people that cost upfront, the ability to collect the credit card as well as really working hard with our partner Optum to get better information on pensions, do a better job of presenting the bill and overall collecting at a higher rate. Operator : Our next question comes from Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities. Your line is now open. Ann Hynes : So, in your prepared remarks, you did talk about all the payers initiatives, what they are doing on the PLN side, you specifically mentioned them and some recent contracts include some PLN aspects. Can you just go to more detail on what you are talking about? Thanks. Steve Rusckowski : Yes, sure. Well, first of all, let\u2019s go back to the opportunity this year. The biggest opportunity is best to access -- health insurance access we have for over a decade. And the PLN is going to be nice to have and it will provide some more momentum, and we believe it\u2019s a nice lever for us. And yes, we talk a lot about the effect that will have with United. But as we talked about, we're having a number of conversations with other payers. And then, finally is some of the new contract extensions that we already have signed include some of the elements that we will talk about.United will be releasing more and more as we go and they will provide details. As I did mention in my remarks, if you are out of network, it\u2019s going to require more authorization to allow that to happen. So, that\u2019s one point. Second is what we\u2019ve said in the past is there clearly will be a benefit design change, so less out of pocket cost for consumers. And then, third, there will be physician incentives. So, when you think about what's going to be the big element, it\u2019s all around benefit design, less out of pocket cost for consumes, physicians being managed to drive towards that preferred lab network and then finally is really making sure there is no leakage to other network. And it will be stronger than ever with United and we see a lot of momentum with other payers as well.So, more to come on that, Ann. But, we're off and running and working this hard, and we do believe it\u2019s going to be an additional lever. We don\u2019t let it overshadow that the biggest opportunities were back in network. And what I also said in my remarks, yes we had good growth obviously from United but all our major health plans grew with the exception of that network, we actually did expect the modest decline which we saw. Mark Guinan : So, just to add, Ann, to Steve\u2019s point that a lot of the benefits of the PLN type elements is still in front of us. So, it hasn\u2019t driven the volume growth to this point, it\u2019s an enabler to continue to drive. So, what are some of those things and it\u2019s going to be different by payer type. But these are concepts that we\u2019ve talked about and various payers have embraced some of these or are all of these to a certain extent. A lot of them are rooted in us getting additional payment or a bonus payment what have you as we\u2019ve shown the ability to scale work to better value away from higher cost providers.So, we\u2019ve gotten that in a couple of contracts recently where we have a metric in a way of showing that as they save money, as their members save money that we get a piece of that. And so, we\u2019re aligning those incentives. Number one is around treatment of preauthorization, which is a huge driver for denial. So, and a couple of payers we\u2019ve gotten -- as our chief competitors and some others, the lab that have shown themselves to be high quality, actually differentiate themselves positively from a service perspective and other things around panels and how conduct themselves. We\u2019ve actually gotten the status where they wave the preauthorization. So, it's an advantage for us from a physician ordering perspective that payers, as we know, if you send the work to these, following labs that who are going to be okay with it. So, therefore, you don't require a preauth. So, that's another element that we've gotten in some of our contracts.Steve mentioned some of the zero out of pocket, and some of the payers are coming up with products that they are offering, but obviously got market. We\u2019ll see the adoption rate and then some other payers have voiced an interest in going heavily in that kind of plan benefit design. So, again, it's not as if there's a one size fits all. That's why we talk about these being in elements in some of the other payers. And then, finally, there is a lot of interest in kind of sharing we\u2019ll call it the win fail game from our outreach acquisition. So, when we buy hospital outreach, obviously those commercial rates immediately go to our negotiated rates, which is a huge savings for patients, huge savings for the payer and the notion that, hey, this is good for all stakeholders, and we should share some of that value.So, those are a couple of details that certainly have gotten a lot of traction with the payers. And as Steve pointed out, that is in front of us. So, when I say in front of us, we've gotten those in some of the contracts but obviously, we have to perform and we have to earn those. And then, those are upside going ahead. Operator : Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Lisa Gill : Good morning. I'm just wondering if you can maybe just give us an update on your consumer retail strategy. I didn't hear anything in the prepared comments this morning. Steve Rusckowski : Yes. It\u2019s one of our strategies for growth. And several parts of being what\u2019s consumer diagnostic information service provider, we have talked about in the past, just to remind everyone, we have really digitized and brought our patient experiences to today\u2019s world. And so, when you look into a Quest patient service center, it will remind everyone of the other experiences they have in their other experiences as a consumer and as a health care experience. So, a lot of progress there.Second is we continue to make progress on the tools and the access and information. So, MyQuest app, which is our smartphone app, has continued to expand its registration, and continued to expand the capability so you can schedule appointment online, you can see wait times at patient service centers, you obviously get your results. And we now have over 7 million registered users, which is remarkable.And there is a last piece of this, which is your specific question, is the physical presence we think is quite important. So, we have continued to manage our retail strategy and move our patients service centers to a more retail setting over time. Right now, we have roughly 200ish patient service centers between our Safeway relationship and Walmart. Walmart is about 70 of that. And we continue to evaluate the best path forward to eventually have about 50% of our 2,200 patient service centers in more retail like settings.Now, what I\u2019ll also share is we have said that roughly 25%, let\u2019s call it, 500 of our current patient service centers are more retail like, not all with retailers, but as we evolve over time, with our current retail relationships and with possible others, that number will grow to be about half of our fleet of patient service centers. And our experience in those is quite good. We believe that the patient obviously experience better with much more consumer experience, our employees, there is -- a lot of us like it better. We can consolidate our operations at the fewer sites. And the patient have access. They walk in, they can walk around with the pager, as they can do some shopping, they can eat after they\u2019ve been fasting. So, overall, m our perspective it\u2019s quite good. And then, our relationship with retailers is good as well because they benefit from that store traffic. So, we feel positive about the response and results so far and we will continue to drive it. Mark Guinan : The only thing I would Lisa is that there is some always some outliers. But if you look at on average, our retail draw sites continue to increase the amount of activity. We had the highest average amount of draws in our Walmart sites in June that we\u2019ve had since we started this. So, we're very happy with the amount of traffic we're getting, we\u2019re feeling really good about the presence. And of course, our volume is growing. So, there is things that are probably driving it. So, part of it is awareness. People are starting to figure out, we\u2019ve got these draw sites in Walmart and getting comfortable going there, and we\u2019d expect that to continue over time. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum. Your line is now open. Kevin Ellich : Steve, in your prepared remarks, you comment about Anthem shifting hospital base rates to independent lab rates. We saw something, I think at Lab Economics that that was shifted for pathology. Can you give little bit more color, is this for all of the tests that are being done in hospitals or just pathology? And then, are you seeing other commercial payers follow this, doing something similar, then what will that do for your hospital outreach and PLS deals? Steve Rusckowski : So, I would just say, as an overarching comment and it\u2019s embedded in our introductory remarks that we have PAMA, and PAMA to some extent is independent of what's happening on the commercial side. But, we now continue to see pressure from commercial payers on hospital outreach. So, yes, we mentioned Anthem but I will also share that there is pressure from other payers, typically with those that we work with, to push down the rates for all the ancillary services and obviously that includes labs, that includes radiology and includes other ancillary services that are provided by the hospital. And, Kevin, two parts to this. One is just in general to move more of the volume to most -- the highest value reach provider like ourselves in lab, but second is because we add a cost to consumers. And the consumers, given the high percentage of corresponsive health plans that have high deductibles and high out of pocket costs for these expensive hospital based services, the payers are looking at more aggressive strategies to normalize the rates more.So, yes, we call that Anthem is proactively having a strategy but we see this in many other places with many other commercial payers that are pushing back on what they\u2019ve done in the past with ancillary services in general but specific to lab. Mark Guinan : So, Kevin, I would encourage you to ask Anthem directly. There is a -- I don\u2019t know, they\u2019ve led a couple of places with pathology. There is a publically available document, which we\u2019re referencing. And as you might imagine, before we said anything, we checked with them to make sure they were comfortable with the statement that we are attributed to. For more detail, I would encourage you to ask Anthem about the schedule and how broadly they're doing it and so on. But, there is something they've published and put out in the public domain. Steve Rusckowski : Yes. And part B of this, Kevin, I mentioned in my remarks, the movement across the country towards more price transparency. As you know there is wide variation in our marketplace with ourselves having what we believe the best value proposition on the planet, great quality, great service at some of the lowest prices. And in that regard, actually there was a story today in the journal, which speaks to a number of the payers, providing apps and services, if you will, to provide visibility to consumers to do a better job of shopping. And they called out Anthem, as we did, but others including Humana and UnitedHealthcare that are working proactively as by way of another example, to help consumers manage their costs. Operator : Our next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is open. Jack Meehan : Good morning. Just given some of the recent progress in terms of the commercial contracting that you talked about, I was wondering if you could give us some line of sight into how you think commercial unit pricing is shaking out for 2020, and just how that compares to the long-term guidance that you laid out at the Investor Day later year. Steve Rusckowski : Mark? Mark Guinan : So, I\u2019m sure you appreciate, Jack, I'm not going to speak to 2020. We're in very good shape in terms of where we stand with the commercial payers and the need to extend contracts. So, there's no surprises that anyone should expect, we're in great shape. And around the pricing, I mean, obviously, those prices already set those contracts. Really, some of those incentive payments that I referenced, those have to be determined, as we as we perform. So those could be some upside. However, if you recall, I gave you a pretty broad range on the revenue CAGR. So, what I would tell you is that within those scenarios, between the low end and the high end, we've contemplated all the different kind of outcomes that might happen, including, obviously, how quickly we get our fair share of some of the new network access contracts, and then how quickly and to what extent we earn some of those potential incentive payments. So, I would say everything within the multiyear outlook that I provided has been reasonably contemplated. And that's why we give a broad range. Operator : Our next question comes from Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Dan Leonard : Thank you. Question for Mark. Hello. I just wanted to clarify your organic volume growth expectations in the second half of the year. So, you said that volume should gradually increase as you progress through the year. The comps do get tougher. So, are you expecting organic volume growth in the back half of the year to be higher than this kind of rounding to 3ish percent you've delivered in the first half of the year? Mark Guinan : Yes. So, we absolutely expect the revenue, despite any sort of comps -- I'm sorry, the volume, to increase on an organic basis. So, it may not happen every week, may not happen every day, every month. But when we look at Q3 and Q4, we expect to continue to see improvements versus the second quarter in our year-over-year organic volume. Operator : Our next question comes from Donald Hooker with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Donald Hooker : So, I just wanted to ask maybe a question on the PLS business. I think, in the past you guys have targeted some good -- some optimistic outlook -- an optimistic outlook. So, I think you talked about 50 basis points of revenue growth and going forward or something, a revenue growth tailwind going forward from just PLS deals. Are you on track with these deals? It looks like there\u2019s been a couple. I\u2019m not sure if there have been others that you haven\u2019t announced but in terms of trying to size these deals and sort of put you on a trajectory with PLS, can you kind of reiterate that or... Steve Rusckowski : Yes. So, as we shared with you our five strategies, one of which is the proactively conversations with integrated delivery systems on their lab strategy, and also the access to health care as well within geographies where we had issues with not having good access with some of their patients. So, this continues to be a nice growth driver for us. We announced the Catholic Health Systems deal in Long Island. We did announce some other relationships last year and they studied in and built throughout 2019. And I\u2019ll just close with say the funnel continues to build. In the past, we shared where we\u2019re going and we have conversation where the lab strategy. It starts with how we can make them more efficient and this is what we call professional lab services or PLS, and this is their in-patient hospital lab and it\u2019s a cost matter. So, we could save them anywhere from 10% to 20% of their costs. So, that\u2019s an opportunity.Second, as we get into that, we look at them to rationalize and to become more efficient in their sophisticated reference testing that we said out. That\u2019s another opportunity. And then, the third piece, it\u2019s very unusual not to have this conversation. We didn\u2019t have a conversation about their outreach where they are in the commercial marketplace with us and does it make a sense for us to them to continue to be in it or should we buy their business. So, those discussions continue to progress. We have a bigger funnel than ever. We\u2019ve backed out the United States. We know all the integrated delivery systems with big outreach businesses, we know those that have substantial number of beds in their cost centers and that continues to be a nice growth driver for us. Operator : Our next question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Patrick Donnelly : Steve, maybe just on the contracts you walked away from. Can you just provide some more color there? It\u2019s a bit surprising to hear competitors are once again being aggressive on price, I still hear there is a bit of a low there. Given the PAMA backdrop the industry seems to realize price discipline is best way to fan that off. So, maybe just more context on what you\u2019re seeing, what would lead these other labs to be price competitive, given this backdrop? Mark Guinan : Great question, yes, they are competitors. So, it\u2019s not something we can speak to. Obviously, we control our own towards pricing. We\u2019ve been pretty vocal and consistent that we feel our price is already really good. There is an awful lot of competitors in this marketplace that have prices that are multiple of our price, and we are an excellent value. There was no need for Quest to offer lower price. So in terms of other people's motivation to drop price further in some instances, that\u2019s a question you will need to put to them. Operator : Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Steve Rusckowski : Ricky, we can't hear you. Alexa Desai : Hi. Sorry. This is Alexa on for Ricky. Can you hear me? Steve Rusckowski : Yes. Alexa Desai : Okay. Thanks. Ihad a little line trouble there. I wanted to come back to your expectations for the second half of the year. You beat the quarter but maintained guidance, which sort of implies the lower second half earnings than what the Street is currently modeling. Are there any headwinds you feel the Street isn't factoring into the back half of the year? Can you just give us a sense of the puts and takes here, and what the sources of upside to the guide could be? Steve Rusckowski : Let me just start and then Mark will give details. What we showed in the first half is we've delivered on what we set for expectations that we wanted to show the moment to build throughout the first half of 2019 that we did. So, we're pleased with the results in the first half. Second is, we\u2019re midway through the year. And we thought it was prudent at this point to maintain our outlook. I\u2019m not going to ahead of ourselves, but what Mark said earlier is and what we\u2019ve said about this year but also in general about the growth opportunities in front of us, it will continue to build throughout 2019, but this is not just a build for 2019. It will conclude the build in 2020, 2021. So, Mark little more color around the rest of the year? Mark Guinan : Yes. So, we are not in any way, influenced by the Street\u2019s feelings into the back half. What we do when we give guidance is really what we think our shareholders and stakeholders should understand from our perspective. So, when you look at the first half, we're very pleased with our results. We feel like we're on track, it's still halfway through the year. Of course, in the back half, we have things that sometimes happened that are beyond our control, like hurricanes and snow in December, and so on. So at this point, we just felt, there wasn't any need since we've given a 4 and not given any certain range. So, there's nothing negative in terms of our signaling for the back half. We are on track to do what we expected, which is to do at least $60.40 starts. We\u2019re obviously feeling good I think as many others with what we've done in the first half. But we'd rather just continue to perform, and then obviously cross our fingers around any sort of weather events and other things that might impact the back half, but certainly nothing operational that we're signaling or that anyone should be concerned. Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Bill Quirk : So, kind of a multi-part question here, guys. First, I think the answer is no. But, is there any negative effects from Anthem? Second piece is with respect to the capitated contract loss, was that contemplated in the original guidance? And then, lastly, just any comment with respect to genomics business, given that the principal supplier into that industry had obviously cited some challenges in that space couple weeks ago? Thank you. Mark Guinan : So, I'm sorry. I didn't catch your question Your question Bill on Anthem. Steve Rusckowski : First part. Bill Quirk : Yes. The first part of the Anthem question was just, I think the impact here was predominantly for hospitals. I just want to confirm, guys, that you're not seeing any negative effects from some of the Anthem reimbursement changes that they're implementing. Mark Guinan : No. We have a contract -- multiple contracts with Anthem. We contract with them regionally that we have a negotiated price and so on. And certainly, we are not in the ZIP code of the hospitals that they are now starting to say need to be rationalized. So, this is really a movement to get everyone -- it's not targeting anyone specifically, except for the outliers to be more in a more consistent rate. So, we feel we\u2019re already in that in that ZIP code. And certainly there's going to be no changes in the current timeframe because we have contracts with Anthem. On the capitated, we really don't give guidance on volume. So, was this a possibility that we contemplate it? Yes, certainly. But as I pointed out in my prepared remarks, it\u2019s had minimal impact to our revenue, and certainly no impact to our bottom line. So, really, it's more of a volume effect. And we try to encourage our stakeholders to not -- to pay quite as much attention to volume because of very reason. So, we thought given the magnitude of this change we\u2019re going to make sure that you understood, there was a big volume shift from us to others or to another direct headwind but really no financial or economic negativity to us, just volume. Steve Rusckowski : The last part, Bill, I had hard time hearing that as well. Bill Quirk : Just a comment, Steve, on your outlook for the consumer genomics business, given one of the principal suppliers a couple of weeks ago. Steve Rusckowski : Got you. Thank you. As you know, we have relationship with the Ancestry and that\u2019s a good relationship and continues to build. No material effect on our -- at our growth plus or minus. So, I would just say in general fairly stable. Second is I did remark about our consumer testing business, which for us is a nice platform that is growing nicely and we're very pleased with the pick-up around our general diagnostic testing. And I mentioned that we just introduced a new line with these tests. But we're going to use that as well as a platform for consumer genetics in the future. So, more to come. But overall, stable environment as we see it. As you know we're not the only provider of the Ancestry at this time. And it\u2019s not a big piece of our revenue. So, stable business for us at this point and still good opportunity in front of us. Operator : Our next question comes from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Derik de Bruin : Could you talk a little bit about the esoteric testing business and just sort of volume and mix trends within that and sort of how that\u2019s impacting revenue per requisition, just pricing getting better, reimbursement stable in that, just any additional color would be great. Steve Rusckowski : First of all, the term esoteric is an industry term. We have defined our genetic and molecular as being what we call advanced diagnostics, and we don\u2019t break out specially that business and provide color. But in general, what we\u2019ve said in the past, it\u2019s a business and an opportunity that\u2019s been growing mid single digits, and we want to continue to accelerate it and it\u2019s active part of our strategy. And within the quarter we felt good about the progress we made in that business in a number of fronts. We had some good growth and some portions of women's health. And in addition to that we define it esoteric. Esoteric, it typically includes a toxicology presence. Prescription drug monitoring continues to be a nice, big growing business for us. We're pleased with the progress and the quarter as well. And just in general, I think, our esoteric or more sophisticated testing, we had good year-on-year compressions, better than last year in the hospital presence, that\u2019s not all esoteric but in general a lot of it is. And then, as we pull more growth in a general diagnostics business, it typically will also pull some of advanced diagnostics or esoteric business as well. So, overall, as we raise the tide, it\u2019s going to help all the boats in the harbor, including advanced or esoteric as well as general diagnostics. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Larew with William Blair. Your line is now open. Matt Larew : Obviously, PAMA was an initial catalyst for hospitals and health systems thinking about the feature of their lab business. But it sounds like the preferred lab network, both specifically with United and then more broadly as payers are being more aggressive with the way you think about laboratory testing may actually be perhaps a more dramatic catalyst. I wonder if you could just discuss the conversations you're having with hospitals and health systems be it for outright M&A or PLS arrangements. And how payer behavior has started to change those conversations? Steve Rusckowski : First of all, recall, we've been talking about three changes in the marketplace, the PAMA effect, and could argue, it really just got started within 2018. And because of some of the nuances of how payment works, it was somewhat muted related to some of the offsets to the fee reduction, which grew about 10%. So, the first year, \u201819 is the second year, is a full year, no muting any of the effects, acts and then another effect in 2020. So, that is starting to become more visible in hospital outreach businesses, and administrations of hospitals are becoming more aware of that.And the second part of that is it will spill over and has already spilled over to Medicaid. Typically Medicaid in all states is lower than Medicare. And then, finally, as I talked earlier, a lot of the commercial payers are pushing back on, wide discrepancy of health care costs, specifically in our space, in laboratory, wide variations where hospital rates could be 2 to 10 times higher than our rates. And the last piece is the reason why they're pushing on this is because consumers are paying for more and more health care every day, employers are asking questions about it and it\u2019s getting visibility in Washington.So, those three changes in the marketplace, they're getting a lot of visibility for -- from the administration of any and it\u2019s great delivery system. And then second is small regional operators clearly see a different environment going forward.But sometimes we're asked question what inning we're in, okay, in anything we do. I would say, in this front, for those three structural changes, we're still in the early innings, but it\u2019s building momentum as we get into the middle of the game. So, I think we're now beyond the start, and we're starting to get a lot more visibility to it. And there's going to be a lot more change in 2020 and that can be affecting decisions of whether hospitals stay the business or whether regionals continue to operate as the operator consider their options and considering selling the business. And it is part of our strategy to be a consolidator in a smart way since we are the leader. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Coldwell with Baird. Your line is open. Eric Coldwell : Hey. Thanks very much. Most of my topics were covered. But on these capitated contracts, we know from past filings that they were in total representing about 11% of volume and 3% of your revenue. Were the contracts that you specifically walked away from the low end of a capitated contract because you're seeing absolutely no impact on revenue? So, I'm just trying to understand -- typically capitated contract is a quarter of your average profitability. So, were these the low end of that range or is there perhaps some slight impact from this change? Thanks very much. Mark Guinan : So, they were definitely low margin, as I referenced. We've actually maintained some of the work at a higher rate. So, there's an offset to the lost OM, because in the particular states that this took place, they're obligated to pay us for a subset of test, even if we're not in contract, and they're obligated to pay us at a rate that\u2019s of much higher. So, therefore, you can get that detail in the prepared remarks. But that's why it is really very little, if any OM impact. That\u2019s a partial offset to the revenue, not a 100% because it\u2019s lower volume, less revenue, even though at a much higher rev per req but not enough to compensate in total. So, it\u2019s within certainly rounding overall annual revenue, it\u2019s not a huge number with that offset and on an OM basis, it\u2019s really had no impact because we continue to get paid for some of the work that we\u2019ve maintained. Operator : Our last question comes from Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open. Mark Massaro : I wanted to ask about, in regards to your consumer initiatives, QuestDirect is certainly one of the initiatives. I know it seems fairly early and other lab providers are doing similar pilots. But can you just speak to any traction you are getting there? Maybe can you help us think about whether or not that has moved the needle in terms of actual orders coming from new types of individuals? And then, my second question is on the Clinical Trials Connect program. Also seems like it\u2019s early days but can you speak to any wins there that gives you confidence that this can grow in the future? Steve Rusckowski : So, first of all, on direct-to-consumer, we\u2019ve been at this for a while. We\u2019ve actually started to test the water. We built a business with the relationship with the New York Football Giants and we call it Sports Diagnostics, and really put our toe in the water of understanding very specific segments, how we can market a product directly to consumers, how we can fulfill that order because it\u2019s a different order fulfillment change resulted. So, we had to build some capability years ago to do that.And then, second is we actually tested the waters on our general diagnostics business is the state of Arizona several years ago. We have a joint venture partner with Banner Health. And as you recall, one of our competitors, given in that state they passed legislation where consumers no longer needed a physician order to order laboratory test. And so, we actually priced out about 100 tests and found out in fact in Arizona there was a market. And so, we took that success and we moved it to Missouri and to Colorado. And then this past fall, we actually expanded it to 48 continental states. About so, 22 of those states who no longer need a physician order, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve also done in the other 26 states, is we lit up a self help [ph] network with PWN to provide in order for consumers that they need it. So, we're deeply engaged in this. We worked out some of the things operationally from years ago with all those experiences and we're off and running. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we are very pleased with the sequential improvement and sequentially actually month upon month we're seeing some nice volume growth.And there is a segment. Now, this is all private pay. And we price it accordingly for private pay. And there is a segment where people rather cold get some of these tests done without engaging their health care insurance company. So, off and running, and we're pleased with it and show results. The second part of the question had to do with -- Mark, could you remind of the second question? Shawn Bevec : Mark, are you still there? No. Operator, we\u2019ll end it from there. Steve Rusckowski : We will take it from there. Well, thank you everyone for joining us today. We appreciate your support, and have a great day. Thank you.

We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics\u2019 future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS from continuing operations and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations excluding amortization expense. References to adjusted operating income for all periods excludes amortization expense. Finally, growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections \u2013 including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth, and adjusted earnings growth are Compound Annual Growth Rates. Now, here is Steve Rusckowski. Steve Rusckowski : Thanks Shawn. And thanks everyone for joining us today. This morning, I\u2019ll discuss the third quarter and review progress on our two-point strategy. Then Mark will provide more detail on the results and take you through updates to our 2019 guidance. We had a solid quarter of top and bottom line growth. While PAMA reimbursement pressures persist throughout the industry, our expanded network access and laser focus on driving operational excellence are enabling growth. Based on our progress to date we have updated our outlook and are well-positioned to meet our commitments for the year. For the third quarter, we grew revenues 3.5% despite continued reimbursement pressure. Reported EPS was $1.56, up nearly 3% from the same period in 2018. Adjusted EPS was $1.76, up nearly 5%. Volume growth remained very strong at 5.1% and year-to-date volume growth is up 4.3%. Now, I\u2019d like to briefly update you on the three fundamental changes in the laboratory marketplace that we discussed at last year\u2019s Investor Day. And as you know they are our PAMA, our expanded network access and increased consumerization of healthcare. First, PAMA, the reimbursement pressure remains a catalyst for structural change in the marketplace. And there is mounting evidence that PAMA is hurting this industry. We see and hear the negative impact that PAMA is having whenever we evaluate potential lab acquisition targets. And CAP Today, a respected industry journal, recently highlighted how PAMA and other reimbursement pressures are already starting to drive consolidation in the industry. As you know, here at Quest, we took a series of actions earlier this year to further reduce our costs to align with PAMA cuts. Some decisions that we made were difficult, and our employees have felt the changes. More PAMA reimbursement cuts are coming in 2020. Our industry continues to fight PAMA\u2019s flawed implementation in the courts and in Congress. We recently received a favorable U.S. Court of Appeals decision to allow the lower court to review the merits of ACLA\u2019s case. ACLA submitted its initial brief last week, and a decision is expected in 2020. This is encouraging news, and so is the introduction of the Laboratory Access for Beneficiaries Act, or LAB Act, introduced in June by six members of Congress from both sides of the aisle and now with nearly 40 cosponsors. ACLA is also working to build support for a Senate companion bill to include the LAB Act in a larger end-of-year health care extender bill. The second fundamental change affecting our industry is our expanded network access and payers becoming more focused than ever on driving better value in their lab spend. We are partnering with UnitedHealthcare to move testing volume to high-value labs like Quest from high-cost hospital and out-of-network labs. UnitedHealthcare began offering a product with zero dollar member out-of-pocket charges for laboratory testing for the majority of fully insured lives in select states on October 1. UnitedHealthcare will also make the lab savings program available for their self-insured employer groups beginning in 2020. And then finally, we continue to see the ongoing consumerization of health care with more and more health care costs borne by consumers. In September, the Kaiser Family Foundation reported that the annual premiums for employer sponsored health care coverage grew 5% for families, surpassing $20,000 for the first time. The number of employees in high deductible health plans has increased over the past decade. Turning to our recent progress, the first part of our two-point strategy is to accelerate growth, which has five elements. To grow 2% per year through accretive, strategically aligned acquisitions; expand relationships with health plans and hospital health systems; offer the broadest access to diagnostic innovation; be recognized as the consumer-friendly provider of diagnostic information services; and then finally support population health with data analytics and extended care services. Now let me take you through a few highlights from our strategy to accelerate growth in the quarter. Our acquisition pipeline remains strong. As we\u2019ve said before, most deals in our pipeline are taking more time to develop than they have in the past. Conversations with hospital systems are getting broader. Hospital CEOs are also interested in how we can help them with their professional lab services and taking on more of their reference work. As a result of this complexity, proposed relationships take longer to develop.  Hospital systems are also interested in learning more about our recently unveiled Quest Lab Stewardship, an innovative new service that employs machine learning to help optimize laboratory test utilization. We have partnered with hc1, a health care IT company, to provide a solution that gives Quest a differentiated offering in a competitive hospital marketplace.  We continue to see revenue and volume growth as a result of our expanding network access. In aggregate, growth continues across our top 50 major health plan customers. Key test growth drivers in the quarter included drug monitoring, continued strength in tuberculosis testing in both QuantiFERON and T-Spot; STD testing; and CardioIQ. Each of these test categories posted solid contributions to revenue growth in the quarter. The second part of our two-point strategy is to drive operational excellence. We remain on track to deliver 3% cost efficiencies for 2019 by continuing to drive increases in productivity. We have some examples which include using digital technology to enhance the customer experience. We now have more than 8.2 million patients now making appointments and receiving their results through our MyQuest digital platform. We\u2019ve continued to drive productivity improvements across logistics, patient services and lab services, enabling us to reduce our overall cost per laboratory requisition. We are also putting new innovations to work while reducing costs. We are in the process of consolidating and simplifying our immunoassay platforms, moving to a single supplier. This approach enables greater throughput, a more efficient footprint, and is expected to save tens of millions of dollars per year. Now, let me turn it over to Mark, who will take you through our financial performance. Mark? Mark Guinan : Thanks, Steve. In the third quarter, consolidated revenues were $1.96 billion, up 3.5% versus the prior year. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services grew 3.7% compared to the prior year driven by strong volume growth and acquisitions, partially offset by higher reimbursement pressure. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 5.1% versus the prior year. Excluding acquisitions, volumes grew 3.7%. We benefitted from an extra revenue day in the third quarter, while the impact of Hurricane Dorian was a modest volume headwind. The net impact of these two items added roughly 1% to organic growth in the quarter.  Recall, we also highlighted last quarter that we recently exited some capitated contracts. In the third quarter, this change represented a headwind of nearly 1% to our organic volume growth.  Importantly, we continued to see a modest acceleration in our volume growth associated with our UnitedHealthcare contract. Revenue per requisition declined by 1.2% versus the prior year primarily driven by higher reimbursement pressure.  Unit price headwinds were approximately 2.5% in the third quarter. This includes the impact of PAMA which amounted to a headwind of approximately 120 basis points. As a reminder, the PAMA impact includes both direct cuts to the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule as well as modest indirect price changes from Medicaid and a small number of floating rate contracts.  Reported operating income was $313 million, or 16% of revenues, compared to $304 million, or 16.1% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $349 million, or 17.9% of revenues, compared to $333 million, or 17.7% of revenues last year. The year-over-year increase in adjusted operating margin was primarily driven by strong volume growth and ongoing productivity improvements related to our Invigorate initiatives, partially offset by higher reimbursement pressure. Additionally, patient concessions are down year-over-year. Reported EPS was $1.56 in the quarter compared to $1.53 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $1.76, up approximately 5% from $1.68 last year. Cash provided by operations was $895 million year-to-date versus $905 million last year. Capital expenditures were $228 million year-to-date, compared to $232 million a year ago. Now, turning to guidance, our updated outlook for 2019 is as follows : Revenues expected to be approximately $7.72 billion, an increase of approximately 2.5% versus the prior year. Reported EPS expected to be between $5.48 and $5.53 and adjusted EPS, to be between $6.45 and $6.50. Cash provided by operations is still expected to be approximately $1.3 billion and capital expenditures are expected to be between $350 million and $400 million. I will now turn it back to Steve. Steve Rusckowski : To summarize, we had a solid quarter of top and bottom line growth. While PAMA reimbursement pressures persist throughout the industry, our expanded network access and laser focus on driving operational excellence are enabling growth. Based on our progress to date we have updated our outlook and are well-positioned to meet our commitments for the rest of the year. Now, we\u2019d be happy to take any of your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We will now open it up to questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : Good morning, Ralph. Mark Guinan : Good morning, Ralph. Ralph Giacobbe : Good morning. Good morning. Thanks. I guess I wanted to ask on the pricing side, and just your comments on sort of the higher reimbursement pressure. I guess what\u2019s \u2013 just help us on sort of what\u2019s driving that outside of PAMA? And then if you could maybe just level set the expectation on sort of where expectations are for that pricing mix that kind of going forward, exclusive of PAMA? Thanks. Steve Rusckowski : Mark, do you want to\u2026 Mark Guinan : Sure. So as we\u2019ve shared before in the Investor Day last year, then also coming into this year, this year\u2019s pricing pressure is primarily driven by two factors, one is PAMA. The second one is getting back in with United. We moved from out-of-network rates to a market-based in network rate. So obviously, we have grown our volume dramatically. As we\u2019ve said this year, we expected and we \u2013 still we are delivering enough incremental value to offset the price set, but it is a significant price headwind relative to the rates we were being reimbursed as out-of-network lab. You don\u2019t have the typical pricing pressure that this industry has faced in the past. We\u2019ve talked about it being for around 100 basis points or less. Number of those pricing pressures are coming from the client bill, it\u2019s not all third-party reimbursement where we\u2019re contractually agreed with the health plan and what those rates are in the hospital business and also where we sell directly to physicians and they\u2019re allowed to build a third party. There is a lot of competition. A lot of pricing pressure in that area and so while we\u2019ve talked about, we\u2019re going to be price disciplined when we certainly walked away from some contracts that haven\u2019t made sense. The reality is that it\u2019s a very competitive environment. And that has not really changed. So the big change over the last two years, obviously PAMA last year, but it wasn\u2019t fully implemented, because you had some offsets to it in the first year that we\u2019ve talked about previously. This was the first year of the full 10% of PAMA. And then additionally, we have the United price as well. And going forward, as we shared, we would expect this to get back to more of its historical rate. I\u2019m not going to give any specific guidance for a given year. But there is no reason to believe once we get through the transition period in the United that we should be really facing in kind of the traditional pricing pressure in PAMA. Ralph Giacobbe : Okay. And could you just quantify that UNH pricing pressure this year? Steve Rusckowski : Ralph, it\u2019s going to be $40 million to $50 million. Ralph Giacobbe : Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : Hey, Bill. Bill Quirk : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Steve Rusckowski : Good morning. Bill Quirk : So Steve, I want to follow up on a comment that you made concerning the decision to consolidate the immunoassay vendors. Can you speak a little bit about whether or not there\u2019s an opportunity here to consolidate some of your other testing methods things like clinical chemistry and hematology and such. And if so, can you just help us think a little bit about the timing? This is something we should think about over the next couple of years to help offset some of the PAMA pressure. Thanks. Steve Rusckowski : Yes, sure, absolutely. So Bill, we were working on this for about seven years, getting smarter and more strategic with all our suppliers, and so we\u2019ve done a lot of consolidation in the past and we\u2019ll continue to do more in the future. So as far as immunoassays, we\u2019re close to deciding on the supplier. I believe that will be announced shortly who that is. Of course it\u2019s a nice opportunity. And this is all part of our 3% productivity gains that we are dialing in to be able to offset PAMA. We need it to be able to offset PAMA deliver on the earnings uplift that we\u2019ve provided at Investor Day. And so part of that 3% is working with our suppliers and part of that working with the suppliers and the example of that is immunoassay while there is others. Another example would be the automation we\u2019re putting in place in some of our newer facilities, particularly we\u2019re investing this year in our branding facility here in New Jersey \u2013 in Clifton, New Jersey. It\u2019s a big project for us. That will have us new platform, but equally it will have us our latest approach to automation, which will increase our productivity, but also allow us to consolidate some facilities into one, so we get some productivity gains from that. But that\u2019s all part of that 3% when we need that 3% to offset the price pressure particularly with PAMA next year and maybe the year after. Mark Guinan : And I just want to add some color there, Bill, make sure they understand this is not just consolidating our purchases. This is actually a new innovation in the platform where we can do multiple tests that previously were performed on separate pieces of equipment on a single piece of equipment. So this will drive, not just procurement efficiencies, but actually will drive operational efficiencies in our labs. Operator : Our next question comes from Donald Hooker with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : Hey, Donald. Donald Hooker : Great. Good morning. So I \u2013 maybe you guys in terms of that new collaboration you announced with hc1. I know you guys do a lot of interesting things in the population health space. I\u2019m just trying to maybe \u2013 can you elaborate on that a little bit? What exactly are you doing? I mean is this something that I guess you\u2019re... Steve Rusckowski : Sure. Sure. What we\u2019re doing for our hospital client as part of our five-point strategy, we talk to them about three things in regards to the lab strategies. One is, can we make them more efficient in running their inpatient laboratory? So this is where we talk about Professional Laboratory Services or sometimes we use the acronym PLS, and we continue to have that dialogs about making them more efficient. We can \u2013 with good evidence now, save them about 10% to 20%. Part of that typically also is looking at the sophisticated send out of testing referred to as reference testing. And in that regard, consolidated was buying from \u2013 like potentially give them a better price. But the third part that we\u2019re looking at and this new offering allows as a tool to do a better job of getting smarter about what they\u2019re testing in the hospital is interrogate their order patterns and look for variation of their order patterns and look at ways of optimizing what the order within the hospital. And there\u2019s two part to that. One is to get more efficient at what you\u2019re ordering. So maybe third quarter as much in some cases, you should also order more because it\u2019s smarter diagnostic workup for the inpatient today, but the second part of this, which is more \u2013 even more intriguing what many hospital administrators are interested in is making sure that we have the right diagnosis. And if you look at the total quality and outcomes for our hospital stay, there\u2019s nothing more expensive than buying diagnosis. So what this tool allows us to do is to work with our clients on getting smarter on their inpatient diagnostics and as part of that, we clearly become more strategic than this vendor providing reference testing within that account. And then finally, the third piece of what we work with hospital systems when we have those discussions is you want to stay in the outreach business and we have bought some outreach businesses from hospitals. We have some within our numbers for this year and will continue to aggressively pursue buying outreach businesses as this industry consolidates. And I would tell you that many hospital systems are now well aware of PAMA and well aware of other reimbursement pressures they are having in their laboratory outreach business. So, as we mentioned in our commentary that funnel of discussions continues to grow. Operator : Our next question comes from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : Hi, Erin. Erin Wright : Hi. In terms of the timing and magnitude of contributions from the managed care access, I guess, can you break out what you\u2019re seeing in terms of underlying market growth and what portion of volume may be stemming from the managed care contracts and possibly also the PLN in early days and are you still anticipating those contributions to ramp from here? How should we conceptually be thinking about that ramp? I\u2019m not asking for 2020 guidance, but how should we be thinking about that ramp into 2020? Steve Rusckowski : Sure. So what will share with you \u2013 we always shared this every quarter. It feels like the market is stable. We don\u2019t see any notable changes in terms of volume increases within the marketplace both outside the hospital, and also inside the hospital so stable. So if you look at volume growth, we\u2019re clearly gaining share. And a large portion of that share of gains is coming from managed care relationships. What we have also said is that our access changes, which is the best in over a decade, we\u2019ll continue to grow. It will continue to grow this year in 2019, but it will also have growth in 2020 and probably in 2021 as we take advantage of that opportunity that we see in front of those. That will be helped in 2020 for certain with \u2013 for lab network, particularly with UnitedHealthcare. So you should look for in 2020 continued growth again because of our expanded network access. So Mark, anything you\u2019d like to add to that? Mark Guinan : Yes. So, you asked about the PLN, it\u2019s still very, very early. To this date, I\u2019d say very little, if any growth has come from the PLN is still in front of us, which is the good news. We talked at Investor Day about kind of three tranches of volume growth, Erin. We sized the new managed care access at about $1 billion at our price, our fair share. We fully expect to get to our fair share. But it\u2019s going to take several years there was a easier to convert accounts obviously came quickly, we call them Quest loyalist where we had the rest of the book of the office and they were sending some of the managed care work that we were out-of-network to those, to other labs that were in-network and they immediately moved that to us once we were in network. We never had some of the accounts where they have multiple labs. We showed you the picture when they were three, four sometimes five boxes outside. We\u2019ve done a better job of consolidating some of that getting a more larger share of wallet per se in those positions that will take a period of time, but certainly, we\u2019ve gotten some growth from that, but that will continue into the future. And then there was the ones where we have had no, none of the work and a lot of that is in the hospital stay, hospital outreach and in some of the physician-owned laboratories that\u2019s where we really think the preferred lab network is going to be a big driver. We would be able to have a very simple message to patients. Hey, if you use one of the preferred labs and obviously we\u2019re one of the five zero out-of-pocket. That\u2019s a very simple message instead of trying to compare how expensive, what option might be the there, it\u2019s free to view if you use this lab. So we\u2019re very confident, very excited. This will be a multi-year tailwind and we\u2019re going to get to that fair share eventually of about $1 billion in our price. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Newshel with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : Hi, Michael. Michael Newshel : Hi, good morning. Maybe to follow-up on that. Do you have any visibility at this point after the selling season from United on the level of uptake in the self-insured base for the PLN for 2020 Mark Guinan : They have not shared specific information, obviously. They are questions you could ask them because we\u2019re not the only preferred lab. So we obviously get the same information that preferred lab network providers do. They talk to us about, as we\u2019ve shared the states where their role in the south making this available, and then they talk to us about the fact that their marketing into those whole insurance sponsored plans for 2020, rolling that out, still very early in that process, and they didn\u2019t give us any specific proportionality or percentage of their overall insured lives that are adapting this, but they \u2013 I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard them talk about it, we\u2019ve heard them talk publicly and in the conversation we have, they are very, very confident that this is going to be something that people will embrace and that is going to make a difference. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : Hey, Kevin. Kevin Ellich : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Steve Rusckowski : Good morning. Kevin Ellich : Hey, Steve. Two quick things. So first M&A pipeline. You said that the deals are taking a little bit longer to materialize. Wondering if the environment has changed or if this is what you\u2019ve experienced historically. And then also could you talk about maybe any tailwinds you\u2019re seeing from the opioid testing and the opportunities within behavioral health facilities? Steve Rusckowski : Yes. Sure. So on the first one, as I mentioned in our opening remarks, these deals are getting bigger and more complicated. And if it\u2019s more complex, it takes more time and there is good news in that and there is bad news in that. One is, it takes more time. That\u2019s bad news. The good news is, the bigger the more complicated. It\u2019s therefore we\u2019re clearly having discussion around how they could be \u2013 their partner for laboratory services around the three topics that I mentioned earlier. And what I did also share is that the interest level around what we can do when partnering continues to grow because of more people are well aware of the pressure on this portion of their business. I would say that was not nearly where we were last year at this time. So if you look at our growth rate from acquisition year-to-date, they\u2019re \u2013 it\u2019s just a little shy of that 2% we indicated last year. We\u2019re well north of that 2%. We still feel confident that over an extended period of time, we\u2019ll continue to be 2% or greater. And so, we feel confident between the three buckets that we acquire. One is hospital outreach, [indiscernible] (0:29:03) lot of engagement around that. Second is, regional laboratories. As I mentioned in my remarks, there continues to be interest in evaluating options for smaller operators because of the pressures that they see. And then finally, we continue to build capabilities and we have a number of acquisitions in the past around that. A good example of this immune attack, which is bringing us new capabilities around tuberculosis testing and also fit for an illness testing. So all three continue to be our focus going forward and you will see that and we\u2019re still confident around our guidance we provided around 2% on a CAGR basis over a multi-year period of time. Mark Guinan : And you asked about opioid testing and the tailwind certainly our prescription drug monitoring business, which is subset of that opioid testing has been a strong growth engine for us for a number of years and continues to be a nice growth driver. Like anything else, when something gets large enough, the payers start putting in policies and all sorts of barriers to reimbursement that dampen that somewhat, despite some of those restrictions around frequency of testing, pre-authorization, and other things that they\u2019re putting in, it\u2019s still a nice growth driver for us. It just will be even larger if they hadn\u2019t made those changes. Operator : Our next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : Hi Jack, good morning. Jack Meehan : Good morning. So I just wanted to focus on the margins here, so in the quarter, nice to see the expansion. Can you maybe walk us through the moving parts between pricing impact, efficiency programs in the calendar? And as we look to 2020, as you pull all these pieces together, do you think \u2013 what\u2019s the right way to think about, are margins flat is PAMA too big of a headwind to grow through? What are some of the things that you\u2019re thinking about? Steve Rusckowski : Yes, so let me first touch Jack on the longer term. So I\u2019m not going to talk to 2020. But what I did talk about at the Investor Day was on a full year outlook that we could grow earnings faster than the top line. And talked about the assumption, although that may not play out depending on how we deploy our cash, but that\u2019s on the flat share count, so therefore we\u2019re actually growing earnings not earnings per share. So that implies margin expansion that I can tell you that we are not expecting some sort of the tax windfall. So that\u2019s before tax margin growth. I can\u2019t assure you that will happen every quarter. I can\u2019t assure you that I\u2019m not going to get into 2025 adding every year, but over multiple years, we expect to grow our earnings faster than our top line. And it\u2019s really having the efficiency program continue, we talked about it being 3% per year, we\u2019ve got really good at that. We need that. We\u2019ll continue to do that with over time tempering pricing headwinds. In this quarter, we shared the pricing headwinds of 250 basis points. Obviously, that all drops to the bottom line for a very small piece for the bad debt element, but basically it drops to the bottom line. So we had enough efficiency and some lift from volume, how much of that is the extra day, how much of that is just the volume growth. Obviously, we have a higher drop through we shared on organic volume growth, enough to offset the pricing headwinds and basically hold our margin pretty flat in the quarter. So I may be getting any more precise than that, I\u2019d be stretching my credibility and ability to give that map. So I would just say that, you can see that despite some pretty significant pricing headwinds, is how their margins in this quarter and that as we continue to drive strong organic volume growth and deliver our 3%, over a period of time, we\u2019re going to grow our earnings faster. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Your line is open. Kevin Caliendo : Hi. Thanks for taking my call. Could you talk a little bit about the fourth quarter guidance? The revenue guidance is in line with model, the EPS fall short. I\u2019m just wondering if there is any accelerated spending, are you may be trying to position better for 2020 by spending more in 2019? Can you give us a little color around the fourth quarter and may be higher thinking about spending in 2020? Steve Rusckowski : Yes, so we\u2019ve raised our guidance for the year. Importantly, we\u2019re signaling stronger finish to the year than we did at the beginning of the year. And until now we\u2019ve not signaled anything above original guidance. So, hopefully people are taking that as a positive message, which we\u2019re saying based on our performance through three quarters of the year and what visibility we have for Q4, we\u2019re feeling confident that we\u2019re going to over-deliver relative to what we said at the beginning of the year. So, in terms of the spending, there\u2019s nothing out of the ordinary in Q4. The only thing that\u2019s out of the ordinary is the easy compare on the top line which we\u2019ve talked about. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Your line is open. Brian Tanquilut : Good morning guys. Steve Rusckowski : Good morning. Brian Tanquilut : Mark just to follow-up on Jack\u2019s question earlier, as I think about the G&A line, you\u2019ve obviously done a good job bringing the G&A percentage down. It flattened out this quarter at about 17.8%. So as I think about your efficiency program, is there more to squeeze out of that or how should we be thinking about that number, it seems like it\u2019s bottoming out here in this 17.8% range? Steve Rusckowski : Let me start on this. For some reason, there\u2019s always a lot of focus around G&A thinking about a lot of our invigorated savings show up in the expense categories. To the contrary, most of our invigorated savings actually sort of show up in our costs of sales. So if you think about what\u2019s in our expense category, a lot of it is G&A and we\u2019ve made really good progress over the last seven years. So getting more efficient with everything that\u2019s in the category in the P&L, from IT cost to cost running our finance organization, the cost associated with our billing operations, with our relationship with Optum. And outside the general and administration, it\u2019s our sales and marketing costs, which we\u2019re always evaluating and getting more efficient. So we have taken a lot of cost out already. And we\u2019re also leveraging that fixed cost going forward. So the lift we generally get now has to do with that operational leverage related to the top line growth while maintaining the same cost perspective and that\u2019s what you see this year. So a lot of the 3% productivity gain will show up in productivity gains in our cost of sales and not in the expenses. Mark, do you have anything you\u2019d like to add that? Mark Guinan : Yes, I just would like to add that yes, over time, well Steve is absolutely correct that a large proportion if not a majority of that efficiency is going to drive margin and gross margin will be in the cost of sales will continue to focus on G&A. You can\u2019t really look quarter-to-quarter. In this quarter, we had some couple of high-cost health claims. Over time, we\u2019re going to deliver what we expect, and we\u2019ve done a really good job in managing, it\u2019s very, very minor increases in our self-funded employee healthcare costs. But in a given quarter you get a couple of large claims that can make some noise quarter-to-quarter. So there\u2019s no trend, where there\u2019s \u2013 nothing should be read in terms of we\u2019ve lost our ability to continue to drive efficiency, there\u2019s always going to be noise on that line quarter-to-quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is open. Derik de Bruin : Hi, good morning. How are you? Steve Rusckowski : Hey, good morning. Derik de Bruin : Good. Hey, I just want to follow \u2013 two questions. One is a quick follow-up to Bill\u2019s question on the vendor consolidation, platform consolidation. Can you talk a little bit about that process and that how is that going to look and sort of like how you\u2019re judging the different vendors and basically how many you have now particularly the IA and going down? And then the other question I wanted to follow-up on was, when you look at the fourth quarter last year, obviously you had a number of weather issues, but there were issues of patient concessions, lower cash collections, in that sense. Can you just sort of talk about going into the fourth quarter how we are relative to some of these issues, I know you mentioned concessions were down. But just to talk a little bit more about the comps and some of the different things you\u2019re sort of going on in fourth quarter versus\u2026 Steve Rusckowski : Okay, so let me take the first part Mark will take the second part. And the first part, so this is a comprehensive review that we perpetually look at with our suppliers on how we run our laboratories. And we work actively with all our suppliers and that over the past seven years we\u2019ve worked hard to make sure that we really have more of a strategic relationship with all our suppliers, particularly those that are driving a large portion of our spend. And so in that regard, in the IVD automation states, there is consolidation with a number of those platforms as Mark mentioned. And there are a number of suppliers that we buy from that are bringing to the marketplace platforms that will allow us to replace up to about five different work cells with different manufacturers over time. And so what we have done is evaluate those vendors that have a product either in the marketplace or will have a product in the marketplace and we do that through a review process with their sales force on understanding what they\u2019ll have, and what they\u2019ll have for functionality at one time, and then also what the economics around their offering are. We narrowed that down to a few. We actually put in place a few of those platforms in some of our facilities to do some trial runs and then we\u2019re at the final strokes of selecting one of those suppliers going forward. And we believe that we will choose a vendor that meets all the requirements of what we need. And yes, a portion of this is economics. That is how cost \u2013 how much productivity we\u2019re going to get for getting more throughput by \u2013 being able to consolidate those operations. But also we think about it holistically. You need to make sure that you have good confidence around their ability to service us, good confidence around their quality, good confidence around what\u2019s in their installed base. So it\u2019s a very comprehensive, operational review of who will be our strategic provider for this new platform going forward. And as I said we\u2019re at the final strokes of deciding that and shortly it will be announced. Mark Guinan : Yes, so on your second question, last year there were a couple of drivers that led us to the change in estimates and obviously the change that we made in Investor Day on our outlook for 2018. Two of them really relate to patients. The first one was that there was more patient responsibility in the year than we saw it coming. And again, we\u2019re always accruing based on a forward-looking expectation of how the revenue is going to play out. We looked at all the available data at the beginning of the year as we shared whether great growth with the amount of people with high deductible plans, we assumed it would be a pretty flat year in terms of the proportion of our revenue from patients. And instead what happened was there were more patient responsibility because the deductibles themselves have gone up markedly as we found out in the September timeframe, which started to actually validate why our cash collections were lagging what we expected from the payer. So anytime, as we\u2019ve shared, we almost collect a hundred percent of the accepted claims that we\u2019re owed from third party payers. And we\u2019ve shared that we collect about $0.70 on the dollar from patients. So you move 1% of revenue from the third party to the patient. That\u2019s a 30 basis point headwind. So it\u2019s pretty significant. The good news is this year nothing changed significantly from last year. We\u2019re very confident with that, there was no surprise. Obviously going in, we were very, very diligent in watching that, being conservative and there\u2019s no surprises in terms of the proportion of our revenue coming from patients.  The second piece really with patients was we had more patient concessions, not just because more revenue was coming from them, but we actually had some issues we\u2019ve talked about in our lab conversion in the south. And that delays some billing because of the way these conversions go. And because of that the more bills age out, the more you\u2019re going to have concessions less like you are going to collect it. So that\u2019s well behind us, we\u2019re fully converted, we don\u2019t have that anymore. So that\u2019s behind us. And then also related to that we had some higher level of denials because of some time with filings, and so on, because lab conversion themselves we always have been dealing with denials, but they spiked the mid to late last year when we went to this lab conversion. So when you add all those things up, they\u2019ve been cleaned up. The issues that we had last year are well behind us. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Larew with William Blair. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : Hi Matt. Matt Larew : Hi. Good morning. I wanted to ask for an update on progress in the retail setting, first just broadly in terms of the footprint transformation in the Walmart and Safeway stores. And then also anything that you think you are doing with the new Walmart health initiative. I know there\u2019s a first center that just opened up in Georgia that you\u2019re participating in. Steve Rusckowski : Yes, so we\u2019re continuing to move forward with our retail strategy as we call it. We have about 2,100 patient service centers and of which can you characterize from above 35% to 40% of those are more retail like, several of which are within Safeway stores and Walmart. The Safeway relationship continues to be a good one. We actually have some new opportunities with Safeway going forward as we kind of work that relationship, so we\u2019re optimistic there. And then second, as we continue to build our presence with Walmart as well. And as you mentioned, they opened up new health concept store and we are their laboratory provider for that store, so they\u2019re still working through how that works. And as you know if you know anything about Walmart, they probably like a lot of things and they\u2019re seeing how well that goes to be able to tune out and we\u2019re working with them proactive on that content going forward.  And as what we said is our goal is to be north of 50% of our patient service centers. So we have some ways to go. And there\u2019s a number of things for us, one is we think it\u2019s a better customer experience, consistent with our strategy, could be the most consumer-friendly laboratory. And we think this will continue to be a differentiator for us in the marketplace. Second is it\u2019s better for employees in a lot of ways and it also allows us to manage the demand and when people are there if we can have larger patient service centers with more providers, it just gives you a lot more operational flexibility to manage the demand based upon location and time of day that patients are coming in over extended period of time. And then finally as the patients really the feedback is quite good. They come in, they have flexibility to walk the store where they wait they have flexibility to do some shopping after their visit. Then we believe that improvement in access and the quality of that access will allow us to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace and pick up share gradually over time. So it\u2019s going well, we\u2019re pleased with it. And then lastly, I will just say, yes, we have the relationship with Safeway, and yes we have relationship with Walmart, but we continue to work with others in the marketplace, so we continue to work with CVS, Aetna, the MinuteClinic and what we\u2019re doing around their strategy is they are a partner of ours. Operator : Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : Hey Ricky. Good morning. Mark Guinan : Good morning Ricky. Alexa Desai : Good morning. This is actually Alexa in for Ricky. Thank you for taking my question. Mark Guinan : Hi, Alexa. Alexa Desai : I just wanted to come back to the United Health PLN. You guys mentioned, I think, in your earlier remarks that they\u2019re offering starting October 1, zero dollar member out-of-pocket charges. So I guess my question is, are there any other things that are looking for to do over the balance of the year to continue kind of incentivizing the use of the PLN and how does that zero pocket compared labs not in the network? Steve Rusckowski : Mark you want to take that? Mark Guinan : Yes so for labs not in the network, it would be the typical out-of-pocket determined by their plan benefit design. So, with a high deductible plan they just had some sort of cover insurance, but there won\u2019t be zero. So if you think about the average requisition being somewhere between $40 and $50 and typical patient responsibility over time, employing proper responsibility over time by be it 20% to 25% of their healthcare dollars, with the balance being paid for by the company, you can do the math. Now that\u2019s an average. Obviously there\u2019s some very high cost tests. So it\u2019d be a big, big advantage if you have a genetic test or some of the other screening tests that could run hundreds of dollars.  But just the simplicity of the message of not having to worry that, hey the same series of tests would be $50 from a national lab and $500 from this hospital. And what does that mean for me? It\u2019s just you don\u2019t have to worry about it. They\u2019re not as good and it\u2019s not just about price, it\u2019s also about quality, and service and access. So those are all the metrics that were required to get in. We did not change our price with the United in order to get into the pervert lab network, nor do we think anybody else did, but we know we definitely did not. So this is really about the total value of the offering. So if you want to go to the best lab with a great price and also have zero out-of-pocket, it\u2019s a very simple decision for the patient. So that\u2019s important. There\u2019s also in United you should talk about this, but there\u2019s also some things that they\u2019re doing around in sending physicians as well. So it\u2019s not just a patient-driven initiative and I\u2019ll let you talk to United about what they\u2019re doing on that end.  And then obviously you can imagine we\u2019re doing a lot of work in the field with our own commercial sales force to make sure that physicians are aware because this is really good for patients. And most physicians their number one priority is their patient, not their owner, not anybody else, so when they know this was good thing for their patients, they like that. The other thing is it\u2019s a source of some patient satisfaction is getting a bill. And so now you don\u2019t have to call to the office about, hey, that lab you ordered from me, I got a bill, I thought it was covered by the office visit, et cetera, et cetera. So reduces noise for the payer, reduces noise for the physician\u2019s office, obviously a good thing for us and a good thing for patients. Steve Rusckowski : Yes I\u2019ll just add to what Mark just said, obviously the savings here is zero coinsurance and copayments, but the biggest driver as you\u2019re moving through the laboratory that has a significant lower reimbursement rate then if they\u2019re working with enough for lab network. So the savings to the consumer is very considerable. But the biggest portion of that has to do with the rate differential, not necessarily with the patient responses they might have or not have with us. So a big opportunity and we\u2019re hopeful. As we mentioned it\u2019s just getting started this month, it\u2019s early. But we\u2019re hopeful, this change coupled with the changes that we spoke to take place in 2020 will continue to allow us to grow our presence and our share with United, but also with other payers because we do believe it\u2019s a trend overall in the marketplace. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : Hey Mark. Mark Guinan : Hey Mark. Mark Massaro : Hey guys, thanks for the question. I guess my first question is for you Mark. Obviously the volume growth is the strongest we\u2019ve seen in a long time. You talked about the one extra revenue day in the quarter. But you also talked about health plan access with United continuing to build. So can you just give us a sense for whether or not the 5% growth is a level that you think can continue? Can you just give us a little sense of the puts and takes around some of the drivers there? Mark Guinan : Yes, so we talked about the fact that the about the fact that the extra day net of hurricane Dorian gives about 100 points. So you can kind of take that math in your thinking. Obviously each corner has different puts and takes in terms of the amount of revenue days, and we usually try to be very transparent about how that all plays out. At the beginning of the year we\u2019ve talked about Q1 having Saturdays and Q3 having an extra day. And obviously next year we have leap year and the quarter\u2019s will play out a little bit differently. And we\u2019ll give you as much transparency on that as possible. But really when you think about the whole year the next year you\u2019re just thinking about generally revenue days are pretty similar year-over-year other than when you have a leap year. And then we did talk about the capitated volume, which is not impacting the bottom line. But if you\u2019re just focused on revenue, at some point next year we laugh that change. So that was about a 100 basis points this quarter. If you recall, we shared about 70 basis points in Q2. So at some point that volume headwind gets behind us. Now I\u2019ll just to share a little additional color in the quarter, our a employer pre-employment testing business is actually a headwind to our growth that was pretty flat. So that\u2019s the non-DIS if you remember then about a 20 basis point higher growth rate I shared at the beginning of my prepared remarks for our core clinical business. So we\u2019ll see how the pre-employment drug screening business goes, but that was if you want to really think about the clinical business, which is what where we\u2019re benefiting from the expanded access and the volume performance is actually slightly stronger than it may have appeared on the surface. So, is it going to be 5%? Obviously we\u2019re not going to have an extra day every quarter. But is it going to continue to be really positive organic revenue growth into the future? Absolutely that\u2019s our expectation as we work our way to that fair share I talked about as eventually getting into $1 billion of revenue in these new lives with the three expanded access plans. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Coldwell with Baird. Your line is open. Eric Coldwell : Hey thanks very much. Mark Guinan : Hey Eric. Eric Coldwell : At the end of the quarter you have been head on. But I think it\u2019s always helpful to get maybe a little more emphatic or explicit commentary. It\u2019s all around the M&A and then the capital deployment around M&A. Inorganic growth will really start to abate here in the fourth quarter based on the timing of prior period deals. I\u2019m hoping you can give us some sense on what you\u2019re expecting from inorganic growth in 4Q. Also, you have a long-term model of 2% plus M&A-driven growth. To the extent that the analysts have built in a place holder here, it sounds like we need to be pulling that in for 2020, at least in the beginning of the year. Can you give us a sense on what you would be comfortable with if people have built in a placeholder? And then third, as you see these elongated decision cycles on M&A cash is building. So are you more comfortable with us leaving that cash on the balance sheet or would you be comfortable with maybe assuming some accelerated repurchase activity as you have those unnecessary balances that start to build? Thanks very much. Mark Guinan : Yes, so let me go back to our capital deployment strategy. So as we\u2019ve shared, we\u2019re going to do M&A where it\u2019s value accretive to our shareholders, there\u2019s a clear path. We\u2019re not going to do an M&A just to meet some outlooks that we gave. But with that said, we\u2019re very confident in that 2% CAGR. So we never include unexecuted M&A in our guidance. So just because we at this point are implying a low level of M&A either in Q4 or early in the next year, doesn\u2019t mean that we might not be close to something, but that\u2019s just not in our practice. So we don\u2019t actually include M&A in our guidance until we have a signed contract, and so on. So we\u2019re very confident in that 2% CAGR. If you look at what we\u2019ve done, last year and what we\u2019re applying this year we\u2019re going to be well north of that 2% after two years. We\u2019re highly confident that in the next two years to complete that four year CAGR. We\u2019re going to be at that level if not beat it, because there is a lot of interest. As Steve shared and as we\u2019ve talked about these deals have just taken a while it doesn\u2019t mean they have fallen by the wayside, we\u2019re still working on the same deals that we thought we\u2019d would have gotten done several months ago. But we\u2019re very optimistic some of these are going to get completed. And I\u2019m not going to give you any guidance for 2020. What I\u2019m comfortable with obviously we\u2019ll give guidance in late January for the year. I\u2019ll talk about the organic M&A mix and then at that point if we have some additional deals that have closed in the interim those will be included. But otherwise we don\u2019t typically do that \u2013 include that in our guidance. Operator : Our last question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : Hi, Stephen. Stephen Baxter : Hi, how are you? Steve Rusckowski : Good. Stephen Baxter : I want to follow-up on the patient concessions question. So I\u2019m glad you mentioned the Kaiser report. I was flipping through it and it looks like we\u2019re seeing a fairly similar trend in this year\u2019s report. As discussed at the Investor Day last year in terms of high deductible enrollment, not really increasing that much, but deductibles continuing to march upwards at a similar clip. So I was hoping you could clarify a little bit of what you\u2019re seeing in 2019 relative to 2018 in terms of where in the ecosystem you\u2019re seeing improvement in collections and your level of visibility into that versus this time last year. And then finally in terms of quantification, would you be able to give us a sense of what the collections of improvement has contributed to this year\u2019s growth? Is it reasonable to think about it as offsetting the United out-of-network impact or should we be thinking about something less than that? Thanks. Steve Rusckowski : Yes, so at this point we share where our sources of revenue are. And so at this point, patient responsibility is not grown significantly year-over-year. So despite what the Kaiser report is talking about in terms of increased deduction, this year it\u2019s not impacted us per se year-over-year. One of the things we did in response to some of the surprise we had last year was we shortened our timeframe. So the way we do our revenue recognition, we\u2019re looking at more recent trends that we use to have a longer term trend that worked for us for years, and years and years. So we\u2019re looking at a lot more recent, which would allow us to not have surprises like we had last year. So we\u2019ve been on top of this. We\u2019re very comfortable with what we\u2019ve been accruing. We\u2019re very comfortable with our cash collections. We have a very robust process. And as we look at that we\u2019ve done better on patient concessions, partially because last year was a particularly poor year for some of the reasons I shared earlier, but part of it is we continue to roll out the tools and partner with Optum, our partner around doing things like offering credit card collections upfront.  We support that with our real-time estimation tool, where if you come into our patient service center, you go to an office where we have an in-office lobotomist. We can tell you on the spot whether the test is covered or not and importantly what your responsibility will be based on that coverage decision and then have an opportunity to say and how would you like to pay for the upfront like most of healthcare has done. So we\u2019re collecting more of our cash up front that makes a significant difference in the overall collectability. We\u2019ve also seen an improvement in denials. So some of the things we talked about last year, especially in the PBM space where we\u2019re surprised by a couple of major payers, I will tell you as I shared earlier, the payers in general continue to throw us curve balls, we\u2019re always having to deal with new policy changes, new opportunities for them to deny, but we cleaned up some of the things last year that were more significant. So we\u2019ve reduced our overall denials in a couple of key test periods. That\u2019s helpful. We\u2019ve also shared in the past that we continue to get some preferential treatment from a couple of payers where they put in pre-authorization requirements for certain tests and they actually wave that for a couple of labs, including us because they know we do things, right. We don\u2019t do excessive testing, we partner with them on what clinically appropriate panels are and approach to testing are. So that not only reduces our denial rate because pre-auth is great challenges for the labs, but it also makes us advantageous for the prescriber because they don\u2019t have to worry about pre-auth based on the work to us. So all of those things together are actually helping revenue growth, and they\u2019re helping our overall margin and part of our Invigorate is on the top line. It\u2019s not all on costs, some of it is actually getting paid for more of the work we do as Jim Davis has said at multiple Investor Days. So we\u2019re seeing good positive improvement in that space. Shawn Bevec : Okay. Well, we thank everyone for joining us today. We appreciate your support. Have a great day, and talk to you soon.

The entire contents of the call, including the presentation and question-and-answer session that will follow, are copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics with all rights reserved. Any distribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited.I would now like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead. Shawn Bevec : Thank you and good morning. I'm here with Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer.During this call we may make forward-looking statements and we'll discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS from continuing operations and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations, excluding amortization expense. References to adjusted operating income for all periods excludes amortization expense. Finally, growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings growth are compound annual growth rates.Now, here is Steve Rusckowski. Steve Rusckowski : Thanks, Shawn, and thanks everyone for joining us today. Well, this morning I'll discuss the fourth quarter and review progress on our two-point strategy. And then Mark will provide more detail on the results, then take you through our 2020 guidance. But we had a solid fourth quarter and ended the year by delivering record revenues, earnings and cash from operations. Strong volume growth from expanded health than planned network access, combined with outstanding execution of our operational excellence strategy helped us offset significant reimbursement pressure.For the fourth quarter, we grew revenues 4.8%, reported EPS was $1.86 and adjusted EPS was $1.67, up nearly 24% from the same period in 2018. Volume growth remained strong at 4.1%. For the full year of 2019, revenues grew 2.6%, reported EPS grew 16% to $6.13 and adjusted EPS grew 4% to $6.56 and volume grew 4.3%. In addition, we are increasing our quarterly dividend by nearly 6%. And this is the ninth increase since 2011.Before getting into the more details of the fourth quarter, I'd like to discuss how Quest is squarely within healthcare's AAA, as well as covered on PAMA and the recent passage of the LAB Act. So many providers within healthcare are focusing on healthcare's AAA, which is all about improving medical quality and the patient experience, while reducing the cost of care.Quest is dedicated to provide a great medical and service quality. One example is that we drive six input quality in our logistics performance by tracking specimen pickups. We're proud that our quality enables us to become a member of UnitedHealthcare's preferred lab network.Second, over the past several years we've made great strides on improving the patient experience. Investments in digital platforms and our patient service centers, as well as our partnerships with retailers such as Safeway and Walmart are helping to drive patient satisfaction scores above 90%. Also our Net Promoter Score exceeds 80%, which is very high particularly in health care services.Finally, Quest offers the best value in the lab industry. Test prices for many of our smaller boutiques and hospital competitors can be two to five times higher than our prices and sometimes even more. So taken together, our medical quality, patient experience and competitive pricing delivers a value proposition that is second to none in our industry.I'd like to update you on three fundamental changes to the marketplace, which I believe favor Quest. First, PAMA. This is the largest hub in Medicare reimbursement this industry has ever seen.Second, receive health plans focusing on the wide variation in price for health care delivery. And they are looking at opportunities to work with fewer higher value providers. Our expanded network access with UnitedHealthcare and the implementation of the preferred lab network are perfect examples of this.And then third is the increasing consumerization of health care. Consumers are shouldering more and more of the cost of health care and they're looking for the best value. We believe Quest Diagnostics is the best deal in town.I'd like to quickly comment on PAMA and the latest development regarding the passage of the LAB Act. We were pleased to see the LAB Act become law in late December. And it is the first step in fixing CMS's deeply through data collection process. The Lab Act will delay the data reporting period for one-year to the first quarter of 2021. It will also require MedPAC to identify a better way to collect the data that reflects private market rates as Congress initially intended.As many of you know the one-year delay now means that CMS will delay on the existing fee schedule for the basis of cuts in 2021. Despite the increase in reimbursement reduction caps from 10% in 2020 to 15% in 2021, we expect the PAMA headwinds in 2021 to be relatively consistent with 2019 and 2020.Additionally ACLA, our trade associations continues its legal challenge against HHS. Both sides have submitted their briefs to the courts and the matters in the hands of the judge. We expect a decision sometime this year.Now, turning to our recent performance and progress. The first part of our two-point strategy is to accelerate growth, which has five elements; grow more than 2% per year through accretive strategically aligned acquisitions; expand relationships with health plans and hospital health systems; offer the broadest access to diagnostic innovation. We're recognizes as the consumer-friendly provider of diagnostic information services. And then finally, support population health with data analytics and extended care services.Now let me take you through a few highlights from our strategy to accelerate growth. Our acquisition pipeline remains strong. During the fourth quarter, we announced the acquisition of Boston Clinical Laboratories, a small regional laboratory in Massachusetts.We also recently announced two new acquisitions. The first, Blueprint Genetics. It strengthens our leadership position in advanced diagnostics, through proprietary bioinformatics, which is often a bottleneck in next-generation sequencing. Blueprint's proven platform and specialty genetics, especially, variant interpretation and reporting is expected to significantly speed the average rate at time of interpretation.We also announced a multifaceted long-term collaboration with the Memorial Hermann Health System, one of the largest not-for-profit health systems in Southeast Texas. As part of the agreement, Quest will acquire Memorial Hermann's outreach lab services business and manage all 17 of its inpatient hospital labs in Greater Houston under our professional lab services agreement. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter.And then finally, we recently signed a professional laboratory services agreement with an eight hospital health system in Tennessee. We continue to see accelerating revenue and volume growth as a result of our branded health plan network access.The sequential acceleration in volumes demonstrates our ability to drive continued market share growth. We look forward to the further rollout of United's Preferred Lab Network, featuring $0 out-of-pocket cost for members. The test growth drivers in the quarter and full year include drug monitoring, tuberculosis testing of both QuantiFERON and T-SPOT, hemepath, our blood cancer test and Cardio IQ. Each of these test categories posted solid contributions to revenue growth.Overall, our G-based and esoteric testing grew approximately 5% for the year, an acceleration from low single-digit growth a year ago. And then, our second part of our two-point strategy is to drive operational excellence. We delivered on our 2019 goal to reduce our cost base by 3% by continuing to drive increases in productivity. We see more opportunities ahead to drive further productivity gains, while enhancing the customer experience.So here's three examples. First, our immunoassay platform consolidation is expected to provide brief throughput, autonomy and more efficient footprint, while saving us approximately $35 million annually when fully implemented. Second, we are optimizing our lab network through investments in our new flagship laboratory in Clifton, New Jersey. When operationally active in 2021, our new lab is expected to consolidate three regional hub labs, double our average throughput and provide 30% more capacity.And then third, we're using digital technology to enhance the customer experience. Nearly nine million patients have downloaded the MyQuest digital platform, which enables them to make appointments and receive their results.Now let me turn it over to Mark to go through the results. Mark? Mark Guinan : Thanks Steve. In the fourth quarter, consolidated revenues were $1.93 billion, up 4.8% versus the prior year. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services grew 5.1%, compared to the prior year, driven by strong volume growth an easy compare and acquisitions, partially offset by higher reimbursement pressure.Volume measured by the number of requisitions increased 4.1% versus the prior year. Excluding acquisitions, volumes grew 3.4%. Importantly, we continue to see a sequential acceleration in organic volume growth in the fourth quarter after considering the benefit of the extra revenue day in the third quarter.Revenue per requisition increased 1.2% versus the prior year, primarily driven by an easy compare, partially offset by higher reimbursement pressure. Unit price headwinds were approximately 2.5% in the fourth quarter. This includes the impact of PAMA, which amounted to a headwind of nearly 120 basis points.As a reminder, the PAMA impact includes both direct cuts to the clinical lab fee schedule, as well as modest indirect price changes primarily from Medicaid. Reported operating income was $363 million or 18.8% of revenues, compared to $220 million or 12% of revenues last year.On an adjusted basis, operating income was $329 million or 17% of revenues, compared to $295 million or 16% of revenues last year. The year-over-year increase in adjusted operating margin was primarily driven by strong volume growth and ongoing productivity improvements related to our invigorate initiatives, partially offset by higher reimbursement pressure.Additionally, patient concessions were down approximately 40 basis points year-over-year. Reported EPS was $1.86 in the quarter, compared to $0.92 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $1.67, up approximately 24% from $1.36 last year. Cash provided by operations was $1.24 billion in 2019 versus $1.2 billion last year and capital expenditures were $400 million in 2019, compared to $383 million a year ago.Now turning to guidance. Our outlook for 2020 is as follows; revenue is expected to be between $7.8 billion and $7.96 billion, an increase of approximately 1% to 3% versus the prior year. Reported EPS expected to be greater than $5.51 and adjusted EPS to be greater than $6.6; cash provided by operations is expected to be between $1.25 billion and $1.3 billion and capital expenditures are expected to be between $375 million and $400 million.There are several considerations that I will review as you think about 2020 and beyond. First, we will continue to face significant reimbursement pressure this year in large part due to the ongoing headwinds from PAMA. Total reimbursement pressure in 2020 is expected to be slightly more than 200 basis points, of which PAMA and associated impacts are expected to be approximately $80 million to $85 million. We estimate a similar impact from PAMA in 2021.Second, it's no secret that the tightening labor market has resulted in rising wage pressure. To remain competitive, we are investing in employee pay and benefits. The incremental cost is included in our guidance. Third, despite the continued reimbursement headwinds, we are making disciplined strategic investments in our advanced diagnostics capabilities that we expect will be slightly dilutive to our earnings in 2020 by roughly $0.15. A portion is related to our acquisition of Blueprint Genetics. The remainder is related to investments in liquid biopsy and next-generation sequencing automation.Fourth, our revenue guidance contemplates some M&A carryover, plus the two deals we recently announced. And finally, our revenue guidance includes contributions from the PLS relationships that Steve mentioned earlier. Keep in mind that revenue and volume contributions from PLS typically take a couple of quarters for rent.I will now turn it back to Steve. Steve Rusckowski : Well, thanks, Mark. Well, to summarize, we had a solid fourth quarter and ended the year by delivering record revenues, earnings and cash. Quest is well positioned in 2020 to grow revenues and earnings despite another year of meaningful reimbursement pressure. And then, finally, our guidance for 2020 is realistic and achievable.Now, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator? Shawn Bevec : Operator? Operator : Thank you. We will now open up for questions. At the request of the company, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. If you have additional questions, we ask that you please fall back in the queue. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ricky Goldwasser, Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : Hey, Ricky. Ricky Goldwasser : Yeah. Hi. Good morning. M&A, obviously, is an important component of your guidance. And when we think about the transactions that you announced recently. It seems the pace has slowed down in the last 12 months. What are you seeing in the environment that you think is driving the relative slowdown? Is it that you're seeing less in the pipeline? Or are the labs waiting to see what PAMA results is? Or is it more on your end?And then, one follow-up to that is, just, given the headwinds that you're going to see this year around reimbursement wage pressure in the additional investments, should we still assume that the cost cutting the integrate program would drive a net benefit to the top line \u2013 to the bottom line. Steve Rusckowski : Yeah. So thanks, Ricky, for the question. So to remind everyone, we have a long-term goal of having 1% to 2% of growth through acquisitions as part of our five strategies to accelerate growth. What we have shared is that we made good progress against that over the last several years. And because of the three elements that we see at play in our marketplace, we do believe that it affords us an opportunity to consolidate the market.So last fall, we did increase our expectation and our goal to get to about 2% through acquisitions. And if you look at 2018, we beat that number. If you look at what we just reported for 2019, we're a little light. But if you look at 2018, 2019, we're about that 2% level. And that 2% is a CAGR, because as you know all acquisitions are somewhat lumpy. We're going to have some stronger quarters. We're going to have some weaker quarters in terms of acquisition growth, but we're shooting for that 2%. So what we just announced in the last several weeks we think are good indications that we continue to work on our pipeline. We play -- Blueprint Genetics is a good opportunity to invest in advanced diagnostics that will provide some growth and some capabilities to organizations that we think are helpful to accelerate growth.And then second is what we also announced around Memorial Hermann is a great example of what we have done in the past and we'll continue to do more of. And we're actively engaged with many other integrated delivery systems around that concept. And to remind you it's comprehensive where we're helping them with their hospital laboratory, making them more efficient. In that regard we're helping them with their reference testing for the hospital. And then finally in the Memorial Hermann case we bought their outreach business.And so what we have shared in the past our funnel is strong. But these deals become more complicated. They're big systems. They have many hospitals as many stakeholders. So this is just taking more time. So funnel is good. And we just announced two deals. And so we think we're starting 2020 with a good pop of acquisitions and we're also hopeful there will be more to come throughout the year. So Mark? Mark Guinan : And on your integrate question, Ricky. Thank you. When you think about the pieces that are headwinds and tailwinds, you mentioned the headwinds certainly we've got the pricing pressure we talked about 200 basis points, we've got our typical way to inflation on about $3 billion wage bill and then we said there's incremental pressure on that. And then you've got the investments.So the 3% productivity, we drive in order of magnitude through our invigorate program alone would not be enough to offset all of that and drive bottom line growth. But importantly the other tailwind is organic volume growth and the contribution of other acquisitions between -- besides Blueprint. And so that's really -- it's all fungible. But that's how we're able to grow our bottom line.So invigorate alone about 3% productivity, it take 2% price, it take a couple hundred basis points against our wage bill of $3 billion, it take the advanced diagnostic investments. They're larger than just invigorate. So it's really the organic growth of our business and the contribution of the profitable outreach acquisitions that really help us to grow the bottom line. Ricky Goldwasser : Thank you. Steve Rusckowski : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Your line is open. Mark Guinan : Good morning, Kevin. Adam Noble : This is actually Adam Noble in for Kevin. Thanks for taking the question. I know it's still pretty early in the year, but could you talk to what type of share gains, volume growth you're seeing from United and some of the other 2019 new access plans year-over-year so far in January? And are you still seeing them outcome the rest of your book? And if yes, do you have any visibility where those share gains are still coming? Steve Rusckowski : Yeah, let me provide a little bit of color then Mark will add to it. So what we shared throughout 2019. Given our volume growth and what we just reported the volume growth we're picking up share. And, yes, we're picking up share from United as we had expected. And then second we'll we pick up share for United, we believe we're actually picking up share from other payers and other portions of the business.We also have managed our Aetna relationship quite well. It continues to be a strong partner of ours with them letting back into the network of one of our competitors -- as well. So we feel good about the progress made in 2019. And what I say it was implied in our guidance for 2020 is a continuation of that market share gain program and our acceleration of growth strategy. As we said back in Investor Day 2018, we believe that the new access changes that we now have afford us about $1 billion worth of opportunity.We have a good start on that in 2019. And clearly we have more opportunity in 2020 and beyond. Incumbent at all that assumes that we're going to pick up share. And as I said, there's a lot of aspects of that and we're just getting started with \u2013 for a lab network for United. And so therefore finding our guidance is picking up share again and some of that will come from the United. Mark? Mark Guinan : Yes. So when you look at our performance last year, we would say that the typical non-network access piece was probably similar to our historic and historically over the last couple of years or get roughly 50 to 100 basis points of growth. And so the growth beyond that you can pretty much attribute to network access.And I want to remind is that it's not just United we also got into Horizon Blue Cross in New Jersey. We got into a portion of Anthem in Georgia. And as Steve mentioned, while the United and the other two plans access increased helped those, specifically it also helped us grow and other payers as well.So we are definitely growing share and that share is coming from multiple competitors not just our chief competitor. The other thing I'd say, you asked about January, well we're not going to comment on January, specifically obviously. we're almost 112 of the way through 2020. And if we were in any way concerned about that progress we certainly would have built that into our guidance. So we're considering January performance thus far as we communicate guidance today. Adam Noble : Got you. And if I could just sneak in one more. Is there anything you could share at this point with regards to the assay vendor consolidation any timing of that? And it would just be super helpful. Steve Rusckowski : Yes, sure. We actually did a very thorough job of evaluating all the different alternatives. We have selected a vendor for that. And we've started the deployment of the systems that we have to deploy to allow us to achieve that eventual $35 million in savings. And so we've started to deploy those as some of our larger facilities. Adam Noble : Got you. Thanks for the questions. Steve Rusckowski : Thank you. Mark Guinan : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Lisa Gill : Hi, thanks very much. Steve Rusckowski : Hey, Lisa, good morning. Lisa Gill : Good morning. I just wanted to follow back up on the comments around continued reimbursement headwinds. I know when I saw you a couple of weeks ago in San Francisco, you did talk about pressure on the commercial market as we think about that? And Mark, I think you talked about continued reimbursement headwind when being roughly $0.15. Can you maybe just give us a little bit more color around where you're seeing that from a commercial market perspective? And then I just wanted also just an update on how you're thinking about your retail strategy? Steve Rusckowski : Mark do you... Mark Guinan : Yes. So Lisa, I don't recall $0.15. I don't think that's something that would represent the reimbursement pressure. So when you're looking at non-PAMA related headwinds. As we've shared over the last 18 months or so, a lot of that is not coming from third-party, the traditional payer reimbursement but it's increasingly coming from the portion of our business that is direct to client bill. And the largest piece of that is hospitals, it's the high end testing we do what we typically refer to as reference work. And we've described how when you think of the set of criteria that a hospital like basis decision in terms of relationship, test, menu, quality, history and price there's been more of a shift to price over the last several years. And we're speculating a lot of that is driven by some of the pressure they're under.So, whereas, in the past you might extend the contract with the understanding that you had a good reasonable price and they had good quality and all those kind of things. More and more of these are going to RFP where there's an opportunity for price competitors to come in and compete on price very highly. So that's one of the dynamics that have definitely increased is the hospital-based client build.The other one we've talked about is in several states where there are no any markup laws. Physicians can actually send work to us. And build a third-party themselves. And you basically mark up the work that we do. And that is a direct build this an office that we compete. And you can imagine that if there's profit mode for those customers. Any nickel they can say from any lab is something that's attractive to them.So that is definitely a source of a lot of our pricing headwinds. And then there is a small piece in third-party payer as well as some older contracts are getting renegotiated and getting more in line with the current pricing environment. Lisa Gill : That\u2019s helpful. Steve Rusckowski : Yeah, on the retail strategy, it goes back to as I outlined our five strategies to accelerate growth. And it's all part of our consumer strategy and the consumer strategy is those multiple strategies. And one piece of it is, we want to have better physical presence. And so we've been working on getting better physical presence for a number of years.To remind everyone we have about 2,100 patient service centers. We have over 4,000 lobotomists and physicians' offices, so in excess of 6,000 access clients. And with those patient service centers what we started on this strategy, we had about 20% and we're retail like settings, more strip walls convenient locations, not in medical office parts. And our goal is to get to 50%. So we want to have 50% of our centers in more retail like settings. And so to help us with that, we actually have formed some partnerships with Safeway, relationship has gone well. We're in about 150 stores. We then added to that our joint venture with Walmart. We continue to make progress there with their patient service centers. You also might see that Walmart is making some other loans in health care. We're engaged with them on that.And then finally as we continue to talk to you and have relationships with other retail like partners in health care as they continue to advance their strategies as well. So you're building at 20%. We're about 30% now with retail like settings. We've got more work to do to get the 50% but that's our goal.We believe it's important that we have more retail like settings, because as I said in my introductory remarks, this market is getting more and more consumer oriented every day. We believe that the consumer will look at the value proposition we'll look at the triple aim. So I remind you it's great health care, it's great experience at great pricing, and we think our strategy delivering really points us to the right direction.The physical presence and the convenience of walking into a Quest diagnostic facility, we think, is part of that. So progress made, but more work to do and we're really fortunate to have some of the partners we have and we think we're on the path of getting to that 50%. Lisa Gill : Great. Thank you. Steve Rusckowski : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Derik de Bruin of Bank of America. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is Ivy [ph] on for Derik today. Thank you for taking my question. Steve Rusckowski : Hi. Good morning. Mark Guinan : Good morning. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning. I appreciate the color on the guide so far. While you talk about the incremental headwinds on the weight fill from the labor cost, can you help us size the pressure on margin from that labor cost? Thank you. Steve Rusckowski : Yes. To give a little bit of color, operational mark, we view some of the -- than what's implied within our guidance within reason. First of all, it's a very strong labor market and separate our exempt workforce, our professional workforce from non-exempt.Our non-exempt workforce is where we feel the pressure. Non-exempt workforce, there's various areas of our value chain. We have about 12,000 lobotomist. We have over 3,500 couriers running our logistics operations in automobiles. We have thousands of what we call specimen processors. And so, if you look at the front end of our value chain, that's where we see some pressure.So what we're finding and it's all very local, is that we have pressure in some of those geographies to up our wages more than we have historically, because we have to be competitive with other competitors, if you will, for those resources. So that's putting pressure on our wage bill. So, Mark, do you want to give a perspective on what that means in terms of scale? Mark Guinan : Yes. So we're not going to size it specifically. But as Steve mentioned, this competition for those areas doesn't just come from the lab industry or specifically for healthcare. Obviously, with lobotomist, it's healthcare. But when you think about couriers, people drive vehicles are desired by multiple industries.And then, the same thing for the specimen processing, which generally is, I don't like the term, but unskilled labor. And so, there's many, many other industries as well that might be a target for that labor. And so, we are not really responding. I'll answer a question that you didn't ask, but might be in people's mind to increases in minimum wage.We don't generally have people at minimum wage. It's really more responding to market forces in the specific markets where we were finding higher levels of attrition and finding it harder to attract the talent that they need. So, really, as we look at this in the near term, it's an increase to our annual wage inflation. But in the longer run we see the value coming back in lower turnover and higher quality employees. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. That's helpful. And then just on the $0.15 dilutive from the investments in advanced diagnostics, can you help us unpack that impact? And then, just a bit more details on how to think about the margin trends for FY 2020 and beyond? Thank you. Steve Rusckowski : If I heard the question correctly, you're asking for some color around Blueprint Genetics of the $0.15. And just provide a little bit of strategic logic and operation and how this will work? So, again, we're investing in advanced diagnostics. We have shared that we want to continue to accelerate it.We just reported that if you look at our genetic and esoteric testing was up by about 5% last year. We continue to invest in that in a number of areas. And, specifically, we believe the acquisition of Blueprint Genetics bring some nice capabilities and a proven commercial organization into Quest. It brings us some nice capabilities atypically related to the variant interpretation that I talked about in my remarks. And then also specifically applying that to some of the specialty categories. They have over 200 panel tests today.And so, if you look at their coverage, okay and their depth of interrogation of the data. It provides us a nice capability to leverage what they've already done but also bring to that where we want to do more, typically around rare diseases where we like and interrogate the data to find the insight. So we're really encouraged about the capability we're just onboard. And Mark? We talked about the impact on our earnings in 2020. Want to provide some color to it? Mark Guinan : Yes, sure. So I would differentiate these investments from the wage inflation and arguably the wage inflation has increased in our long-term cost structure all other things equal. And the reason we call these out is because we don't expect these to be long-term dilutive, certainly Blueprint not only will turn from being dilutive to accretive over a period of time but as Steve mentioned, the capabilities that it brings to us to actually create value in other areas including being more competitive winning more business but also reducing the cost structure and other work that we do in this space.The work we're doing on liquid biopsy is something that will come to a point within the next couple of years. And so either we will stop investing or hopefully self investing and be successful. So it will no longer be a drag on our earnings. And then certainly the work we're doing around low-cost sequencing is also a short-term investment and we're highly confident that that will be successful and certainly will no longer be a drag on our earnings. So these are really temporal investments, that doesn't mean that there won't be other things that we invest in in a couple of years. But these specific investments will be fairly short term. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : Good morning, Erin. Erin Wright : Hi, good morning. Are the preferred lab networks at this point really helping to steer volume? Can you describe some of the efforts that UNH is implementing to incentivize physicians and patients to actually use the lower cost preferred providers here under the PLN? And then my second part of the question would be, can you elaborate on your lab stewardship program and how that's helping to position yourself as a strategic partner with the hospital labs? And can you give us some metrics maybe how that traction is going with that program? Thanks. Steve Rusckowski : Yes. So Preferred Lab Network, we've said in the past it really got started in the fall where UnitedHealthcare where their fully insured books starting to pull some of the principles of deferred network. And then beyond that it's really just getting started in 2020. And we're optimistic that that will provide us again to gain share. So Mark specifically to... Mark Guinan : Yes I'd say thus far what's publicly shared by United and we've talked about is they're starting last August. They're really focusing on how to network usage. And they've done a number of things to try to reduce that including sharing that information with members of the PLN, where we can go out and target some of those accounts and explain to the physician why there's a benefit in steering that to a preferred lab member including importantly the quality and other things that really limited the number of people that were included in the preferred lab network.But they're also doing some other things with the physician directly that you probably should ask United about as they've shared with us that they're giving incentives for them to above and beyond what we might do when we go and call on them and explain why it's in the patient's best interest, we're also doing some things to make in the physician's best interest to move away from using out-of-network providers. And there's a fair amount of out-of-network amongst all of the major payers that is a source of higher cost and quite often not the quality that you'll find in the members of the PLN.In terms of the PLN itself as we shared there were a couple of states that were rolled out in their fully insured book. Beginning in January they're small accounts, they expanded more broadly. And in the middle of the year there's going to be pretty much a full rollout including their larger members and they're fully insured book throughout that time they still have to sell the members where ultimately even though it's fully insured over time have to agree because it could have implications for premiums and so on all of that takes time.And then there's the sponsored plans, which is the next step. So this is a long-term initiative that certainly is reaping some benefit. But it's not in terms of the step change where this is going to overnight move on dramatically. And that's why we talked about multiyear tailwind for a lot of the efforts because some of this is going to take some time. So all in the right direction, but something that is going to take a while to get to where its ultimate level would be. Steve Rusckowski : So Erin you asked about the lab stewardship program. And let me bring it back to, again we're actively working our strategy to build relationships with health systems, hospital health systems. We've been actively working on this for a number of years. And when we go into a health system and it is at the C-suite. We talked about our ability to help them meet their hospital more efficient and effective in diagnostics.And then secondly, as part of that the sophisticated testing that is sending out, we could do more for them and we can do a better job of how we manage that.And then thirdly, when we always get into those conversations, we then now with PAMA. And with the pressure for commercial sales, we have conversations around their outreach business. Does that continue to make sense for them to have it? In the case of more there was an example where again a hospital services business. So as we get in there it's all about building a relationship. We help them manage their diagnostics.And our last stewardship program is being deployed through many of our good accounts, it's going quite well. And this is all about getting smarter about diagnostics. And it goes back to the notion of a triple lane, it's about better health care, it's about better experience that's at lower cost. And what we're finding is as you get more analytics like everything, what you find out is there's over utilization and we need to get rid of that to make them more efficient. But what we're also finding is there's under utilization. And so we become more of a consultative adviser in terms of diagnostics. And one thing that we like to talk about is there's nothing more expensive than a bio-diagnosis for a hospital setting.And so with their last stewardship program and where the relationships, we're working proactively with our partners to be able to deliver a better answer for the specialist. And again Memorial Hermann is a great recent example of the listening to our story, understanding what we're going to do for them and now we have a new partner in one of the largest cities in the United States. So we're really encouraged about the progress we've made over the number of years in the prospects in front of us. Mark Guinan : Operator next question? Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Quirk with Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Mark Guinan : Hi, Bill. Bill Quirk : Hi. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I guess Steve Rusckowski : Good morning. Bill Quirk : I guess, a multipart question here, Steve. So first, we appreciate that there's considerable pullback by some providers, concerning the executive order around hospital pricing transparency. However, since this does include diagnostics, should we be thinking about this as a potential added risk from a long-term reimbursement standpoint? And then also, and separately, given the interest in the preferred lab networks by a number of payers, not just United, should we expect additional announcements in 2-20 concerning some of the new formation of these? Thanks, guys. Steve Rusckowski : Yes. So, thanks, Bill. The first part of your question has to do with transparency and surprise bills and pushback from providers, about that, and its complex, as you know. But going back to my prepared remarks, we believe, if you just look at the value proposition we bring into marketplace, we'd like to get more and more exposure to the prices that are out there for us.Because as I said, with the full confidence, we believe, we're the best deal in town. And so, making sure consumers see that, making sure physicians see that, making sure that plans are working with us to move more of their laboratory services to a great value provider like Quest Diagnostics is what the strategy is all about.And so, the more visibility of that is a good thing for us. And we're doing this with the plans and the preferred lab network is part of that. We're also doing this with employers with the plans, because as those employers look at their employee cost of healthcare, they're looking at what they can do to help their employees out and we believe our category is a good example of where they can do that. But if they do it for us, they could do it also with other healthcare services like radiology and physical therapy. So, we think it's a good opportunity for us.And then, finally, you asked the question about preferred lab network. We continue to work with other partners. We have the nationals, but we also have a number of regionals. And as you know, we enjoy a large presence in Florida. If you look at Florida Blue Cross Blue Shield, even though they haven't announced a preferred lab network, we are very strong in Florida and we have a great relationship with them.So in essence, you could say they are our preferred labs, even though we haven't announced it. So as we work through where we go with this long-term, you'll see what others are willing to provide publicly. But this will continue to be a trend that we'll keep on working. Mark? Mark Guinan : And when you think about the preferred lab network, whether or not another major payer is very overt in announcing a preferred lab network or not, you will see. But some of the elements within the preferred lab network, we already had for some payers before our relationship with United. And some of them have actually expanded some of those.So when you touch on what are some of the advantages of the preferred lab network, one of them is, when I described the out-of-network usage and having the payer actually partner with us to educate physicians around the cost of prescribing high -- the high price out-of-network labs and how that impacts our patients with deductibles and how it could impact denials and so on and so forth. So we're doing that with a number of payers.There's also a plan, a very large managed Medicaid plan that had put in some pre-authorization requirements for certain test categories, where they were concerned about the size of the panels and the appropriate clinical appropriateness of some of the offerings. And because we -- and then, some others, it's not us alone, do it appropriately, they've actually created, in essence, what they call a gold card, which means that we're exempt from that pre-authorization.So not only does that avoid a headwind for us, so that\u2019s the second thing, is it makes it easier for physicians to order from us. They don't have to go through perhaps. So actually in essence it should steer more work to us. And then finally another one I'd comment is in the past as we described it what we do outreach acquisitions. It was a huge windfall for everybody. Other than us, certainly we would still get great economic benefit as I've laid out in the past at Investor Day is about how they're very, very accretive despite the pricing dissynergies.And so what we've partnered with a number of payers on is that actually we share in some of that price savings initially. So it's not all a windfall for the payers and others. But actually some of that value comes to us. So a less severe pricing dissynergy headwind for the first couple of years.So that's just a couple of examples that you may not hear a very, very over an announcement about a preferred lab network and where the payers are partnering with us in the areas that they know we bring critical value to really drive more volume towards us. Steve Rusckowski : Operator, next question? Operator : Our next question comes from Donald Hooker of KeyBanc. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : How are you, Donald? Donald Hooker : Great. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Steve Rusckowski : Good morning. Mark Guinan : Good morning. Donald Hooker : Yes. So on the heels of this sizable Memorial Hermann PLS deal. I just was hoping to maybe get a sense kind of maybe looking back and looking forward of kind of the momentum you're seeing in the PLS business? I think a couple of years ago, you loosely sized it for the investor community saying it would be maybe 50 basis points of top line growth that might be just question I'm wrong but that was a couple of years ago. Maybe can you update kind of what your thinking there and the current conditions? Steve Rusckowski : Yes, yes. So, thank you for the question. And our professional lab services business is something we've built over time. We've got a nice referenceable book of business and clients that we continue to build on. We actually did say in our prepared remarks that we announced another relationship in Tennessee.Memorial Hermann is yet another example. And what I'll share with you \u2013 you'll hear more about more professional and lab services business going forward. In our 2019 results we did have some growth from it. I'll Mark comment on the specifics around that.But we believe it's an important element of again walking in and having an engaged conversation with good delivery systems around their lab strategy. And helping them make their hospital laboratory better, more efficient and more effective as an important part of that. And so now we have a proven trucker being able to do it. We have augmented that with their lab stewardship program and then we also have logged with that with our clear ability to be able to acquire outreach businesses. It will provide more of the sophisticated testing, particularly around advanced diagnostics. So it's moving along nicely and it's becoming a real stand for us and delivering the growth that we expected. Mark? Mark Guinan : And I think the 50 basis points is plus or minus a reasonable number. Certainly as we look at the last couple of years the contribution that could accelerate because we do do some PLS deals, as we mentioned this morning state of Tennessee that are just PLS deals stand-alone. But then as part of what we really still believe will be increased indices broad deals with hospital partners around selling the outreach around getting that reference work and doing the PLS deal, especially if some of these are larger systems.And we have a very deep pipeline. PLS contribution could grow to be larger than that. Certainly we'll talk about that as we see that happening. So yes, the 50 basis points is reasonable, very happy with it and that's something that we're hoping and certainly could see accelerating down the road. Steve Rusckowski : Yes the interesting thing too that we mentioned in the press release for Memorial Hermann, but many of these systems also have their own plans -- their own health plan. So what we're finding is kind of a secondary benefit has become their preferred or their exclusive provider laboratory service within their plans, and Memorial Hermann is a good example of that. So it's an added benefit of having these relationships. Shawn Bevec : Operator, next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Larew with William Blair. Your line is open. Mark Guinan : Hi, Matt. Matt Larew : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask on the retail side. As that footprint continues to grow, could you characterize with that volume in terms of just site shift versus incremental market share shift as you alluded to on the network access side?And then in the past you've described potential opportunities to expand the relationships with some of those retail providers in terms of the services that you're involved in any progress that you anticipate there? Steve Rusckowski : Yeah absolutely. So first of all if you think about our value chain. We actually do the draws for about 40% of our volume, okay? That's not through our true bottoms that are even each in service centers or in physician offices. That trend is actually moving more to our site. So we're doing more and more to us. It's a small gradual shift to us, which says 60% is still provided by physicians or our clients and hospitals. So think about the our front end if you will of the value chain that way.What we believe is if we have a better experience and in better locations, we're going to be able to get share. And so we believe that we're we are growing the front end that we deliver ourselves faster than our overall growth because of this shift in the marketplace and also the experience being good as well.And as far as other relationships all -- this is a health care service providers are looking at their strategy. We mentioned Walmart earlier, they're a big player in health care. They're getting bigger with the opening of some clinics. We have great partnership with Aetna, and onwards with CVS, CVS Health is building up pumps, which is an extension of what they've done with their MinuteClinic. We were a partner of theirs with MinuteClinic.And as that strategy evolves we'll have a presence with them and others as we go forward. So -- and also we will continue to organically to do some of the retailization if you will of our fleet of patient service centers, because we do see opportunities within local druggists to do some of it ourselves. So it is a multiyear strategy that we keep on making progress against and partnerships continue to be an important part of it. Shawn Bevec : Operator, next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Your line is open. Brian Tanquilut : Hey good morning, guys. Yeah, so my question is on Memorial Hermann. So do you think that with this it's one of the largest hospital systems out there? Do you think this is finally the proof that outside of UMASS you're starting to get traction on the hospital side?And then I guess if you guys don't mind just giving us kind of a view on what the tail benefit is from these comprehensive PLS deals where you're buying the outreach, you're getting the reference and basically the whole lab business for the whole hospital system? Steve Rusckowski : Yeah. So first of all as we said, I think we have a lot more interest today than we did two or three years ago with integrated delivery systems. But what we just announced with Memorial Hermann is complex and so these deals just take a longer period of time.We do already have over the years a number of significant systems. If you remember when we bought the outreach business from Dignity, which is a major player on the West Coast. PeaceHealth is another example. I'll remind you we have a long-standing relationship with UPMC in Pittsburgh. We have a long-standing relationship with INTEGRIS in Oklahoma City.So we have a long history of working actively with these great delivery systems long before the deal before -- with UMass. And I would argue this is a good example of a large system in a large city coming in our direction. And a good proof point that there will be more like this to come.And the reason why Memorial Hermann chose us is because we have this proven history of being able to pull it off. We can help them with their hospital. We can help them with the reference work, we can buy their outreach business. We can integrate it. We could tie in to their physicians, we can help them with their health plan. So we have a long-standing history and credibility with a referenceable book of clients that serves us well.Because laboratory testing is an essential part of running an integrated delivery system, it's 2% of costs, 70% healthcare decision-making. It's critical that we're working with a partner, they get it right. So, Brian, I think, we do continue to see this as a good indication that there will be more to come. And this is a major system that we're happy to be able to announce. Shawn Bevec : Operator, next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Your line is open. Ralph Giacobbe : Thanks. Steve Rusckowski : Hi, Ralph. Ralph Giacobbe : Good morning Mark Guinan : Hi, Ralph. Ralph Giacobbe : Just, I was hoping you can give a little bit more on sort of the underlying volume and pricing mix assumptions just embedded in guidance? And then, secondly, just quickly, I wanted to clarify the wage pressure comment. I though, Mark, I heard you say a couple of hundred basis points higher, just want to make sure I heard that right? Thanks. Mark Guinan : Yeah. So let me address the wage piece and then I'll turn it back to Steve on the volume of the guidance. So no, a couple of hundred basis points of the total wage pressure. So what we're saying is that, historically, it was at a given level. And we were pretty consistent with how we did our annual merit increases. And then, this year we're funding more increases. So, in total, it's several hundred basis points. Steve Rusckowski : Yeah. And so, if you look at our initial guidance of 1 to 3, contemplated in 1 to 3 growth are the acquisitions that we've talked about, which we historically have done, which says that there's organic growth in there. We've also said that we have less reimbursement pressure in 2020 than we had in 2019. We've sized that to be about 200 basis points of an idea of the scale. That helps us some. Okay?We then have these new deals that we just talked about, they're going to provide PLS. As we said, they're going to start to ramp particularly in the second quarter. So that will help us with some of the growth. And so, therefore, when you go through all the math, we have to have volume growth. And we have to pick up share and that's implied in our guidance.So entirely consistent. Okay? What we've told to you before, is that 2019 was a good start. But it doesn't start with 2019. We're going to continue to build on that momentum. And we will continue to see access improvement of gains and share with the preferred lab network, with the other payers that we brought into it, our full last year and that implied in our guidance as grow through acquisition. And growth through market share gains related to work with the payers and other parts of our strategy. Shawn Bevec : Operator, next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Newshel with Evercore. Your line is open. Mike Newshel : Thanks. Can you just comment on seasonality for 2020? We obviously have the extra day from leap year in the first quarter, but are there any other calendar effects or comp issues just to call out? Mark Guinan : Yes. I mean, it gets a little bit complicated. So there's an extra calendar day in Q1. But it's actually not really a full day because of the data we could it is. So it gets a little bit complicated. So there's \u2013 in the year there's definitely an extra day. There's a chunk of that in the first quarter. If you recall in 2019 we called out an extra day in Q3. So you should think about that when you size Q3 because that will not repeat the way the calendar is falling.And then there's the typical seasonality around some of the floating holidays. And then the last thing I'd point out is that some of the fixed holidays in terms of the day of the week matters. So when you look at where things like the 4th of July and Christmas and New Year's fall, there can be a difference, the worst being if those are a Tuesday, Wednesday and the best thing if those are weekends. So I'd point to those being some of the things. But you \u2013 I'm sure you can imagine that within a 200 basis point range of revenue guidance we've contemplated all the scenarios that might play out there. Steve Rusckowski : Operator, next question? Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Stephen Baxter : Hi, thanks for the question. So obviously a lot of moving parts in the guidance today including the investments you're making. I was hoping you could help us understand a little bit more explicitly what the guidance is embedded from an op margin perspective? If I looked at this year and took out the United out of network impact, I would have seen margins I think roughly stable year-over-year. So do you think that's achievable again as we go into 2020? And if you can add on any expectations for below the line items, the interest expense, tax rate anything we should be considering there that would be different than 2019 in our models? Thank you. Mark Guinan : So let me address the latter. Interest expense and tax rate will be pretty consistent. The other area where we've had a number of people ask questions recently as equity earnings. And that growth has been certainly largely driven by our JV with IQVIA our Q Square JV that we set up several years ago that have been continuing to drive earnings growth.One of the investments that we called out our liquid biopsy investment actually comes to us through an investments that we have with a third party. And the accounting rules dictate that we have to take our share of those losses and even months an investment in this company. That will be in the equity earnings line so that will dampen somewhat the equity earnings growth but it's all again in that $0.15 that I called out earlier. So I'll turn it back to Steve for the other part of your question margins. Steve Rusckowski : Yes, margins, we've been consistent where we haven't guided around margins because we have a mix of businesses. We're driving growth and we're driving a return on invested capital. And we had provided outlook around growth and earnings per share. We think that's the best way for us to drive shareholder value. So we're not going to really comment on what the margins will be year-on-year. But we go through the math, you can get it from private markets could be based upon the top line growth and what we have guided as far as our EPS growth. Mark Guinan : And the other thing is that margins are not given. So if we're at the low end of that revenue guidance versus the high end, it will have the impact on margins because as we've shared previously that organic revenue growth comes through a higher drop-through than our fully loaded margin. And we're depending on that as I shared with Ricky with her initial question. Our invigorate program alone can offset in a large proportion of the headwinds. But really the bottom line growth and the margin -- any margin expansion will come through that organic revenue growth. Shawn Bevec : Operator, next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is open. Jack Meehan : Thank you. Good morning. Mark Guinan : Good morning, Jack. Jack Meehan : Hi. One clarification and one strategic question. Clarification on the fourth quarter, I was curious if you could weigh in on how much you might have contributed? I know that Hooper Holmes acquisition last year had a little bit of that?And then strategically just given the dilution associated with the Blueprint acquisition that's, obviously, unusual in terms of the framework of deals that Quest has done in the past. I'm curious if you could just weigh in just the appetite for deals like that versus -- I guess what we're accustomed to in terms of tuck-ins on the outreach side? Mark Guinan : Yeah, the Blue was a small competitor. As we've shared in the past in this point of care, we certainly get some flu testing when the flu season spike. So yeah it was a little bit of tailwind, but not anything notable.In terms of our strategy, I want to ask Steve\u2026 Steve Rusckowski : So Jack we're always looking at aligning our adjustments around our strategy and having a balanced approach. And related to acquisitions we shared, typically what you're seeing for us is acquisitions falling in one of three categories. One is regional laboratories. We've talked about Boston Clinical Labs that\u2019s a small regional laboratory we just acquired. We did one in Missouri last year. So we'll continue to pursue those.Second hospital outreach business is Memorial Hermann is a good example of that. We like those deals are accretive to our earnings. They provide real growth. We really like the stickiness if you will of the customer relationships we take on board and it keep capability building. And so Blueprint Genetics is an example of capability building.We thought it would be prudent for us to make an investment there. We think it's very consistent with our strategy. It's modest in size, but it's going to give us a nice capability around bioinformatics, around the variant, interpretation that I spoke to. It'll allow us to achieve that strategy of accelerating growth in advanced diagnostics, which is a category we shared in the past, our definition in genetics and molecular we do over $1 billion. And we believe that that is prospectively a great opportunity for us to continue to invest and that's why we made it.So we will continue down that path of a balanced approach consistent with our strategy with deals that we can make money for shareholders and trust that will make any deal including the ones we just announced, we have a path to value creation for our shareholders. Mark Guinan : And just one final comment. I mean typically Jack with our acquisitions the value creation has to come directly from the book of business we're buying. And while certainly the book of business we're buying from Blueprint will become better from a profitability standpoint. Really the value creation goes well beyond that book. And as we've mentioned earlier capabilities it brings will benefit everything we do in that space. And so the capability, a description that Steve gives really means that it's going to create better margins and better competitiveness in space outside the specific test menu and book of business that we're acquiring. Jack Meehan : Thank you. Shawn Bevec : Operator, last question. Operator : Yes, our last question comes from Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities. Your line is open. Mark Guinan : Hi, Ann. Good morning. Ann Hynes : Hi, good morning. So, I just want to ask about cash flow beyond 2020? I know your CapEx is a little higher, just because of the new facility, should we assume that CapEx run rate goes down after 2020? Steve Rusckowski : Typically, I don't give any kind of guidance beyond the current year, Ann. But what I will say is that, this is the largest year for Clifton, 2020, we're expecting to be operational in 2021. The Clifton facility has been the driver certainly this year, last year and even back into 2018 and the increase in our relative level of capital spending. We haven't announced any similar plans like that. So you might infer from that that capital spending might come down a little beyond 2020. Ann Hynes : Have you disclosed how much you've been investing in CapEx for Clifton? Steve Rusckowski : We haven't by year, what we have disclosed that it was about $0.25 billion investment over three years. Ann Hynes : Okay. Mark Guinan : You might have seen as well that we recorded a gain on the property sale with self focus\u2026 Steve Rusckowski : Yes. So we sold our Teterboro property and we're going to lease back right now until we exited and moved to Clifton and that was a big contributor to the year-over-year GAAP earnings gain. We adjusted that out of our adjusted income, but it was a nice cash inflow.And as you know, Ann, that goes into financing, not into operating cash flow. And actually the tax on the gain actually goes against operating cash flow in 2020. So from an accounting perspective, it's a little bit disconnected. But we actually got quite a bit of cash from the sale of Teterboro at the end of fourth quarter of 2019. Mark Guinan : Yes. So when we built the business case on Clifton investment, we assumed a certain sell price for the Teterboro facility. We really exceeded that expectation. So we feel good about the business case and what we're putting our capital budget against. Ann Hynes : All right. Great. Thank you. Mark Guinan : Thanks, Ann. Steve Rusckowski : Sure. So thank you very much. Appreciate your engagement. We appreciate your support and look forward to seeing you in our travels. Have a great day.

Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited.I would now like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead please. Shawn Bevec : Thank you and good morning. I'm on the line with Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer.During this call we may make forward-looking statements and we'll discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization expense. References to adjusted operating income for all periods excludes amortization expense. Finally, growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings growth are compound annual growth rates.Now, here is Steve Rusckowski. Steve Rusckowski : Thanks, Shawn, and thanks everyone for joining us today. We are definitely living in extraordinary times. The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way we all live, work and engage with one another. While the crisis will likely continue to impact our lives in the weeks and months ahead, one thing we can be highly certain of -- we will get through this.So this morning, I will discuss our performance before the crisis hit, the impact the crisis has had in our role in it, and the actions we are taking to mitigate the impact going forward. And then Mark will provide more detail on the first quarter results and our financial position.Our financial performance in the first quarter was off to a strong start in January and February. Through February year-to-date, total revenues grew more than 4%. Total revenues grew more than 6%. Even after adjusting for the calendar benefit and favorable weather in the first two months of the year, organic volume grew more than 4%.However, in March, social distancing and shelter-in-place measures were instituted to combat the spread of COVID-19 and we began to see substantial declines in our business. In the last two weeks of the quarter, we experienced a reduction of volumes in excess of 40%.We saw the impact across all metropolitan markets, not just in hot spots like New York City. In April, volume declines continue to intensify as we are seeing signs that volume declines are bottoming out at around 50% to 60%. As you know, Quest Diagnostics has played a pivotal role in bringing COVID-19 testing capacity to the nation.Since we launched COVID-19 testing with a molecular laboratory developed tests, performed at our Advanced Diagnostic Laboratory at San Juan Capistrano, California. We have performed and reported results of nearly 1 million test to providers and patients across the United States. This is approximately a quarter of all testing done in the United States.We continue to provide testing for -- from 12 laboratories. Through these laboratories who are now able to perform more than 50,000 COVID-19 tests per day. We've also limited our backlog with a current turnaround time of one to two days and less than one day for priority hospital patients.We\u2019ve maximized our output by effectively managing the global supply chain. This has enabled us to have sufficient supplies to collect specimens for patients, runner test and also protect our employees. This has been a team effort that requires a great deal of collaboration.Since early March, we've been in regular contact with the federal government and state and local governments. And this has happened at all levels. We're working closely together with our payers, IVD manufacturers, retailers and our trade associations to bring as much testing capacity as possible to the American people.We've also joined forces with Walmart to make our drive through testing sites available to anyone who may be exhibiting symptoms of the virus, as well as all health care workers and first responders, whether or not they're exhibiting symptoms. We're currently operating in approximately 10 sites in 5 states and have line of sight to approximately 20 locations by the end of the month. There are no out-of-pocket costs for testing at these sites.We're also supporting state and local government COVID-19 testing efforts across the country. Finally, we are pleased to see CMS decide to increase the reimbursement for high throughput molecular COVID-19 testing to $100 last week. This is a strong recognition of the vital role laboratories are playing to support the nation's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and we hope to see other payors follow CMS's lead.As we look to the next phase of managing the virus, we've begun to perform antibody testing, which could be useful in improving our understanding of infection rates in a certain area, as well as providing a likely indication of immunity for an individual.Antibody testing, also known as serology testing is a blood based test. We're moving from a testing pilot in which we initially supported a handful of hospitals and health systems to making the test available to all of our customers nationwide using a variety of test platforms.By mid-May, we anticipate having the capacity to perform over 200,000 antibody tests per day. I'm very proud of how our Quest colleagues have stepped up in so many ways. There are so many heroes at Quest from our scientific and medical staffs who have quickly brought up and validated new tests, through our operations teams, to our procurement teams, to our front line phlebotomists, couriers, pilots and specimen processors. And we've taken extra precautions to protect our employees with mandatory temperature checks at our labs and require use of protective equipment such as gloves, lab coats, masks, face shields, all this very depended on circumstances.Our employees take pride in their work because so many Americans depend on the insights of our testing delivers to make decisions to improve care. These efforts for all of us are inspiring. COVID-19 testing is critical to managing the pandemic. And while the volume of testing is substantial, it is that nearly enough to offset the reductions we're seeing in the rest of our business.During this difficult time, we're managing the business for the realities of today and to assure its long-term health. While we cannot say with precision. What the overall impact the COVID-19 pandemic will have in our business, we do know it will have significant impact in our [technical difficulty]. We are taking actions to mitigate that impact.At the end of March, we withdrew our full-year 2020 outlook because we no longer had confidence in the outlook we provided in January. And we have taken a series of temporary actions to manage our workforce costs and conserve cash, to support the business and to navigate our way through the pandemic.This started with a 25% pay cut for me and reductions for salaried employees ranging from 20% for the most senior executives to 5% depending on level. Each of the members of our company's Board of Directors will forego 25% of their cash compensation. These pay reductions will be in place for 12 weeks.We've also suspended contributions to our 401(k) and deferred compensation plans through the remainder of the year. We've approved furloughs for more than 5,500 employees, or approximately 12% of our workforce whose work has diminished and also have indicated an interest to us. We've reduced hours for non-exempt employees where possible and as necessary. And then finally we\u2019ve reduced overtime, frozen virtually all hiring and promotions; and dismissed temporary and contract workers.We're taking a balanced approach to implement these difficult measures. We also want to maintain flexibility because we know when the crisis ends, our volumes will begin to recover and we'll need our colleagues more than ever. This is a challenging time for all of us and in response to that we've established an employee relief fund for those colleagues who need assistance. Importantly, none of these changes will impact our ability to deliver critical COVID-19 testing.Now, I'd like to cover a few other topics. The passage of the CARES Act, the M&A environment and some early thoughts on how the lab industry may evolve in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act became law in late March, delivering much needed stimulus the country as we battle this crisis. The stimulus package included a number of benefits request and other health care providers.First, the Act provided coverage for critical COVID-19 testing at no out-of-pocket costs for nearly all patients. Second, regarding PAMA, the CARES Act suspended the PAMA price cuts that had been scheduled for 2021. In addition, the new round of data collection has been delayed another year into the first quarter of 2022 and will continue to use data from the first quarter of 2019. This is important as it allows ample time to implement the recommendations of the MedPAC study to identify a better way to collect the data that reflects private market rates as Congress initially intended.Third, the Act appropriates $100 billion to health care providers for expenses or lost revenues that are attributed to COVID-19. Quest received approximately $65 million from the initial tranche of the $30 billion distributed to providers earlier this month. Finally, Medicare sequestration will be suspended from May to December this year. This 8-month sequestration holiday will afford us a small benefit.Now, turning to the M&A environment, we continue to make progress. We're pleased that we completed the Memorial Hermann transaction as well as its integration phase, and this is an important complex relationship with a very prominent healthcare system.There are other transactions in the pipeline that we were very close to announcing before the crisis. While they are on hold, our strong conviction is that these discussions will resume, which will be in the third quarter and will be a very good position at that point to complete those transactions.And then finally, I'd like to share some thoughts on industry dynamics, post crisis. Given the many challenges that hospitals will face, we expect many to be open to discussions about Quest and how we can help them achieve their lab strategy. At the same time, we know that many smaller regional labs have had their own challenges. This could produce opportunities for tuck-in acquisitions. If any, the crisis could be an additional catalyst to drive the consolidation we've been forecasting for several years.Before I close, I just want to say once again how proud I\u2019m to be part of the Quest team at this historic time. Our employees have stepped up in every way to serve the nation during this time of need. The challenges have brought all of us at Quest closer together, changing the way we work and collaborate, making us stronger as a team. We have become more agile, customer-focused and unified. We will emerge from this crisis stronger with substantial opportunities in front of us.Now, I would like to turn it over to Mark, who will take you through the results as well as our thoughts on our financial position. Mark? Mark Guinan : Thanks, Steve. In the first quarter, consolidated revenues were $1.82 billion, down 3.7% versus the prior year. Revenues for diagnostic information services declined 3.8% compared to the prior year. As Steve noted earlier, our business performance was strong in January and February, but we experienced a substantial decline in volumes in March. Volume measured by the number of requisitions decreased 2.4% versus the prior year. Excluding acquisitions, volumes declined 2.7%.Before describing some of the volume trends we saw in March and early April, I do want to spend a moment on the strong performance of our business prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Through February, year-to-date total revenue growth was just over 4%, with organic revenue growth of just over 3.5%.Total volume growth was strong at 6.3%. Volume through February included a calendar benefit due in part to leap year, as well as mild winter weather. Adjusting for these benefits and the impact of acquisitions, organic volume growth in the first two months of 2020 was nearly 4.5%, indicating that the strong progress you made in 2019 continued into 2020.As we moved into March, we started to see single-digit volume declines through the first two weeks of the month. Stay-at-home measures were implemented in several states by the third week of March, volume declines accelerated to nearly 40%. And by the last week of the month, volume declines across the business started to approach 50%.So far in April, we have indications that volume declines have stabilized in the 50% to 60% range. These declines include the benefit of COVID-19 molecular testing, which has been running at approximately 30,000 tests per day on average or approximately 6% volume growth through April.Revenue per requisition declined 1.2% versus the prior year, primarily driven by higher reimbursement pressure. Unit price headwinds were slightly more than 2% in the first quarter in line with our prior expectations. This includes the impact of PAMA, which amounted to a headwind of approximately 100 basis points.Reported operating income was $175 million or 9.6% of revenues compared to $248 million or 13.2% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $225 million or 12.3% of revenues compared to $286 million or 15.1% of revenues last year. The year-over-year decline in operating margin was entirely due to declining revenue in March as a result of COVID-19.Note that operating margin was up meaningfully year-over-year through February, primarily driven by the strong volume and revenue growth highlighted previously. Reported EPS was $0.73 in the quarter compared to a $1.20 a year-ago. Adjusted EPS was $0.94 compared to $1.40 last year.Cash provided by operations was $247 million in the first quarter versus $275 million last year. I'd like to take a moment to discuss our financial position and our ability to access additional capital. As of March 31, we had $342 million of cash on hand and $1.3 billion of borrowing capacity was available under existing credit facilities. These facilities consist of $529 million available under our secured receivables credit facility and $750 million available under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility. There were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities as of March 31.In April, we borrowed $100 million under our secured receivables credit facility and $100 million under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility. Our secured receivables facility is subject to certain financial covenants with respect to the receivables that comprise the borrowing base and secure the borrowings under the facility.Our unsecured revolving credit facility is also subject to certain financial covenants to limitations on indebtedness. In particular, the unsecured revolving credit facility requires us to maintain a leverage ratio of no more than 3.5x EBITDA as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. As of March 31, we were in compliance with all applicable financial covenants.The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to impact our ability to comply with these covenants, beginning as early as the end of the second quarter. In this scenario, we would not be able to borrow against these credit facilities and then lenders would have the right to demand payment of any amount outstanding.We have been in advanced discussions with our lead lender regarding an amendment to certain financial covenants of our unsecured revolving credit facility. We believe this would provide us with the necessary flexibility to remain in compliance for the remainder of 2020.Based on these discussions and the strong support from our lead lender, we are confident we will be able to enter into this amendment later in the quarter. If, for some reason we are unable to enter into this amendment, we believe that our investment grade credit rating would provide us with access to alternate sources of financing. Finally, as noted in our earnings release this morning, we are also suspending share repurchases through the end of the year under our existing repurchase authorization.To summarize, we believe our financial position and ability to access additional capital is strong and our Board of Directors remain committed to the company's quarterly dividend at this time. As many of you know, we withdrew our 2020 guidance on March 31, given the unprecedented uncertainty caused by COVID-19 pandemic. We expect to provide updated 2020 guidance at a more appropriate time when visibility improves around the impact of COVID-19 and the duration of current stay-at-home measures in place across the United States.While we aren\u2019t providing guidance today, I'd like to share some details for you to consider as you build your models. As many of you know, our business is one of high fixed costs. We have modeled a number of different volume scenarios over the near to medium term and at this point our best estimate is that volumes for the business excluding COVID-19 testing will be down 50% to 60% in the second quarter.Once the COVID-19 crisis mitigates or passes and stay-at-home measures begin to lift, we believe our volume will slowly improve but to a lower level in 2020 than where we started the year. While we have taken several cost reduction steps, which we first shared in an 8-K on April 13, these steps are not sufficient to enable us to generate a profit at this volume assumption. If the conditions affecting lower lab utilization continue throughout the second quarter, it is highly likely we will incur a net loss.Molecular COVID-19 testing does serve as a partial offset to the volume declines we're experiencing across the rest of the business. We expect that demand for molecular COVID-19 testing will remain high throughout the second quarter and likely the foreseeable future. In addition to the uncertainty around health care utilization in lab volume trends, another unknown is the impact of serology testing. We believe there's significant potential in serology testing, but reimbursement and customer demand are still in front of us.I will now turn it back to Steve. Steve? Steve Rusckowski : To summarize, we were very pleased with January and February performance, but saw a material decline in last two weeks of March. We are managing the company for the long-term and are taking a series of actions to protect our financial flexibility.Quest has been at the tip of the spear in responding to the crisis, and we will continue to play a critical role in the next phase of containing COVID-19. While there's uncertainty in the near-term, we look forward to the gradual improving conditions we see in front of us. Eventually, the healthcare system will start to return to normal and when that happens, Quest will emerge from the crisis stronger with significant opportunities in front of us.Now, we'd be happy to take any questions you have. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : Good morning, Ann. Ann Hynes : Good morning. First, I want to commend you and all the Quest employees working through this crisis. It's been nice to see. Steve Rusckowski : Appreciate that. Ann Hynes : But my questions are focused on antibody testing. Steve Rusckowski : Sure. Ann Hynes : I know you said by mid-May your capacity will be about 200,000. What do you think your peak daily capacity could be over time? Because I'm assuming this is a serology test, it could be higher. And then secondly, what do you think the ultimate -- like how should we view this opportunity? Should we assume that everyone in the U.S. will at some point go a serology test, whether it's to get tested for the vaccine or go back-to-school or to go back to work? And maybe what is Quest doing to maybe grab some more of the market share? Are you working with governments, employees, school systems, things like that would be great. Thanks. Steve Rusckowski : Yes. All right, Ann. All right. So all around antibody testing and serology testing. So as you read our press release yesterday, we launched our broad implementation of serology testing. We actually brought up a week or so ago, our first limited LDT laboratory developed tests on the EUROIMMUN platform. And we did that in two of our facilities and we did that for limited customers, hospitals and at risk individuals. So we had some experience with it.And then second, as we brought up our first platform, which is an app platform, and we announced last night, that will -- platform is in many of our sites and we will bring that up quickly. And then we will have a few other platforms we bring up in the course of April into May. And that will allow us to get to that 200,000 tests per day number by mid-May. We've run seven days a week, 24 hours a day. That's about 1.5 million per week. And so you can think about 6 million per month.Now, to answer your questions, we're not stopping there. We've got more capacity in front of us. We are always dependent though on the capacity coming out of the IVD manufacturers with the reagents that we need. So somewhat of the limiting factor has less to do with us where we have lab capacity, but more related to the reagents and the supply chain from our suppliers. So we're working with them as well. So that's what we're willing to say we'll have in the month of May.Now, how broad would this be? What we announced in a press release and you see the guidance from the FDA, while we do believe are several things, one is after a certain number of days and the best indication is after 14 days of being infected, the person can have an IGG response. That's the last antibody. And therefore, it is obviously a good measurement that you have been infected in the past. It's important to those individuals that have not been tested and made it -- might have been asymptomatic. So it's another good indication of infection rate within the geography or within a population. That's number one.Point number two is based upon other viruses. We believe that there may be immunity for some period of time. This is what we need to study. And that's why we have the conditions on our press release that we need to have more evidence and this is why we need to do more of it. The vast majority of viruses in the past have had immunity for a period of time, but we need to confirm this with evidence. So with that said, I would share with you we have tremendous interest in both continuation of the molecular testing that has to be done going forward. And then second is combining it with serology testing. This is happening at the state level for broad infrastructure needs.You might have seen a new announcement by the state of California. They're going to start to test asymptomatic members -- excuse me, citizens within California. Second is employers. We have actually leveraged our capability with our employer population health business, which we used to call our wellness business, where we have this product called Blueprint for Wellness and we work with employers. And we leverage that now in building on those relationships with employers in their return to work programs. And so that's giving us a nice leverage point. And the return to work programs vary by industry. It matters a great deal if you're a manufacturer and you have plants, or if you're an office environment or if you're a food processor, so we have a number of engagements going on with employers. And those employers are working with their states and are working with their cities and towns and local communities, as they think about what needs to happen and within those geographies, because there is wide variation, that's what's happening with the constraints around return to work and shelter-in-place in schools.And then finally, we are working with the states. Many of the states have mounted now task forces to look at what needs to happen next with test -- testing. As I said, California has made now a broader announcement of what they want to do to expand testing. We see this coming from out from a number of states. We're right in the middle of all those conversations. In fact yesterday, I did a press conference with the governor of Connecticut, Governor of Lamont in Connecticut, where we work proactively with one of our partners, Hartford HealthCare and expanding testing in the state of Connecticut.So as Mark said, there's substantial opportunities in front of us both for the molecular testing, which has to be done to rule in, rule out COVID-19. And then you, coupled with the opportunities we see for serology or antibody testing as well for overall surveillance within a population and returning to work. So a good opportunity in front of us. Ann Hynes : All right. Thanks. Steve Rusckowski : Thank you, Ann. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : Hey, Ralph. Ralph Giacobbe : Thanks. Hey, good morning. Thanks for all the detail. So you mentioned the minus 50% to minus 60% volume ex COVID, I guess first just want to clarify that the profit loss commentary is inclusive of COVID-19, so sort of it's an all-in number or is it enough to offset that profitability loss? And then how do you think about decremental margin with that type of revenue decline? If you can give us any sense there that would be helpful as well. Thanks. Steve Rusckowski : Yes, Mark. Mark Guinan : Sure, Steve. So, Ralph, the statement around net loss would be a volume inclusive of COVID testing continue to be down around 50% to 60%. Now, what that does not include is serology. So as I said in my prepared remarks, the -- well, we're encouraged by the potential demand and a lot of the things that Steve just explained are either in mid-term or a late stage conversations around stepping up some testing for government entities, for employers, etcetera. We haven't been performing that test. Obviously, we just launched serology, so we wanted to be cautious about forecasting in any way how meaningful serology would be.But based on all the things we've talked about, it could be significant. We also don't know the reimbursement rate yet, but hopefully fairly soon. And I think the trigger for commercial rates will largely be based on where CMS comes out. So we're all waiting on that. So that net loss comment and the 50% to 60% would include the current level of PCR where we said we're averaging about 30,000 tests a day. It's offsetting about 6% of our loss, but it does not contemplate significant upside if it happens from serology testing at some point in this quarter. And then on a margin perspective, obviously, if we losing money, the answer to that, but from a drop through perspective, because we are high fixed costs and we've already counted on as much adjustment to our cost structure as we can optimize through our furloughs, through reduced hours to some of those salary reductions for the next twelve weeks. We're largely fixed cost after that.So therefore any sort of volume changes would likely be at a very high ratio, if things were to get worse. As we said, we believe we've bottomed out because we've seen some stability over the last couple of weeks. There's some encouraging signs in some of the areas that were most impacted because not all geographies are created equal. So, some of those are bouncing back a little bit. But at this point, we wanted to be cautious, we wanted to be conservative, we wanted to tell you what we know today. And therefore the outlook for the quarter is not based on speculation. That is based on what we're seeing and what we know today. Ralph Giacobbe : Okay. Helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : Hi. Kevin Caliendo : Hi. Thanks. Thanks for taking my call. Good morning. A lot to think about here. But one thing I guess we'd like to focus on a little bit is on the cost side, you Invigorate and the plans that you have had in place for a long, long time. How do we think about cost savings, net growth Invigorate, all of that kind of that we had originally built into the model. I'm guessing part of that \u2026 Steve Rusckowski : Yes, yes. Kevin Caliendo : \u2026 thrown out here. Steve Rusckowski : Sure, sure. So let me start, then Mark will I\u2019m sure, add to it. First of all, Invigorate continues. That's a regular cadence and one of our two strategies that we have is to drive operational excellence and a portion of that is our efficiency program and we continue to look for that 3% of our cost basis for years. So that hasn't changed. So we continue to work on those programs. And in that regard, one of our flagship programs that we talk about is the new Clifton Laboratory that will allow us to consolidate the footprint to allow us to put in some new platforms, the immunoassay platform we talked about in the past, that project continues. But what I'll say, we're in the process of refreshing our plans because some of those plans might change. So, for instance, construction in the state of New Jersey might slip some. So some of those might change.And then secondly, some of the expectations around costs within a given year in terms of magnitude might be lower because some of it is volume dependent. However, in terms of percentage, if we're at lower volume levels, they'll be even higher percentages given some of this is fixed. So we're refreshing our perspective, but the goal of getting at least 3% of our cost basis for a year still stands. But we haven't provided an absolute number beyond the 3% in the past. So, Mark, would you like to add to it? Mark Guinan : Yes, I think Steve summarized it well. A lot of our Invigorate is around volume related activities, whether it's labor, whether it's our lab throughput, whether it's the draws we're doing in a patient service centers. So any sort of savings, certainly will continue as we implement some of the cost improvement efficiency opportunities, but they will be proportional. So obviously the dollars will be less. We always talked about 3% on a $6 billion plus cost base. Obviously if the cost base goes down, given lower volumes, you can expect lower dollar savings. The other thing I would add is that a lot of our efficiency programs are, design along the normal level of testing. So it is difficult to operate as efficiently when you lose half your volume on a given line, some places even more than that and given assays.So the efficiency around reagents and other things operational, things like labor flexibility and so on. So there is some offset to our Invigorate program and lost efficiencies, while we continue at this low level of volume because we're not going to rescale our business obviously to that extent. We're considering this to be temporary at some point, even though I caution we don't expect to be fully back to the level we were prior to COVID. We at some point we'll be back to much more significant testing. I mean, some of our cancer screening is down, very, very significantly. We all know at some point we have to come back and do that work because cancer doesn't go away. So, Invigorate will continue. It will be proportional. There will be some offsets because of the inherent lower efficiencies at these volume levels. Kevin Caliendo : If I can ask a quick follow-up on the volumes. When you say things have stabilized, are you seeing now a baseline where these are the chronic tests that basically need to be done and or are you starting to see an increase in sort of other testing that might -- you might be considered incremental that you hadn't seen in March that maybe you're now seeing again in April? Steve Rusckowski : Mark, you want to take that? Steve Rusckowski : Yes. So volume has not turned around. We said it stabilize. So when you asked about whether things in March and now we're seeing them pick up, what I would say is that, we worked across what we call our clinical franchises, and there's absolutely differences depending on the acuteness of the condition and the necessity of the testing. But there's some very acute important areas of adjustments and like cancer screening led testing in children, etcetera, that are down significantly just because physician offices are closed and people are uncomfortable going out, or people being told not to go out except for extreme necessary situations. So while we absolutely see some levels of difference across the testing venue and how much it's down, some more than 50% to 60%, some less than that. I can't tell you that we've seen more discretionary type testing come back dramatically yet. Kevin Caliendo : Guys, thanks so much for all your help on this. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jack Meehan of Barclays. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : Good morning, Jack. Jack Meehan : Yes. Good morning. Hope you guys are doing well. Steve Rusckowski : Yes, we're doing well. Jack Meehan : If you don't mind, I have a three parter on COVID testing. They're all \u2026 Steve Rusckowski : Let me write it down, Jack. Jack Meehan : Okay. The first one is where do you think reimbursement is going to shake out? Do you think commercial payers will follow the higher Medicare price? Second, how much further do you plan to scale up the testing? The stimulus package last night seem to call for further expansion. And then finally, just as you fold this all together with the core volumes down, if you look to the second half of the year, do you think net, net, it could be a positive impact as this testing persists? Thanks. Steve Rusckowski : Yes. So let me start. So on reimbursements, we were really encouraged by CMS upping the rate to $100. We're current -- currently working -- approaching all the commercial insurance companies on what their rate will be. And we don't have an answer on that, but we're encouraged that CMS went up and that's usually an indication that gives us leverage working with the commercial insurance companies. So more to come on that. Second, as Mark said, we still do not have the CMS rate for a serology testing. That's an important fact for us to establish reimbursement for serology, which would be, as we said, a significant opportunity. As far as scale, I mentioned in my comments, we are driving capacity gains going forward. We're bringing up some new platforms, trying to get some additional units. We're looking for different approaches of how we can get more productivity and more capacity from our existing platforms. And that is on the molecular side, will equally be on the serology side. And we have actually been asked by the White House task force to think creatively of what we can do to expand our capacity beyond what we have done so far. So we're thinking our way through that.As I said, we're right now at 50,000 tests per day, and that's for molecular. We're trying to get plans in place to bring us north of that number. But nothing that we can say at this point, but we're aggressively pursuing it. We are encouraged by what we saw last night come out of the Senate and hopefully the House will deliberate and we'll get the next round of funding. And some portion of that will come to us, because we do need to continue to do the testing in this country. And it so depended on both tests happening, molecular testing, as well as the serology tests going forward. So encouraged with the progress we're making, more in front of us. And yes, we will push hard to get more out.And as I said earlier, when I am asked the question about capacity on serology we have to look at the whole supply chain, the front end and the back end. So, yes, we have the lab capacity. But one of the issues we had on molecular side is not having the supplies, the swabs in the right places. We actually have shipped out in excess of a million swabs and we haven't resulted in excess of a million. So we have some inventory sitting out there. And also on the back end, it's very dependent upon IVD manufacturers providing us with the reagents and the kits o be able to increase our capacity as well. So we're working with them. And I can tell you, we're getting a lot of help from the task force, the White House, help from the states, everyone is rolled up their sleeves and trying to get more capacity out there. So there will be more coming, but what we\u2019ve said so far is what we feel comfortable so far, I would say. Mark, you like to add to that? Mark Guinan : Yes. Let me add a couple of things. So, Jack, almost without exception and certainly all of the national payers and large regional payers, the commercial reimbursement for the PCR test was based on the rate for Medicare and was not a subset or proportion, which obviously it's in the industry practice, but was with at or above the CMS rate. So therefore, I'm confident that we're going to do well. As you know, CMS has updated this price. We are in advanced discussions and I think it's very probable that most, if not all the company, the commercial payers will recognize the higher rate from CMS and our commercial rates will change. So I'm optimistic there.In terms of the second half of the year, as we said, we're very careful. We -- none of us know how this is going to play out, but you can do the math. So if you know, the capacity for serology is in any way meet the demand and Steve talked about 200,000 a day, you have the PCR currently today at 50,000 tests a day combined, those represent almost half of our normal daily testing volume. And given that we don't know serology yet, but we're hopeful the price will be fairly close to an average requisition price for us.And we know that the PCR testing is above that with the CMS rate revision. One would assume that the value of a requisition will be somewhat similar to what our average is today. So, again, I don't know how much the core volume will recover, how quickly it will happen, etcetera. But if there is some recovery and if there is some high level of demand for the COVID-19 testing, as we're all hearing publicly, then you can do the numbers and you can see that the back half of the year could be very different than the second quarter. Steve Rusckowski : And just to remind everyone there is a difference. And hopefully it's clear between the molecular testing, which requires a health care professional in most cases to do the specimen collection. And in many cases, they're protected with full garb of personal protection equipment. So that created a bottleneck of people getting tested. And we've worked on some different approaches to that. As a matter of fact, in the Walmart, the Walmart sites, we have observed self collection where actually we have an approved kit from the FDA where it is a nasal swab, but the person can use that swab themselves, but it has to be observed by health care professional.But in the case of Walmart, what actually happens is the person drives up, they provide the order to a health care worker in those parking lots that aren't nearly as protective as what we need to do before, they confirm all the information. The health care worker provides information that close up their window and they do the self collection themselves and it's observed through the window. So that's proven to be highly efficient. And we're looking at other ways of collecting that trend on the molecular side. So that has been a little bit of a bottleneck too on that and we're improving how we get the specimens.Remember, serology is blood based. And so it leverages all our infrastructure. And so as you know we have 12,000 phlebotomists, we have 2,200 patient service centers, we have 4,000 phlebotomists and physicians' offices. And so when this starts to light up, that provides us a nice opportunity to collect those specimens quickly and potentially tag those orders onto other orders that might be coming in from the health care delivery system as health care starts to turn on. So when you think about serology and you think about the front end being much simpler and much more pervasive and leveraging everything already have, not exceptional like the molecular test has been so far. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : Good morning, Ricky. Ricky Goldwasser : Yes. Good morning. And thank you very much for the update that you've been providing over the last four weeks. Very, very helpful and all the transparency. My question is focused on unemployment. Obviously, it's another variable to think about as we think about this year and next. So first, how are you incorporating into your assumptions that Mark talked about. And then if we think historically you have relatively more exposure to Medicaid. Just wanted to better understand, is there something that's structural or will you -- do you expect that we are going to see higher -- as we're seeing higher unemployment to see a move from commercial to Medicaid? And then maybe if you can give us some sense of what's the relative pricing or relative margin so we can we can start framing what that mix shift could mean for second half of the year in 2021? Thank you. Steve Rusckowski : Mark, you want to start with that? Mark Guinan : Yes. So, Ricky, our Medicaid revenues, as you know, are low single digits. Currently Medicaid is typically lower priced than Medicare, typically priced lower than commercial rates. Now when you talk about unemployment, absolutely, we've thought about that. And one of the reasons amongst many that we're cautious about whether volumes bounce back to where they were earlier in the year was the potential for continued unemployment higher than obviously we've had in the number of years. And so, therefore we are recognizing that potential as we think about the balance of the year. And quite frankly, going forward, the other dynamic is if you look historically and obviously we try to do that, I'm sure others have to try to predict what might happen this time, there are some notable differences. One of them is the Affordable Care Act does provide more of a safety net for those who lose their jobs. So that's a positive.But the other thing is, given the magnitude and the speed at which people have become unemployed, it's really difficult to model and predict what that might do to utilization. We are being very cognizant of collectability, not just from patients, but from hospital systems, from physicians. So we're monitoring very, very closely our receivables and collection rates. And we are anticipating likely headwinds on collectability of our revenue going forward, given everything that's going on. So that's certainly on our radar. But the other dynamic is, given that utilization has -- in the last couple of months dropped significantly, one might assume that a greater portion of our revenues would be coming from patients because people will be more slowly or not getting through their deductible and calendar basis relative to where they may have in the past.So we've looked at all of these things and that obviously it will be a headwind. But there's no model we can point to historically to say this is exactly what it means. I mean, in the last significant recession, our collectability rate actually did not materially decline. Utilization was impacted, but we did not have a higher rate of what used to be bad debt. Now it's mostly patient concessions. But given all the dynamics this time, we think that that's a likely possibility. However, you do have the safety net through the Affordable Care Act of expansion of Medicaid in many states. So how all those pieces put together? I can't fully predict, but trust me we're thinking about all that. And as we see trends and as we understand those impacts, as always, we'll be extremely transparent around what we're seeing. Ricky Goldwasser : Understood. Thank you. And just one follow-up question on the volume side. Whether you -- do you see any differences in geographies? Obviously, you have the national footprint and when we think about different states we're trying to kind of look at the volume declines to try to start to think about how recovery might look like. So are you seeing any differences between volumes in the northeast versus the south versus the west? Steve Rusckowski : Yes. So we've built up a model looking at our business from multiple perspectives. One, Mark, said earlier we have variation by types of clinical franchise business we have, some have declined greater, some have declined less. And we're thinking about why that has happened and when there is turning back on to health care delivery system, how quickly they will come back up. So that's one. Second is we do have differences between what's happened in the hospital environment and also physician environment. And so as hospitals start to change what they are going to allow back in their doors, that will change. That is well. And then third, we do see a difference in what's happening by state and by cities. And so we've tracked all of that. And what we have found, as we said in my introductory comments, all metropolitan areas have dropped. Obviously, some of those areas like New York, New Jersey, and now Lawson is starting to light up, parts of Florida have come in later than the West Coast. So we're tracking all of that and we're doing that because we're also trying to see when things might start to turn back on.So you start to see some of the individual states starting to loosen up their shelter-in-place and started to loosen up employers coming back to work. And so we're watching that carefully, so we can kind of indicate where we need to bring back our capacity. We talked about our costs programs. We've talked about furloughs. I want to make sure it's clear. Our furlough program was a program where we offered it to employees, but they had requested from us and we had to grant it. And so we grant out furlough. It allows them to continue to benefits request, but also allows them to collect unemployment and apply to the CARES Act for a weekly stipend. But it also allows us to bring them back. And so they have an obligation to come back when we need them. So as these states start to turn back on, we will bring back the capacity we need to turn it back on. But we're watching that Ricky carefully to understand what's gone down and when did we start to see some recovery by state and by clinical franchise going forward. Mark Guinan : Yes, the one other thing I'd add is that while shelter-in-place certainly has a significant impact on utilization and some of the greatest volume decreases were in those geographies, as we mentioned, every major metropolitan area in the country was seeing significant declines. Maybe not to the same extent in late March and then into early April, regardless of whether we had shelter-in-place. We are not as true outside the urban areas, but in the metropolitan areas people were being cautious, including physician offices, etcetera in -- how they were accepting patients and whether they were staying open or not and patients were being cautious about whether going out or not, given all the media attention and so on and so forth. So while there is absolutely a correlation with shelter-in-place rules, it's more than that, that has been depressing utilization. Ricky Goldwasser : Thank you. Shawn Bevec : Folks, there's a number of people still in the queue. And we're getting towards the bottom of the hour and we'd like to get to most of you, so please limit to one question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Baxter with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : Hi, Steve. Stephen Baxter : Hey, guys. Thanks. Hey, thanks for all the information and thanks for everything you guys are doing a standup testing capacity. Steve Rusckowski : Appreciate it. Stephen Baxter : I appreciate all the color on the antibody testing so far. So I'm just wondering, I guess, how you guys are thinking about sizing the demand when you scale up capacity to those levels? Because if you could run 6 million tests a month, you could test more than 20% of the country yourself over the next year. And obviously others will be ramping up their antibody testing capacity as well. So it sounds like you think this is going to go well above the sort of like sampling types of analysis that we've seen in places like Germany and New York City starting to pursue. I was hoping you could help us see the bigger picture here, from where you think this might be going over time. Thanks. Steve Rusckowski : Yes, well, to start with, if you look at the numbers that come out of the White House in their press briefings, we said that we've done over a million tests. We're close to 25% of the total country's testing. Obviously, we have better percentages, a higher percentage in certain states grew up broader presence. And some states are really just ramping up their testing in a bigger way. If they look at Florida, where we have a big presence that's just really started to light up in a big way. As far as the opportunity in front of us, we are encouraged by the opportunity we see. We're waiting to see how quickly it does ramp up and just what kind of pickup there will be from physicians on serological testing and how fast that ramp will be. But we're building enough capacity to respond to it. And again, a lot of our capacity will be highly depended upon the equipment we have and the reagents we get. So if there's more, we're hopeful we can build on what we have, but we are very limited by that. So we're going to keep our eye on it, push it as one of the two testing categories that should be done to respond to the virus and see how quickly it ran. So we will keep you updated as we learn more. Stephen Baxter : Is there something that's going to be an add on to your typical kind of routine panels, or do you anticipate people coming in sort of exclusively for these types of test? That\u2019s it for me. Thank you. Steve Rusckowski : I would say both. And I think there's as I mentioned earlier, we're working with employers because many employers are trying to understand how they bring back to employees. And there's wide variation in employers, but these employee programs will both test your employees for the virus with the molecular tests, and they'll also test them for the antibody tests. And we might do those, particularly the antibody test in different types of venues like corporate sponsored events where we can -- now where we can draw the specimen quickly as we do, corporate events they were for flu shots or Blueprint for Wellness program. So we already have that capability of ramping up these corporate programs. And those will be quite different than the traditional way of doing testing that we have with physicians or hospitals today. Stephen Baxter : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Derik de Bruin of Bank of America. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : Hi, Derik. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is Ivy for Derik today. Thank you for taking the question and thank you for comments so far and all the COVID updates in the past few weeks. It's very helpful. So I wanted to talk about longer term here and looking across COVID. So the two parter. One, does COVID change your thought on future wellness and routing testing demand? And two, does COVID and the PAMA delays change your view on lab consolidation. So with this change there could be more difficult to have those conversations with hospital C levels? Just wanted to get your thought on that here? Steve Rusckowski : Mark, you start the first one, I had a hard time hearing the first question. Mark, did you pick it up? Mark Guinan : Go ahead. If you wouldn\u2019t mind repeating, you talked about future wellness. Unidentified Analyst : Right. So that's the COVID-19 changed your thought on future wellness and routine testing demand. So in other words, does the crisis drive more routine and one is testing, given that people with preexisting conditions are at higher risk from that virus or there may be more of a downside from the post COVID disruptions. Mark Guinan : Yes. So on that one, it's very hard to predict. And just like you're asking, it could go either direction. We don't have any sort of crystal ball better than anybody else. Obviously, in my prepared remarks and then one of my answers, I expressed a concern that we're deferring critical diagnostic testing that's important for our health and well-being. And one would hope that at some point we say, that's really important, we've got to find a way to get it done regardless of what risks might be around COVID and whether that bounces back to where it was before or whether to your point could it potentially be more because COVID is obviously much riskier for those with pre-existing conditions that we're all familiar with and that means we want even more tightly manage that. I certainly can't predict it. I\u2019m not sure, if Steve wants to comment anything differently. So that's unclear. But as we said, as we progressed through this and we all learned together, we will be highly transparent around what we're seeing so that you all can understand as much as possible how that is playing out. Then, Steve, the other one was on PAMA lab consolidation. Steve Rusckowski : Yes. We see an opportunity. So if you think about what's happening within the healthcare provider market, we're an indication that volumes are down. You have all the data on possible missions. You have data on physician visits. You see it reflected in our volumes being down. And so hospitals and as we all know, 50% of physicians now are employed by hospital systems are going to be struggling as they enter this quarter. And we'll be looking at opportunities to become more efficient, reduce their cost, generate some cash. And so we believe there could be an opportunity for us to continue our consolidation strategy in the back half the year, it is more of these systems and some of those dialogues we've had for years maybe become more active now because there's now more likely to think about creative ways that they can work with a company like Quest on their lab strategy.So we think that could be another catalysts for consolidation. And as you know, this is also a fragmented industry. There's other regional, especially laboratories. And it also might have worsened other opportunities for us to consolidate. So we believe this is a good opportunity in the long-term for us to continue our strategy of accelerating our growth and consolidating the marketplace. And in the short-term, it's difficult, but in the mid to long-term, we think it could be yet another opportunity to do what we\u2019ve said we wanted to do. Shawn Bevec : Operator, next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Larew with William Blair. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : Hey, Matt. Matt Larew : Thanks. Hey, how are we doing? Thanks for fitting me and I wanted to ask about this sort of pacing through the recovery second quarter and third quarters here. A number of states have targeted opening up at the beginning of May and then some in the second week of May. A component of that and the administrations kind of guidelines are focused on getting some of the non-emergent care back opened up and physician offices opened up. But Mark, I think you mentioned that you anticipate non-COVID testing down 50% to 60% for the quarter. Could you maybe just give a sense for how in terms you're thinking about what those months might look like as states start to open up in some of that care, which as you\u2019ve alluded to, isn't necessarily entirely not elective starts to return. Mark Guinan : Yes. So as I said, we are not going to speculate, because it shows too hard to predict. So, yes, there's absolutely some potential for volume bouncing back from where it is now. We're not assuming any material improvement for the quarter, not because we know that won't happen, but because we think that's the appropriate point of view to take in order to make sure people are aware of some of the potential downside. We also haven't built in any significant serology volumes into those assumptions. And we've heard a lot of discussion today around that potential demand and ramping up fairly quickly. We don't know to what extent. So I don't want anyone to assume we have too much precision around this 50% to 60% down for the quarter and a, net operating loss. But that's potential if it does stay where it is and we don't get significant serology testing or significant upwards in our PCR testing. I don't know if you want to add anything, Steve, to that. Steve Rusckowski : I think I'll add is what I just said earlier. There is going to be a lot of pent up demand from patients. And Mark said there's been a lot of physician offices that have been canceled, postponed and delayed. And so they will start to come back to the system. When that will be, we will vary by city and by state. And so that's what I said earlier in the comments we're tracking all that. So one could think later in the quarter you start to see some recovery. There'll also be those physicians' offices in those hospital systems want to bring back in those patients as well. So we're actually going to do a survey of our customers to get a perspective of what they're thinking about when they turn back on their offices or open up their offices with extended hours, extended workdays. I think people are now thinking that the summer won't be the same summer. July and August won't be the heavy vacation period. So we're watching all that. But as Mark said, too early and too much too much uncertainty around it for us to give you anything more than we provided. But we're keeping an eye, our eyes on it closely. Shawn Bevec : Operator, next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Donald Hooker with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : Hi, Don. Donald Hooker : Great. Great. Good morning. So in last quarter, you called out some significant expenses around your advanced diagnostics. And I think a part of that was associated with the very interesting acquisition. I think a Blueprint that was kind of thinking about that being a nice tailwind for 2021. It sounds a little discretionary to me. Is that's something you're going to continue to pursue and as we think going forward. Steve Rusckowski : Yes, absolutely. Our strategy to accelerate growth continues. One of those strategies is to continue to build our advanced diagnostics platform. Again, that's all genetics and molecular. The acquisition that we did complete early this year was a nice platform capability acquisition. We feel good about that company coming into Quest Diagnostics. The integration is going well. There's a lot of opportunities in front of us with a genetic base testing. And our plans for that do not change given the crisis step that we have. Shawn Bevec : Operator, next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Lisa Gill : Hi. Thanks very much. Good morning. Steve Rusckowski : Hey, good morning, Lisa. Mark Guinan : Good morning. Lisa Gill : Good morning, everyone. Steve, in your prepared comments you talked about changes to the lab industry. And I'm just curious around your thoughts on telemedicine and the impact going forward. So clearly, at some point we're going to start to see physician offices open again, etcetera. But I think every large hospital system, to your point that own physicians has talked about the fact that we'll see more telemedicine going forward. How do you think about your relationship? Do you have any preferred relationships today with Telehealth providers that you anticipate that you'll see more Telehealth services in the home and then they'll be coming to your patient services center? I'm just curious, as to how you think that trend plays into Quest going forward? Steve Rusckowski : Yes. So, we\u2019ve been working with all the Telehealth providers and platforms in this many different models as we know. So we do see that as another channel, if you will, or another type of capability as health care provision. And this crisis has burned some of those models there and established some credibility and some comfort with patients. And so we do believe that will become a larger percentage of our volume. And when you have those engagements, many of you on the call probably have had those engagements, they do order testing. And then it follows the workflow that we have for testing within Quest Diagnostics. And then depending upon the model we\u2019ve used in the platforms, the use is telemedicine going to be your primary care physician or would they be an adjunct to it and therefore, we have the connectivity to connect back to the EMR in the primary care physician. So good opportunity. We have strong relationships with many of the Telehealth platforms, big and small. We actually are always prospecting what new startups and ventures are coming up with new capabilities. There's been a lot of new front end capabilities, triage capabilities that you see to run COVID-19, which has been interesting, some of which we're very well of -- we're aware of and have good relations with. So it is changing and this crisis has brought more visibility to it. So we believe that's a good opportunity for us and we're very well positioned with those companies going forward. Shawn Bevec : Operator, next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Erin Wright of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Erin Wright : Great. Steve Rusckowski : Hey, Erin. Erin Wright : Hi. Good morning. Hope everyone is well. In terms of PAMA, do you think that you've also earned some goodwill in light of the COVID response that can help with the lobbying efforts overall and for the recalculation of rates there? Thanks. Steve Rusckowski : Yes. What I'll say, Erin, is it can't hurt. This crisis has brought to the forefront the importance of testing. And I never believed when I joined this company over eight years ago, that would be on the front page of every news story in America and all over the media, but we are. So it's much easier now for us to make our case with members of Congress, to the administration in HSS with the value of testing and the need for us to get fairly reimbursed. And also to reinforce the intent of Congress in making sure we get a new process put in place that properly reflects the market rates. So it is actually a very good fact for us. We're going to leverage that. Just to remind everyone the CARES Act did change the timing. I had those in my prepared remarks. And then second is we still have the lawsuit going on, which is still happening. And we're hopeful we'll get a decision sometime this year on that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Coldwell of Baird. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : Hey, Eric. Eric Coldwell : Thanks -- hey, thank you very much. You mentioned in prepared remarks the $65 million distribution from the first $30 billion out of the CARES Act. Just a couple of questions on that. Does that mean you're anticipating getting another $150 million plus here in the short-term? $65 million at 30%, so assume it's $150 million less. And secondarily, with the 25 billion of testing stimulus that just came out, are there any impacts to Quest other than just the support of more volume and more activity in the market? Are there any direct impacts from that new 25 billion for testing that just came through in stimulus? Steve Rusckowski : Yes. Mark, do you want to start on the $65 million? Mark Guinan : Yes. So that was a unique situation. They created a pot of money of $30 billion emergency relief. There were no stipulations for how you would get that money. In fact, we are surprised, it showed up in our bank account. It was based on proportional billings to Medicare and that probably divided up at $30 billion. So anyone who had billed Medicare in the prior year got a portion of that. The other parts of this bill are, for various aspects of getting testing up and running. I will turn to Steve to cover some of that, but there's nothing else that quite mirrors that emergency relief fund where we got the $65 billion. So while there's opportunities for us to utilize some of the other funds, it's not as straightforward and it's not as simple as what happened with that emergency relief fund. So, Steve. Steve Rusckowski : Yes. And I'll just say the package that was just approved by the Senate last night, we don't have a lot of clarity of any specificity underneath the hood, if you will. And then also, as you know, it's going to be debated in the House. So we'll be watching and giving them input as they refine it. But it is critical to get America turn back on, that we have the resources and we're properly reimbursed and paid for the work we do. And as I said, we are the leader for a portion -- a large portion of the country is testing. And therefore, I would expect that some portion of that money we could tap into as a resource for us, but it's uncertain at this time what it will be and if any. Shawn Bevec : Operator, last question. Operator : Our last question comes from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : Hi, Brian. Mark Guinan : Good morning, Brian. Brian Tanquilut : Good morning, guys, and thanks again for everything. So just for the last question, just really quickly. So, Steve, thanks for all the updates or comments on your -- the hospitals and physicians. But as we think about your referral sources and try to pinpoint the recovery, if you don't mind could you give me some more granularity on where the bulk of your referrals are coming from? Is it primary care specialist and then hospitals? And then I guess my follow-up is just what your average serology test reimbursement is across the platform? Thank you. Steve Rusckowski : Yes. So just to give you a scale again of what our different businesses. Of our business, roughly a billion of it before crisis was coming from hospitals. To give you an idea of the scale and -- and then a billion of our business is -- are related services like our population health business with employers, our employer drug testing business, our insurance business. And so the remainder is really physician driven, okay? So, roughly $6 billion of our $8 billion before crisis was -- is physician driven. So those referrals are obviously very important because that's where we get the vast majority of our volume. Mark Guinan : And then on serology testing, Brian, well, we've never shared a dollar amount. You can look at some of the CMS rates. We've made it clear through our trade association that we don't think the crosswalk that they probably would default to is sufficient. Obviously you saw -- in the first case for the PCR, we weren't successful initially. They established a rate and then they reconsidered, looked at it and almost doubled it. So we're hopeful that in the case of serology, there's some pretty compelling evidence and detail that we're going to get a serology rate for the COVID testing that's more commensurate with the cost that its -- we're going to incur in order to perform it. Shawn Bevec : Steve, closing remarks. Steve Rusckowski : Sure. Well, thanks everyone, for joining us today. Glad we got everyone's questions and we appreciate your continued support and you have a great day. Operator : Thank you for participating in the Quest Diagnostics first quarter 2020 conference call.

The entire contents of the call, including the presentation and question-and-answer session that will follow, are the copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics with all rights reserved. Any redistribution, retransmission, or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. Now, I'd like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead, please. Shawn Bevec : Thank you, and good morning. I'm on the line with Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements, and will discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results, include but are not limited to, those described in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K. The company continues to believe that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on future operating results, cash flows, and, or its financial condition will be primarily driven by the pandemic's severity and duration, the pandemic's impact on the U.S. healthcare system and the U.S. economy, and the timing, scope, and effectiveness of federal, state, and local governmental responses to the pandemic, which are drivers beyond the company's knowledge and control. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS from continuing operations, and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations. References to base testing volumes or base business refer to base testing volumes, excluding COVID-19 molecular and serology testing volumes. Finally, growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections, including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth, and adjusted earnings growth, are compounded annual growth rates. Now, here's Steve Rusckowski. Steve Rusckowski : Thanks, Shawn, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Well, in one of the most challenging periods of our history, Quest Diagnostics stepped up and expanded COVID-19 testing for the country, and delivered stronger than expected performance in the second quarter. Second quarter results were driven by COVID-19 testing and the rapid recovery of our base testing volume. I'm very proud of Quest employees who have been on the frontlines of healthcare, answering the call, and fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. So, this morning, I'll discuss our performance for the quarter, our role in the COVID-19 pandemic, and update you on our non-COVID base business. And then Mark will provide more detail on the second quarter results and our financial position. We have reinstated our financial outlook for the remainder of the year with a broad range, which reflects uncertainty caused by the pandemic. Mark will talk about our outlook in an underlying subject [ph] just in a few minutes. Our financial performance in the second quarter was stronger than anticipated, also lower than the same period of 2019. For the quarter, total revenues declined approximately 6% to $1.83 billion. Earnings per share decreased by approximately 10% on a reported basis, so $1.36; and approximately 18% on an adjusted basis, so $1.42. These results were driven by a strong bounce back in our base testing volumes for March and April, as the healthcare system began to resume non-urgent care and elective surgeries sooner than we had anticipated. Heavy demand for COVID-19 molecular testing helped partially offset the base volume decline as well. Demand came in from a number of areas with the continuing spread of the virus throughout most of the country, the pent-up need to test non-COVID-19 pre-surgical patients, people in high-risk populations like nursing homes and prisons, the proliferation of retail testing sites, and finally, employer interest in testing employees before they return to work. Quest Diagnostics has continued to play a pivotal role in bringing COVID-19 testing capacity to the nation. We performed roughly 8.5 million COVID-19 molecular diagnostic tests, and more than 2.5 million antibody or serology tests. We now have the capacity to perform up to 130,000 molecular diagnostic tests today, double the capacity since mid-May. Over the next couple of weeks, we expect to have the capacity to perform approximately 150,000 molecular diagnostic tests per day. Cumulatively, Quest has delivered nearly 20% of all the testing included in this country. Working together with large national retailers like Walmart and CVS, we've built a new model for consumers to access testing. We're also supporting HHS and state drive-through testing initiatives across the country. I'm very proud of the progress we have made in rapidly scaling up capacity since the pandemic began. However, demand for testing has soared in recent weeks. And we are providing testing results in about two days for the highest priority patients, and the average turnaround time for non-priority patients is at least seven days. So, we're doing everything we can to bring more COVID-19 molecular testing to patients and speed the delivery of test results. We continue to add testing platforms and work with our suppliers to ensure access to testing equipment, reagents, and personal protective equipment. We're exploring a range of new technology options, like last week, the FDA granted Quest the nation's first emergency use authorization to use specimen pooling for COVID-19 molecular testing. This technique, which is commonly used with blood banking, will help expand capacity, especially among populations with low estimates. Through our lab referral program, we're partnering with other quality laboratories to expand our available capacity. And in recognition of the magnitude of the current demand for testing, we have asked customers to help us prioritize patients we test for COVID-19 at this time. Quest colleagues have stepped up in so many ways over the last few months to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. Our company has been central to the crisis response, and I'm proud of our employees on frontlines who are serving patients, customers, and communities every day. In June, we offered financial assistance to about 23,000 of our frontline colleagues and their supervisors to encourage increased expenses during the pandemic. In April, we took us a series of temporary workforce actions to manage our costs. These included the furloughs, reduced hours, and pay cuts for salaried employees. And then today, I am very pleased to report that a vast majority of these actions were reversed a month earlier to enable us to continue to respond to our customers' increased demand for testing. Since March, we've been fighting COVID-19, but we've also been focused on accelerating growth in the base business. And as a reminder, the five elements of our strategy to accelerate growth are to grow more than 2% per year through accretive [indiscernible] acquisitions, to expand relationships with health plans and hospital health systems, to offer the broadest access to diagnostics innovation, be recognized as a consumer-friendly provider of diagnostic information services, and then finally, support population health and data analytics in extended care services. Now, let me take you through a few highlights from our strategy to accelerate growth. Through the pandemic, the M&A environment understandably slowed. But despite that, we were able to complete the acquisition of a Memorial Hermann outreach business in April, and are pleased with the early progress. We also recently announced our plan to acquire all of Mid America Clinical Laboratories, or MACL. Once we complete this transaction expected this quarter, Quest will wholly own MACL's laboratory in Indianapolis, and about 50 patient service centers across Indiana. Also, we'll provide professional lab services under a long-term agreement for 30 hospital labs owned and operated by MACL founding hospitals, Ascension St. Vincent and Community Health Network. Our M&A pipeline remains strong. Given the many challenges that hospitals will face, we expect many more to be open to discussions about how Quest can help them achieve their lab strategies. At the same time, we know that all our regional laboratories have had their own challenges. This could also produce more opportunities for tuck-in acquisitions. If anything, the pandemic could be an additional catalyst to help drive industry consolidation. Some transactions in the pipeline that were paused because of the pandemic are being revisited, based on the new realities that the healthcare system is experiencing at this time. We also continue to make progress on our health plans strategy. We entered our second year of being a member of your UnitedHealthcare's Preferred Lab Network, and we are pleased with the results to date. We have met or exceeded key quality metrics, such as electronic ordering and resulting, and patient service center appointment rates. We've also secured business for more than 180 out of network UHC labs, saving money for patients and lowering the overall cost of care. We look forward to making continued progress with the Preferred Lab Network in the second year. Over the last few months, we've seen a remarkable surge in the sign-ups of our MyQuest patient portal. Today, more than 11 million patients have a MyQuest account to make appointments and receive their results through their smartphone or computer. Since late April, we've seen a more than three-fold increase in weekly registrations, which accelerated at the end of the second quarter. We believe that our patients see and appreciate the ease and convenience of our consumer experience. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Mark, who will take you through the results. Mark? Mark Guinan : Thanks, Steve. In the second quarter, consolidated revenues were $1.3 billion, down 6.4% versus the prior year. Revenues for diagnostic information services declined 5.7% compared to the prior year. Although revenue declined year-over-year, our second quarter results were stronger than we communicated back in June, reflecting the stronger than expected recovery in base testing volumes, as well as growing demand for COVID-19 testing services. Volumes, measured by the number of requisitions, decreased 17.7% versus the prior year, with acquisitions contributing approximately 50 basis points. Testing volumes in the company's base business declined approximately 34% versus the prior year. In April, base volumes declined in excess of 50% compared to last year, as stay at home measures were implemented across the U.S., hospitals began to limit elective procedures, and many physician offices were temporarily closed for business. Base volume trends began to improve in May, down more than 30%, as stay at home measures [Technical Difficulty], many hospitals reintroduced elective procedures, and some physician offices reopened. The base volume recovery continued in June, down less than 15%, as the trends in May gained momentum. Throughout the quarter, the strongest recoveries were observed in the states that opened more quickly than others, such as Texas and Florida. As we exited June, base volume declines had moderated to approximately high single digits. However, due to the recent spike in COVID-19 cases across the country and the rollback of several state reopening plans, we have seen a slight softening of our base business in early July. While base testing volumes remain down year-over-year, COVID-19 testing was a meaningful offset in the second quarter. We exited the second quarter averaging approximately 110,000 and 26,000 COVID-19 molecular and serology tests respectively each day. Over the next couple of weeks, we expect to have the capacity to perform 150,000 molecular diagnostic tests per day. Revenue per requisition increased 15.3% versus the prior year, primarily driven by reimbursement for COVID-19 molecular testing. Unit price headwinds were slightly less than 2% in the second quarter, in line with our prior expectations. This includes the ongoing impact PAMA. Reported operating income was $283 million or 15.5% of revenues, compared to $307 million or 15.7% of revenues last year. Reported operating income second quarter includes $65 million of proceeds from the CARES Act. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $294 million or 16.1% of revenues, compared to $352 million or 18% of revenues last year. The year-over-year decline in operating margin was due to the significant decline in revenue associated with our base testing volumes, partially offset by COVID-19 testing and our cost reduction actions. Adjusted operating income does not include proceeds from the CARES Act. Reported EPS was $1.36 in the quarter, compared to $1.51 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $1.42, compared to $1.73 last year. Cash provided by operations was $602 million year-to-date through June 30, versus $596 million in the same period last year. Cash from operations in the second quarter included the $65 million of provider disbursements under the CARES Act I just mentioned. Our financial position remains very strong. During the second quarter, we amended our revolving credit facility, allowing us greater financial flexibility. We completed a $550 million debt offering in May, which may be used to redeem or repay our senior notes due in 2021. Given the better than expected second quarter results, our debt to EBITDA ratio was only slightly above where we ended Q1. We ended the quarter with nearly $1 billion in cash on the balance sheet. Finally, our Board of Directors remains committed to the company's quarterly dividend at this time. This morning, we reissued our full-year 2020 outlook as follows. Revenue is expected to be between $8 billion and $8.6 billion, an increase of approximately 3.5% to 11.3% versus the prior year. Reported EPS is expected to be in a range of $5.66 and $7.66, and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $6.60 and $8.60 8 per share. Cash provided by operations is expected to be at least $1.25 billion, and capital expenditures are expected to be between $375 million and 400 million. We continue to operate under extremely uncertain conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which is evident in the wider than usual outlook ranges we shared in our quarterly press release today. As you consider our new 2020 outlook, I'd like to share the following considerations and assumptions. First, regarding base testing volumes, we expect base testing volumes to remain below prior year levels for the remainder of the year. While the magnitude of the year-over-year decline is likely to fluctuate geographically as states throttle reopening phases, our current outlook does not contemplate the magnitude of base volume declines observed in April and May, and the low end of the outlook assumes an average 20% decline in base testing volumes through the remainder of the year. Regarding molecular COVID-19 testing demand and capacity, we continue to drive towards molecular COVID-19 testing capacity of 150,000 tests per day over the next couple of weeks. Keep in mind this represents peak capacity, operating under optimal conditions. Due to various factors, such as routine maintenance and planned downtime, we generally operate at somewhat under peak capacity. We expect demand for molecular COVID-19 testing to remain high, at least through the third quarter. Please note, that the low end of our outlook assumes recent molecular COVID-19 testing volume trends continue at a similar level throughout the third quarter and then step down in the fourth quarter. Regarding Medicare reimbursement from the molecular COVID-19 testing the existing $100 Medicare reimbursement for molecular COVID-19 testing is tied to the public health emergency declared by HHS. HHS officials have recently indicated they plan to extend the public health emergency for an additional 90 days beyond the current expiration of July 25. Our outlook assumes this level of reimbursement continues through late October. To be clear, we believe HHS to continue the Public Health Emergency while the crisis continues and we are not aware of any plans for it to end. Regarding COVID-19 serology testing, COVID-19 serology testing also continues to help offset declines in base testing volumes. We continue to believe there is meaningful potential within serology testing but rising customer demand remains in front of us. Regarding the cost actions we've undertaken, as Steve mentioned, we have rolled back many of these cost actions we took in April with most remaining actions expected end of July. Finally, as we develop this outlook we contemplated a range of potential outcomes in the second half of 2020. The low end assumes the variability and uncertainty I just described. We have greater degree of visibility in the third quarter and there are far more unknowns in the fourth quarter. Therefore, we currently expect third quarter results to be stronger than the fourth quarter. I will now turn it back to Steve. Steve Rusckowski : Thanks, Mark. With the sunrise in the second quarter, Quest Diagnostics step up and rapidly expanded COVID-19 testing for the country and delivered stronger than expected performance. Looking forward to the rest of the year, we will continue to expand COVID-19 testing capacity while also serving the unmet needs of healthcare community and drive our strategy to accelerate growth. We reinstated our financial outlook for the full year of 2020 with the broad range, which reflects the continued uncertainty caused by the pandemic. Finally, I'm very proud of our Quest employees who have been on the frontlines of health care, answering the call and fighting the COVID-19 pandemic Now, we'd be happy to take any of your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Ann Hynes from Mizuho Securities. Your line is open. Ann Hynes : Great, thank you. Again, I want to thank everyone across for what they're doing. I have two questions regarding testing. Could you clarify the comments you made on serology testing, the assumptions in guidance? I think you used the words, it's in front of us. Does that mean you do not have a meaningful contribution for serology testing in 2020 and if so do you think it's more of a 2021 contribution when the vaccine comes out? Then my second question would be around just molecular testing, the pooling that you announced Monday. Should we think about that as just the ability to turn around faster or do you ultimately think it's going to increase the capacity over the 100 to 2000 per day? Thanks. Steve Rusckowski : So it sounds good. Well, on serology we are doing serology as we speak. We brought that up in April. We have in our outlook for the year some serology volume. What I will say is there is growing evidence of the value of serology. There has been some debate of the evidence that would suggest if you have the antibodies that, in fact, it provides the ability for a period of time. It is clear that people are starting to weigh in that, in fact, those antibodies do provide confidence that there will not be a re-infection. As that confidence builds and as we get into the fall and into next year, I do believe there will be a pickup in serology particularly as we start to think about who should get the vaccine and who should not get the vaccine. So I think some of that is in front of us, but we do have some of that in our outlook. As far as molecular testing and pooling in the numbers that I provided particularly getting to 150,000 per day in a couple of weeks, some portion of that will be driven by the opportunities we see with pooling. Some portion of that is also driven by adding new systems and new resources to increase our capacity. What I'll say is we're not stopping there. There's opportunities in front of us beyond that 150,000. Mark Guinan : I just would like to add in certainly, serology testing is meaningful and we shared in Steve's prepared remarks we've done 2.5 million. That's certainly meaningful. It's just different than molecular where the demand is exceeding our capacity. We had shared earlier that we had capacity of 200,000 serology tests a day with an expectation that demand could possibly be at that level. For various reasons, it's nowhere near that. But certainly, the amount of serology testing we're doing is very meaningful to Quest and is one of the offsets to the base business decline right now. Ann Hynes : All right, thanks. Operator : Next, we have Stephen Baxter from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Stephen Baxter : Thanks for the question. I also wanted to ask about the molecular testing. Can you talk a little bit about how you referral patterns have looked throughout the quarter and what percentage of that testing volume is now coming from return-to-work? My thought process was that if you are currently utilizing close to full capacity in the molecular side and the return to work opportunity is still largely in front of you, you potentially have pretty high visibility even going out into Q4, one way or another, as there sort of a natural hedge built in there. Then just as my follow-up, it looks like DSOs increased very meaningfully during the quarter. I was hoping you could discuss that a little bit and whether you're seeing any collection challenges or delays with the COVID testing. Thanks. Steve Rusckowski : Sure. First, as far as demand, where is it coming from. In our prepared remarks, we took about the different elements of demand and what I'll share with you is that we have demand right now that is exceeding our capacity and we're doing what we can to obviously bring up the capacity. Also, we said in prepared remarks is working with our customers and clients on prioritizing those specimens that we're getting in to make sure we're testing the most urgent need in the country and we're making progress. As we bring up the capacity and we manage our demand over the next several weeks and get into August, we believe as we get through August and into September, we'll have a higher level of capacity, but also a higher level of demand and we'll be able to get to turnaround times that are in the acceptable levels that we've had in the past. So it's in front of us. We're working hard getting there and I think all elements that you described will allow us to be successful through the next several weeks. As far as demand, Steve, you talked about return to work programs. It's starting to come into our demand. We're managing it with employers. We also see in front of us the demand for return to universities and colleges. There'll be a lot of testing required in the month of August around that. We also see physicians bringing up their offices and more physicians are actually sending us persons that they've collected. So we see that adding to the demand. Then there has been broader access and broader availability of testing where people have now at access to asymptomatic testing and very convenient locations. Then I mentioned that our remarks the access we provided with CVS stores and also with Walmart has increased the demand. So, I would say across the board, it's growing in all areas. We do believe though as we get into the September months when we hope there is still a number of employers that are bringing employees back to the office or to work that we are going to be in a place where our capacity will meet the demand that we see in our funnels. Mark Guinan : Stephen, did you ask about pacing concessions? I didn't quite pick up your last question. Stephen Baxter : Yes. It just looks to me that the DSOs were up a bit maybe [ph] 5 days -- maybe sequentially something like. I just want to know whether COVID testing or other collection and things with you guys might want to talk about with these things. Mark Guinan : That's really formulaic approach. Cash collections are stronger as expected. We did have some delayed billing around COVID testing because the payers needed to update their systems and many of them needed 30 days or more to do that so we were holding on some billing, but I can assure you that at this point in terms of our reserves and our cash collections and everything we're very, very comfortable with where we're in our balance sheet. As you can see the operating cash flow was benefited from the CARES Act. $65 million was pretty strong year-over-year despite the depressed volumes revenues and earnings in the second quarter. Stephen Baxter : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jack Meehan from Nephron Research. Your line is open. Jack Meehan : Hey, good morning. So first of all, congrats on the trajectory. Wanted to get your thoughts on one of the top questions I've been getting to the labs, which is how can you convert the short-term opportunity from testing and make your long-term growth rate more durably higher? I was curious to get your take on that. And then, Mark, what does the guidance assume for incremental margins on testing in the second half versus reinvestment and are there any things that you can accelerate to try and improve the longer term trajectory of the business? Steve Rusckowski : Let me start with we're going into second half and clearly, our base business is going to continue to be down versus 2019. We are hopeful that we'll start to continue to see some recovery in the back half of the year, but we're not necessarily contemplating any of that in our outlook for 2020. As we get into 2021 it goes back to us continue to work our strategy for accelerated growth and we do believe we have the right strategies and we wanted to share with you in our prepared remarks that we're working those hard. I actually believe that the strategies are actually more appropriate given the pandemic than they were before. So if you think through those, one is, we do believe there could be more acquisitions in front of us for growth through acquisitions. We announced the two deals recently that will prepare us nicely in the back half of the year for growth through acquisitions and sets us up for 2021 too with that carry over on that and the funnel that we're seeing and we're going to push on that front. It will give us some nice growth through acquisitions as we keep on working those in the back half help us in 2021. Second is as far as organic growth in our base business, we continue to work our relationships with the health plans. I would say that our work in the preferred lab network with United is going well. We're going to continue to gain share with them and we're pushing that same type of approach in concept with many peers throughout our route or contracts and we believe there is an opportunity for us to pick up share as we've said in our strategy. We also continue to work with hospitals. We talked about the Mako systems, professional lab services deal. We have a number that are being finalized as we speak that we feel good about and those will give us continued organic growth next year. Then also as we think about our advanced diagnostics and the capabilities we're bringing to the marketplace with gene sequencing and consumer genetic offerings, we believe those strategies will give us some nice opportunities for continued growth next year. So we're continuing to push on the base business growth platform. At the same time, we'll have some natural recovery in our base business as the economy and as healthcare recovers and also through acquisitions. We think we'll be in a good place as we get into 2021 to deliver on that objective that we have of 2% growth through acquisitions. Mark, anything you'd like to add to that? Mark Guinan : Sure. To answer your EBIT question about margin dropdown, Jack. As we've shared in the past in a short window, we are a highly fixed cost business on our base business, so generally any plus or minus will be 80% or so drop through. It's really supplies and reagents that are the variable costs. The most of it, everything from their logistics infrastructure to phlebotomy to even largely the labour in the laboratory in a window is fixed so variation, good or bad around the base business has a very high drop through. Although we certainly have good margins on our COVID testing there is more variable cost in the COVID testing so it's not quite as high a variable margin on any sort of plus or minus is from our base case, but still very attractive. Jack Meehan : Thank you. Operator : Next, we have Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Ricky Goldwasser : Hi, good morning and thank you for all the details. So my question is on the guidance. Mark, you obviously highlighted the assumptions on the low end of the range. Just trying to understand better what you assuming at the high end and especially when we think about molecular testing. I think you're expecting that at the low end that there is going to be a step down in the fourth quarter. So just trying to understand the rationale for that. What type of environment do you see where we're going to see a step down in molecular? What are you assuming at the high end? Then, when we think about just the future of COVID-19 addressable market in relation to vaccine administration as it relates to the molecular are you in any conversations with the vaccine manufacturers and in how do you think -- what do you think the role of testing will be in relation to the vaccine? Mark Guinan : I'll let you handle the vaccine question, then I'll just talk about the assumptions. Ricky, I appreciate the question. If there is one thing that has been demonstrated over the last several months is we don't have the ability to predict some of these things so I don't think any of us here envisioned a 50% decline in our business in April even when the pandemic first started. Then on the other side, we didn't expect the fast recovery that we saw throughout May and June, given what had happened in April. So we want to recognize that some of these things are out of our control and we want to talk about some ranges of potential outcomes and how they might impact our financial results to take away a little bit and hopefully a large degree of that uncertainty, we've been living with over the last couple of months where people were wondering what might be happening at Quest. But when we talk about PCR molecular volumes falling off in Q4, it's not because we have a vision of that happening, but we had to make some assumptions in the guidance. Since that's several months away and we've shown that even a month or two in the future it's hard to predict that, we didn't expect the surge in June that happened. Therefore we're just being I think appropriately cautious and explaining what those assumptions are, so we don't have any sense that it will follow-up. I think all of us for society are hoping it will follow-up as the infection rate dampens but also note that some of the non-clinical work, the work we're doing for return-to-work for employers and students should be heavy in Q3 and some of that we might expect to step down in Q4. So, that is one driver that might lead you to believe that demand would dampen a little bit in Q4, but it's not as if we know how the virus is going to proceed and the infection rate and certainly some people would say that when we get the flu season, we might even have another spike. So we don't know but we wanted to be very clear around those assumptions. Steve Rusckowski : Ricky, on your question about next year and specifically the vaccine. So, first of all, we believe there will be COVID-19 testing next year in 2021. Second is, if we assume we'll have a vaccine next year or sometime, and you go back to what I said earlier about the role of serology and evaluating and prioritizing who should get the vaccine, we do believe there will be a role of testing in 2021 for us. Then finally, in terms of working with those that are developing the vaccine, we are actively in conversations of using our data in a productive way to recruit patients. Some of this is around the vaccine development but also using our data to help with the donation of plasma for the country. So, good use of our data, which is part of our strategy again for growth -- the user data, the smart way as a diagnostic information services provider to help with the pandemic. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Ralph Giacobbe from Citi. Your line is open. Ralph Giacobbe : Hey, good morning. Sorry to harp on this, but I do want to go back to the guidance. Because when you first updated in early June, you expected breakeven is slightly positive for the quarter, you obviously ended up at $1.42. That essentially implies all of the two key earnings came in June. So if I just run rate that number for six months, I'm already at $8.40 [ph] in earnings before I even contemplate the over $2 you put up in the first half. So -- and again, my guess is COVID testing trajectory moves higher and assuming some continued core recovers, I'm still struggling a little bit to understand the offsets or the headwinds on what appears a pretty extremely conservative range, particularly at the lower end, but just want to make sure I'm not missing anything else. Mark Guinan : Well, we laid out for you in pretty detailed fashion in the low end. So you can take a look at those assumptions. And,, you can have your own point of view, and that's why we wanted to be very, very clear about that assumption. So your notion that Q2 earnings were all pretty much in June is spot on. And the issue with multiplying that times six for the back half would be a couple things. One is our base business was down exiting the month high single digits of average 15 in June. And the question is, is that sustainable? We'll take a step back, we'll look at worse. We don't know. So certainly, if it were to improve, or were to hold for the whole six months, would say down 10% versus that 20% assumption on our floor, that would make a material difference for the business. And as I just described, at an 80% drop down, you can do some of the math, but our core business was about $2 billion on quarter before COVID. So you know, 1000 basis points is a pretty significant difference on revenue and OM. On the PCR, we shared that we're assuming the volumes dropped down in Q4, not because we have any foreknowledge, but because as I said, return to work and back to school will largely be behind us, and because we don't know. So we want to be cautious about putting on a guidance that counts on the level of PCR testing that at this point is unpredictable. Obviously, we go through Q3 and we get better knowledge towards Q4 and see a need to update that, we would do so. But, given how things have moved around, we want to be really careful. The other thing is, as I said, we fully expect, if we continue to have high levels of COVID and ease-of-testing [ph] that the Federal Emergency will continue, but because that's unpredictable, it could actually be revoked at any time. We want to be very careful about assumptions on reimbursement for our molecular tests. And so, at this point, we're only building in that reimbursement through a 90-day extension, since that's been voiced by HHS. And while we would hope and expect if COVID continues that that reimbursement will continue into Q4, that would make a very significant difference as well. But that is not in either the bottom or the high-end of our current guidance. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Pito Chickering from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Pito Chickering : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Two questions for you, back to the pooling option, that I would have assumed a larger multiplier effect for geographic areas with a low posit testing rates. As you progress into the third quarter, is there a reason why that can't scale to provide a much larger multiplier effect? And what would hold it back from being that large of an impact? And the second question is, as we look into 2021, and if there's a decline in COVID testing, both molecular and serology in the US, is there any discussions about providing testing capabilities for other countries that don't have the testing infrastructure? Steve Rusckowski : Yes, so let me start with pooling. So what you mentioned is true, that is, it's more beneficial in areas that have low prevalence. We've started to ramp up our capacity that will be driven for getting some nice boost in our capacity, which we're planning for, as I mentioned, to get to that 150 [ph] in a couple of weeks. So we're going to apply those concepts in our laboratory developed test locations and try to steer it towards the low prevalence areas to be able to get the best bang for the buck. So we'll push that and the multiplier is considerable when you have low prevalence, so that would be very helpful to bringing up our capacity. We'll keep on pushing on it. As far as testing for non-US geographies, frankly, we are focused entirely for all-intensive purposes on the US. We could consider it in 2021, but it's not in our plans right now and we haven't spent a lot of time thinking about it, as we sit here dealing with the pandemic in the US. Operator : Thank you. Next we have Kevin Caliendo from UBS. Your line is open. Kevin Caliendo : Hi, thanks, and thanks for taking my call. I want to get to the assumption around the vaccine and how to think about this. So if we were to assume a vaccine becomes available January 1, there's a billion doses or whatever the number might be, how do you anticipate the vaccine being distributed and administered along with testing? Are you suggesting that first people would get serology testing to figure out who would need the vaccine or? We can imagine that this vaccine is going to be administered quickly to the entire population. So take me through how you would expect to model out the administration of the vaccine along with testing. Steve Rusckowski : Yes, well, obviously, this is beyond Quest Diagnostics and rationing or prioritizing who should get it first, and what's the progression and how you distribute it throughout the United States. But like with other vaccines, you'd like to get it to the higher-risk groups. And the higher risk groups are those groups that we actually tested initially, higher on the priority list for COVID testing. And so, those were with pre-existing conditions, over the age of 65, and obviously, people that have been compromised with other respiratory illnesses in the past. So independent of serology and antibody testing, my assumption would be those at-risk groups would be high on the priority list. And then, the second priority list would be everyone else. And if, in fact, you were to test positive for the antibodies, then my sense is there will be evidence at that point that will suggest that, in fact, you'll have immunity for a period of time. And the question will be, how much of this would be public policy versus independent choice of whether you want to have the vaccine or not. That's all speculative on my part, a lot to be determined. First of all, where the vaccine will come from, when it's going to be available, how much will the US get. And also, this is going to be I'm sure debated throughout the United States as we get into it. Operator : Thank you. Next, we have Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much, and good morning. Steve, I just wanted to follow back up on reimbursement. So, you talked about Medicare. Can you talk about the commercial market? So, it's the anticipation that the commercial market will just follow Medicare through the emergency pricing and what's your anticipation post-emergency pricing, should it be rolled back, number one. And number two, we've heard in the market that some of the health plans are pushing back on multiple tests done on individuals. What's been your experience so far? Steve Rusckowski : Sure, sure. So first of all, we do have an assumption that commercial rates are aligned with Medicare rates and, Mark, why don't you just remind everyone what we have in the outlook going forward as far as our assumptions for reimbursement? Mark Guinan : So we -- the emergency use -- obviously the Federal Emergency expires on July 25th. HHS has expressed a view that they're going to extend that 90 days, so we've built that $100 price which is not our AWR, you know, we don't fully get $100; but that $100 priced into our -- pretty much our full book. And so, the commercial as we shared previously, the commercial payers pretty much fell in line with the Medicare reimbursement rates as a couple of additional state Medicaid plans that didn't quite get there. But for the most part, we get that price from everybody, regardless of who they are. Therefore, we would expect that to continue. So, as long as the Medicare rate stays up, that doesn't mean there wouldn't be some pressure, but we would expect the commercial payers to stay in line with that, because obviously, if it stays, there's a federal emergency, and it'd be hard to argue. They should be cutting the rate for a test that's quite so important. And nonetheless, we will get some pressure. Once we get through that, where the commercial rates end up, obviously, we will take a position that says it shouldn't be less than Medicare. It will be very transparent with what our costs are and the continued importance of that test, even post-emergency and we'll do our best to keep it at the Medicare rate and not something less than that. But that's still -- it's obviously still in front of us. Steve Rusckowski : As far as payment policy, reimbursement policy, it is evolving. What I'll share is that frequency policies, first of all, as we all know, you could test negative one week and the next week, it'd be positive. So therefore, it's quite important that people feel that they should get tested if they've been exposed, and if, in fact, they believe that they might have some early symptoms. So, we'll continue to take that as the position and I think by and large people support that notion, but you have seen positions taken on return-to-work programs that employers are moving with, and in many cases, these employees are self-insured. So it's sort of a moot issue, what pocket it comes from. But for those fully insured employers, there is positions by some of the insurers that that's not included in their healthcare reimbursement policies. So therefore, it should be paid for by the employers. And then equally with universities and colleges, whether the students -- free on campus testing is included in the reimbursement like a physical would be, if they're going back to school or playing sports or going -- there's some debate around that. So I would say, characterize it as people are debating some of this. We're seeing kind of a growing trend with some of this. And then, also as we evolve, we're trying to understand who should get tested and who should not get tested. There is even some question of whether, after you've been tested positive and out for 14 days right now, most people are operating on a protocol that you get retested again, but there's some views that maybe that second test to verify your negative is not of great value, and therefore, this might help reduce the demand that we have on the system right now. So that's being debated, as well. So it's evolving, a lot of discussion. And Mark, anything you'd like to add to reimbursement in general on COVID? Mark Guinan : I would just add that we have not had a significant amount, it would be very few of any denials or frequency limitations. So, while things might evolve, Lisa, to this point, we've not run into issues with the payers around frequency for the molecular tests, and for the return-to-work and back-to-school programs, we are not taking the risk on those. So we are either arranging client bill where we get paid directly contractually by the customer, or in some cases where they think they have coverage from the payer, we have a fall back to where, if we do get a denial, then we have a right to bill the client directly. So, we think we're protecting ourselves for the financial standpoint, we have not run into headwinds less far from the payers on frequency [indiscernible]. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Matt Larew from William Blair. Your line is open. Matt Larew : Hi, good morning. I wanted to ask about how pair mix is trending in the base business, obviously, with the rising unemployment, but also, I suspect that patients in the commercial population may have been quicker to seek services as restrictions were relaxed, and I wanted to follow up on the opportunity for back-to-work and back-to-school. Just curious what discussions you've had and what role lab-based testing might play versus rapid testing? And then, perhaps there is an opportunity for Quest to play a role model not only in testing, but managing the testing strategies for employers, cities or companies, or schools? Steve Rusckowski : Mark, you want to take the first part of this around payments? I think that was the question. Mark Guinan : Yes, I'm sorry, Matt, what is your specific question? Can you repeat it? Matt Larew : Sure. Just payer mix; how that trended through the quarter in the base business? Mark Guinan : Yes, payer mix did not change materially. The one thing we did see was an increase in uninsured. So beyond that, I don't think there was any -- and we rarely see -- given our size, we rarely see material changes of payer mix and this was no exception. So certainly, the drop in utilization did not impact people with certain payers more than others. The one that we did see was more uninsured. Steve Rusckowski : Yes, Matt. On return to work programs and university role of let's say point of care devices, we are looking at all those devices and where they can help us, particularly around surveillance. And what we're finding for the initial testing, if you will, the gold standard is the PCR test for like a diagnostic workup and then secondly is for serology or blood based test is the gold standard. The sensitivity and specificity of both those are the best. Still to this day, and there are few devices -- there are a few devices that are coming to the marketplace that are -- that are offering we think an opportunity for us to include that in our services that we provide to both employers and to universities, specifically. Some of the antigen devices are coming to the marketplace we're looking at, you know those devices and some of the sensitivity around 85% which is lower than our sensitivity but for surveillance and in combination with possibly serology and just overall biometric screening of some form, it could be a helpful set of tools for us to manage a population over time. So, we are thinking about how we'll include those in our services to employers and also to universities as they have surveillance for their populations going forward. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Tanquilut. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : Hi, Brian Mark Guinan : Hi, Brian. Brian Tanquilut : [Technical Difficulty]. Steve Rusckowski : Brian, you're breaking up. Brian Tanquilut : I'm sorry. Yes, how's this? Better? Steve Rusckowski : Much better, much better. Yes. Brian Tanquilut : Okay. Yes. So how do you think about the strategy in terms of balancing, increasing capacity beyond that 150,000 tests per day versus the uncertainty of not knowing how big this opportunity really could be? And what are the limiting factors right now that prevent you from pushing that up to say 200 or 250 a day? Steve Rusckowski : Yes. Well, first of all, as I mentioned, on my earlier remarks, we are going to push it beyond 150. And we do see capacity -- excuse me do we do see demand going forward, that's going to be beyond 150. And we do believe we'll get to a point where our capacity will meet that demand. And so we will get there. We'll go beyond the 150. And the limiting factors are, you know, combination of machines. So getting, you know, the IVD test systems and laboratory test equipment, and particularly for laboratory developed tests. It's not just the platforms, the PCR platforms, but in our setup, you know, there's actually two other pieces that you need to consider. It's the extraction and then second is the liquid handling. And it's been some machine constraints on us for getting those systems to be able to bring up -- bring up more and more capacity, but we're working with all our suppliers to get as much as we can get to bring our capacity and take it beyond the 150. The second is just manpower. Yes, we're running 24x7. And as I mentioned in my remarks, you know, doing 8.5 million tests over the last four months, our teams are working nonstop. Remember, this is in our microbiology department that has gone from the backwater of the laboratory to front and center. And we have capacity limits around the people and those that are trained adequately to deliver on this. And then third is just, you know, physically we need to get, you know these systems in place, we need to have the adequate controls and training in place. And that just takes some time. And then fourth is, you know, the reagents. We are rate limited by how much juice we get to run all our different platform. And we're working with our suppliers and getting more. We have had some shortages with some of the suppliers and that has not helped our ability to deliver results. And so we're working actively to, you know, get them to, first of all, give us more and then secondly to be reliable, what they commit to delivering again. So now, I will also say that everyone is working incredibly well together, the IVD manufacturers working with the task force, White House working at future ideas of where we can get more capacity, we're all pushing hard to get more and more capacity. But to answer your question, those are the rate limiting factors around what we need to do to get beyond 150. But we will get it beyond 150. That's where we want to be to be able to meet the demand we see, particularly as we get into the late August, early September time. Mark Guinan : And Brian, you know, to be clear, you didn't ask this directly, but we are not being conservative. We are doing everything we can. The challenges are not financial, you know, willingness to spend more capital or for that matter, operational expense to get things up and running. They're all operational in our ability to get more equipment and, as Steve said, multiple pieces of equipment, and to get them operating and to get the people who are trained to do it. And we are, you know, moving as quickly as possible. As you said, we doubled our capacity from mid-May, you know, we're expecting another 20,000 per day increase from where we are today over the next several weeks. And then as Steve said, we're going to go beyond that. So there's no, you know, hesitancy to add capacity because of uncertainty and demand. We're doing everything we can to increase our capacity and certainly to reduce turnaround times. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Eric Coldwell from Baird. Your line is open. Eric Coldwell : Hey, thank you very much. Maybe just a couple of quick housekeeping first. I know you said that your guidance assumes PCR volumes declined in 4Q versus 3Q, I'm just curious can you give us a sense on how much what you're expecting for average daily volume in PCR in 4Q that's implicit in your guidance assumption? Steve Rusckowski : Yes, so, you know, Eric, I'm sure you can appreciate that, you know, it's not as if we have a point estimate, forecasts, you know, for every number within that range or even the high-end range, because we've got, you know, multiple factors that can move things material, you know, certainly as we mentioned, the base volume, decline or improvement relative to our assumptions is very material to the outcome. And then that PCR, you know, volume is very, very material, as well. And then finally, the reimbursement rate, you know, beyond the 90-day extension is very, very important. So, you know, there's multi variable so, you know, I really can't answer directly, but, you know, specific number because, you know, we're running scenario planning, but I would tell you that at this point, we have a significant reduction in Q4 demand to get to these guidance numbers. So it's not small, it's fairly significant. And again, not because we know that's what's going to happen, but just given the uncertainty of the volumes and the knowledge that the return to work and back to school volumes will largely be gone by Q4. Operator : Thank you. Next we have Derik de Bruin from Bank of America, your line is open. Derik de Bruin : Hi, good morning. Two questions. The first one being, can you give a little bit of color on some of the rebounds in the different categories? And then you've noted some softening in July. So can you talk about what you've sort of seen oncology versus clinchem versus pathology, just to give us a flavor on how you're seeing sort of hiccups? Steve Rusckowski : Yes. So let me characterize it this way; in primary care, I'll put OB/GYNs [ph] in that as well. We've seen a nice rebound as physicians have opened back up their offices and call back some of their patients. In some cases they have extended hours; so we've seen a nice bounce back on that piece of our demand. Secondly, as we are seeing some nice recovery in some of those -- some of those procedures that might have been pent-up and our pathology tissues have actually rebounded in a good way. We're not sure it's entirely sustainable because there might be some of this is reacted to the pent-up demand that is coming back to us that we lost in April and May and we started to see it in June that will come into the summer. And that's why when we talk about outlook, we are cautious to make sure that we're not taking the June run rate as our run rate forever in the summer. We actually might see some slowdown related to that being absorbed, if you will, through the system. And then we'll get to the run rate that we should expect for a reasonable period of time in Q3. And then, some of our other businesses; we have our life insurance business, frankly, that's down considerably, we haven't seen a big recovery there. Our pre-employment drug testing business is starting to come back as employers start to hire people but is down considerably versus 2019. Our employer population health business where we do wellness programs for employers is down considerably, many of those events have been cancelled. So, I would say it's really a wide variation with the best being primary care and the worst being those that are tied to the economy, and in general, constraints around normal programs like life insurance and wellness and hiring people. So Mark, anything you'd like to add that? Mark Guinan : Yes. I would just add that most of our base business has come back proportionally. As Steve said, oncology has really picked up recently over the last couple of weeks; we'll see how much of that was deferred pent-up demand. But the one category, it's not just in pre-employment but prescription drug monitoring; so the whole drug testing area, that's lagged a little bit some of the other franchises within the base business, not just in our employer business. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from Mike Newshel from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Mike Newshel : Thanks. Maybe just a follow-up on pooling. Is there a specific positivity rate threshold you have in mind where pooling makes sense in a particular state and region? And I know you get full reimbursement for each specimen, but how much does pooling change your cost structure? Is there a big incremental margin difference versus testing single specimens? Steve Rusckowski : Yes. So, you know, think about, you know, the best is obviously the lowest and where we pool, and we could put four specimens in a well, you know, like quadruples, your throughput per batch, if you will, and if there is zero positives, then you get it all. Where you have positives within that run, you have to test those -- that whole well, and, you know, that obviously starts to eat into the productivity game. So, the best is lower than 2%. We actually have a number of states and geographies that are in that range. Actually, right now the Northeast is doing quite well. We hope that is sustained. And then, as you start to go up to high single digits, it starts to lose it's effectiveness because of all the retesting you need to do. So clearly, less than 5% is in the sweet spot, and greater than 5% starts to get marginally worth it. But we have plenty -- if we look at pooling; again, pooling is applied to our laboratory developed tests, it's a piece of our capacity, it's going to give us more capacity to get us to that 150, and also, we believe beyond. But we're not just doing pooling to get more capacity, we're adding new systems and processes and people everything we talked about earlier. So, it will give us some of the capacity but there's other things we're doing as well. Mark Guinan : And just a reminder, that pooling is only currently possible on our LDT. And so therefore, you know, it's not as if it's going to be an expander across our whole network, and we can prioritize low prevalence areas or that LDT to a certain extent or to a large extent. And so to Steve's point, we're going to target the areas that we currently have low positivity rates. But the biggest benefit is while we do get costs -- some cost savings on reagents when you can do four samples at once instead of a single one, even despite some retesting; it's really the benefit of the capacity. So, being able to serve more people with the same equipments and more patients is really the benefit, much larger, although there is a certainly a cost of sales savings that comes with pooling. Operator : And we have no other questions. Thank you. Steve Rusckowski : Okay. Well, we appreciate the time on the phone. We appreciate the extent of your interest in our business. And we hope you, like us, are appreciative of everyone at Quest and what we're doing, and we appreciate your support as well. So have a great day everybody. Operator : Thank you for participating in the Quest Diagnostics second quarter 2020 conference call.

Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. Now I\u2019d like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President, Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead, please. Shawn Bevec : Thank you and good morning. I\u2019m here with Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and will discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that may affect Quest Diagnostics\u2019 future results include but are not limited to those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. The company continues to believe that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on future operating results, cash flows, and/or financial condition will be primarily driven by the pandemic\u2019s severity and duration, the pandemic\u2019s impact on the U.S. healthcare system and the U.S. economy, and the timing, scope and effectiveness of federal, state and local governmental responses to the pandemic which are drivers beyond the company\u2019s knowledge and control. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS from continuing operations and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations. References to base testing volumes or base business refer to testing volumes excluding COVID-19 molecular and serology testing volumes.  Finally, growth rate associated with our long term outlook projections, including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings growth are compounded annual growth rates. Now here is Steve Rusckowski. Stephen Rusckowski : Thanks Shawn, and thanks everyone for joining us today. Quest had a very strong third quarter, benefiting from continued demand from COVID-19 testing as well as the rapid recovery from healthcare utilization. We have performed over 22 million COVID-19 molecular and serology tests to date, more than any other provider. We\u2019ve also developed and introduced several new innovations that are contributing to enabling the country\u2019s ability to return to work, the classroom, and on the athletic field.  I\u2019m extremely proud of all that Quest Diagnostics has accomplished through the COVID-19 pandemic and I want to thank our 47,000 employees for their hard work and dedication.  This morning I\u2019ll discuss our performance for the quarter, our role in the COVID-19 pandemic, and update you on our non-COVID base business, and then Mark will provide more detail on the third quarter results and our updated financial outlook for the remainder of the year. Our financial performance in the third quarter was very strong. For the quarter, total revenue grew by more than 42% to $2.79 billion. Earnings per share increased by more than 164% on a reported basis to $4.14 and nearly 145% on an adjusted basis to $4.31. These results reflect continued demand for COVID-19 testing and continued recovery of our base testing volumes as healthcare systems resume non-urgent care and elective surgeries. Organic base testing volumes orders declined high single digits in July and improved in the quarter to mid to high single digit declines in September versus the prior year. Demand for COVID-19 testing came from several areas : clinical testing ordered by healthcare providers as the virus spread throughout much of the country, especially for non COVID-19 pre-surgical patients and people in high risk populations like nursing homes and prisons; in retail testing in our standard network access points, such as our drive-through sites offered across the country by CVS and Wal-Mart; workplace testing as employers sought to return employees to the job and their offices; university testing to facilitate the return of students to campus life, including sports; and our consumer testing direct testing offered by Quest Direct. We\u2019ve also demonstrated innovation and agility in bringing COVID-19 testing to our nation. In the quarter, we were granted an emergency use authorization, or EUA to offer unobserved self-collection. We were the first provider to receive an EUA due to the pandemic or [indiscernible]. Finally, we teamed up with Wal-Mart and DroneUp to pilot a program for contactless delivery of specialty kits using drones. Also in the quarter, we announced an initiative along with our Quest Diagnostics Foundation to address and reduce healthcare disparities in underserved communities, including those impacted by COVID-19. This value-based commitment builds on our existing work with [indiscernible] health centers and will focus on serving people of color, elderly and underserved populations in locations throughout the United States. Quest plans to donate testing services and fund a range of initiatives estimated to total more than $100 million. Our goal is to improve access to testing and drive awareness of value of diagnostic innovations and managing health. Before updating you on our base business, what I\u2019d like to do is comment on our recent CMS change to Medicare payment for COVID-19 testing and our decision to return the CARES Act funding to the government. In conjunction with our trade association, we\u2019ve been currently reviewing the new reimbursement policy for high throughput COVID-19 molecular testing from CMS will impact laboratory and patients we serve. Last week\u2019s announcement removes uncertainty that was an overhang on COVID-19 testing reimbursement.  Finally, we\u2019re grateful for the CARES Act funding from last spring which provided us at an important time of great uncertainty for our country. Now several months into the pandemic, we no longer require this funding and as a result, we will be returning these funds to the government. That was the right thing to do. We\u2019re making progress on our strategy to accelerate growth in the base business, so as a reminder, the five elements of our strategy to accelerate are to grow more than 2% per year through strategically aligned, accretive acquisitions; expand relationships with health plan and hospital health systems; offer the broadest access to diagnostic innovation; be recognized as the consumer friendly provider of diagnostic information services; and then finally, support population health with data analytics and extended care services.  Now I\u2019ll share a few highlights from our strategy to accelerate growth. Our M&A pipeline remains strong. Since the second quarter, we close our acquisition of Mid America Clinical Laboratories, referred to as MACL, which is Indiana, and we did a couple two small tuck-in acquisitions. Our recent acquisitions have been performing well during the pandemic; for example, our Memorial Hermann outreach acquisition announced earlier this year, as well as this recent MACL acquisition have driven growth in both COVID-19 testing and our base business. We\u2019ve also seen growth in advanced diagnostics from our acquisition of Blueprint Genetics.  The second growth driver, expanding relationships with health plan and hospital health systems is also delivering. Our hospital reference testing volumes excluding COVID-19 have returned to growth year over year. Given the challenges that hospitals are facing, we expect many more to be open to discussions about how Quest can help them achieve their lab strategy, so in professional lab services this year we have logged a record amount of bookings, represent larger and longer term agreements than in the past.  We also continue to make progress on our health plan strategy. Within the UnitedHealthcare preferred laboratory network, we\u2019re helping United reduce out-of-PLN lab spending through the previously announced zero out-of-pocket benefit. In addition, United has added enhancements that reduce the administrative burden for physicians and patients related to those tests requiring preauthorization. Then in August, we entered into a new strategic relationship with Anthem in 12 states. We\u2019re working with Anthem to improve quality and efficiency in delivery of laboratory services. Then finally, additionally we\u2019re working with major national payors to enable their members to access COVID-19 testing through Quest\u2019s relationships with major retailers. We made progress on our third element of our strategy to accelerate growth by offering the broadest access to innovation. In the quarter, we launched three new combined COVID-19 and respiratory virus tests, reducing time for physician to diagnose and treat patients by identifying nearly 20 viral and bacterial infections from a single swab. We also launched our automated next generation sequencing solution that enables individuals to access genetic testing insights about hereditary diseases at consumer price points through Ancestry Health.  Finally, we grew our direct-to-consumer services in the quarter. Quest Direct test offerings continue to resonate with consumers. In the quarter, we launched our COVID-19 active infection test, offering consumers a choice of using an at-home kit or getting the specimen collection done at a drive-through location. Also, we made remarkable progress in the surge of sign-ups to our My Quest patient portal. Today, roughly 13 million patients have a My Quest account to make appointments or receive their results through their smartphone or their computer. In the third quarter, on average more than 100,000 patients per week signed up for this service. This is more than double the rate we experienced before the pandemic. Now, the second part of our two-point strategy is to drive operational excellence by continuing to pursue our goals to reduce our cost base by 3% per year. We also see more opportunities ahead to drive further productivity gains while at the same time enhancing our customer experience and overall service levels.  Here\u2019s a couple of examples. We have standardized on the Siemens immunoassay platform in 14 of our 18 regional laboratories. The solution drives workflow efficiencies and has enabled more than a 50% reduction in our equipment footprint. We are still in the early stages of these realized savings but so far, we\u2019re pleased with this progress. Then also, our new flagship laboratory in Clifton, New Jersey is being prepared to go live in early 2021. When complete, this state of the art facility will be the most highly automated in our laboratory network and will represent the final regional lab to be converted to our standard operational system, which we call [indiscernible]. This will mark the culmination of a multi-year initiative to simplify, streamline and standardize our regional laboratory operations.  Now I\u2019d like to turn it over to Mark to take you through the results and update you on our outlook. Mark? Mark Guinan : Thanks Steve. In the third quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.79 billion, up roughly 43% versus the prior year. Revenues for diagnostic information services grew approximately 44% compared to the prior year, which reflected significant demand for COVID-19 testing services offset by a modest decline in base testing volumes. Volume measured by the number of requisitions increased 19.7% versus the prior year with acquisitions contributing approximately 3%.  We continued to experience improving performance in our base business in the third quarter. Orders for organic base testing compared to our pre-pandemic business declined high single digits in July and improved to a mid to high single digit decline in September versus the prior year. For the entire third quarter, base testing volumes declined roughly 5% versus the prior year and benefited from recent M&A and the new PLS [indiscernible] that Steve highlighted earlier.  We also experienced a significant contribution from COVID-19 testing during the third quarter, performing approximately 9.9 million molecular tests and 1.5 million serology tests. We exited the third quarter averaging approximately 93,000 COVID-19 molecular and 11,000 serology tests per day. Revenue per requisition increased 20.9% versus the prior year, driven largely by COVID-19 testing. This was partially offset by unit price headwinds of approximately 1.7% in the third quarter, in line with our prior expectations. This included the ongoing impact of PAMA.  Reported operating income was $718 million or 25.8% of revenues compared to $313 million or 16% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $831 million or 29.8% of revenues compared to $349 million or 17.9% of revenues last year. The year-over-year increase in operating margin was driven by strong revenue growth in the third quarter, reflecting the relatively high drop-through on incremental volume in our business. Reported EPS was $4.14 in the quarter compared to $1.56 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $4.31 compared to $1.76 last year.  Cash provided by operations was approximately $1.46 billion year to date through September 30 versus $895 million in the same period last year. Cash from operations in the third quarter includes approximately $138 million of provider relief under the CARES Act. As a result of our strong financial position, we are planning to return the entire CARES Act funding we received, which Steve noted earlier. Additionally, we are accelerating the redemption of our senior notes maturing in April of 2021. We will use the proceeds of the bond offering that we completed in May 2020 to repay these notes. We expect to complete the early debt redemption in November. Turning to guidance, we raised our full year 2020 outlook as follows : revenues now expected to be between $8.8 billion and $9.1 billion, an increase of approximately 13.9% to 17.8% versus the prior year; reported EPS expected to be in a range of $8.22 to $9.22 and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $9 to $10; cash provided by operations is expected to be at least $1.75 billion, and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million. We continue to operate under the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Continued recovery in the base business as well as demand for and duration of COVID-19 molecular testing are significant swing factors that remain challenging to forecast. With that high degree of uncertainty in mind, please consider the following : the midpoint of our full year outlook generally assumes base testing volumes to remain modestly below last prior year levels as we exit 2020; COVID-19 testing volumes averaging nearly 90,000 tests per day for the molecular test and 10,000 tests per day for the serology test in Q4; COVID-19 molecular reimbursement generally stable with recent trends. Our performance through mid October is slightly above these assumptions, but again our guidance reflects the uncertainty of the current environment. Finally, as Steve mentioned, we are currently in the early stages of launching our recently announced initiatives with the Quest Foundation to reduce heath disparities in underserved communities. As we move forward, we expect to exclude the costs associated with this multi-year initiative in determining our adjusted results. While we aren\u2019t prepared to share a detailed outlook for 2021 today, I\u2019d like to offer some considerations for next year. First, we are likely to have an easy compare in our base business for much of the year, especially in Q2. Second, demand for COVID-19 testing is likely to persist well into 2021. We believe that molecular PCR testing will continue to play a very important role in diagnosing, tracking and tracing active COVID-19 infections and that there will eventually be a growing need for serology testing as vaccines and additional therapies come to the market. Third, we are working to understand the details of the recent CMS announcement regarding COVID-19 molecular reimbursement for 2021, and finally as a reminder, there will be no Medicare reimbursement costs under PAMA in 2021 given the one-year delay included in the CARES Act. I will now turn it back to Steve. Stephen Rusckowski : Thanks Mark. To summarize, we had a very strong third quarter and have performed over 22 million COVID-19 molecular and serology tests to date. We\u2019ve also developed and introduced a number of new innovations allowing the country to get back to work, into the classroom, and onto the athletic fields. We\u2019ve seen further signs of recovery in healthcare utilization as our base testing volume continued to recover rapidly throughout the third quarter. Finally, again I\u2019m extremely proud of all that Quest Diagnostics has accomplished throughout this very difficult time, and I thank all the 42,000 people at Quest Diagnostics for all their hard work and dedication. Now we\u2019d be happy to take any of your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator instructions] The first question is from Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities. Your line is now open. Ann Hynes : Hi, good morning. How\u2019s everything? I just wanted to touch back on your comments, Mark, about the reimbursement for next year. I know that a lot still is unknown, but just for modeling purposes, maybe can you talk about your current turnaround time, what you expect your molecular capacity to be by that time in January, and should we assume would you need to make any more further investments to be able to get that $100 reimbursement for molecular test?  My second question is just about cash flow - obviously it\u2019s very elevated because of all the testing. What do you expect--how do expect to deploy that once you\u2019re able to, and maybe about timing the cash deployment since it\u2019s very elevated? Thanks. Stephen Rusckowski : Let me start with the operational piece of that, Ann. First of all, we\u2019re running about a capacity of 200,000 tests per day, even though what you heard from our guidance is less than that in terms of actual results. We\u2019ve done that for two reasons. One is to be prepared for the fall where we\u2019re anticipating further demand for COVID-19 testing, and then secondly is when we have more capacity and we result less, it helps us with turnaround time, so I\u2019m happy to share that right now we\u2019re averaging less than two days for testing for COVID-19. What I\u2019ll also say, as I said in my early introductory remarks, we\u2019re trying to understand the exact guidelines, and I\u2019m sure there will be more detail from CMS In terms of recovery--excuse me, reimbursement changes. When we\u2019re looking at turnaround times, we\u2019re looking at it today from specimen collection to results, and that\u2019s also by calendar day, and there will be more specificity on this from CMS but--you know, there will be more clarity around that.  So we\u2019re performing well with, I think, capacity versus our demand, and we\u2019re not stopping there. We\u2019re actually increasing our capacity as we speak. We\u2019re working out some of the last capacity we can get out of some of the new systems we put in place, and secondly we\u2019re looking at applying pooling to some of our IBB platforms, so that should get us to eventually coming out of this year at 250,000 per day versus the 200,000 today, so we should be able to meet the demand and keep our turnaround times at the level I\u2019ve already indicated. Mark? Mark Guinan : Yes, so just to add to that, Ann, the devil\u2019s in the details. We need to understand exactly when the clock starts on turnaround time. Based on where we think it should end up, we expect to be in very good shape around meeting the criteria. At this point, assume we have to get more than half of those tests turned around in two days or less, and obviously we need clarification and certainty around that, and that\u2019s for obviously Medicare, and we still also need to work through some of the issues with the commercial payors as well to understand how it\u2019s going to work with them. That\u2019s why we\u2019re cautious in terms of committing too much to what this pronouncement by CMS means. We have a lot of work to do, but certainly we\u2019re optimistic as we look at it that we should be able to meet that requirement. On cash flow, as you see, we\u2019re obviously feeling much better about our cash flow at this point. The fact that we\u2019re repaying the debt early from April that we issued as a pre-issuance in May shows our confidence, returning $138 million which of course is deducted from our projection when I said at least $4.75 billion, so we\u2019re expecting a very strong cash year. You know, Steve mentioned we have a very strong M&A pipeline, and I\u2019ve said many time to investors I would prefer to do M&A because when we do it, we\u2019re highly confident that that\u2019s a better return for our shareholders, but we do have very strict criteria. We have to find deals that meet those criteria, so I\u2019m optimistic that we will deploy a chunk of that for M&A and then at some point you can expect us to return to our normal capital strategy as we move forward throughout the calendar year, or early next year. Ann Hynes : Great, thanks. Operator : The next question is from Stephen Baxter with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Stephen Baxter : Hi, thanks for the question. I wanted to ask you about the progression of core volumes for the quarter. I believe you said August core volumes were down mid to high single digits, and then in today\u2019s release I think it also has the September exit rate at about the same level, down mid singles to high singles. This would seem to suggest that the baseline volume return to normal has slowed a little bit. Is that consistent with what you guys have actually experienced, and if so, what do you think needs to happen to see it improve further? If it\u2019s not, what\u2019s the nuance that I\u2019m missing? Then just to put a final point on it, does guidance assume you see a continuing improvement from the September exit rate or basically a continuation at that level? Thank you. Mark Guinan : Thanks for the question, Stephen. As we mentioned, volume improved from July, so really September versus August is fairly flat, so yes, there was a little stagnation in improvement in the baseline, not completely surprising given the recent uptick in COVID again. So it hasn\u2019t gotten worse for us, but it did not continue its improvement, and that\u2019s why when I talked about what we expect in Q4, we don\u2019t expect a full recovery any time this calendar year. Obviously we have a very broad range - $300 million, so within that range there\u2019s multi variables, but in terms of the base business, we\u2019re not counting on in the middle of that a complete recovery. We\u2019re not expecting it to move materially away from where it\u2019s been the last couple months, but that would kind of get you to that lower end and upper end of the range, depending on that along, of course, with COVID testing as well, where they go from that midpoint. So not counting on anything, but certainly improvement could lead us toward that upper end, and if it eroded a little bit, it could lead us towards the lower end of our guidance. Stephen Rusckowski : Yes, and we\u2019re watching that carefully. If you go back and hear what I said, we started off July at high single digits, and then also as I indicated in September, it was mid to high, so slight improvement there but we\u2019re watching it as we enter the fourth quarter and as we sit here in the fourth quarter in October. Operator : The next question is from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Ricky Goldwasser : Hi, good morning. I have a question on the gross margins. You came in meaningfully higher than us - clearly we\u2019re seeing the benefits of the return of core volumes. But can you maybe help us quantify, off the gross margin that we saw in the quarter, what is coming from the return of core versus realized price for COVID testing? We understand the reimbursement, but also we\u2019re hearing you talk a lot more about direct-to-consumer testing, which I\u2019m assuming comes with a higher price point, so if we can just get a little bit more clarity on that. Mark Guinan : Sure, so Ricky, first I\u2019ll confirm that direct-to-consumer does come with a higher price point. Certainly there are other expenses that go with direct-to-consumer. We\u2019ve actually invested incrementally in some marketing to drive awareness and so on, but from a gross margin perspective, the consumer testing is higher than our core business. Recall even though we feel good about that business, it\u2019s still a very small part of our overall enterprise. Then between COVID and base, obviously we don\u2019t get into gross margin on specific test offerings, but the one benefit I will point out on COVID is that there\u2019s no patient responsibility, so when you think about it - and I don\u2019t have the precise numbers, but just let\u2019s say because our overall enterprise, about 20% of our revenues come from patients, if we collect, as we\u2019ve shared, $0.70 on the dollar, you can imagine that there is about a 6% higher margin on that particular business because it\u2019s 100 reimbursed by payors instead of having any patient responsibility, so there is some benefit to the gross margin. But in COVID, it really is unrelated to price and really has everything to do with the coverage policies and not having that inability to collect all the money that we\u2019re due. Ricky Goldwasser : Great, and just one follow-up, if I may. You gave us some early puts and takes for 2021. We\u2019re starting to hear some companies that are accelerating hiring in preparation for next year. When you think about increasing first serology associated with COVID vaccines, etc., should we assume a step-up in costs related to increased hiring in preparation for that? Stephen Rusckowski : Yes, so Ricky we managed our workforce carefully over the last six to nine months. As you\u2019ll recall, the second quarter we had to trim down our workforce, so we furloughed over 6,000 people, we reduced work schedules, we cut salaries including myself and Mark and our board, and then we saw the steady recovery in our base business coupled with the COVID testing that we\u2019ve done. So we\u2019ve reinstated salaries, we have brought back full work weeks and we\u2019ve brought back the vast majority of the furloughed employees, and actually we\u2019ve hired people, so we\u2019ve hired people where we need to hire people, particularly in areas like specimen processing. You can see with the volumes we\u2019re seeing, you have to have a lot of people to receive all these specimens to sort it out before they go into the lab. But I\u2019ll tell you, we\u2019re still being very, very careful before we add another person. We\u2019re being very careful in overhead, and Mark can go through exactly what\u2019s in our expenses, but we\u2019ve been very limited in hiring in our expense categories and will continue to be very [indiscernible] with our hiring for our overhead with our laboratory operations and our operations in general. The reason for that is we want to make sure we don\u2019t\u2019 get ahead of ourselves. We feel we got good leverage in the third quarter, as you see, and we believe we have a workforce in place to manage the demand we\u2019re getting right now. We\u2019re constantly looking at what we think the future demand will be, but we want to make sure we don\u2019t get ahead of ourselves. We indicated what we think the fourth quarter\u2019s going to be. We are building capacity to get more COVID-19 testing done. We have plenty of capacity available for serology without adding a lot of staff, with the exception of some of the volume based jobs as I mentioned, and so as we get deeper into the fourth quarter and we get into the beginning of next year, we\u2019ll then assess if we need to add some people. But so far, we\u2019ve done some modest hiring, we\u2019re back to full workforce, and we\u2019re watching it, frankly, daily and we want to make sure we don\u2019t add people before we need them. Mark Guinan : Yes, so we don\u2019t have any proactive plans to add resources, Ricky. We\u2019re going to continue to monitor demand in our business, and we have the flexibility generally to ramp in a fairly short window as volumes move in one direction or the other. I can confirm no plan to add to the expense base in Q4 in anticipation of anything next year at this point. Stephen Rusckowski : And interestingly enough, this is a last point because we do have this natural hedge on this, is despite where we are with the economy, we still have attrition in some of our draws, so we\u2019re in some places still trying to keep up. There are other options for people particularly with some of our non-exempt employment jobs, and therefore if things turn down, we could carefully turn off our spigot as well. Shawn Bevec : Operator, next question? Operator : Next question is from Ralph Giacobbe from Citi. Your line is now open. Ralph Giacobbe : Great, thanks. Good morning. I want to go back to the reimbursement comments, and specifically in your prepared remarks on the CMS reimbursement tweak and it removing an overhang. I guess I just want to be clear on what the expectation is now, sort of post the PHE period, assuming you meet those turnaround times. Does it sustain the $100 level, am I interpreting that right or not?  And then second piece is related just post that PHE period, my understanding is the commercial rate for COVID will be the default to your contracted rate, or there\u2019s a rate negotiation that takes place. Is that correct, and then how should we think of that commercial rate off the $100 baseline? Thanks. Stephen Rusckowski : Yes, so let me start with where we saw some uncertainty and therefore the word we used, overhang. First of all, for this year we had some uncertainty, as you know, in the third quarter about the emergency order that\u2019s in place, and that was extended to October. We are hopeful that the rate would continue at $100, and it\u2019s our expectation given that the new rate changes with the incentive that we outlined [indiscernible] on January, so therefore we\u2019re assuming the $100 for reimbursement for the remainder of this year. But up until we heard this, there was some uncertainty about 2020. Then secondly, in 2021 remember the original rate was at $51 and it went up to $100, and so therefore the new reimbursement that\u2019s being spoken of, again if you get the turnaround time of two days, you\u2019re at $100, if you don\u2019t, it\u2019s $75, so that removes some of that uncertainty of it reverting back to where it was before we got the bump from $51 to $100.  Mark, do you want to take it on the commercial side? Mark Guinan : Yes, generally it\u2019s a renegotiation, Ralph. We had provisions in our contracts for new tests, and certainly the high throughput COVID-19 molecular test is one of those, so there is no provision for it to default automatically to any sort of relationship to CMS or what have you. We had to negotiate that, and I was successful in getting it to match CMS\u2019 rate, and certainly as we go forward we\u2019re going to have to continue to talk to our commercial payors and negotiate. There\u2019s no set answer at this point to where commercial reimbursement might go. Shawn Bevec : Operator, next question? Operator : The next question is from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Your line is now open. Jack Meehan : Hey, good morning. Wanted to dig in a little bit on the commentary around core volumes. Just a clarification first - I think you said the core was down mid single digits. Does that include M&A, just to bridge versus the monthly commentary? Then as you look out to 2021, do you think routine demand can return to the pre-COVID baseline or is there some reason why you think it might struggle to get back to 100%? Mark Guinan : The core volumes, I want to be clear, for the quarter were mid to high single digits with an improvement from July into August, and then fairly flat in September, and that was an apples to apples comparison, so M&A puts those core volumes in a better place and then also some of the new POS deals. But we didn\u2019t want to confound utilization by just reporting the base business. We wanted you to understand the apples to apples, almost same store analysis, and that\u2019s the one where we\u2019re down mid to slightly higher single digits for the full quarter. In terms of next year, like everybody else, we\u2019re trying to figure out how quickly things might recover and to what extent. We\u2019re looking at all the same reports you are. Given the continued [indiscernible] utilization given the potential for the economy to have impact on utilization and other uncertainties, at this point we\u2019re not expecting any time soon to get the base volume back to the pre-pandemic levels, but with that said, it doesn\u2019t mean it couldn\u2019t happen. We\u2019re just not at this point assuming it, and while we haven\u2019t given guidance for 2021, we wanted to just give some of our initial thinking. But obviously when we come out with guidance, we\u2019re going to give you specifics around what those assumptions are, and at that point we\u2019ll have a lot more information. Stephen Rusckowski : Some color around--you know, we\u2019ve got variation around geography and around clinical franchises, so by way of example, New York City has still not recovered and we have a fair business in New York, so if you look at the percentage overall that\u2019s affected by New York not recovering. There\u2019s other parts of the country that are fully recovered, so we\u2019re watching that carefully and we\u2019re watching it by city. If things change by city or state, we can understand the consequence of that.  Then secondly, we\u2019ve got some clinical franchises that are back to pre-pandemic levels but we still have the laggers. We have our prescription drug monitoring business which is still below pre-pandemic levels, so if you look at it from a couple different dimensions, you can understand why we\u2019re below pre-pandemic, and then what it takes to get back to where we were going into 2020 and potentially get above it, it will require some of these areas to get back to normal levels that we saw in the winter months, before we hit the pandemic in March. Mark Guinan : To Steve\u2019s point, there is a lot of complexity. We actually do have some geographies that are growing year over year, and then we have some like--and it\u2019s really [indiscernible]. If you look at Long Island, you look at Westchester County, you look at New Jersey right outside of Manhattan, they\u2019re in much better shape than Manhattan is, and we aren\u2019t sure whether that has anything to do with physician office and so on. We think it might be fewer commuters going into the city, they\u2019re getting their work done elsewhere instead of while they\u2019re at work during the day. But certainly we don\u2019t have any specific information on that at this point. Operator : The next question is from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Erin Wright : Great, thanks for the question. Overall, how are you thinking about the competitive dynamics between the point-of-care rapid testing capabilities in your COVID offerings, or should we be thinking about it as testing to get testing in this sort of environment? Then I guess a broader question here too, how are you thinking about consumer behavior when it comes to diagnostic testing in a post-COVID world? Will this inherently expedite some of your direct-to-consumer initiatives here, or does it change or affect any of those efforts, such as Quest Direct and other consumer initiatives, and will this be dramatically more meaningful from a financial perspective for you in the coming years? Thanks. Stephen Rusckowski : Yes, thanks. I\u2019ll take the first part around point-of-care solutions. As you know, there\u2019s two point-of-care solutions. One of the point-of-care diagnostic solutions that were out there for some time provided by IBD manufacturers, and for all intents and purposes they were there for a number of months and they provided a role. Then most recently, I believe you are referring to what\u2019s happening with the antigen testing. We do believe there will be a role for antigen testing, particularly for monitoring and surveillance of a population. But we do understand for a lot of reasons why PCR and the return to the lab model is going to continue to be the gold standard. One of the reasons for that, depending upon the quality of the antigen testing that might be applied, there are requirements around reflex testing to PCR for both positives and negatives, and also we believe that physicians do prefer PCR testing, and when we\u2019re offered, it means flu respiratory panel and COVID tests that will be a PCR, and we think with the flu season coming out that we are going to get some demand for it as well. So we believe that antigen testing will be a necessary part of our portfolio and we do expect to be bringing out a solution for antigen testing as part of our services we offer, but it will be complementary to the PCR testing that we\u2019re currently doing. Hopefully that provides some clarity of what we think the role will be. Then finally on the consumer piece, we do believe that there is increased interest in our direct-to-consumer offerings for the basic testing. As you all know, a number of patients have not gone to their doctors as they should. We do believe there is an opportunity for them to have their lipid panel checked for their cholesterol, make sure the statins are working properly - you know, [indiscernible] glucose A1c, sexually transmitted diseases. As we\u2019ve mentioned, we\u2019ve brought up serology testing direct to consumer and most recently COVID-19 testing. We believe there is interest in a very convenient approach to getting testing, and we couple this with a telehealth physician consult as part of our service and we do believe going forward, there is going to be increased demand for both telehealth in terms of its role in our business overall, and then secondly is testing and getting that either indirectly through Quest Direct or getting that through a telehealth provider as well. We\u2019re very well positioned in that regard with our relationships with telehealth companies but also with Quest Direct. Before the pandemic, we kicked this program off, and so we have a nice platform that\u2019s been building up volume and we feel that there\u2019s going to be more opportunities in front of us as the demand, given the circumstances, continues to have a lot of interest from consumers. Shawn Bevec : Operator, next question? Operator : The next question is from Donald Hooker from Keybanc. Your line is now open. Donald Hooker : Great, good morning. There\u2019s a lot being talked about here, a lot of topics, but one thing that jumped out for me in your prepared remarks was the record bookings in POS. I was wondering if it\u2019s possible to maybe size or scope that. I suspect I know why that might be the case, but I\u2019d also love to hear your perspective on what you think is going on there, if it speaks to maybe the health of the hospital environment as well. Stephen Rusckowski : Yes, well we\u2019re encouraged. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the hospital business is actually growing again versus last year, and that\u2019s encouraging, and that\u2019s without COVID-19, so that\u2019s an encouraging trend. We see hospitals back in business and we\u2019re seeing the testing that you would expect from those hospitals, and we\u2019re doing well in that marketplace. This is where what we traditionally called our reference testing business. Then in addition to this, over the years we have built up a professional lab services business. This isn\u2019t just a new program - we\u2019ve been working on this for over five or six years, and we\u2019ve built up a nice portfolio of referenceable accounts and that\u2019s serving us well. We are penning a number of long term, multi-year contracts this year that will provide growth for us in \u201921 for certain, and we see continued growing interest from integrated delivery systems on how we can help them with their lab strategy. As you know, many of these hospital systems are having a difficult time through the pandemic, and now speaking with many of the CEOs, and I actually had a conversation Tuesday with one, they\u2019re looking at a variety of options to get more efficient, get more effective. One of the areas that we\u2019ve talked about for years, and I think it\u2019s going to keep building momentum, is walking in and having a conversation around their lab strategy, which includes the reference testing, the sophisticate testing they send out, how it can help save their money through the acute care laboratory. Then it does beg the question of what they do with their outreach business, and in some cases they sell that to us, and that\u2019s what we did with Memorial Hermann this year, with MACL, and we\u2019re seeing more and more prospects.  So it continues to receive strong interest, and this year was really a banner year for bookings, and we\u2019ll see that in the growth in \u201921. Mark, anything you\u2019d like to add to that? Mark Guinan : Yes Don, as you know, we don\u2019t generally prospectively announce the size of a contract, but what we will see as we report our quarterly results and we talk about our growth and where it\u2019s coming from, the POS contribution, so certainly moving forward you\u2019re going to see the evidence of what Steve just talked about in some of these very large bookings and deals that we\u2019re just starting to implement and that will accelerate our growth into 2021. Shawn Bevec : Operator, next question? Operator : The next question is from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Your line is now open. Kevin Caliendo : Hey guys. I have a two-part question here. I guess I don\u2019t understand why you expect COVID volumes to be down from your current levels given COVID is likely to increase - we\u2019re already seeing the outbreaks for the 4Q. But even if they are, like just say it\u2019s 90 versus the 100 pace that we\u2019re at now, the margin assumption for 4Q is still meaningfully lower. Maybe Ricky was asking about this earlier, but is there any additional costs - bonuses or anything that maybe you\u2019re going to do in the fourth quarter that you didn\u2019t do a year ago, that would suggest the margin sequentially falling, given your guidance? Mark Guinan : Yes, so I did not intend to imply that PCR volumes will be reduced in Q4. Actually the midpoint of the guidance assumes it stays where it is, where we are right now, and as I shared, through the first couple of weeks of October we\u2019re actually slightly ahead of the midpoint of guidance. I wanted to clarify that. In terms of margin, really nothing of significance. We did have in Q3 a significant catch-up expense on our bonus. As I\u2019m sure you could imagine, early in the year we were projecting to significantly miss our targets, and then Q3 really reversed that and got us to a point where we\u2019re expected to exceed our targets, so in Q4 we would just have, assuming we deliver, the Q4 proportion of that.  So actually, there was in Q3 a significant incremental expense to catch up our bonuses that will not be repeated in Q4, so there\u2019s nothing of huge significance other than there are some of the cost actions that Steve referenced that we have reinstated to normalcy, so we did have some reductions in July on salaries and in Q4, those will be fully to where they were pre-pandemic, and then we did reinstate the 401K match late in Q3 and that will be fully reinstated in Q4. So there are a couple of what I\u2019d call headwinds, but those are really just returning us to pre-pandemic levels, and then normally in Q4 we just have some other margin pressures, given the holidays and some other things that we manage through, but nothing of note. Finally, there is a small amount of incremental investment. I referenced on the things that we\u2019re doing around supporting our consumer business. We want to continue to build that business. We think it\u2019s going to be increasingly important, and so we do have the opportunity given our business performance to invest, and so there\u2019s a little bit of commercial investment into our consumer business that\u2019s a step up from where it\u2019s been in Q3. Operator : The next question is from Pito Chickering from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Pito Chickering : Good morning guys. Thank you for taking my questions.  Two quick ones for you. Now that you\u2019ve more experience with the preferred lab networks, what leverage do you think plays a bigger impact with changing consumer behavior? Is it the zero co-pays for the consumer or is it the lower admin burden from the referral sources? Also a quick follow-up on the core organic volumes - you mentioned seeing geographic pressure in New York City. Is geographic weakness a primary driver that you\u2019re seeing across your book of business, or is it more broad-based specialties like Pantox that haven\u2019t recovered yet? Thanks so much. Stephen Rusckowski : We continue to work on our relationship with UnitedHealthcare. As we said, in \u201919 we made some really good progress picking up share related to the PLN. We had a lot of things to do in the fall of 2019 related to employers, zero out of pocket and preauthorization work, and we really felt good about January and February. We actually did see a nice progression of our volumes and then we hit the pandemic in March.  We continue to work those programs and matter of fact, this week I was spending time with United on this and we continue to work on everything we can do to move more of their lab purchases to the PLN, and obviously specifically to us, and there will be other programs that we\u2019re working with them by geography, by state to be able to make sure that employers and patients and integrated delivery systems understand the value of what we deliver. Remember if you go back to where we started, we believe that by the improvement in access with United and Verizon and Anthem in Georgia as of the time of our last investor day, it afforded us about a $4 billion opportunity in market, and we believe that we should be able to get about 25% of that. We received some of that in 2019 and we believe there\u2019s more opportunity in front of us. So what I can share with you is we continue that work in 2020 and we do expect it will continue to help us pick up some share in \u201921 to accelerate our growth. Mark Guinan : I just want to remind everyone, Pito, that the zero out of pocket still has a ways to go, so they started with their fully insured small plans and then expanded it, and then it\u2019s going to go out to the sponsored plans. Obviously that\u2019s marketed to the employers who are paying those bills, and the good news is we\u2019re collaborating with them on that and trying to demonstrate how that will save the employers a whole lot of money. To this point, most of the movement has been through other activity, things that United has done to encourage physicians to stop using out-of-network providers, having us go in and show them the benefits of moving that lab ordering to us and the PLN member, but still a lot of runway in front of us in terms of how that might benefit. The lower burden is really just a new thing. We\u2019re putting in some pretty significant requirements around some of the higher cost testing, and they realize that two things - one is that the PLN members can really have more responsible panels or an approach to clinical testing. The second thing is obviously we have good prices as compared to some of the other providers, and we\u2019ve mentioned in the past that some of the managed Medicaid payors, so outside of United, have used this approach in specifically toxicology to drive better value. You know, with toxicology exploding over the last couple years, they put in some very tight restrictions on utilization, and seeing that the national labs tend to do this responsibly and have better prices, they exempted us from a pre-auth. So not only does it make it easier on physicians and patients, but it tends to steer more work to us because the administrative burden is lower. United sees that in the same areas where they\u2019re trying to control some of the growth in high cost testing, but that benefit to us is to come yet. Operator : Next question is from Matt Larew with William Blair. Your line is now open. Matt Larew : Good morning. We\u2019re in the early weeks of the traditional flu season, so I had a couple questions. First, what are your expectations going in with respect to potentially higher vaccine rates or social distancing? What are you hearing from physicians about approaches to flu versus potentially flu with COVID, or flu-RSV-COVID combos in symptomatic versus asymptomatic, and then what are you hearing about with respect to reimbursement on those combo offerings versus the individual analytes? Thanks. Stephen Rusckowski : Matt, we\u2019re watching it carefully. We believe that when somebody presents themselves with symptoms, they want to rule out COVID, and we believe that PCR testing will be the option. As we mentioned, we brought out a new solution which we feel really good about - with a single swab, you can test for influenza, you can also test for other viral and bacterial issues, and that is going to be very convenient for physicians just to quickly diagnose and then treat the patients effectively. Now what you bring up, we\u2019re watching it carefully because with all of us being socially distant and all of us doing a better job of hygiene and schools not being entirely back in session, it might actually lower the infection rate this year, but we\u2019re not certain of that, and so we\u2019re watching that. Mark, do you want to talk about reimbursement for some of the-- Mark Guinan : Yes, you know, it\u2019s still to be determined. Basically for reference, CPT code 87631, which is the respiratory multiplex panel with three to five targets is $142 today; 87632, with six to 11 targets, is $218, and then 87631 reflux with 12 to 25 targets is $416, so still to be determined exactly where we come out on this. Still have negotiations with the commercial payors, but at least we could reference in the past for some of these multiplex panels, you know, the reimbursement is reasonable. Shawn Bevec : Operator, next question? Operator : Next question is from Brian Tanquilut. Your line is now open. Brian Tanquilut : Hey, good morning guys, and congrats on a good quarter.  I guess my question to you guys, you talked about serology and how that plays into the 2021 outlook. How are you thinking about the ramp of that, and what are the conversations right now with payors on potential coverage or likely coverage for serology once the vaccine is out? Stephen Rusckowski : Yes, we\u2019re doing our share of serology, running around 10,000 per day. We\u2019ve got plenty of capacity in front of us. We believe it\u2019s going to play an increasingly important role as we get into 2021, as the vaccine becomes available. We\u2019re actively engaged with those pharmaceutical companies that are doing the trials for the vaccine and trying to understand where we might play a role [indiscernible] either with the vaccine or post vaccine, and serology has a role there.  We\u2019re also doing some serology population health testing. We\u2019ve done some work for states and we\u2019re doing work for the CDC, and we believe that that work will continue to give us a good handle on what is happening with the progression of disease and have an early warning signal if we\u2019re moving in the wrong direction, so more to come. We\u2019re working through that. We do believe it\u2019s going to be a growing and bigger opportunity in 2021 and more visibility of that as we understand where the vaccine is, understand the progression of where we are with the pandemic.  Then also, we will be bringing new solutions out to the marketplace that will provide more and more utility around serology, and more to come on that. But we\u2019re working on the science and we believe there\u2019s more we can do to contribute towards the pandemic as we go, particularly as we see how the pandemic progresses. Mark Guinan : In terms of discussions with the payors, it\u2019s still early, Brian. There is not clarity around the exact role that serology is going to play, and while we believe there is going to be an important role, it\u2019s not at a point where we\u2019re in detailed discussions with the payors yet. Operator : The next question is from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Derik de Bruin : Hey, great. Thanks for fitting me in. Just a question, a quick question on the impact on the business from pooling. How much of the samples are being pooled right now, and what are the economics on that and the reimbursement for that? How much is your cost savings, and I guess how much of the volumes do you think can ultimately be pooled, realizing the fact is you\u2019ve got to have low pandemic areas to do it. Just your thoughts on that for the business. Stephen Rusckowski : Yes, sure. Remember we talked about 200,000 tests per day for capacity, and [indiscernible] resulted in the third quarter about 100,000 per day. Roughly 20% to 25% of that volume is done on what we call our LDTs, and that\u2019s where we\u2019ve been leveraging the pooling capability. It\u2019s particularly useful. It has good improvements in productivity and efficiency where you have low prevalence populations because when you do the pooling, when one well lights up, you have to test for that well, and you get a few 14, 15% positivity rates in locations, the mask doesn\u2019t mark it out any more, so we\u2019re applying it in the right way. It\u2019s primarily around our LDT portion of our capacity. What I mentioned in earlier comments was we\u2019re looking at applying that to our IBD platform as well, and that will be helpful in moving our capacity from 200 up to 250. Mark Guinan : Yes, and just to remind everyone, as Steve said, the efficiency is really highly dependent on the positivity rate, and while we do save on reagents, it\u2019s not an order of magnitude less expensive. The real economic benefit of pooling comes from capacity increase, so our ability to do more testing and the margins we get on that testing, not a huge difference. There is a benefit but not a huge difference in the cost per individual test that we pool. Operator : The next question is from Lisa Gill from JP Morgan. Your line is now open. Lisa Gill : Good morning. I just want to go back to the guidance that Mark gave, or kind of preliminary thoughts for 2021, and just understand a couple things a little bit better. When we think about the base business, what\u2019s your expectation around unemployment trends, and as we think about the near term, what we\u2019ve seen in the last few months, do think that unemployment is having any impact on your core volume? Then secondly, when we think about COVID and we think about PCR testing persisting into 2021, do we think about that just in the first part of the year, and when we think about a potential vaccine, what are your thoughts around PCR testing? I understand your comments around serology, but how do we think about PCR testing playing into a vaccine? Stephen Rusckowski : Mark, you want to start with \u201921 comments and the economy? Mark Guinan : Yes, so Lisa, it\u2019s hard to know specifically what\u2019s driving the dampened utilization. Certainly things have opened up a lot more than they were in the spring, so whereas physician offices were closed, I think there was a huge fear in a large part of the population around engaging with the healthcare system at all because of the risk potentially of catching COVID when you went into a physician office. While I wouldn\u2019t suggest that\u2019s eliminated, certainly that has improved dramatically, so there is some overhang left there certainly but the unemployment rate is probably a contributor right now - we don\u2019t know for certain, and we wouldn\u2019t expect that to change dramatically certainly in the next six months, or who knows how long before it might turn around. So we\u2019re being cautious around our thinking for next year, and we wanted to share that. Obviously people will form their own opinions, but we would expect unemployment to have some dampening on utilization going into next year.  In terms of the COVID volumes, we haven\u2019t modeled and we haven\u2019t given guidance for \u201921, but maybe three, six months ago some of us had hoped that COVID might be behind us this calendar year. Clearly, that does not look like it\u2019s going to happen, but all this depends on how quickly the vaccines get rolled out, how effective they are, and even once they get rolled out, we see a role, so whether it\u2019s a level of testing we\u2019re seeing today or something a little less, we expect there to be a meaningful amount of COVID testing, including the PCR testing throughout a reasonable part of next year. Stephen Rusckowski : Yes, and just to add to that, remember with the economy, and we saw this back in the Great Recession, whatever happens to the economy will affect access, and so access is important to us [indiscernible]. Second is consumer confidence, and we know a large portion of the population is paying for healthcare out of their own pocket, and therefore they\u2019re going to think twice about utilizing it, so we are thinking about that as we think about models in \u201921. Now with that said, if you look at where we are with our base business versus where it was and you think about the math for the full year, it should be an easy comparison, as Mark said in his comments about \u201921. Even if it\u2019s down versus \u201919, just to look at the comparison of what the full year will be for \u201920 versus \u201921, given where we are right now, that makes for an easy comparison. As far as PCR, remember we brought out our first PCR test on March 9 and we\u2019ve been ramping rapidly, so we have not had a full year from PCR. We\u2019re hitting our stride, we\u2019re building capacity because we do anticipate more demand, winter is coming and we\u2019re all anticipating more demand as we enter the winter, clearly in the first quarter, and then we\u2019ll start to see hopefully some of the vaccines. As we all know, those won\u2019t be broadly deployed immediately and the pandemic and the virus will be with us for a large portion of \u201921, so if you think about the full year of \u201921 for COVID-19 versus what we did in 2020, there\u2019s still going to be a lot of volume for testing and you have the full 12 months versus essentially a half year for PCR in 2020. It\u2019s something to think about as you do your models. Mark Guinan : Yes, and to Steve\u2019s point, for this year based on our guidance expectations, we see our base volume down organically in the high teens, so even if it\u2019s down a couple hundred basis points in 2021, it will still be an easy compare for the full year. Operator : The last question is from Mike Newshel with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Mike Newshel : Thank you. Going back to the geographic differences on the core volume rebound you mentioned, just wondering if you\u2019re seeing fluctuations tied specifically to where there are new COVID outbreaks. Is there patient behavior changing and affecting the core business when cases spike [indiscernible] or is that variation just more correlated to how far along local economies are into reopening? Is there volatility at a local level or is it just some states are bouncing back faster than others? Stephen Rusckowski : Well you know, it\u2019s by states, really the big four states. California shut down first, we saw a steady rebound, they\u2019re still not back to pre-pandemic levels, particularly in some of the large cities like LA. If you go into Texas, we actually saw a good rebound in Texas. We have a great presence in Texas, both in Houston and Dallas, and despite some of the flare-ups we saw in the summer, they still continue to be in the range of where we were pre-pandemic. Look at Florida - it went down in the spring into the summer, there\u2019s still issues in Florida. We\u2019re still not where they were pre-pandemic. Then if you go to the northeast, New York and Boston and Connecticut, actually we\u2019ve seen some nice steady recovery with the exception of, as we\u2019ve indicated earlier, New York City, but specific to the Borough of Manhattan. We still have a ways to go to recover there, so we\u2019re watching those, particularly related to infection rates.  But where we have had some of these flare-ups, interesting enough, like in the States of Texas and Florida in the summer months, it did not have a negative of a consequence to our base business as we saw back in the spring, so we\u2019re watching it carefully. But so far, we\u2019re getting there. Then again, you can\u2019t ignore that clinical franchise element of this because some of the portion of the buy-in effects are related to these specific businesses, like prescription drug monitoring, and there\u2019s other issues related to what it takes to get those back to pre-pandemic levels that are not related to the geography at all. Mark Guinan : I can\u2019t say they\u2019re precisely negatively correlated, but actually that would be my representation. Areas with the lowest positivity rates, like New York, actually are down the most, so we haven\u2019t seen a huge parallel movement between spikes in COVID over the last several months and a downturn in utilization. It actually has kind of gone in the opposite direction. Shawn Bevec : Okay, so thank you all for your questions. We appreciate your support on this call today and in general, and we wish you all a great day. Operator : Thank you for participating in the Quest Diagnostics third quarter 2020 conference call.

Any redistribution, retransmission, or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. Shawn Bevec : Thank you and good morning. I\u2019m on the line with Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and will discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that may affect Quest Diagnostics\u2019 future results include, but are not limited to those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K. The company continues to believe that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on future operating results, cash flows, and/or its financial condition will be primarily driven by the pandemic\u2019s severity and duration, healthcare insurer, government and client payer reimbursement rates for COVID-19 molecular tests, the pandemic\u2019s impact on the U.S. healthcare system and the U.S. economy, and the timing, scope, and effectiveness of federal, state and local governmental responses to the pandemic, which are drivers beyond the company\u2019s knowledge and control. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS from continuing operations and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations. References to base testing volumes or base business refer to testing volumes, excluding COVID-19 molecular and serology testing volumes. Growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections, including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth, and adjusted earnings growth are compounded annual growth rates. Finally, revenue growth rates from acquisitions will be measured against our base business. Now, here is Steve Rusckowski. Steve Rusckowski : Thanks Shawn, and thanks everyone for joining us today. So, in the year dominated by the pandemic, Quest brought critical COVID-19 testing to our country, and delivered record revenues, earnings, and cash from operations for the fourth quarter and the full-year 2020. The pandemic has tested our nearly 50,000 employees and they have responded as heroes, by developing COVID-19 tests, building test capacity, innovating new testing models with our retail partners, transporting specimens, delivering results, and of course, supporting our customers. Mark Guinan : Thanks, Steve. In the fourth quarter, consolidated revenues were $3 billion, up nearly 56% versus the prior year. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services grew approximately 58%, compared to the prior year, which reflected ongoing demand for COVID-19 testing services, offset by a modest decline in our base testing revenue. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 26.8% versus the prior year with acquisitions contributing 4.5%. As we highlighted in our 2020 outlook update in mid-December, organic testing volumes ordered in our base business were down mid-to-high single digits versus the prior year in October and November. The recovery stalled in late November with organic testing volume trends down high-single-digits versus the prior year in December due to the surge in new infections across the country. Steve Rusckowski : Thanks Mark. Well to summarize, I\u2019d like to thank all Quest employees who have worked tirelessly over the past year. They have delivered a significant portion of the country\u2019s COVID-19 testing, while serving the needs of people who rely on Quest every day. Thanks to their heroic efforts, we delivered record revenues, earnings, and cash from operations for the fourth quarter and the full-year 2020. In light of the company\u2019s strong financial performance, we have increased our dividend and share repurchase authorization while maintaining flexibility to pursue our M&A strategy. We look forward to sharing a more in-depth update on our market views and strategy at our upcoming virtual Investor Day to be held on Thursday, March 11. Stay tuned for additional details on that day. Now, we\u2019d be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you.  And our first question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Your line is open. Ralph Giacobbe : Thanks. Good morning. I guess \u2013 I think I heard you say that you expected molecular reimbursement to trend lower, just wanted to flesh that out to understand that and maybe what have you seen for reimbursement with PHE likely extended for the full-year? And has there been any discussion or thoughts about proactively go into plans and perhaps not continuing to get that sort of inflated PHE reimbursement in exchange maybe for more favorable longer-term pricing escalators? Thanks. Steve Rusckowski : Mark, you want to start it? Mark Guinan : Sure. So, you know, we are expecting, you know, to still do quite well in terms of reimbursement in the near term. We believe we can meet the turnaround times, certainly the threshold that's required to be eligible for the higher rates, and then we get paid, obviously, based on the individual tests.  So, you know, we're still thinking in the near term that our average weighted reimbursement is going to be pretty strong, but we also recognize the reality, you know, the pressure on the industry, from all the various payers, especially the commercial payers, and so therefore, as we mentioned, you know, throughout the first half of the year, we would expect, you know, some reduction in that reimbursement, not something, you know, that would be momentous, but certainly some downward pressure. And as we said, the client area is very, very competitive. So there's, you know, quite a few labs at this point, given the demand that have significant capacity. And so therefore, in the  it\u2019s very, very competitive. You know, in terms of your questions, I'm sure you can appreciate Ralph that first off, we don't feel we're getting paid excessively for COVID PCR, and we feel like we're being paid appropriately. But even if you could exactly forecast the volume of our COVID testing, and forecast the base business, you know, over a period of time, which obviously would be nearly impossible, you know, I'm not sure that we need to trade off anything. We're very happy with the relationships that we built, as Steve mentioned, with the payers, we've moved away from a focus on price and move toward more of a partnership and a, you know, alignment around value creation, where, you know, they're looking for us to save the money and create value and big piece of that is moving more work to us because we're already \u2013 they're very, you know, high value compared to the rest of the industry and, you know, possible choices for patients. So, you know, good question, Ralph, certainly appreciate it, but for practical and for strategic reasons, because of where we think we are with the payers already with some of these new contracts, certainly not something that we're looking to pursue right now. Steve Rusckowski : Let me just add to that. Speaking to demand,  shares that over the course of the last 10 months, we've brought up our capacity considerably, and we're going to continue to build it. And the reason for that is, we want to continue to be prepared in the event that we do have another surge. And then secondly is, we want to make sure we really have a capability to meet turnaround times that are expected in the market.  And over the last 10 months, obviously, a lot of retesting has been for the clinical purpose and what we believe as we entered the second half, and we're having many discussions in this regard, there's going to be a lot more demand for return to work programs with employers, which have been pushed out, as you all know, return to leisure activities, there's a number of cities that have large tourism bases that are thinking about what they need to do to get people back into those venues.  And there will be a lot of activity around just return to life. And I know that we are still trying to figure that out. And that's going to offer us a lot of opportunity in the future. And with that, there's always a COVID test, but there's also a number of services we provide, and those are yet to be defined. So, we're still trying to understand what that second half opportunity would be. But what we see so far, we will continue to have strong demand, but it may take a different form as we get into the second half and as we go into 22. Thanks, Ralph. Ralph Giacobbe : Thank you. Shawn Bevec : Operator, next question. Operator : Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Justin Bowers : Hey, good morning. This is Justin Bowers on for Pito. Just with respect to the guide, can you kind of frame the high-end and the low-end for us in terms of your testing assumptions, and then also the through process on the increase in serology testing through the quarter? Mark Guinan : Yeah. Sure Justin. So, you know it's multivariable. So there's several ways you could come to the high and low-end. So, what I would say is, you know, they're all based on the three major drivers with most of it being on the base volume recovery, and the level of PCR, you know, volume to lesser extent, serology. So, you know, if we don't see a significant fall off from where we stand today, in PCR, or if it, you know, surges up again, you know, because of these variants, or some other unknown factors, certainly that would take us, you know, to the higher-end combined with, you know, if the base business also were to continue to recover and not, you know, go the opposite direction as COVID surged again.  So, there is some negative correlation, obviously, between the two. But if they both move in the same direction, that would move us to the higher-end. And then if for some reason COVID fell off markedly, even more than we're planning, and as we talked about, we are planning for a decline over time in the first six months, as that midpoint, and the base business did not show recovery, or even, you know, potentially take a little bit of step back for economic or other reasons.  And that would take you to the low end, but you know, I can't at this point, provide exact, you know, changes in the base and COVID, because, obviously, there's multiple ways to get to either one, but directionally that's what, you know,  that our guidance with the midpoint being, as I said, you know, a modest recovery, but not full for the first six months of the base business. And then some step off, but still significant COVID testing for the first six months with the second quarter being, you know, markedly lower than the first quarter. Justin Bowers : Okay, got it. And then just to clarify the earlier comments, it sounded like the base business right now is kind of running stable month-over-month from December levels, are we interpreting that correctly? And then, just in terms of the molecular tests, reported on the website at, you know, 32.8 million is that the right number, look like kind of a huge step-up from February to January, but more importantly is that kind of where you guys are now for total molecular? And I'll hop back in queue. Thank you. Mark Guinan : Sure. Steve, do you want to take that or would you like me to. Steve Rusckowski : Well let me \u2013 the step-up is, you know the step-up that we've seen based on the strong delivery that we had in the fourth quarter in the beginning of January. So, we are \u2013 as I said in my introductory comments, you know, we are one of the leading providers of COVID-19 testing. Second is, it does not include serology and did ask a question about serology, because we do believe there'll be an increasing role of serology throughout 2021. We seem to see some early indications that there's interest in understanding whether you have the antibodies or not, which might inform patients and physicians around, you know, their urgency of getting vaccinated. And at the same time, we're bringing out a new capability called  testing, and this will allow physicians and patients to see if in fact, they do get the spike protein from the vaccines. And we'll be bringing that out at platforms in the next few weeks. And you know, this can help us, you know, determining the vaccine is being effective.  So, we do believe that there will be some increased demands for serology, and this is on top of what we already do. And serology is providing a really important role for management of the disease, overall surveillance, epidemiology, and in measuring the response of what's happening pre and post-vaccinations and broad population. So, we believe there's an opportunity in front of us in 2021 in that regard. Shawn Bevec : And Justin, just to close out on your other question, yes, 32.8 million was the total through as of Monday, and that was up 1.8 million over the prior two weeks. So, about 130,000 a day in the prior two weeks. Operate our next question. Operator : Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Your line is open. Jack Meehan : Thanks. Steve Rusckowski : Hi, Jack. Jack Meehan : Hey, good morning. Steve, you mentioned the focus of the new administration on COVID testing, can you talk about how you think Quest role might change at all, serving the pandemic? And if we start to see greater adoption of home testing, how do you think Quest is going to be positioned for that? Steve Rusckowski : Yeah, so I think, you know, the new administration is leveraging what we've done in the past as a country and as an industry, and taking it to the next level. I mean, you see the capacity that's out there around the country. Back a few weeks ago, we were doing about 2 million COVID-19 molecular tests. So, obviously up considerably from where we all started last March. But going forward, Jack, I do see that there'll be a change beyond the PCR test. As I mentioned earlier, now there's going to be a greater demand, you know, for programs that get to portions of the population that help us get back to work, back to leisure activities, get back to life. And so, we're having a number of dialogues around that. And that will include the role of antigen testing, and more rapid testing workflows that allow us to see if the fact a person that wants to engage in whatever the activity is, is negative and safe for a reasonable period of time to participate. So, when we get into that world, you know we\u2019ll obviously be providing the testing, but as I said earlier, there's a number of services, and also IT solutions that you need to provide. And, like so much in healthcare, you see one, but we're currently engaged with a number of organizations, a number of municipalities, and a number of corporations, and what they will be doing in this regard, particularly in the second half.  I think, you know, the first quarter is outlined in our guidance  start to see improvement as we get into the second quarter. I think the second quarter will be a telling quarter for us all. And we do see a lot of people getting prepared for, you know, better infection rates, you know, better position for populations to get back to work life and leisure activities, and we're going to start to see more of that and Quest has a significant role in helping in that regard. Jack Meehan : Great. And then just to follow up, I have a two-parter on unit pricing. I was curious if you could weigh in, do you have any notable commercial contract renewals in 2021? And then maybe more broadly, as you have discussions with commercial payers now, you know, do you feel like you have a little more of a, you know good footing you know in terms of negotiating price given, you know, the role the labs have served, you know, amidst the pandemic? Steve Rusckowski : You know, let me start with where you ended, I think our relationship with health plans has never been better. As you've seen over the last number of years, we've increased our presence, we have the best access to lives now that we've had in over a decade. And so, we are in a very strong footing. And also, during the pandemic I\u2019ll share that we were deeply engaged with many of the plans of what they needed to take care of their membership, and also their employees. So, the relationship is continued to strengthen. And as I said, in my introductory remarks, and Mark said, as well, we're shifting the dialogue away from exclusively price to the value we deliver. And when you go back to what we talked about in the past around what we bring to the table in terms of our value proposition around quality, our service performance, our innovation, all at a very affordable price, we believe our value proposition is really second to none. And as I said, you know in the course of the last year, we've done service, look at our reputation in the industry and net promoter scores, and those are quite strong. So, when you bring those facts to the table Jack, our position in terms of working out, the forward-looking relationships has, you know, provided a much stronger foundation, and a better understanding on the other side that we really do deliver a lot more value. So, we're in a good position with our plans. We\u2019re in good position with our contracts. We obviously don't provide specific details, but we feel very good about that. And also, I shared that we continue to make progress with our united relationship with a preferred lab network and the building relationship with Anthem were quite encouraged about as well. So, we feel good about a relationship and the progress we've made, but also the opportunities in front of us to continue to build on what we've been talking about. So, Mark anything you could like to add there? Mark Guinan : Sure. So Jack, I understand the question and several years ago, I think there was an expectation where, you know people holding their breath, every time we extended a contract with a major payer because it would imply some sort of major price concession. I can tell you, you know, this has become largely invisible to you all, you know unless we talk about it like Anthem, which was really a new contract and brought together a number of states under a single contract, as opposed to having, you know different periods of time in which we were negotiating across the Anthem network. We just extended with a major commercial payer. You didn't hear about it, because there was no price concession. And in fact, we made huge headway with this payer. And, you know, getting them to acknowledge that in the world of PAMA, the whole notion of a discount to the CMS NLA rates no longer will apply going forward. And that, in fact, you know, CMS will be setting the market and that they should feel confident, is a market rate that they can feel comfortable and represent to their prospective or current members.  So, you know, really that's what it's been about, as they all want to make sure that they can say, they've got good prices. And now you've got an external benchmark, you can look to. So, we just extended with a very large national. We do have one coming up this year. But I can assure you that it's not going to be \u2013 it will not come with a major price concessions, you know, we're going to continue to work on the value-based contracting and with that actually comes good pricing that we feel, you know, represents the market, and then these come with upside, whereas we performed, you know, we both share in the benefit of that upside. That's the way we're really contracting in the last couple years and how we would expect to contract going forward. Jack Meehan : Nice, Thanks, everyone. Shawn Bevec : Operator, next question. Operator : Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Your line is open. Adam Noble : Great, thanks for the question. This is Adam Noble in for Kevin. I just wanted to, I guess double back to your comments around reimbursement for COVID PCR, you know wanted just to confirm that you're assuming throughout the first half, that the PHE is extended so that the Medicare rate, you know with the add-on payment remains 100? And then you talked about the, kind of the commercial reimbursement, you know, potentially declining over time, just any thoughts around kind of what the magnitude of changes on the commercial side you guys could potentially see in PCR? Mark Guinan : Yeah, sure. I'll comment on then Steve may want to add. So yes, we would expect that as long as the, you know,  continues that this structure with the, you know, opportunity to earn $100 per test from CMS will continue now, you know, that is a very small portion of our volume. But we would expect that however, as I said in the prepared remarks, there is some risk, they could decouple it. There's no guarantee that that will continue. So, and \u2013 you know and not only could they decouple the reimbursement with the , but they could also, like they did January 1 change the approach. However, you know, at this point, yes, we're assuming the highest probability is that as long as the  continues, CMS will continue to pay us under this new method. You know, on commercial, obviously, we're not the only player. And so, you know, while we defend, and, you know, feel like we do a good job of explaining why our reimbursement makes sense, as we've negotiated some, you know, new payment methodologies, including some who wanted to move to the Medicare methodology, and we think we've done a good job, but obviously, there are other labs as well. And, you know, to the extent that other labs, you know, don't do as good a job as we do, there could be additional pressure on us. So that's why it's hard for us to predict exactly where this is going. But certainly, in our mind, you know, we would expect to continue to defend commercial contracts as well to the  seeing the same basis for CMS paying us at that rate should apply to the commercial payers as well. I also want to remind everybody that, as long as the zero patient out of pocket applies, that is also a huge tailwind for us because, you know, to avoid having to build patience, where historically, we've shared that we get about, you know, $0.70 on the dollar, and actually get, you know 100% of that payments from the third party is also a large enhancement to our revenue and our profitability as well. So that's, that's a factor I don't want people to forget about. Steve? Steve Rusckowski : Yeah, just to add to the CMS new methodology for reimbursement. As you know, we are reimbursed at $100 when we report the results in two days and $75 for all other results. And to Mark's comments, we have seen a few payers to look at this model as well. But we're encouraged by the public health emergency extension through 2021. And also, just to share our timeliness of our results are quite good. We have met that threshold of 50% of COVID. Molecular tests resulted in less than two days. We did that in the last few months. And I'll share that, you know, the majority of our testers are resulted in two days or less. So, in my other comments, I did mention that we continue to build capacity, because it just gives us a lot more operational flexibility to meet better turnaround times based upon where the demand is coming from. So, I think we're progressing well. We're very good provider of the test. You know, time is one element and quality and reliability, and also the type of testing we have done, you know, our methodology for PCR tests, both on the LDT side, and obviously, the kits are somewhat consistent throughout the industry, are really quite strong. So, if you look at the accuracy and the quality of our testing, you know, people have come to consider us the gold standard. And I think that will bode us well going forward as well. Adam Noble : And if I could just \u2026 Shawn Bevec : Operator, next question. Operator : Eugene Kim your line is open, with Wolfe Research. Eugene Kim : Good morning and thank you for all the color around guidance. Apologies if I missed this, but have you guys provided the average reimbursement levels for the PCR testing in Q4? And can you comment whether you're embedding similar levels in the first half guidance? Mark Guinan : Yeah. So we didn't specifically call that out, but I can tell you that it did not change much in Q4 from where it was in Q3, you know, so, you know, it was above $90. We, you know, we do have some client bill customers that are less than 100. And we don't, you know, get paid for 100% of the testing, sometimes due to missing date, and so on and so forth. We do get some denials. But you know, certainly north of 90 was AWR previously. Now, we did talk about the fact that we expect that to have some pressure and reduce over time in the first half. That doesn't mean that it absolutely will. But in our guidance, in the midpoint of that guidance, we did make an assumption that, you know, given the new model with the $75, not just with CMS with some commercial payers, we're not going to get paid or 100% of our tests at that 100, where we have been done previously, still a large majority, as Steve said, meet that two-day turnaround time. So, that'll create a little bit of erosion. And then also, I mentioned that, you know, there's a lot of capacity there for a very competitive environment in that client bill arena aside from the third party. Eugene Kim : Got it, thank you. And just as a quick follow-up, on the base business, can I confirm you said, you don't think you'll get back to pre-pandemic levels in first half? And is that compared to 2019 or does that include our  as well? Thank you. Mark Guinan : Yeah, that is correct. We would \u2013 I said was, you know, as we're looking at the back half, even though we're not giving guidance because there's too much uncertainty around it. We expect it to be back to pre-pandemic levels towards the end of 2021. So, in the first half, we still expect to be down versus 2019. We felt, even though the pandemic didn't start largely for our business till March, easiest compare and how to talk about it is 2019 volumes. We did have a large growth for the first two months of 2020 as we share that in our first quarter earnings call, you know, so that compounds things a little bit on a year-to-year comparison. But, yes, we're going to talk about our volume performance relative to 2019 because it's the cleanest compare for the whole year. Steve Rusckowski : And when we speak to that, I heard it in your question. We are looking at organic growth. And so you know, we spoke of a couple of acquisitions that we closed last year. And you know, in our organic discussions we're excluding those and any other deals we might do prospectively. So, it's organic, based business we're talking to. Mark Guinan : And we think the best representation of utilization, so that's why we think it's important. Our organic performance versus 2019, kind of gives a sense, because of our size and reach. We think were the market overall is performing. Steve Rusckowski : Yeah. So, the acquisition revenue will be on top of that. We obviously announced a couple of deals and what we said is, we have a good funnel and anything we might do prospectively be on top of what we said. Operator : Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is open. Derik de Bruin : Hi, great. Thank you and good morning. So, just one quick one. Can you provide a little bit more color on how should we think about the margin progression throughout 2021? And particularly how much of your, with the core business still being down, how much of that is the margin headwind? Just sort of thinking about the dynamics as we go from the first half, the second half with COVID volumes testing coming down, and you've returned to price to be more normal for the core business, just wanted to go get some thoughts on the margin progression of work flow, please? Thank you. Mark Guinan : Sure. So, it depends, when you when you say is it a headwind? It depends on to what you're comparing it. So, as we, you know, expect the base business to improve. That's a significant margin tailwind versus the prior period, because we are in any given window of time, a highly fixed cost, you know, operation on our base business. And while we took some significant cost actions in the second quarter of last year in response to the significant downturn in our volume, and we've continued to manage our costs very, very tightly to the back half recoveries, and not get out in front of ourselves, you know, we're not planning on any significant restructuring in the near term with, you know, volumes that are down single digits at this point.  So, our cost structure on the basis business is, to some extent, what it is, and we'll add small, you know, pieces that are necessary as it recovers. But that, you know, growth and recovery in that base business sequentially is a nice tailwind. Now, on the other side, as we talked about, you know, expect erosion in our COVID volumes, you know that, you know, greater headwinds, and how those two pieces offset each other is hard to predict slightly, you know,  specifically. But, you know, I would at this point expect that the COVID reduction, more than offsets the base, but at least they do partially offset each other as we as we move forward.  And then the other dynamic is obviously reimbursement on the PCR test. And we shared that we expected some, you know, pressure on that as we go, you know, from the first quarter into the second quarter sequentially, and then likely, even more so in the back half of the year. So, without getting into specifics, those are kind of things you should, you know, specific numbers, those are kind of the things you should think about, as you think about where margins are going to go through the first half and into the second half of 2021. Derik de Bruin : Thank you. Operator : Lisa Gill with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : Hi, Lisa. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to follow up on your comment around the acquisition opportunities. Steve, you know, one of the things that was anticipated that with PAMA there'd be a lot of pressure and you'd see more acquisition opportunities with PAMA now being pushed out, does that change anything? Number one. And number two, when we think about reimbursement, as we've been talking about, for molecular tests, etcetera. I would think a lot of these labs have done well during this period of time, does that change what their expectations are at all around what their business is worth as we think about acquisition opportunities? Steve Rusckowski : Yeah. So, thanks Lisa for the question. So, the first part is really about acquisition opportunities around hospitals. And, you know, you see that we announced a couple of deals last year that we were happy we did and that's going to help us and we continue to see a nice funnel for 2021 as well. And as you all know, hospital volumes up and down through 2020. They have recovered for us. However, what we do see is, a lot of renewed interest of looking at their lab strategies, which includes, you know, acquiring their outreach business and includes professional app service agreements, like we just announced in the fourth quarter. Now that relationship we announced in the fourth quarter with Hackensack Meridian Health system is the largest we've ever done. And I can tell you, it took a long time to get there. And I believe the prospective reality of what's happening in the healthcare market this year help bring that to a conclusion. And I believe that that will happen with a number of dialogues we have going on with hospitals right now. So that's one piece. The second is on other commercial laboratories. Yes, you're right. Number of commercial laboratories have jumped into the COVID testing arena. You see it with, you know, all the capacity we've added in the country. However, as that starts to be pulled back, and they start to see what the prospects are, given what we're driving as an industry, with consolidation, with tighter contracts and networks around health plans, we believe that, you know, there still will be a catalyst in the marketplace for us to continue to consolidate. So, yes, there's been a short-term opportunity for a number of labs to take advantage, if you will, the opportunity to provide COVID-19 testing. But as that starts to change, you know, as we get throughout 2021, we believe the realities of what the new world will be with, you know, tighter networks, more consolidation will play nicely into our strategy and allow us to acquire more going forward. And obviously, given our cash position and strong balance sheet, we\u2019re in a very nice position to continue to do that. And also, Lisa, there's been a lot of discussion around all this additional capacity out there.  People have added new systems, and, you know, potentially, does this present a risk for us that these people are going to get into other businesses outside of COVID, like ? You know, we are watching it, you know, obviously, some hospitals have moved their molecular capacity to COVID. And we help them with some of the other work, but for other commercial laboratories and hospitals to use that capacity to get into competing with us, by the way, good example,  that's a long stretch. I mean, there's a lot to \u2013 lot more to getting a client to flip over than the lab capacity, you have to have a Salesforce,  logistic capabilities, you have to do electronic interfaces, you have to work with the physicians, you have to be in a contract with the health plans. So, we are watching it, but at the same time, we're a little, you know, little cautious in, in the belief that some of this will have a significant effect. At the same time, we're watching it carefully to make sure it doesn't. And then we're staying on top of our clients to make sure we serve them well. Thank you. Mark Guinan : So, if I could add Steve, just a couple things. Lisa, around your question, around our pipeline, at any given point in time, you know, we've got multiple opportunities that we're discussing, I can tell you that, you know, none of the potential sellers that we're speaking to right now are getting, you know expecting to get paid for that PCR bubble. So fortunately, I could see a mentality that, you know, hey, my value has gone up dramatically because of COVID testing. But you know, the people we're talking to right now recognize that that\u2019s short-term, and that should not be a part of the valuation discussion.  And then the, you know, while PAMA gets a pause this year, you know, there\u2019s still, you know, some risk. But more importantly, as you know, we've mentioned, and I'm sure you've seen, it's not just CMS, but the commercial payers are starting to, you know, put pressure on these high hospital outreach rates, you know, re-contracting, that work that's outside, you know, the patients who are in the hospital, either admitted or outpatient, at independent laboratory rate.  So it's not \u2013 this pressure is not just coming from Washington, it's coming from the commercial payers as well. And from quite frankly, patients who, you know don't like those high prices when they have a high deductible plan. So, there's a number of things that are getting the C suites of large hospital systems with outreach to think about. Do they really want to be in this business? And will this be a good time to monetize? And so therefore, I really don't see the pipeline of interest having been impacted over the last 12 months negatively. Operator : Matt Larew with William Blair. Your line is open. Matt Larew : Hi, good morning. As I think about the various components of your response to COVID-19, and you're role in testing, two things that stick out as step changes from a pre-COVID  capacity, and then consumer engagement. I think the number of patients using QuestDirect has doubled in the last 15 months. So, just curious, what can you do and as we move to sort of a post-COVID world to leverage that increased consumer facing presents consumer engagement, as well as the added capacity that it sounds like you're still bringing on? Steve Rusckowski : Yeah. Thanks for the question. And we're very bullish on our consumer strategy. As you all know, we have five strategies for growth, one of which is the consumer strategy and our direct-to-consumer business that we've built over the last several years has done quite well and we do believe that the pandemic has now been an accelerator for that. We're providing COVID-19 testing through that platform. We're going to look at using it for consumer genetics. And as I said, in my introductory comments, interesting part of the pandemic is brought to the forefront the strong role of testing and overall health care. And questioning has been out there more than ever, and our brand has been built. And our brand is really second to none in our industry. And we coupled that with our service performance. And so we have this strong foundation coupled with the change in the marketplace. And we do believe, you know, there's going to be a continuation of the number of consumers that are engaged, that will engage differently with healthcare delivery systems, and how they engage with the physician. With telehealth, we have a very strong presence with telehealth providers and with integrated delivery systems that offer the telehealth option. But at the same time, a lot of patients as well, and consumers will want to receive their basic health checks and testing online as  so much else in their lives.  And so we're very well-positioned with reputation with capabilities. And so, we are investing in that in a significant way more so than we would have, if we did not have the pandemic. And so, we think about, you know, the growth drivers going forward, and we'll talk about this some more in our Investor Day. We're very bullish about the opportunity we have in front of us around our QuestDirect, but also the consumer opportunity in general. Operator : Dan Leonard with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Dan Leonard : Thank you. Just one quick one on the deal side. Possible you could frame for us the Hackensack opportunity, the contribution to growth in 2021, and the first half guide? Thank you. Steve Rusckowski : Mark, you want to take that? Mark Guinan : Yeah. So, we, you know, we don't typically announce the revenue impact of deals like this, and again, I want to remind you, this is organic. So, this is not something we bought. We worked with Hackensack and demonstrate to them that we can perform the same work they do in their lab at a better cost better value. And you know, for a system that size, you know, they're significant lab spend. So this is \u2013 is going to be quite impactful and beneficial to them, and we see that as a, you know, opportunity, obviously to also get other clients, who will get their attention to see Hackensack, you know, thinks that this will work well, you know, in addition to some of the other hospital systems that we've learned over the last couple of years. So, we're very, very excited about it. It is a large deal. It's the largest deal we've ever done. It will be, you know, material to our growth. And we talked a couple years ago at our Investor Day and we\u2019ll likely give an update on this. We thought we could get more than 100 basis points, and you know, somewhere between 100 basis points to 200 basis points of growth every year from our PLS business and certainly this one is a large contributor to that, and might even give us an opportunity to exceed that. So, you know, very large deal, but you know, we are not going to, we haven't had a historical precedent of pulling out the exact revenue, but it will be noticeable, and material as we go into 2021 and beyond. Operator : Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Ricky Goldwasser : Yeah. Hi. Good morning. So, I mean, clearly, there's a lot of uncertainty around second half in the trajectory of the combat for more normalized utilization level, but if we step away from the timing and just think about the margin trajectory, how should we think about core margin trajectory from where they were, let's say in the fourth quarter, to where they can expand to as utilization comes back to a more normalized level? So again, the question is more about the margin trajectory, as it relates to utilization, not about the timing. And then my second question is more about, sort of a market demand. So, how do you think about changes in physician behavior patterns? And you know, we're seeing telehealth becoming more integrated into the workflow. So, do you think that there's going to be any impact on longer term lab testing demand curve because of that, I don\u2019t know if the experiences early in the year could shed some light on that? Steve Rusckowski : Sure. Mark, you want to take the first part. I\u2019ll take the second. Mark Guinan : Yes. So, Ricky, obviously, the, you know, size of the revenue we've generated from COVID, which more than offset the base business has materially impacted our margins and expanded them greatly relative to our historical margins. So, as we, you know, progress. We'll talk more about this at Investor Day, but we progress into a future where, you know, COVID testing is still around for, you know, for a while. As Steve said, we don't expect it to go away completely, certainly, by 2022. It's going to be less material to our top line and to our margin.  So, where will our base business be? Once we get back to the pre-pandemic levels of 2019, I would expect our base business to be, you know, slightly higher margin than it was pre-pandemic. Because as you look at, you know, our invigorate program, which we continue to drive, even during the pandemic, and you look at the offsets of the pay for is that we usually talk about, including wage inflation and price erosion, you know, given the pause on PAMA this year, and given, you know, the fact that we've done really well and other price concessions, despite, you know, significant increases in our  that was warranted during the pandemic, you know, as we wanted to reward our employees for their incredible contributions in getting us up and running, operating well threw it, and obviously driving strong company results. And when I net all those together, you know, that level of business should be more profitable. And then going forward from that, when we get back to the growth that you saw in 2019, and you saw in the first two months of 2020, and our ability to leverage that growth, you know, I would expect to see margin expansion on the base business, but of course, that will be partially offset for a period of time, as the COVID revenues and margins, you know, fall down. So, you know, longer-term, the good news is, you know, we were on a good path on growth and margin expansion pre-pandemic, and we will, you know, we'll get back there. But for a while, it'll be somewhat masked by the COVID decline that's inevitable, you know, over the next, certainly 18 months or so. Steve Rusckowski : Yeah. And the question about physicians, Ricky, we're watching this carefully, because we do believe going back to an earlier question about the consumer activity there will be a transition here now going forward with physicians serving the market in a different way. You know, as we said before, about half the physicians have either sold their practices to integrate delivery systems or have strong affiliations with integrated delivery systems. And, you know, that will be consistent going forward. But the other half of the market, we believe there will be a growing percentage of that portion of physicians that are served by telehealth and we have a very strong position with those telehealth providers, and that was before the pandemic.  And those telehealth providers are not going to work with  of laboratories who will work with a few. And they will have a real type for lab network as you would expect. And as you would expect, Quest would be one of those options. So, we feel good about that. Second, as you see more consolidation going on in physicians and we see what's happening, particularly with one of the health insurance companies, , acquiring physicians and a number of those physician practices, or customers. You think about debt consolidation, and think about their role, not thinking about where they add value bringing all those physicians together. We believe there will be an opportunity for us to work with a consolidator, like , to provide lab services more broadly, and in really reduce the variation they have with other physicians. And just one last point to show that, you know, this world is moving towards tighter network of lab providers. In the fourth quarter of last year, United Healthcare actually announced the removal of lot of network benefit for some of their fully insured members. And so, it's just another example of a major health plan tightening up their network. So, we think the physician side will change and there'll be a different way of providing physician services to patients going forward. And that trend, we believe is a good trend and will provide tailwind for us to consolidate the market. Operator : Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : Hi, Erin. Erin Wright : Thanks. Thanks so much for sneaking me in. Just a follow up on that competitive landscape and consolidation. So it sounds like you don't expect there to be any sort of meaningful impact on your opportunity around consolidation just even given the dramatically expanded install bases, PCR instruments across the U.S. over the past year. I mean, I would assume that customers do want to monetize those investments to some extent, I'm just curious what you're seeing in terms of market share shifting outside of maybe COVID testing that you're seeing already, if that's happening at all? I mean, it sounds like everything still remains an opportunity from an M&A perspective and consolidation standpoint. And then my second question is just on how should we be thinking about the long-term dynamics as it relates to COVID testing? It will obviously diminish with the vaccine rollout, but could it evolve into something more similar to like flu testing in future years? And can you remind us of the flu testing exposure you do have? Thanks. Steve Rusckowski : Sure. So as I said earlier, we believe that hospitals will be now increasingly looking at their options to become more efficient, given the pressure, the pandemics put on any of them. And we're encouraged by, you know, the level of discussions we had, and, you know, the deals we've closed as an example that this is happening. So, we think that's good. On the commercial laboratory side, we believe that, you know, some have gotten into the COVID testing opportunity, it's provided somewhat of an opportunity for them to get through this year. But as you know, the dust settles and testing volumes go down, you know, the reality of what we talked about in  doesn't change. And we think there will be many of those that would be looking at their options. And we do believe that COVID testing will continue into 2022. We believe that this, you know will be a virus that we'll have to manage. So, it will be more flu like, and something that will, you know, will be behind us and beyond 2021. And, you know, it's hard for us to scale at this time what that will be. But you should not think that this is going to be the testing opportunity that will go away at the end of this year. But we do believe there will be with us in 2022, as well.  And as far as the flu, you know, we talked about prior earnings call that we have offered a combination panel that when a patient presents itself with symptoms, the physician wants to rule out the flu, and also COVID. And so, we have seen, you know that be accepted, but as you all know, the incidence of flu this year is down considerably because of all our behaviors in the United States. So, that has changed somewhat. Shawn or Mark, you want to add something to food testing in general and exposure to answer the PAMA point of the question? Mark Guinan : Yeah, I don't have anything to add. Shawn. Operator : Our last question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Your line is open. Brian Tanquilut : Hey, good morning, and thanks for squeezing me in. I guess just one quick question. Mark, as I think about your capital deployment, obviously, you're generating a lot of cash. And it sounds like the hospital acquisition opportunities are the pipeline's there, but maybe a little slow in coming through. So, how should we be thinking about your willingness to buy back more aggressively in the front end? You know, and how should we be thinking about, just other capital deployment opportunities, whether it's internal, on the CapEx side for growth? Mark Guinan : Sure. So, we are investing quite a bit internally. You know, as you may have seen or you will see our, you know, capital spend for 2020. You know, we ended up 418 million, which was above the initial range. A lot of that was related directly to the COVID capital that was necessary. But we certainly have not stepped back on investing internally, because we think that's the best way to drive returns. A lot of that, obviously, is related to our invigorate program. You know, we are moving all of our new  test to a single platform, we continue to move forward on that, and then a big piece of the 2020. And the first half of 2021 was related to Quest and our new facility. Although we started operating in early January, we still have some final set out in equipment to put in a narrow drive some of the spending in the first half. So, we absolutely have a high priority on internal capital. And we'll continue to do so. You can see we guided to 200 million in the first half, which is you know, about 50% of what we spent in 2020 as we step back a little bit from COVID capital, but we have some continued spending on Clifton and then also the normal priorities on which we spend. On share buybacks, as I mentioned, I will give a lot more color on the Investor Day. The reason for that is, you know, we do have some things that we're monitoring around potential cash deployment. We will have greater clarity on as we move over the next couple of weeks. We also wanted to get a little more of 2021, Q1, you know, behind us to see how that performance continues, and what our expectations, you know, for Q2 look like at that point, because every day, every couple of weeks, every month certainly gives us you know, better line of sight and expectations. But, you know, by announced by, you know us seeking and getting approval and announcing a billion dollar increase in our authorization, certainly you correctly are taking that as a signal. And as I said, specifically in my prepared remarks, that we're going to do more share buybacks than we have done historically. And I'll remind you that our capital allocation strategy, which we have not changed to this point is to give the majority of our free cash flow back to our shareholders to our dividend. And our share repurchases, we suspended them for 2020 for a period of time. But even with the 250, you know, we spent in Q4 and the increase in dividend over time, you know, we're behind that 50%. So, we have some catch-up to do. Steve Rusckowski : Let me just add to that performance we had in 2020 and the performance that we're indicating, with our guidance in 2021, is affording us an opportunity to invest in our growth strategies. And that includes what we've talked about on this call. Working on the relationships with health plans are gaining traction was presenting our lab strategy view to health systems, hospital health systems, what we're doing around advanced diagnostics, and then finally, what was asked about earlier around the consumer opportunity in front of us. So, implied in the guidance is an increase in investment for those growth drivers to accelerate growth of our base business within 2021, but as we enter 2022 as well. So if there are no further questions. I like to thank everyone for again joining us on this call. We appreciate your continued support and interest and you have a great day. Take care. Operator : Thank you for participating in the Quest Diagnostics fourth quarter and full-year 2020 conference call.

The entire contents of the call, including the presentation and question-and-answer session that will follow, are the copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics with all rights reserved. Any redistribution, retransmission, or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. Shawn Bevec : Thank you and good morning. I\u2019m here with Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and will discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that may affect Quest Diagnostics future results include, but are not limited to those described in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K. The company continues to believe that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on future operating results, cash flows, and/or its financial condition will be primarily driven by : the pandemic\u2019s severity and duration; healthcare-insured, government, and client-payer reimbursement rates for COVID-19 molecular tests; the pandemic\u2019s impact on the US healthcare system and the US economy; and the timing, scope, and effectiveness of federal, state and local governmental responses to the pandemic, which are drivers beyond the company\u2019s knowledge and control. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS. References to base testing volumes or base business refer to testing volumes, excluding COVID-19 testing. Growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections, including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth, and adjusted earnings growth are compound annual growth rates. Finally, revenue growth rates from acquisitions will be measured against our base business. Now, here is Steve Rusckowski. Steve Rusckowski : Thanks, Shawn, and thanks everyone for joining us today. Quest had a strong first quarter with our base businesses to continuing to recover the near pre-pandemic levels. Contributions from acquisitions and PLS relationships accelerated growth in the base business and helped offset the reduction in demand for COVID-19 testing, which was in line with industry trends. In March, for the first time since the pandemic began, monthly organic revenue in the base business grew versus our 2019 baseline. As we noted at our recent Investor Day, Quest is well positioned to grow as the US exits the pandemic and people return to normal activities and address the routine care issues that have been neglected over the past year. Mark Guinan : Thanks, Steve. In the first quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.72 billion, up 49% versus the prior year. Revenues for diagnostic information services grew approximately 52%, compared to the prior year, which reflected ongoing demand for COVID-19 testing services into a lesser extent continued recovery in our base testing revenue, which increased versus the prior year. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions increased 25.6% versus the prior year, with acquisitions contributing 4%. The impact of severe winter weather during the quarter negatively impacted volumes by approximately 2.5%. Compared to our first quarter 2019 baseline, total base testing volumes increased 1.5% and benefited from M&A and new POS partnerships that began in 2020. Excluding the net impact of weather in the first quarter as well as M&A and new PLS wins over the last year; base testing volumes declined approximately 7% in the first quarter versus the 2019 baseline and down 5% in March. This represents more of a same-store view of the recovery in our base business since the pandemic began. While COVID-19 testing volumes declined faster than expected throughout Q1, the decline coincided with reduced demand across the industry. Importantly, these volumes have stabilized over the last several weeks. We resulted approximately 9.1 million molecular tests and nearly 900,000 serology tests, contributing nearly 21% to volume growth in Q1 versus the prior year. We exited the first quarter averaging approximately 73,000 COVID-19 molecular tests and 8,000 serology tests per day. Steve Rusckowski : Thanks, Mark. And to summarize, we're off to a very strong start in 2021. Our base business continues to recover back to near pre-pandemic levels as people address the routine care issues that they have neglected over the past year. And then finally, I'd just like to thank all Quest employees who continue to serve the needs of people who rely on Quest every day. And so with that, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We will now open it up to questions. At the request of the company, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. If you have additional questions, we ask that you please fall back in the queue.  Our first question comes from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Your line is open. Kevin Caliendo : Hi. Thanks for taking my call. Steve Rusckowski : Hi, Kevin. Kevin Caliendo : Yeah. Good morning. So I guess, some of the commentary around 2Q, I sort of want to understand the expectation, it looked like March, the base business was up year-over-year, and your guidance is suggesting that 2Q would be down year-over-year. You don't expect it to recover fully. Is there anything that changed, or was March an anomaly, sort of, take us through what you're seeing in the base business in terms of the volumes? Steve Rusckowski : Mark? Mark Guinan : Sure. So Kevin, when we talk about the base business, and sorry for any confusion, it being up in March. That included our new PLS wins, which were significant and also M&A. So it's the total base business that was not an organic number. What we tried to do was delineate where the -- what we call same-store, so kind of the apples and apples versus 2019 to give you a sense of where we think utilization is. So separate from new significant PLS wins and M&A where that base business performance is. So when we talk about expecting to be slightly down in Q2, that's that organic non-PLS utilization, same store number, not our total base business performance. Steve Rusckowski : So Mark, it\u2019d be good to share our implied view on what's going to happen COVID testing in Q2. Mark Guinan : Yeah. So we talked about 100,000 a day in Q1. We talked about an expectation about 50,000, we also shared that we exited Q1 over 70,000, so that would imply a significant ramp down throughout the second quarter. And that's based on our expectation that vaccines will continue to roll out, we'll get more and more people who'll be protected and less and less clinical demand. And of course, we'll see how that plays out, but that is certainly within the guidance that we're providing today, how we see the next several months. Steve Rusckowski : So if you assume Kevin, our base business, it would include acquisitions in PLS and organic growth. But let's just focus on organic growth. The steady improvement that we've seen in Q1 continues in Q2. And then it's somewhat offset by what we are anticipating with COVID, and that gives us the expectation around ranges of guidance in the second quarter. So hopefully, that's helpful. Mark Guinan : Yeah. And just to close it out, Kevin, I would point to the numbers that we quoted for Q1 of minus 7%. That's the same-store performance number. And we -- obviously, March was stronger than that. February was impacted by weather, as we said. But that -- we expect that minus 7% to improve, as Steve said, throughout Q2, but not yet to get positive. Operator : Our next question comes from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Erin Wright : Thanks. Steve Rusckowski : Hi, Erin. Erin Wright : Capital deployment is still one of the biggest questions we're getting from investors, are there any meaningful changes now in your view from an M&A pipeline perspective? And what's assumed in guidance in terms of inorganic growth? And longer term, here over the next few years, do you anticipate the pace of consolidation across the lab industry to accelerate, or do you anticipate a similar pace to what we've seen historically? And just somewhat tied to that as well, I mean, how should we be thinking about the broader excess capacity across the competitive landscape post-COVID? And how does that impact your positioning? Mark Guinan : Hey, Steve, let me take the guidance question first, and then I'll turn it over to you. So Erin, our current guidance, obviously, is only through the second quarter, and we're not counting on any M&A that hasn't already been transacted. And even the deal that we announced Mercy is not going to close and generate any significant volume or revenue in the second quarter. So the current guidance does not anticipate future M&A. Steve? Steve Rusckowski : Yeah. So we feel good about the discussions and the funnel of prospects we have for what we have characterized as our hospital strategy. There continues to be a lot of pressure on these pre-delivery systems. They are considering their last strategy is one of the options to help them. And we have a number of examples over the past six months on delivering on the strategies that we've talked about for years. And so the answer to your question, we do see a continuation of interest in the building funnel with more prospects to come. What we shared at Investor Day is we reaffirmed our outlook that we would grow through acquisition around 2% per year. What we shared is that, we historically have delivered on that at the three years prior to 2021. And we believe that's still a good guidance number for us for this year, and going forward, it's implied in our outlook for growth. So finally, as we do see the trends in general, just like all health care on consolidation. We do see systems interested in thinking about what's most important to them. And what's your strategy and Quest help them with their lab strategy. And likewise, we see, if you will, fewer and fewer in network providers with the health clients. And if you want to think about that, that is a consolidation play as well. And when those two forces happening, there will be more share in the hands of fewer, and our plan is to gain share. So all the megatrends and changes that are happening in the industry, we believe have actually improved to support what we've said for some time, and that our view is both for what's happening with hospitals and also what's happening with health plans. Operator : Our next question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Pito Chickering : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Within the routine market, can you give us some more color on strength and weaknesses in different parts of the country? Looking at your customers, can you give us some color on dock offices versus hospitals versus the baseline and their routine tests? Any details you can give us on what types of test are normalizing and sort of what are the laggard areas? Steve Rusckowski : Sure. Sure. So let me take a run around all the different customers the way we look at the market. So geographically, we have seen good recovery in Texas and the South West. We're actually seeing, really in the last several weeks, starting a much better recovery in California in the West Coast, which is good news. We see the South East starting to recover and bring us back to the 2019 levels that we spoke to earlier. So I would say those are moving in the right direction. Now the offset to that is long as you've seen the spikes and the hotspots in the Midwest and when that happens in the lockdowns and people are concerned about going into health through delivery, that's going to affect our business. So we've seen some of that, let\u2019s say, in the Midwest. And then finally the Northeast and the Northeast including New York and Pennsylvania and going into New England. It's still behind, and it's recovering slowly, but we're the most off, if you will, in the Northeast. So that's the geographic swing. As far as physician business versus hospital business, the hospital business is actually very close to where we were. We're encouraged by that. We see remissions getting back to 2019 levels. We see outpatient procedures getting back to 2019 levels. So that business is tracking nicely compared to where we were. And then the physician side, it all depends on what type of physician. Primary care is starting to turn on oncology, particularly those that have postponed diagnosis and treatment for oncology starting to turn on. And at the same time, we still see our prescription drug monitoring business or mental health and behavioral health and drugs and abuse still down versus where we were at 2019. And that's an issue that varies by state to work in that. So that gives you a feel for what's going geographically. What's going on by physician, but also by what we described as clinical franchises. Mark, anything you\u2019d like to add to that? A \u2013 Mark Guinan : No, I think that's a good summary, Steve. Thanks. Steve Rusckowski : Yeah. Operator : Our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : Good morning. Ralph Giacobbe : Thanks. Good morning. The higher revenue guidance, just want to understand, is that upside from 1Q? Because it sounded like COVID was maybe lower than you had expected. So just trying to understand if it reflects assumption of better core, or is it deals? Just maybe color there, reconciling the higher revenue? And then second, is the ASR included in the guidance? Because just based on the revenue increase and running through recent margin performance, it doesn't look like that's factored in, or otherwise, there would be an assumption of much lower margin. So I'm just trying to reconcile that as well. Thanks. A \u2013 Mark Guinan : Yes. So let me take a shot at that, Ralph, thanks. The higher revenue is absolutely driven by stronger-than-expected recovery in the base business. So as you point out, we've acknowledged and we record every couple of weeks, COVID testing has ramped down faster than we had anticipated throughout the first quarter. We continue to expect to have that ramp down, but the base business has recovered stronger, is most certainly more than an offset on the revenue side. In terms of the ASR, it is in the guidance. I just want to remind everyone that we have had committed to $900 million in share repurchases that was already in the guidance for the first half. We did $410 million in Q1. And then part of the ASR is related to the proceeds from the sale of our 40% ownership in our JV with IQVIA, and that is slightly accretive when you consider the loss of the equity earnings. So you need to look at over $600 million of the ASR as really offsetting the -- foregoing those equity earnings. We had already committed to $900 million in the previous guide in the first half, so almost $500 million there. So when you combine that, the share repurchases are really just up by several hundred million. So I want to make sure everyone is clear on the math there. So it is reflected in the guidance. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Your line is open. Brian Tanquilut : Hey, good morning guys, congrats on the quarter. I guess, my question for you guys, Steve as you think about what you saw in Q1, specifically in March with the assumption of volumes in the core. What are you seeing in terms of acuity levels, like rep number of tests per req, or even revenue per req that you saw in March, is that carrying over already into April, just any color you can share with us on that? Thank you. Steve Rusckowski : Yeah. So thanks, appreciate the question. Mark was encouraging, and we're watching April, carefully. And we do look at the number of test per requisition to see if we're getting more density, if you will, of testing for requisition, and we talked about new made explanation for increase in the calculation of revenue per req have to do with the COVID test, the straight calculation. But we have historically seen a, let's say, modest expansion of the newer test for variety of reasons, we offer more. Second, there is a higher level of acuity and chronic disease and aging of the population. So we have generally seen a general increase in that. But nothing that was really notable that's standing out within March. Operator : Our next question comes from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : Hi, Jack. Jack Meehan : Good morning. I was wondering, if you could give us an update around your thinking around COVID testing for the second half of the year? What do you expect in terms of, the base in terms of testing levels, and then also if you can give us an update as to how you think the school testing opportunity could shake out your reference that at the beginning. How do you feel your positioning is for the upcoming awards there? Steve Rusckowski : Yeah. So you go back to where we started off the year. What we said is we do expect COVID, PCR testing to decline throughout the year and we mentioned in our remarks, you could see that in Q1, and we see it happening in the country. So as Mark said earlier, we do expect that continuing trend in Q2 and that will continue into the second half. Now with a little bit offset, we do see this transition from what we described as more clinical uses of the PCR testing, roll in and roll out COVID for hospitals, roll in, roll out patients seeing their physicians and moving it to return to life activities, and there's a lot of activity around that, Jack. A lot of activity, I mentioned in the remarks, what's going on around schools. There's two funding mechanisms for that from the U.S. government. We've actively engaged with a number of, let's call it, systems integrators that will be coordinating the efforts beyond the laboratory testing. We're well-positioned there. Secondly, is corporations are now thinking about how they get people back physically into their places of work, maybe albeit not as full-time as they want for. But despite the vaccination progress, they're still going to be testing requirements with the return to work activities. And then let me just say the entertainment piece of this is big, too. We see the sports teams, want to put paints back in the stands. We see New York City, interested in getting people back. The tourism as they get into the fall and turning back on the city, we mentioned in our prior remarks and other calls and meetings that we participated in this pilot study with New York to provide a check, if you will provide access for an individual over the course of the day. So that type of activity will be a larger portion of what we do for COVID testing in the back half. Now with all that said, we're not providing guidance for the back half, but we do see continued PCR testing in the back half, but it's going to change in this nature. And also, we do believe COVID-19 testing and PCR testing will continue in 2022. This is not going away fast. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Larew with William Blair. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : Hey, good morning, Matt. Matt Larew : Thanks for \u2013 yeah, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, maybe a two part. The first would just be a follow-up to Jack's question, Steve, in terms of how much of that return to life testing opportunity really is going to be in a sort of a reference lab setting with the day or to turnaround time versus a point-of-care setting. But my question though was about the consumer market. I just wanted to get your take on sort of the PWN Everlywell combination and if that changes any of your approach or the competitive dynamics in that space? Steve Rusckowski : Yeah. Yeah. So first of all, as you know, not all tests are created equal. And PCR still is the gold standard. And we do provide a solution with antigen testing, okay, as part of appropriate utilization of that testing, particularly for surveillance. But as we know, the antigen testing, sensitivity and specificity has been for let's say day two through day five of a potentially infected person. But the PCR test is really the gold standard to rollout, if someone has been exposed in the early days, there were rule out the pick are exposed in the late days. And so the sensitivity and specificity we have with our PCR testing is quite good. And so physician sell that, and therefore, that's why we're so confident that it will continue to be an important part of how we fight this pandemic. As far as the consumer, the consumers trying to figure out to get easy access to testing, and they will get that access in a variety of forms. And by the way, our turnaround time is now for PCR testing are much better on average than the two-ish days that we often thought about several months ago. We're now delivering results in less than the day for many \u2013 for many tests that come in. And the reason for that is, remember the remarks we're testing about 101,000 tests per day, and we have approximately 300,000 per day for capacity. So that allows us to have much better turnaround times, which we believe, as that becomes more and more visible and people want to get good access to the gold standard, they're going to rely on those places they can get access. So we continue our relationships with retailers. We're expanding our relationship with CVS has gone quite well. CVS is active on promoting good access to PCR testing around the drive ends and Walmart as well. And then also with our direct to the Quest capability that we talked about at our Investor Day, we have put on that platform, both PCR testing as well as serology testing. And we are seeing high levels of interest from a consumer perspective of what they could do simply by getting collection kit in the mail and a FedEx envelope to ship that back and good turnaround tied to start up of MyQuest. So that will continue to build, as the consumers -- as we start to return to life in a safe way. I want to be assured that even if they are vaccinated or they have natural immunity, we are not locking into a situation that they might have been exposed in some ways that they fell through the cracks with all the caveats we have with the effectiveness of the vaccines, the questions about natural immunity, and then also, with the new variance as well. So because of that, we keep on working on better and more efficient and easier ways for Americans to get access to PCR testing. And we've got now, I think, a lot of good chance to do that, and that will continue to be an opportunity for us in the back half. Mark Guinan : Yeah. And Steve, I'd like to add. I want to make sure that Matt and others understand how the surveillance works. And in this case, when you pool you get the economics to where it's affordable to do more broadly and more regularly, because we're going to be putting up to 10 individual samples in a single well. And so hence, the cost will be 10% or less per individual. And what you sacrifice is, it's not a diagnostic, because we're not going to have the individuals identified in that well. The school or the entity that provides us the sample will have tool that they will know in test through that who the 10 people are. And if we come back to them with a positive result, they will apply a real diagnostic to those 10 individuals. So with that, we also don't have the obligation or the ability to retest. Whereas today, when we do pooling for clinical purposes, if we get a positive, we have to go back and retest the individual samples, so it actually is an inefficiency in our process. In order to get this to work, we don't do retesting of a sample. We don't have the capability of doing that. We notify the submitting entity that we had a positive in one of the pooled collection specimen tubes, and then they go forward and test those individuals. Operator : Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : Good morning. Hey, Tycho. Mark Guinan : Tycho, you\u2019re on mute. Steve Rusckowski : You\u2019re on mute Unidentified Analyst : Hi. Sorry about that. This is Casey in for Tycho. Can you give us some color as to what the implied operating margin is for the EPS guide? And sort of what's the upside is from the ASR? And then just on serology, can you talk a little bit about you're not modeling a decrease in 2Q from 1Q, but PCR is going down. Can we assume the same level of serology testing throughout the back half of the year and explain maybe what the resilience is there? Thanks. Steve Rusckowski : Mark, do you want to talk the ASR? Mark Guinan : Well, the ASR is in our updated guidance. So there's not upside per se relative to before we announced the ASR, as I tried to walk through the math, about a little less than $400 million of the repurchases are truly incremental in terms of an EPS lift, because we had already committed to the full $900 million, and we had about $500 million remaining in Q2 that was already in the guidance. So that $1.5 billion goes down to $1 billion incremental. A little over $600 million of that is the proceeds from our divestiture of our stake in Q2, that's slightly accretive. But not materially relative to the -- for mature of the equity earnings there. So it's really less than $400 million of share repurchases that were incremental to what we guided to previously. And that is built into the updated guidance. In terms of implied operating margin, obviously, we have a range. So we can't answer that with precision. But if you take the midpoint, you can all do the math. As we get a lower mix of COVID testing at our assumption of the $100 reimbursement, obviously, realization in AWR that's less than that, $100 price point. And that mix is toward the base business that will erode the margin slightly. But the offset to that is the base business recovers, we're very leveraged. So the variable drop-through on that base business recovery, certainly much higher than our enterprise and historical fully loaded operating margin, but it's not quite as high as the COVID PCR. Steve Rusckowski : Yeah. Serology, we imply that it will continue at the same level. We are pushing on the value of serology going forward. We believe that the semi-quant capability that we offer has nice insight into what response is happening in patients in general with the virus and therefore, that has value. We also believe that between historic PCR and serology, knowing that you've had the viruses important for Americans to know so. We keep on pushing down the value, and we will continue to look at new tests beyond that. We will be immune response long-term includes T cells. We don't have that, but we continue to look at that has been the prospect. So you should assume for now it's stable with what we've seen so far, but we continue to believe that's more and more valuable in the quarter. We continue to work on developing the test to support that. Operator : Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Ricky Goldwasser : Yeah, hi. Good morning. So two questions because I wanted to follow-up. So when we think about the first half guidance, it does imply that meaningful operating income sequential decline. I fully realize you're still not giving second half guidance. But just to maybe everybody on the call, sort of -- some, sort of, a framework as we think about a more normalized pace of the core business. How should we think about that margin headwind? I think it's just going to help us all as we think about the second half modeling. That's first. And then second, more is like long-term strategically. We're hearing the payers talk a lot about digital-first strategies and being like the front door to health care you guys talked about expanding relationship with payers like Anthem. So are you having any conversations with payers on how you can be part of that digital-first strategy in those digital networks? And if so, do you see that as an opportunity to accelerate more narrow networks that will drive volume toward you, and actually, would that require any additional investments or you think you have the infrastructure for that already? Steve Rusckowski : Mark, you take the first one, I'll take the second one. Mark Guinan : Sure, Steve. Thanks for the Ricky. Again, just to reiterate, the first half, we delivered over 100,000 PCR COVID tests per day. We're assuming half that in Q2. So that's certainly contributing to the margin decline, as you talked about, implied in the guidance for the first half, implicitly in Q2. When you think about the base business, we're still uncertain how all those moving parts will play out in the second half, which is why we've not provided second half guidance that we want to wait until we can confidently give guidance that we're highly confident will be delivered. So what I would point to is that's the transition period, really look at an Investor Day and how we talked about 2022. And talking about getting our base business fully recovered by the end of this year, back to growth through the growth pillars and back to a margin level, pre-pandemic and then obviously improving beyond that, as we talked about a CAGR where our bottom line grows significantly faster than our top line by 700 basis points. So we feel very confidence in the earnings power of the base business. Certainly, we're going to have a step down from the pandemic bubble, where we did several billion dollars of COVID testing last year, and significant COVID testing this year. But the base business should be very healthy coming out of the pandemic once COVID testing drops to a minimal level. We'll be right back to the operating rhythm. Our expectation is that you saw early in 2019 when we were growing a business January, February, more than 5% on a volume basis, and you saw strong improvements in our operating margin. Steve? Steve Rusckowski : Yeah. Yeah. Just to transition. So as you recall in our Investor Day, we went to a walk, if you will, to bridge you from the pandemic years of 2020 and 2021 into 2022. Mark went through chart with some math, which gave you kind of our indication for 2022. And also, as I said earlier, is we do believe there would be some COVID testing, but the base business will be recovering, and we'll get growing \u2013 going forward in 2022 based upon our outlook. So the last question you add, Rick, you have to deal with the digital front end and digital-first and we're excited about this because we're very well positioned. This isn't something that we have just started working on. We've been working on it for a while. First of all, if you go back to a large provider like Quest, we're very much embedded in the ecosystem of connectivity already. We have over 500 interfaces of all the different electronic medical records, obviously, that's the big players like the Cerner, but there's hundreds of others. And so therefore, we have a real strong interoperability capability. And that's helpful because when you're in the workflow because from a disposition perspective, that allows you to more streamline the different service offerings like laboratory to fewer players. And then secondly is this past year, we've seen the acceptance, if you will of telehealth, it has been growing nicely but out explosively, and we did see explosive growth in 2020 and we believe that overall, that acceptance, if you will, of that front end, be an accepted way to first engage with the healthcare that this system will continue. And the payers are working on that and providers are working on that, and they're working with other partners, and we're very well positioned with those other partners. So who are those partners? Those partners are some of the telehealth companies that you know. And those telehealth companies, as they become much more indebted in healthcare delivery, let's call the digital equipment , will rely on a fewer number of laboratory service providers, and therefore, we're very well positioned as more of a small handful of what just described as the deferred lab network that we are ready with United, but for this new world that we see. And with all that, we do believe that our direct-to-consumer initiative will have an opportunity as well, because consumers equally are wanting to engage with upgrade delivery. They not always need to engage with this physician. And therefore, with the prospects we see of growing that business and the opportunity for consumers to serve themselves, if you will, which is a big opportunity for us. As far as investment, we are investing. We were fortunate enough to have the capabilities in 2020 and 2021. If you again go back to what we shared at Investor Day, we said we're investing about $75 million over a period over the last two years, 2020 and 2021. Some portion of that is related to what we're discussing here. And so, we're not rate limited by investments. We're rate limited by logistics time to get some traction, and we're very well positioned with the telehealth companies, very well positioned with the plans. And yes, we do see a change. And yes, this will allow us, again, to gain share as we go forward, because they can't do this with tens of laboratories, they can only do it with a select group like us. So we have another question? Shawn Bevec : Operator? Operator : Our next question comes from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is open. Derik de Bruin : Hi. Good morning. Steve Rusckowski : Hi, Derik. Derik de Bruin : Thanks for taking the question. Hey. So two questions. One is, I was on the Danaher call just before this, and they actually pretty sharply raised their COVID testing guidance for the year and also surprisingly gave a very bullish outlook for 2022 and sort of backing that number. So I think the first question goes to, is some of the -- this is a question on the point-of-care shifting from decentralized testing, shifting to point of care. Is some of the volume you're seeing coming down just because there are more of these point-of-care platforms out there and just as they ramp capacity, you're seeing volume shifting out of the central lab? That's the first question. And then I think the second question is, when you look at your -- you're at 100,000-ish test, you've got 300,000 capacity. How are you using -- how do you utilizing that capacity? Is it more -- are you ramping down your IVD platforms versus your LDT platforms? Just to assume that it's more of the IVD, because the LDTs are more profitable. But just would love some idea on sort of like how you're utilizing your installed base. Thank you. Steve Rusckowski : Yes. So the first part, yes, we did see an increase in the availability and use of the antigen testing and point-of-care testing throughout the last 12 months that clearly has picked up in the back half of 2020. We see that continue in 2021. So if you look at the industry trackers of how much testing we are doing in this country, clearly, it has dropped off, and therefore, volumes have dropped off as well. We believe in those tracking mechanisms, it's predominantly PCR. However, we think there could be some point-of-care antigen testing in there, but we believe it does not include all the testing that\u2019s happening. So if you look at it, look, happy for PCR testing throughout the United States and if you look at the excellence that are coming from least point-of-care and antigen providers, you see that the actual level of testing is almost at the same level that we were in the summer, but in different forms. So the answer to your question is, yes, there is a transition from PCR is exclusively what we have to more of the capabilities around point-of-care and antigen testing. However, going back to what I said, all tests are not created equal. And so we're also working with clients to make sure they realize where antigen testing can be helpful for a period of time. And also what you need to reflex into PCR and where you can use point-of-care and costs are not all created equal. So it has come down because of what we described, but there continues to be a strong role for PCR through the remainder of 2021 and also into 2022. Operator : Our next question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Pito Chickering : Hey, guys, thanks for follow-up question here. Could you give us a little more details on the changes of what the UnitedHealthcare did for out-of-network providers in the quarter, what markets did they make this change in, what impacts did you see in your volumes from these changes? Thanks so much. Steve Rusckowski : Yeah. Yeah. So what we have been working on as a journey to pick up share, if you will, it can be mated what we shared in March at our Investor Day is we really kicked off the network program in 2019. We saw a good progress there. We're actually very encouraged by what we saw in 2020, it's very early days, and then we have the pandemic. But it didn't stop our activity. So what we shared is we actually picked up some share over that period of time, but we have more share to gain. And there's a list of activities we're working with United to support picking up share and getting it to at least that 25% level, one of which is what we're providing is limiting the other network policy and benefit design for their fully insured book. And where that has happened because we have other examples of the topic, it does move share to us. We don't provide specifics on states and specifics on how much did this contribute to share. But it did have a nice impact for us to allow us to pick up share. And so we continue that market. But I'll also share that we didn't share everything we're doing. There are many other programs, and some of this is working with their plan sponsors. Their employers, some of this is working with their regions, specific opportunities with providers. When we do an outreach purchase and relationship within the geography, whose work on expensive venue to a less expensive venue, which is Quest, and all of those are active relationships that we have to continue to build share with United and other payers is equally will continue to work programs with the Anthem and others. Operator : Our last question comes from Eugene Kim with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : Hello. Eugene Kim : Hi, good morning. So quickly on 2022, at the Investor Day, the company provided a baseline EPS range of $7.40 and $8, and I believe fund to the higher end of that range. And that was what assumption that base business recovery return to pre-pandemic levels toward the end of the year. With the potential -- I mean, the recovery come faster than expectation, how should we think about that range that provided at the Investor Day? Thanks. Steve Rusckowski : Mark? Hey, Mark you there? Mark Guinan : Yeah. So the -- what I would say is, I'm not in a position to update that what we provided at Investor Day, because we could get in a rhythm of constantly getting asked to update that. So next time we'll comment will be when we provide guidance for 2022. But of course, as we have that broader range, there's a lot of different considerations, what the remaining level of COVID testing, what's the reimbursement level. Where is the base business at? When we gave the $7.48, as we said, we're expecting the base business to be fully recovered this year to be back to 2019 baseline and starting to grow. But depending on the pace of some of these initiatives that are being rolled out by several payers, not just United by Anthem and some of the other major players depending on the economy, depending on, obviously, potential expansion of covered lives. There's a lot of variables that we'll know a lot more about by the end of the year before we give guidance for 2022. So stronger recovery of the base business, good fact, I wouldn't say at this point that, the faster decline in COVID testing yet necessarily implies anything for 2022 around our comments. Because we assumed it would still be around, and you heard from others as well. Nobody thinks is going away. And we were not expecting it to be anywhere near the significance that it was in 2020 and in 2021. So \u2013 and then you've got the ASR we just announced. So there's a lot of different moving pieces. So we'll give you an update on 2022, when we provide our guidance for 2022. We just wanted to ground people at Investor Day, because the pandemic really confounded everyone's ability to understand our long-term earnings power, and that's why we thought it was important to make a specific comment on 2022. Shawn Bevec : Good. So I think we've covered all the questions. We appreciate you joining the call. We appreciate your continued support, and have a great day, everybody. Take care.

The entire contents of the call, including the presentation and question-and-answer session that will follow, are the copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics with all rights reserved. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. Shawn Bevec : Thank you, and good morning. I'm with Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and we'll discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. The company continues to believe that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on future operating results, cash flows and/or its financial condition will be primarily driven by the pandemic severity and duration, health care insurer, governments and clients payer reimbursement rates for COVID-19 molecular tests, the pandemic\u2019s impact on the US health care system and the US economy and the timing, scope and effectiveness of federal, state and local governmental responses the pandemic, including the impact of vaccination efforts, which are drivers beyond the company's knowledge and control. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS. Any references to base business testing, revenues or volumes refer to the performance of our business, excluding COVID-19 testing. Growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections, including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings growth, are compound annual growth rates. Finally, revenue growth rates from acquisitions will be measured against our base business. Now here is Steve Rusckowski. Steve Rusckowski : Thanks, Shawn, and thanks, everyone, for being us today. We had another strong quarter and continued to build momentum, thanks to faster than expected recovery in our base business. Organic based testing revenues grew compared to 2019 levels in the quarter. This is the first quarter since 2019 that organic base testing revenues grew. The growth was driven by contributions from new hospital lab management contracts as well as people returning to health care systems. We are well positioned to continue our momentum and support the return to health care in the coming months, which is reflected in the outlook we have provided for the remainder of 2021. Mark Guinan : Thanks, Steve. In the second quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.55 billion, up approximately 40% versus the prior year. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services grew 40.2% compared to the prior year, which reflected the strong recovery in our base testing revenue, slightly offset by lower revenue from COVID-19 testing services versus the second quarter of last year. Compared to 2019, our base CIS revenue grew nearly 5% in the second quarter and it was up more than 1% excluding acquisitions. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 45.2% versus the prior year with acquisitions contributing approximately 5%. Compared to our second quarter 2019 baseline, total base testing volumes increased nearly 7%. Excluding acquisitions, total base testing volumes grew approximately 2% and benefited from new PLS contracts that have ramped up over the last year. Importantly, compareto our 2019 baseline, our base testing volumes were \u2026 We discussed making approximately $75 million in targeted investments to support our long term strategies to accelerate growth. These investments are ramping with $50 million expected to fall in the second half. We also continue to incur expenses to comply with CDC guidelines, address supply chain challenges and maintain staffing levels to ensure high levels of service and quality as the base business recovers faster than expected. We forecast these expenses to be approximately $30 million in the back half of the year. Finally, the low end of our outlook assumes an average of at least 20,000 COVID-19 molecular tests per day and 3,000 serology tests per day. It also assumes low single digit revenue growth in our base business in the second half of '21 versus 2019. The midpoint of our guidance assumes slightly stronger COVID-19 molecular testing volumes and a modestly faster recovery of the base business and the high end of our guidance assumes both a greater level of COVID-19 testing and the strong continued recovery in the base business. Steve Rusckowski : Thanks, Mark. Well to summarize, we had another strong quarter with a faster than expected recovery in our base business. We are well positioned to continue our momentum and support the return to health care in the coming months. And then finally, I'd like to thank all Quest employees and the team to serve the needs of people who rely on Quest every day. Now we'd be happy to take any of your questions. Operator? Operator :  Our first question from Ann Hynes, Mizuho Securities. Ann Hynes : I just have a question on -- I think you just said your guidance assumes about 20,000 molecular tests per day. Is that average for the entire second half or is that exiting the year? Also, can you just talk about what your guidance assumes for any kind of labor and inflation pressures for the second half? And do you see that those getting worse or are they stable throughout the year? Mark Guinan : So Ann, at 20,000 is not the exit rate, it is the average for the back half. The 20,000 was the baseline for the low end of guidance. To get to the middle part of guidance, we would expect somewhat stronger than 20,000, of course there's moving pieces because it's also dependent on how the base business moves. And then the high end of guidance would be significantly more COVID testing and then a stronger base business recovery more in the mid single digits revenue. So that's how we try to dimentionalize the range for you. In terms of labor pressure, we certainly saw some of that and we responded to it and that's built into the whole year. It's not accelerating at this point in our outlook in the back half. So we have a process where we make annual salary and wage adjustments that was implemented earlier in the year. We certainly make some market adjustments periodically, which we've done and that's not unusual. So there's nothing extraordinary in the back half of the year in terms of labor inflation. Operator : Our next question is from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Brian Tanquilut : I guess my question for you, Steve. As we think about the PLN and the preferred networks, it sounds like we're seeing some progress there. But any color you can give us on the recovery and the uptake and the traction you're getting there, especially as we exit the COVID drag. Steve Rusckowski : So we're feeling about the programs we've put in place over the last couple of years, Brian. We started these with United, as you know. And then we mentioned that we have a program that we're working with Anthem across the country, so we feel good about. We continue to work on the programs with other payers that see this as an opportunity as well. And what I said in my remarks, we do see those payers and the volume going through those payers growing faster than our other base recovery. So we feel we're actually getting some traction where everything was put in place. And I can tell you the engagement between us and those organizations are quite good. And I've said before in my remarks, we see an opportunity to get a variation to move with a high quality low cost value laboratory like Quest Diagnostics and then tighten up the network to what we describe as for lab network. And it's really all about what we've talked about in my remarks around the triple aim and primarily in affordable care. So good progress. What we've done already is making advance in the opportunity and we see more opportunities in front of us. Operator : Our next question is from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Jack Meehan : I wanted to dig in a little bit more on the base business recovery. Was it fairly linear since the end of March to the commentary you made around June? And then was curious if you're seeing any sort of pent-up demand and whether you thought that might have helped the trajectory? Any commentary around test per acquisition that would be helpful. Steve Rusckowski : So we are seeing a nice step by step improvement in base business. I would say it's been a nice recovery over the sequence of the first half. You remember we entered the half with our base business being down somewhat around high single digits and kind of improved throughout Q1 and that continued into Q2. And there's different ways we look at it what is the clinical cost and we actually see good recovery in our general health business or current  business. I mentioned in my remarks, our advanced diagnostics business, which includes a portion of cancer and genetic  testing to recovery. We still see our prescription drug monitoring and toxicology business being somewhat of a laggard, but they're actually starting to recover, not back to '19 levels but it's coming along. And then on a geographic basis, we do see much of the country of the after \u201819 levels. And as I said before, the Northeast is stubborn -- we started to move in the right direction, Massachusetts and Connecticut and New York City being the slowest recoverer, if you will, and that's all boroughs, not just been happening. And we're hopeful as the opening continues as people get back into life within that\u2019s happening in New York that, that will recover as well. So to answer your question you started with it has more of a nice steady progression clinically and also geographically. Mark, anything you'd like to add to that? Mark Guinan : The only thing I'll add, Jack, is that it is somewhat uneven even though it has been steady nationally. And we do have a couple of regions that are actually back to the volume growth we had in those first couple of months of 2020 before the pandemic. So that's why we're feeling good not just about utilization recovery, we're really good about getting back and working on the things with our key partners such as the PLN and other relationships that we've called out with some of the payers around value based contracting and then really continuing to have our strong relationships with hospital systems. And we've talked about how much progress we've made around POS. So the good news is that things are open for business. We're able to go back in to the offices, not completely, but much more than we were over the last 12 months plus. And therefore, we're getting back to what we were doing before the pandemic started. Jack Meehan : And was there anything relating to pent-up demand that you saw? Steve Rusckowski : You know it\u2019s hard to tease out. What we talked about in our calculation of revenue per req is that we are seeing more tests per requisition. So one could assume that some of that is tag on the test because the divisions show a step up in the office and they haven't been there for 16 months. So hard to tell, you got to believe there's a little bit of that in my prepared remarks as people return and catch up on pre-pandemic levels. But we\u2019ve also, to Mark's point, that we\u2019ve done into '19 but remember when we started '20, we have some nice growth in the first couple of months. So we've got more opportunities in front of us to continue to recover and also build on top of what we see to gain that share we're planning for. Operator : Our next question is from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Ricky Goldwasser : Just a quick follow-up and then sort of my main question. Just on the follow-up, you mentioned that you renewed the Aetna contract. So just wanted to understand how should we see the remodel, how should we think about the pricing impact for the next 12 months? And then when we think about the value based programs that you're now signing with payers. I think, Steve, you mentioned that it's actually growing faster than the rest of your book. Can you maybe give us some color on where you\u2019re seeing these value based relationships and mostly focused on commercial versus Medicare? And also what's the framework, are you sharing upside from the savings or are these more sort of fixed price contracts with some downside protection. Steve Rusckowski : Mark, do you want to talk about what\u2019s in\u2026 Mark Guinan : So first off, the Aetna contract was extended. It will be invisible to you because there was no significant change in pricing. And in that contract, we continue to build stronger elements of what we call value based programs and I'll touch on that in a minute, Ricky. So it's more focused on commercial, although obviously, Medicare Advantage as well. There are certain things you can do in the  commercial that are harder to do in Medicare Advantage because some of the rules around that program. But the framing is not us sharing our upside with them but really they're sharing their upside with us. So we win together. So as we show greater value for their membership by getting more work to a better value lab like ourselves relative to out of network providers or in some cases other high cost providers in network, obviously, their members or for their fully insured book, they themselves pay money, and then we earn upside to a base level contract. And that base contract is not at a discount, it's really been kind of a historical level. So we didn't have to give up in order to gain. But it was really more about the case that we've been making for years that's getting more and more buy-in from the payers that we're part of the solution. And working with us and not focusing on our price but focusing on what we can do to drive better quality, better service and better value for their members is good for everybody in that ecosystem. So that's really the elements we shared. Steerage when they give us list of accounts where a lot of efforts going to out of network or higher cost providers. We go in with their support, calling those to educate for the people who have  plans, coinsurance, et cetera. So the patients are bearing some of that higher cost, which obviously has more influence benefit that's fully covered by the payer in terms of the doctor. And then we talked about M&A incentives where in the past when we would buy hospital outreach as soon as we start billing it and fall to our price, obviously, and the huge windfall to the payers but that it's good for them if we buy outreach and therefore, instead of taking that debt immediately, maybe a step down in those rates and we share some of those savings over those first couple of years. And that's an element we've gotten into just like every one of the major payer contracts. So it's things like that, Ricky, where we've made the case and they're finally buying in that when we're successful and they're successful together we can do more of that and therefore, there is upside than in the past we didn't see that now we have a chance to earn when we prove that we've actually saved them money and driven improvement for their members. Ricky Goldwasser : So just one follow-up on the upside payment to base levels. So should we think about that now that sort of at the end of the year as you calculated by the upside, we could see upside to numbers from payments at the end of the year, or is this something that would just kind of flow through on a quarterly basis? Mark Guinan : Well, I'll address the two examples I gave. So in the steerage one, where we're moving work, it's really more quarterly. So it's a constant look at that. We have a formula for doing that and then we're reimbursed more regularly. It's not a once a year catch-up and that's much better for us for a lot of reasons, not just for more regular rev rec but also for accounting purposes and so on for both of us, that's a better approach. On the M&A, obviously, that would be somewhat invisible to you. Because when we do a deal what it just means is that we get paid more than we would have historically a little bit with some of a premium over what our negotiated rates would be for the volume that clearly has moved from that hospital system to us, the hospital outreach business. So you\u2019re not going to really see that. Again, that's going to be a regular monthly quarterly thing, not a catch up. Operator : Our next question now is from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Ralph Giacobbe : So you mentioned PAMA in the prepared remarks, and looks like the cuts are likely to restart next year. Maybe just remind us the headwind. And then at your Analyst Day, you suggested an EPS range for 2022 and kind of pointed to the higher end, I think, closer to an $8 number. Just wanted to confirm that, that assumed PAMA was coming back. And then just your comments on incremental investments that you talked about in the back half. Just wondering does that change anything related to that $8 number that we should be thinking about for 2022? Steve Rusckowski : Let me start with PAMA. So remember we said in our remarks we're filing hard to get a better answer on PAMA. And so hopefully, that was clear in the remarks. We do believe that the MedPAC report, those gave us some data that suggests that we were right with saying that if you collected all the data, it was representative that there will be a 10% to 15% reduction in the rates versus what we see now. And we obviously have some work to work with reduction in the price cost, not a reduction in the clinical outreach, just to make that clear, an increase of 10% to 15%. And in that regard, we have some work to do to get that through congress because it's going to be a legislative fix but we're going to keep on pushing on that. But with all that said what I'll keep on saying is we're assuming worst case in our outlook that in '22, we'll see another top. So that's clear. And then Mark, do you want to talk a little bit on the range and where are we pointed to at Investor Day. Mark Guinan : So what I would say is that I laid out the CAGRs from 2018 and said obviously, the pandemic has clouded issues with the base business. And at some point, we all hoped COVID is a much smaller piece of our revenues. And the base business CAGR that we laid out would have suggested , and what we were saying is based on a base business being fully recovered by the end of the year and everything else that we're confident we should be in that range. And yes, we felt because of everything we knew at that point that it should be in the upper end of that . PAMA was absolutely included in that. As I shared that at this point, if nothing changes, should be the last year of the sizable reductions that we've had since PAMA was implemented. So based on the current fee schedule and the current methodology, there can be 15% cut on any CPT code next year. And we estimate our overall book of business is going to be somewhere between 10% to 15%, so higher than 10% but less than 15% based on what we can see. However, because that traditional Medicare book of business is much smaller than it was when we started, the dollar impact is actually going to be similar to what it was in the first couple of years of PAMA. So it\u2019s still a large number, somewhere around 1% of our overall revenues. And then once you get beyond that, even if PAMA isn't fixed, based on our understanding of commercial pricing and we don't know everything but certainly, we know our prices and we've shared that we\u2019ve really stabilized commercial pricing, combined with some competitive intelligence in the marketplace. We feel that while there might be some cuts with the recalculation they're going to be relatively small compared to what we incurred for several years. Steve Rusckowski : And we continue to feel good about the investments we're allowed to make on the additional resources. We talked about at Investor Day, about $75 million worth of investments. We talked today that continues in the back half of the year, that\u2019s guidance in the outlook or the guidance we provided. And it's entirely consistent with what we teed up at Investor Day and on our growth platforms. We're investing in both self plans relationships with hospital opportunities we see. We see opportunities to accelerate advanced diagnostics. We feel good about the recovery we've seen there and then also the opportunity we see around the consumer and consumer initiated testing. So our performance is allowing us to make these investments to accelerate growth, to get to the outlook that we provided to you for '22 and beyond, which is the 4% to 5% top line growth in high single digit earnings growth. So we feel good about our ability to make those investments and we're are making them. So we're hiring the people, we're spending the money and it's included in the guidance in the back half. Mark Guinan : And then the revenue as well. So some of these are several years in the coming in terms of the return and some of them we get much more immediate. On consumer, we've talked about potential $0.25 million business by 2025, that's coming from small  before the pandemic. And so you could imagine that with some of the things we're doing, we're going to be building significant incremental revenue to get to that $250 million over the next couple of years. It's not going to all come in the last year or something like that. So we're getting revenue growth upside as well for those investments, not just incremental expense. Operator : Our next question is from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Pito Chickering : Two quick follow-up questions here. On the 2021 guidance, you quantified the COVID assumptions and base business assumptions for the low end of guidance. Can you quantify the same levels for the midrange and the high range guidance? And just to clarify on the last question, the investments that you're making this year, does this continue into 2022 and beyond? Are they onetime in nature or do you have to add additional investments next year? Mark Guinan : So I didn't intend to quantify with specificity been at high end, because it's a multivariable equation. So what I wanted to do was make clear the low end for a lot of reasons. You can imagine, we wanted to make people understand how we might get to that low end. And it's not a base business recovery that stalls or goes backwards so it's really a much slower than what we've seen and that we would expect. And we don't think there's a high probability for that. But one thing we've learned this pandemic is all these things are somewhat volatile and hard to predict. If you saw a lot of retrenchments across the country because of the celta variant or other things that might cause geographies to shut down, we want to make sure that we provide you guidance that are 95% plus deliverable or even more. So once you get beyond the floor, there's so many different moving parts that could go in opposite direction. It's kind of harder to give you a point estimate. We wanted to make sure that people also understood that the COVID average per day, we anticipate for the balance year significantly lower than we're getting right now. As you might imagine, we've been working on this outlook for a while. The recent news with obviously delta driving up the positivity rate cases, obviously, our volume is increasing. One thing we've also learned is not to overact the short term. So we're very transparent. So we give you those volumes every two weeks. So we felt that we can build reasonably deliverable, highly deliverable outlook to make clear what those assumptions are and especially around the COVID volumes, you're going to see that every two weeks. So you're going to know where we're going in terms of net outlook range that I laid out this morning. Steve Rusckowski : As far as the investments, some of the investments are temporal within '21. But as you would expect, we're investing in long term capabilities that will continue into '22. But rest assured that to be reapplied business case and the revenues associated would be there as well. So yes, we will have the outlook assumptions, we'll have some portion of these investments to '22 and trust that those investments are investments for us to do that. Mark Guinan : And back to Ralph's question, again, I want to emphasize those were built into the outlook that I provided in Investor Day. So we've tried to make clear that we see these growth opportunities. The COVID revenue upside give us the opportunity not just to deliver some record earnings for the last couple of quarters but actually to invest and accelerate the long term prospects for our base business. So we thought it was the right balance between near term delivery results as well as the long term growth of the business. And so when I gave you that multiyear outlook for years and then when I frame 2022, those all fully contemplated these investments. Pito Chickering : So then just on that one, is it fair to say that you are reiterating the number today for 2022? Mark Guinan - CFO: Yes, so nothing's changed. So we would feel compelled if there was something over the last six months that would cause us to feel that, that range was no longer appropriate. We will take some of it, absolutely. Operator : Our next question now is from Dan Leonard with Wells Fargo. Tim Daley : This is actually Tim Daley on for Dan. So I just wanted to dig a bit more on Pito's question. So I believe the back to school total opportunity has framed as upside in relation to the guidance for the second half of the year. So first, I just wanted to clarify, is there any back to school testing baked into the COVID guidance or company level ranges discussed? And then secondly, given we are kind of weeks away from kids heading back to school. I'm sure there's been some discussions, but could you give us some insight into the internal on the ground discussions happening? Like are there broad based general screening plans for back to school and maybe a big one off push at the start of the year? Just any more additional color there would be really helpful. Steve Rusckowski : So Mark just laid out expectations around COVID testing. We did assume that the clinical testing would come down and the return to life testing would go off and a portion of that return to life has to do back to school programs. And what we highlighted is we've been working with the different partners with two programs that are funded with the funding for testing. One is the 600 million program for return to school programs where we have partners to help us with that and school systems throughout the United States could apply for that money and get money to reimburse whatever program come up. And then there's a larger program to about $10 billion. But as you can understand, I mean, every school system throughout the United States is going to have its own plan. And so they're going to start ramping up soon than into the month of August and in September. And I think there is going to be a fair amount of variance across the United States and who does what, when. And I do believe that given what we see now with the delta variant, I'm sure that will have some bearing on the need for testing to make sure that we're safe when kids return back to school. And also return to office programs, we do expect that there will be more returning to the workplace, those people that have been working remotely. I think clearly, there's been heightened level of safety with that happening. And as I said in my earlier remarks, testing is vital to that. So we've embedded that in our expectations as well. But we assume that clinical testing would come down. We believe that a lot of our capacity is not used for the hospital portion of COVID testing as in the early days of COVID testing. And some of the recent increase that we've seen has been related to some of the effects we see from the delta variant so far in the last week or two. So hopefully, I\u2019ve provided some color on what's assumed in the guidance so far. Mark Guinan : I just want to remind everybody how that surveillance testing works. It's very different than our clinical testing. So if you think about the PCR test today where we're averaging over $90 per test, that's not economical for surveillance. So what we have come up with the numbers are as well, our methodology is a heavily pulled approach. We pull a handful of samples today when we're testing in low positive regions for economic reasons. But it's our responsibility if we are positive to retest those individual samples. So you don't want to pull too many because the math suggests that you're going to be retesting a lot of samples. And so when you go to surveillance, the assumption is that nobody has it. And so therefore, you're going to do a lot less retesting. But actually, in this case, we're not obligated to do it because they\u2019re not even identified. So what happens is the collections done, the entity, in this case, the school, knows whose 10 samples, let's say, are in that specimen collection device. It's not shared with us. All we do is test it and we say this is negative hopefully. And in the case where it's positive then they, the administrators, know which students need to be retested. And then that's a separate order. That's a separate payment, et cetera. And so the reason that's important is that in order to make this economic and because the economies can be kept with this huge coin, we have to do approximately 10 specimens to equate to a single one for our core PCR vessel. So the volumes have to be 10 fold at the same dollar values for our top line. So yes, there's absolutely some contracts we won, we\u2019ve got some of that volume. But to really move the needle it has to be really broadly endorsed and embraced. And while the funding there, to this point, we've seen some momentum but not enough to be significant at this point and really move the needle to offset the decline in the clinical testing we've seen over the last several months. Operator : Our next question now is from Derrick Brown with Bank of America. Derrick Brown : So twp quick questions. Just a little bit more color on the recovery in the base business, just are you seeing anything in particular in terms of oncology and esoteric versus routine testing? Just a little bit more color on that. You gave some geographical differences, but I'd love some mixed differences. And then another question that keeps coming up. In contrast, you're guiding to -- we just got off the  and they're talking about, they went from 10 million point of care tests in the first to 14 million point of care tests in the second quarter. So one of the question we continue to get on the central lab is the impact longer term on the business on point of care testing, is this trend going to continue, particularly given the number of players that are sort of entering this market from the point of care and at home space. So I'd love to hear your general thoughts on sort of your spot on volume shifts to certain applications into the point of care market? Thank you. Steve Rusckowski : Let me start with the first one. So what we said is our general health and our cardio metabolic testing, which is sometimes referred to by us as our general diagnostics and I would say the industry sometimes is also -- routine type of prognostic and that\u2019s in the United States and that\u2019s recovered there. Second, as you asked about oncology, we've seen some recovery at our AP business and pathology business. And as I said in my remarks, our advanced diagnostics business, which is our definition of sometimes called esoteric has actually recovered nicely, and we are making investments there, and we think we're tracking well against our investment accelerated growth plan. So we feel good about that. And the second question, which has to do with point of care. And when I say point of care, the PCR point of care and then also the antigen test. We do believe there's some portion of the testing demand, if you will, that's taking place with these new approaches. We do believe there is a place that we would return to work programs related to testing and some of the point of care applications. Well equally what you see with our volumes somewhat stabilized, as you saw in the second quarter when we report our numbers and the modest increase that we saw is PCR continues to be the gold standard. And so in many cases, they do reflex back to the PCR testing when there is a positive for sure, questionable negative metric not the false negative. So we do believe we did a good place in the marketplace and we do believe there is point of care devices, including the antigen as well as PCR going forward. Operator : Our next question from Tycho Peterson with J.P. Morgan. Unidentified Analyst : This is Julia on for Tycho today. A lot of my questions have been answered already. So just following up on an earlier question about your payer program. It's great to see that you're having success with United and Anthem and recently with new contract with Aetna as well. You previously said the volume through these relationships are growing faster than the rest of your book. Just curious if you can provide some additional color on how much faster these volumes are growing? And what kind of investments you are making to capitalize on these opportunities? Mark Guinan : So as you might imagine, there's not an answer to how much faster because they're not all equal. And also there are more -- each of them have more concentration in certain geographies. So as we shared with Northeast and specifically New York City is growing at different rates. So if you assume that payer there, more membership there, we might have a different answer than the payers that are in Texas. So Florida, I would say, or even California. So we've looked at, because it's one of our key -- you know, we have a full process, we call the  and we have these breakthrough objectives, one of them is growing our share in these health plans. And we look at it regularly and we share information back and forth to understand kind of our share of wallet with those. And so we have chance to see as they themselves also are recovering in terms of the volume that's going through their membership, whether we seem to be growing at the same pace in that recovery. And that's the basis for our saying that we're growing faster. So you know in this business a couple of hundred basis points is a big difference. It's not going to be half a percent or double digit kind of differential. But couple of hundred basis points of share growth is meaningful. That's clearly what we saw before the pandemic started as you look back to our 2019 performance, what we shared in the first two months of 2020. So line of the business utilization becomes fully recovered what happen is that we'll get back to that, not just historical growth of market but finally getting to growth above that by share gains. And that's what we laid out in our multiyear outlook at Investor Day. Steve Rusckowski : And as far as investments, what Mark said is everyone plans all the detail, plan of what we're going to do to gain that share. And some of that happens nationally and some of it happens locally and some of it happens by line of business. So we do have some programs to go with the payer to grow national talents and their plan sponsors and plan sponsors. And so a lot of that is local. And so you asked the question where we're making investments. We'll put those investment dollars where we think we need extra capacity to drive those programs by payer. And there's a lot of variation around where those opportunities are by payer and that detail is what we're speaking to when we talked about investments in the health plans. Mark Guinan : I'll just give you one other example, which we've shared in the past, but it's really expanded broadly. So take toxicology in perspective of monitoring. The payers as that is starting to grow and there was some concern the payers part around the behavior of some of the providers, they put in some really onerous rules in place, such as pre-authorization and so on. Of course that impacts everybody, including the people like ourselves who are very responsible around our panels and how we conduct ourselves. And so we went for some of the payers, talked to them about that and said, hey, not only is that not right for us, it's not right for the patient, because it's going to be make it more difficult for them to get testing they need. But also if you got rid of that, you would actually steer more work to the good less. And when I say it's not just certainly our chief competitor and some others are just like us, they're very responsible. We do good work and tops calling prescription monitoring. So they put in rules in place where we're actually vented from pre-op. So that's another example where it's really not an investment, it's an investment of time to work with them to get them to understand and get them to change some of these rules and behaviors. But again, as an example where we're benefiting but so are the patients and a lot of other people, because it's a more thoughtful approach to rules around lab testing. Operator : Our last question now is from Matt Larew with William Blair. Matt Larew : So the Clifton lab went live in January and Steve, I think you said the consolidation from it will wrap up here next month. In the past you talked about sort of doubling throughput, 30% more capacity, I think 50% increase in productivity. Just curious if there are any data points to share so far on how the consolidation is going, and how we should think about the impact to margins as volumes consolidated into Clifton? Steve Rusckowski : So we're pleased with what we're able to do. It's pretty remarkable that we built this facility in the middle of the pandemic and for all intents and purposes that are on track and it's up and running. And we bring in this facility to do that consolidation, we have to continue our program around organizational processes and harmonization around systems to get them all in the same platform within the new facility. So we're on the final strokes of that implementation, we feel good about it. And then in that facility, we have implemented a lot of the new systems we've been in place for our new immunoassay platform from Siemens, we talked about, it's a big investment for us. We are getting some pretty good gains for them and more to come. We\u2019ll put in place new front end automation and through the lab automation with our partner Inpeco. And actually, Siemens has done the systemization with that as well. So we are pleased with the progress made so far and we're looking forward to more productivity from that going forward as we continue to burn in systems and work out some of the early details and those improvements are already part of the 3% productivity gains that we have in our operational excellence program and that are already included in our outlook that we provided at Investor Day. Matt Larew : Thanks. Steve Rusckowski : Okay. So thank you, everyone, for this call, and we appreciate your continued support. You have a great day.

The entire contents of the call, including the presentation and question-and-answer session that will follow, are the copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics with all rights reserved. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. Now I'd like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead, please. Shawn Bevec : Thank you, and good morning. I'm joined by Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, CEO and President; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and we'll discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K. The company continues to believe that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on future operating results, cash flows and/or its financial condition will be primarily driven by the pandemic severity and duration, health care insurer, governments and clients payer reimbursement rates for COVID-19 molecular tests, the pandemic's impact on the U.S. health care system and the U.S. economy, and the timing, scope and effectiveness of federal, state and local governmental responses from the pandemic, including the impact of vaccination efforts, which are drivers beyond the company's knowledge and control. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS, and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS. Any references to base business, testing, revenues or volumes refer to the performance of our business, excluding COVID-19 testing. Growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections, including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings growth, are compound annual growth rates. Finally, revenue growth rates from acquisitions will be measured against our base business. Now, here is Steve Rusckowski. Steve Rusckowski : Thanks, Shawn, and thanks everyone for joining us today. Well, we had a strong third quarter as COVID-19 molecular volumes increased throughout the summer, while our base business continue to deliver solid volume growth versus the prior year, and 2019. In late summer, we experienced some softness in the base business across the country, but saw a rebound, in September. Importantly, our base business continues to improve sequentially in the third quarter, which speaks to the ongoing recovery. We have raised our outlook for the remainder of the year based on higher-then-anticipated COVID-19 volumes, as well as continued progress we expect to see in our base business, despite rising labor costs and inflationary pressures. The momentum of our base business positions us to deliver the 2022 outlook we shared at our March Investor Day. So, this morning, I'll discuss our performance for the third quarter of 2021, and update you on our base business. And then Mark will provide more detail on our financial results, and talk about our updated outlook and underlying assumptions. But before turning to our results in the third quarter, I'd like to update you on the progress we've made in our quest for health equity initiative, a more than $100 million initiative aimed at reducing healthcare disparities in underserved neighborhoods. Since we've established it, just over a year ago, we have launched 18 programs across the United States and Puerto Rico, ranging from supporting COVID-19 testing and vaccination events to educating young students on healthy nutritional choices, to providing funding support for a long-haul COVID-19 clinic in Puerto Rico. Recently, we announced the collaboration with the American Heart Association that will expand research and mentorship opportunities for black and Hispanic scholars to drive hypertension management and COVID-19 relief. We're off to a good start, and I look forward to updating you on our continued progress as Quest for Health Equity enters its second year. Now, turning to our results for the third quarter, total revenue of $2.77 billion, down 40 basis points versus the prior year; earnings per share were $4.02 on a reported basis, down approximately 3% versus the prior year; and $3.96 on an adjusted basis, down 8% versus the prior year. The revenue and earnings declines in the third quarter reflect lower COVID-19 testing in 2021 versus the prior year, partially offset by continued recovery in our base business. Cash provided by operations increased by nearly 20% year-to-date through September, to approximately $1.75 billion. Now, starting with COVID-19 testing, our COVID-19 molecular volumes increased in the third quarter versus the second quarter, due to the spread of the Delta variant over the course of the summer. Testing began to increase meaningfully in mid-July, and peaked in early mid-September. Our observed positivity rate peaked in mid-August, and has steadily been declining across much of the country in recent weeks. We performed an average of 83,000 COVID-19 molecular tests a day in the third quarter, and maintained strong average turnaround times of approximately one day for most specimens throughout the surge. As clinical COVID-19 volumes declined, we are expanding our non-clinical COVID-19 testing to support the return to school, office, travel, and entertainment. We're making testing easy, fast, and affordable for school systems and other group settings across the country. We are currently performing K-12 school testing in approximately 20 states, with five additional states ready to come online. We're testing passengers on   cruise lines, and Quest exclusively provided testing at the Boston Marathon earlier this month. In the base business, we continue to make progress on our two-point strategy to accelerate growth, and drive operational excellence. Now, here are some highlights from the third quarter. Our M&A pipeline remained strong. In the third quarter, we completed a small tuck-in acquisition of an independent lab in Florida. We continue to build on our exceptional health plan access of approximately 90% of all commercially insured lives in the United States. At our Investor Day, we discussed how we have fundamentally changed our relationship with health plans, and we continue to see the promise of value-based relationships come to life. So, here's a couple examples. We are working with national health plans to help their self-insured employers -- employer customers improve quality, outcomes, and lower the cost of care for both the employers and their employees. Also, effective October 1, we gained access to one million managed Medicaid members, in Florida, as their coverage transitions to  Sunshine Health Plan. We're getting good feedback from the provider community and our growing testing volumes through this expanded access opportunity. Our hospital health system revenue continues to track well above 2019 levels, driven largely by the strength of our professional laboratory services contracts. As we highlighted previously, 2021 performance is benefiting from two of our largest POS contracts to date, Hackensack Meridian Health, and Memorial Hermann. Altogether, our POS business is expected to exceed $500 million in annual revenue this year. Trends in our hospital reference business also remained steady, with third quarter base testing volumes above 2019 levels. We also generated consumer-initiated testing revenue through QuestDirect in the third quarter. While COVID testing has been strong contributor to growth, we expect our base direct-to-consumer testing to more than double this year. Recently, we soft-launched a comprehensive health profile on QuestDirect, similar to our Blueprint for Wellness offering for employers. This expanded health plan -- panel offers a deep dive into consumers' health profile with a battery of tests and biometric measurements to provide a personalized health quotient score that can be used to track health progress over time. And then finally, our MyQuest app and patient portal now has almost 20 million users. In advanced diagnostics, we continue to ramp investments and see strong momentum in key growth drivers. We're seeing growth in non-evasive prenatal testing significantly above 2019 levels, and saw solid contribution in our specialty genetics portfolio from Blueprint Genetics. We continue to work closely with the CDC to sequence positive COVID specimens in an ongoing effort to track emergent variants, expanding all of the work that we performed in the quarter. And then finally, we plan to introduce a test service based on a new FDA-approved companion diagnostic   for a therapy from Eli Lilly for a certain type of high-risk early breast cancer. Quest will be the first laboratory to offer it to physicians, nationally, at the end of the month. Turning to our second strategy, driving operational excellence, we made progress and remain on track to deliver on our targeted 3% annual efficiencies across the business. Last week, we announced that we completed the integration and consolidation of our northeast regional operations into our new 250,000 square-foot next-generation lab, in Clifton, New Jersey. This state-of-the-art highly automated facility services, more than 40 million people across seven states. In patient services, we are seeing all time high numbers of patients making appointments to visit our Patient Service Centers. Now more than 50% of patient service center visits are now by the appointment versus walk-ins. And this enables patients to be very satisfied and also improves our ability to drive productivity for our Phlebotomist. Similar to our immunoassay platform consolidation, we recently procured a highly automated neuro analysis platform that is expected to generate millions in annual savings, once these new systems are standardized across our laboratory network. And then finally, I'd like to recognize and thank all of our nearly 50,000 employees who have worked tirelessly to provide critical COVID-19 testing to our country throughout the pandemic, and continue to serve the healthcare needs of patients who depend on Quest every day. As a demonstration of our gratitude, we're assisting our employees with a one-time payment of up to $500 designed to reimburse costs, they incurred during the pandemic. Additionally, another year of pandemic pressures and travel restrictions have made it very difficult for many employees to take their hard earned time off. Therefore, we're providing a payout of most unused paid time off for our hourly employees to ensure they don't forfeit their earned unused time at year end. Now I'd like to turn it over to Mark, to provide more details on the third quarter financial performance and updated outlook for the remainder of 2021. Mark? Mark Guinan : Thanks, Steve. In the third quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.77 billion, down 0.4% versus the prior year. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services were essentially flat when compared to the prior year, which is reflected by lower revenue from COVID-19 testing services versus the third quarter of last year, largely offset by the strong ongoing recovery in our base testing revenue. Compared to 2019, our base DIS revenue grew approximately 6% in the third quarter, and it was up nearly 2%, excluding acquisitions. Volume measured by the number of requisitions increased 5.3% versus the prior year with acquisitions contributing approximately 2%. Compared to our third quarter 2019 baseline, total base testing volumes increased 9%. Excluding acquisitions, total base testing volumes grew approximately 4% and benefited from new PLS contracts that have ramped over the last year. We saw a rebound in our base business volumes in September, following a modest softening in August that we believe was at least partially caused by the rise of the delta variance and the timing of summer vacations. Importantly, our base business revenue and volume grew sequentially in the third quarter. This helps illustrate the ongoing recovery as historically total revenue and volume typically stepped down in Q3 versus Q2 due to summer seasonality. As most of you know, COVID-19 testing volumes grew in the third quarter versus Q2, which was in line with broader COVID-19 testing trends across the country. We resulted approximately 7.6 million molecular tests and nearly 700,000 serology tests in the third quarter. So, far in October, average COVID-19 molecular volumes have declined approximately 10% from where we exited Q3, but are still above the levels we expected prior to the surge of the delta variance, while the base business continues to improve since September. Revenue per requisition declined 5.4% versus the prior year driven primarily by lower COVID-19 molecular volume and to a lesser extent recent PLS wins. Unit price headwinds remained modest and in line with our expectations. Reported operating income in the third quarter was $652 million or 23.5% of revenues compared to $718 million or 25.8% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income in Q3 was $694 million or 25% of revenues, compared to $831 million or 29.8% of revenues last year. The year-over-year decline in operating margin was driven by lower COVID-19 testing revenue, partially offset by the recovery in our base business. Reported EPS was $4.02 in the quarter, compared to $4.14 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $3.96, compared to $4.31 last year. Cash provided by operations was $1.75 billion through September, year-to-date, versus $1.46 billion in the same period last year. Turning to guidance, we have raised our full-year 2021 outlook as follows. Revenue is expected to between $10.45 and $10.6 billion, an increase of approximately 11% to 12% versus the prior year. Reported EPS expected to be in the range of $4.69 and $15.09, and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $13.50 and $13.90. Cash provided by operations is expected to be approximately $2.2 billion, and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million. Before concluding, I'll touch on some assumptions embedded in our updated outlook. We expect COVID-19 molecular volumes to continue to decline from Q3 levels throughout the remainder of the year. At the low end of our outlook, we assume approximately 50,000 molecular tests per day in Q4, and serology volumes to hold relatively steady at approximately 5,000 tests per day. As you may know, late last week, the public health emergency was again extended another 90 days, through late January. We expect reimbursements of clinical COVID-19 molecular testing to hold relatively steady through the remainder of the year. However, we continue to assume average reimbursements to trend lower in Q4 as our mix of COVID-19 molecular volumes potentially shift from clinical diagnostic testing to more return-to-life surveillance testing. Finally, we continue to assume low single-digit revenue growth in our base business in Q4, versus 2019. Getting to the midpoint or higher end of our outlook ranges assumes stronger COVID-19 molecular testing volumes and/or stronger growth in our base business. I will now turn it back to Steve. Steve Rusckowski : Thanks, Mark. Well, to summarize, we had a strong third quarter. We have raised our outlook for the remainder of the year based on higher-than-anticipated COVID-19 volumes, as well as our continued progress we expect to see in our base business. And finally, the momentum of our base business positions us to deliver the 2022 outlook we shared at our March Investor Day. So, now, we'd be happy to take any of your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We will now open it up to questions. At the request of the company, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. If you have additional questions, we ask that you please fall back in the queue.  Our first question comes from Kevin Caliendo, UBS. Your line is now open. Steve Rusckowski : Good morning, Kevin. Kevin Caliendo : Thank you. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for all the details and the guidance for '21. I really want to talk about into 2022, and sort of you reiterated your guidance from March, which I believe it was at the higher end of the $7.40 to $8.00 range. And I'm just wondering at this point, what are the assumptions baked in for COVID testing into next year? Do you anticipate that it's going to continue? Do you anticipate there's going to be a meaningful decline? Any color around how you think COVID testing will proceed into next year? Steve Rusckowski : Mark, why don't you start, and then I'll follow. Mark Guinan : Sure. And, Kevin, just to be clear upfront, we haven't provided guidance yet for 2022; we provided an outlook. And we did confirm that today. And things have largely played out where we saw them for 2022, back in March, and base volumes have recovered. And we thought we were ahead in June, when it was close to being flat to 2019, and potentially saw some upside, obviously, with Delta, it's -- it took a little bit of a step back. But we still expect to enter 2022 with a base volume utilization level similar to pre-pandemic, so that's good. The second thing is we did assume that COVID will continue at a much lower level than we saw in '20 and '21, but still to be significant, and certainly much larger than our current flu testing. And we've referenced, in the past, that at some point COVID testing will still be here, but maybe more on the level of flu testing. At this point, we feel comfortable with what we had assumed, back in March, around continued need for COVID testing for PCR. And we envision a stronger role for serology going into 2022, and think that's a potential. So, we feel good about that. And then, we did reference inflationary pressures. We certainly have longer-term contracts on a lot of our purchases, but things, like fuel, certainly were subject to inflation in the near-term and going into 2022. And then most notably, as many have talked, there's certainly inflation in wages and in benefits, and especially in wages. And that, as we look at that, we gave a range, and we still feel very comfortable that when you put all those pieces together, that the $8.5 billion baseline for revenue and the $7.40 to $8.00 is certainly still deliverable, maybe in slightly different way, and -- but still very comfortable, that that's likely where we're going to land when we do finally provide guidance for 2022. Kevin Caliendo : Just as a quick follow-up, can you in any way quantify the higher inflationary pressures, supply chain, any of that? Is there any way to put numbers around that? Mark Guinan : Yes. So, I'm sure you're most interested in 2022, so, we'll see what we can provide when we come out with guidance, in early next year, to provide clarity. Certainly at this point, well, we're experiencing some of that given the performance of the business; it hasn't prevented us from significantly over-delivering our previous guidance. So, we'll take a note of consideration, Kevin. We appreciate the question. We'll see what we can do when we talk more about next year. Kevin Caliendo : Thank you. Shawn Bevec : Operator, next question? Operator : Yes, our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut, Jefferies. Your line is now open. Brian Tanquilut : Hey, good morning, guys. Congrats on the quarter. So, just a follow-up just as I think about costs and all the moving pieces. Obviously, the Clifton lab just opened. So, how are you thinking about the flow-through of the benefits from that and how it would potentially offset some of the inflationary pressures that you're seeing on the cost side? Steve Rusckowski : Yes, so, thanks, Brian, for the question. So, as you know, and what I reiterated in our prepared remarks, we've been marching with our two-point strategy for some time. And the second strategy is to drive operational excellence, and we have maintained, and just reiterated, that we do believe we can continue to deliver 3% efficiency or productivity gains going forward. And that 3% comes from a variety of programs across Quest Diagnostics, and one of which is what we did in Clifton. And I actually also reiterated a couple other programs on the prepared remarks, are working with our suppliers with new integrated platforms, what we're done around immunoassay, what we're doing around our   analysis is -- are two good examples of more work we can get the benefits from, and there's others. So, there's a lot more efficiencies in productivity we can continue to get. And as I said before, this isn't cost-cutting, this is improvement. And so, every time we make an improvement in our operation we expect our quality improves, and our service performance improves, and it has. So, we continue to make progress. You see it in our numbers this year, and you'll continue to see it in our '22 numbers as well. And that's always been used to offset headwinds, and we do have headwinds, we've had headwinds from wage bill increases in the past, albeit maybe it could be a little bit higher going forward, given what we see in the labor market. And then second is, we have seen headwinds from price consequences as well, which we've been able to offset, and we'll have some of those in '22 as we've outlined before. And then, also any additional inflationary pressures, we will be able to offset most of that, if not all of that, to be able to hit the outlook, and we just reiterated our confidence, our ability to do that. So, hopefully that's helpful. Mark Guinan : Yes, I just wanted to add a reference that the Clifton lab and its increased productivity efficiency is really part of our invigorate work that we talk about 3% productivity every year. It's not over and above or separate whatever  common is that what we've done there like we did up in Massachusetts. We have added more automation. Obviously, as you add automation, you insulate yourself a little bit from labor inflation. So, certainly, we have that going as we operate that lab, but it is built-in, and part of what my assumptions I had putting together that outlook for 2022 that we would achieve that ongoing 3% efficiency is not something specially\u2026 Brian Tanquilut : Awesome. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser, Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Steve Rusckowski : Good morning, Ricky. Ricky Goldwasser : Hi, good morning. So, one follow-up question on the cost, I mean, clearly we're all interested in a magnitude of the potential impact of paper and inflation. So, maybe you can help us by reminding us what percent of your cost structure today is labor and how should we think about it breakdown between cost of goods and SG&A? Steve Rusckowski : Mark? Mark Guinan : Yes. So, Ricky, we've shared in the past pre-pandemic, that about $3 billion of our cost was related to salary and benefits. Obviously with COVID moving around it's hard to cite the precise number with including the COVID testing. So, I think that should give you a pretty good idea of what proportion of our costs a $6 plus billion. Cost base we had prior to the pandemic has made up the labor at somewhere in the 50% range. And then as we said, as we continue to automate that certainly offset some of that, but also we are seeing an increased amount of demand for phlebotomy. So, that is going the other direction. We obviously considered a net benefit because giving access helps us grow our business and certainly makes us more attractive, especially in a world of consumerism. And it's a good thing, but it certainly will drive costs, the labor costs as a percentage of all of all costs in the other direction. Ricky Goldwasser : And then just a follow-up on the direct-to-consumer point, Steve, you mentioned a soft launch of comprehensive health plan, all that's directed in consumer. Can you just share with us what has been the response to date and maybe some data points about pricing? Steve Rusckowski : Sure. So, as I said in my introductory remarks, we have a product that we sold for years to employers called blueprint for wellness. And we offer it to request employees as well. So, it's a fabulous dipstick reading on an annual basis for people to get an indication what's going on with their health. And if we do it year upon year, you've got a good nice trending capability that I found beneficial since I've been here in question, I know many of our employees have as well and many of our customers. So, we're now using that is the product to introduce that through our direct-to-consumer channel request direct. We're very optimistic about the possibility that this has we believe that it has a unique capability that few others provide. And we also believe it's hitting the market at the right time, where many people have not gone to their primary health care providers. And we believe that there's a lot of opportunities now for people to directly engage with us as a consumer to buy this directly from us. As far as pricing marketing share what we're thinking about in terms of pricing, even though this is a soft launch. Mark Guinan : Yes. So, it's going to be a couple of hundred dollars. And when you look at the individual elements that are contained in here, it's a reasonable price for everything that you get. And I can also tell you that we've gotten a lot of feedback that this score that we give people with really simplifies how to interpret the results is a huge consumer positive. So, a lot of reason to believe that this could get some additional momentum for our consumer business, and we think the pricing is reasonable and we feel that the product we're delivering is something that consumers really find interesting valuable. Steve Rusckowski : And just to follow-up on the price, we actually did some market research to understand that the value that this provides to consumers justifies the price that we're pricing it for initially. So, we feel good about value delivered and price charged. Shawn Bevec : Operator, next question? Operator : Our next question comes from Jack Meehan, Nephron Research. Your line is now open. Steve Rusckowski : Hey, good morning, Jack. Jack Meehan : Good morning, Steve. Good morning, Mark and Shawn. I wanted to continue on the inflation topic, but looked at a different way. If operating costs were to remain elevated, do you think there's an appreciation by payers that the cost of doing business is moving higher? How do you feel about your ability to get price increases? Maybe just talk about recent negotiations. Steve Rusckowski : Yes, but let me start it, Mark, please add. Yes, we've been on this march, as I said in my remarks to continue to demonstrate to our health plan partners, that we continue to deliver value and I believe we make -- we're making tremendous progress. One is that we're picking up access in the number of lives. I mentioned 90% of insured lives are -- we're a network within the United States. And we're happy about the progress of picking some more up this coming year. So, that's moving along. Second, as far as pricing is concerned, we continue to march through our contracts as they are up and renewal. And we have said in earlier calls that we're now very fairly arise and matter of fact, we believe we offer a very affordable price offering to the health plans and their memberships with great quality, great service and very competitive pricing so much so that we're part of these preferred lab networks. So, we're justified, we are getting some modest price increases and we do believe going forward that we can continue to pound that drum. And we are using what other people are using across the United States that in fact, now that we're renting a new inflationary period. Our costs are going up just like yours. And therefore, we need to start talking about modest price increases going forward. So, Mark, you'd like to add anything to that? Mark Guinan : Yes. So, Jack, I think you appreciate, I'm sure a lot of people do as well that our health plan contracts typically are three to five years. So, it's not as if every health plan contract is up for renegotiation in any window of time. But so we've been socializing PAMA and how that is changing the dynamic and how they can look at the NLA rates and be competent that, that they have competitive rate because they know what the -- that's the market for the independent labs, which we've said is lower than the market, but the market for the independent labs. So, this whole notion of a price below Medicare, which was the historical practice is going away with PAMA. Now, you add inflation as you suggest and it's absolutely part of the conversation we've been having over the last number of months. And I can tell you that although it's not final. There is one national payer that we've been negotiating and it's not final, but it looks like the first price increase we will have gotten from them. And certainly my tenure and I'm sure more than a decade. So, we've been stabilizing as we shared our commercial negotiations to go from a world of price declines every contract extension to getting it more flat. And we actually have shared there's a handful of regional plans where we've got increases over the last couple years and now we have a national contract that I'm very optimistic we're going to get an increase. And so, how much of its inflation, how much of its PAMA, how much of it is our value proposition and seeing that working with us is a benefit for everyone versus training us as a commoditized provider of laboratory results. Can't tell you, but we're in a much better place. Steve Rusckowski : Just to remind everyone, our health plan channel business is a significant portion of our revenue every year. But what we've also highlighted, the reason why we do have unit price decreases and our typical assumptions annually is because we have other pressures in our business. We do have break business to physicians, which we call clients and our client business as under price pressure over the past several years. And that has contributed to the price pressure we see. Secondly, as we sell the hospitals and we're doing quite well in the hospital segment, but is price competitive. And then we have other product lines, where we sell our services directly to employers or to insurance companies is price pressure there as well. So, when we talk about our unit price changes, it's not all in the commercial health plan area. There's other area that we have price pressures as well. Operator : Our next question comes from A.J. Rice, Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. A.J. Rice: Thanks, everybody. I'm just trying to maybe ask you a high level question about how the pandemic is maybe impacting your business for the long term. It seems like in the pandemic we've seen people move away from just traditional physician office visits at some level virtual care, other alternative sites to get their primary care. Are you seeing and does that help you or hurt you if people go to these other avenues, which may generate testing volume, do you think you capture a disproportionate share of that? And then the other thing, I was going to ask you about the pandemic was related to the -- you've said that if you have outperformance because of COVID testing, you accelerated some of your programs for cost savings and other efficiencies. Should we think of that as just enhancing the visibility on the 3% cost reduction annual goal? Or are there things you're doing that might even present some upside to 2022 and beyond? Steve Rusckowski : Yes. So, thanks A.J. for your question. Let me take the first one, I'll ask Mark to comment on the second part of your question. First of all, telehealth as we all know has really increased considerably during the pandemic and it has really hit an inflection pouring in in-patients and consumers are now very comfortable with getting a portion of their healthcare delivered through telehealth networks, whatever that might be. And as we have watched it initially, a lot of the telehealth visits started with mental health and behavioral health and have now transitioned to more general health and primary care and even specialized care. So, with all those visits happening in telehealth, you have to engage with the patient and have to be able to enter orders. And unfortunately for us, despite the pandemic and before the pandemic, we have strong relationships with all the telehealth companies. And as you would expect, they're only going to work for us with a small group of laboratories. And question would be one of those laboratories. So, we're very well positioned with the telehealth providers, but you also know that even though there are telehealth companies, telehealth is provided through integrated delivery systems, hospital systems in different ways, and they might use one of the telehealth provider platforms, but they're still providing that through their physicians and using their EMR. And so, when they enter the order, it's going to be into the order of the same way as in the past. So, we're watching it carefully. We do believe it's as a positive trend for us given what I just described, but it's complicated because it all depends how telehealth platforms are deployed in particularly with so many on physicians, by integrated delivery systems. And they're still conducting the business as they do. It all depends how they actually implement their telehealth services throughout their network and how that will affect our business. But again, for us, we believe it is a positive. So Mark, do you want to take the second part? Mark Guinan : Yes, actually, A.J. could you repeat that the second part? Steve Rusckowski : It had to do it accelerating our drive program because of our enhanced performance. And I think he's speaking to some of the acceleration and capital purchases that we've made and spending some additional money to get more improvements than what we would have realized if we didn't have the pandemic. A.J. is that a correct\u2026 A.J. Rice: Still there -- Mark Guinan : Yes. So, we have had an opportunity to invest more than we probably would have otherwise given the stronger growth than we would have anticipated in 2021. We've talked about that. A lot of that investment has actually been more towards top line acceleration. So, we've talked about, what we're doing in advanced diagnostics, we talked about what we're doing, what requires to build a consumer business. So, I'd say a disproportionate amount of the opportunity, as we try to balance near term results with longer-term, value accretion has really been in top line. But yes, as we looked at some of the things we did during the pandemic, we have an opportunity to update our molecular equipment and into more efficient \u2013 into more state-of-the-art, probably faster than we normally would have cycled. So, that'll give us some efficiency that maybe wouldn't have otherwise. So, I wouldn't -- at this point suggest that we're ready to commit to more than the 3% productivity, because obviously that's the large number of unit of itself and small basis points changes are really significant. But directionally, I would say, yes, A.J., this pandemic goal was of value accretion in additional cash has enabled us to accelerate some investments. Most of it on the top line growth, but certainly some on the productivity side as well. Operator : Next up is Ann Hynes, Mizuho Securities. Your line is now open. Ann Hynes : Hi, good morning. So, I just want to talk about the base volume trends. I know revenue was up versus 2019, but can you give us some color on how much your based volume trends are still down versus pre-pandemic, maybe ex some of the PLS deals that you've signed during the pandemic, and if it's still down maybe just to give a geographic breakdown and I guess my second question would be obviously testing was a very strong for molecular PCR test for COVID-19. Can you give us a breakdown, how much of that was contributed to like this back to life initiative, whether it's schools, cities, states more like maintenance testing, and I know you said in your prepared remarks that you assume revenue per test goes down in Q4. Can you give us what it was in Q3 and maybe just directionally what we should model for Q4? That would be very helpful. Thanks. Steve Rusckowski : Okay. Thanks, Ann. Mark, why don't you just start with giving the numbers on base business performance system there. Mark Guinan : Yes. So, hopefully, I can clarify, base volume in total is obviously anything on COVID-related as we've been through the pandemic, we've been recording strong growth in base volume, which includes our M&A and our PLS, as you would expect. But we've also been trying to provide some color on utilization, in the absence of independence way to measure that. We look at our base volume ex, the acquired volume and facts the new PLS deals. And we've talked about that continuing to improve in addition to the growth we're getting from M&A and from PLS. So, in June, the organic base volumes and the new PLS deal was getting close to back to the 2019 levels. And then it kind of stabilized in August \u2013 in July, and it took a little bit of a step in August. And then as we see where we are through September and into October, it's getting back again, very close to being fully recovered in 2019. And that's why I said earlier that we would expect certainly by the end of this year and going into '22, that we'd be fully recovered. Now, it is regionally, very variable as we've talked in the past, and that really has not changed. There are certain regions that are actually above where they were in 2019, most notably our Southwest region, as we're looking at Florida in the south, the volume trends are above, and then a couple other areas that are kind of in that middle point. And then the one area of note that's really been lagging is the east, and it continues to lag while it certainly has improved from where it was several months ago. It's still down and kind of an outlier especially in the five boroughs of New York City. And then quickly, I'll answer the question on the revenue expectations for molecular testing, and I'll let Steve talk about the back to life. So, we're still around $90 in the quarter. We're not expecting a meaningful decline in the fourth quarter. Certainly, if back to life really, really took off, which is not, what we're expecting in the middle of our guidance here, it could have a little bit of a row, but again, it's still net positive. It's just math. So, you can expect for your modeling purposes, that just a very, very slight decline in Q4, nothing of significance. Steve Rusckowski : And the last question Ann, you had asked for the breakdown of what we describe is, first of all, the clinical portion of our PCR volumes versus return to life portion of our clinical volumes. And as you can expect, it's tough for us to know exactly particularly, which bucket we can put those in. But I can tell you that the trend line is trending towards more of the return to life. We see the infection rates coming down and we see programs that we've worked on going up, examples are the return to school programs, we mentioned 20 states and five more coming. We also doing some testing for employers if they have mandates in place where they're requiring vaccination or testing. So, we'll see some increase in testing related to again, employers bringing people back to the workplace and requiring testing or vaccination for that. So, I would say trending wise, it is a larger percentage than before, but it's very difficult for us to give you exact numbers on that because we just don't get it through the orders that we received. But we think what we've provided for guidance is clearly what's going to happen in '22. Operator : Next up is Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Your line is now open. Ralph Giacobbe : Hey, good morning. Thanks. First, just a quick follow-up on a comment you made, can you give us a sense of how much flu testing you do a year, if that's what you're anchoring for baseline COVID testing going forward. And then separately, I was just hoping you could talk about COVID reimbursement and the outlook of that for next year? Obviously, you mentioned PHG got extended at least for the early part of next year, if that continues to expand, if you expect reimbursement to be better than what you assumed in that $8 EPS for next year? And then also, what about commercial pricing specifically for COVID is that that tied to PHG? Or help us understand sort of how that's negotiated and if there's a step down there for next year? Thanks. Steve Rusckowski : Mark, do you want start with the flu? Mark Guinan : Yes. So, it was quite a bit there, Ralph, we'll see if we can touch on all of them. So, we don't generally share the precise revenue for any given test offering, but it's significantly lower than our current levels of COVID and what we would anticipate. So, the flu is not the baseline for 2022. We still expect COVID testing to be multiples of our fleet revenues in 2022. And the reason flu testing is smaller than what the otherwise is. There's not a ton of molecular testing done. Physicians have become very comfortable with doing point of care. And even though the molecular is more precise, they feel that it gets good enough in the office and they have an opportunity to make money on it. So, I would probably be several years, although I don't have the ability to call it precisely before we would expect COVID to be at our flu level. And then in terms of the pricing we have either specific agreements or general agreements that as long as in the commercial rates, that as long as the federal health emergency continues, that the pricing will reflect what we're being paid by the federal government. So, it's not mechanistically tied to every contract, but we know that the expectation would be when that goes away. And again, there's still always a possibility they can decouple that $100 reimbursement rates from the health emergency. So, there's some other risks as well, but as long as that continues, we would expect most of our commercial pricing to be at the same rate. And then, obviously, when that goes away, that we would expect a negotiations to take it down to more the NLA level. So, when I talked about 2022 at the Investor Day, I talked about a reimbursement rate around $50, which is what the NLA is. And so, again, when you put all these pieces together, I want to be clear, we still fully expect to be in the upper end of that $7.40 and $8. I just wanted to caution against upside to that given everything that's going on with inflation and so on, because we do have some positive things that have developed over the last six months or so. And some of that is probably going to be partially offset if not largely offset by labor inflation. So, we're still pretty much where we were back in March. So, in the higher end of the $748, and then certainly at least $8.5 billion of revenue, which importantly ties back to the 2018 CAGR that we've shared with you at Investor Day, and so, just getting there in a little different way, but still getting to where we said we would be. Operator : Next question comes from Matt Larew, William Blair. Your line is now open. Steve Rusckowski : Good Morning, Matt. Matt Larew : Yes. Hi, good morning. So, a number of questions around labor issues, I actually want to ask about supply chain. I'm just curious if you're starting to see any challenges in sourcing anything, either for your PSCs or the labs, either longer lead times, and then if you're having any issues with the sample transport logistics? Steve Rusckowski : Well, so far Matt we're keeping up, we always have battles here and there, even despite the pandemic with supplies got a complicated business and a lot of pieces have to come together to do what we do, but not a meaningful disruption so far, but we're watching it carefully because we're not through this yet. So, the last part of this is around logistics and again, logistics have become a little more complicated given we do use commercial carriers for some portion of our logistics, but we've been managing our way through that. Fortunately, we have our own network of carriers. We have about 3,500 carriers and automobiles that are request employees. We have a fleet of small airplanes through some of the connections between our collection locations and our laboratories and they're employed by us. And so we're happy we had those in these uncertain times and we continue to have strong relationships with the national carriers as well, so far so good. Operator : Next up is Pito Chickering, Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Steve Rusckowski : Hi, Peter. Pito Chickering : Hi, good morning guys. I follow-up on Ann's question around the base testing business, once you exclude M&A and POS, can you give us color on where the tests are coming in from specifically looking at primary care visits versus specialty visit versus hospital visits? Just curious if hospitals slowdown in fourth quarter with the COVID surge, does it impact anything on your fourth quarter growth? Steve Rusckowski : Yes. So, first off, Pito to be clear, the utilization trend that I talked about being nearly fully recovery doesn't exclude all POS, it just since we're comparing to 2019, it's excluding some of the really large deals that we've done recently. So, that we don't cloud what we think utilization is. So, we had a PLS business of size back in 2019. I'm not taking that out, because obviously, that's part of the trend as well. So, when you look at the sources, we've shared that -- the recovery has been pretty broad based. There's not a lot of differences especially now, early in the pandemic there were some we talked about for certain drug monitoring, certainly being one that was lagging. A lot of that was policy driven, a lot -- some of that, not all of it, but a lot of it's been addressed and certainly we've seen the toxicology or prescription drug monitoring business coming back in the same ballpark as some of our other clinical areas. We did see hospitals recovering faster early in the pandemic as a return to trading patients for elective surgeries and so on, physician office was a little more lagging, but at this point, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, the physician business is quite strong and we're seeing the volumes especially in some of the regions above where they were in 2019. So, we don't feel other than the east that there's been any sort of a fundamental change in either patient engagement with physician offices and or the prescribing practices for our diagnostics business specifically. Operator : Next up is Tycho Peterson, JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Steve Rusckowski : Hi, Tycho. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Casey on for Tycho. Two quick ones for you guys, the first one, do you think that the increased cash spent per requisition or test density trends that you've called out in 2021 will continue into 2022. And is that baked into that $7.40 to $8 EPS outlook. And then my second one is just on capital deployment. You guys have completed the ASR, right? So should we expect any more buybacks in 4Q and what share account should we use for our model for 4Q? Thank you. Steve Rusckowski : Yes, I'll take the first one. Mark, you take the second and versus on rec density that is the number of tests per requisition. We assume there's a lot of different moving parts as you know for our business. One of which is the mix of tests. The second is number of tests for requisition being able to we have channel mix changes. So, all of that is complicated in our outlook that we've provided. So, we assume that that's in there. And Mark, you want to talk about capital deployment question? Mark Guinan : Sure. So, the ASR should be wrapped up sometime in the next 30 days. So, therefore for at this point, even we did additional purchases once the window opens and not committing to anything at this point, because we always say there's a balance between potential M&A and share repurchases. It wouldn't have a significant impact on our way so this year. So, any sort of additional purchases of our shares repurchases would be more of an impact for 2022. And obviously, we'll talk about that in detail when we come up to the guidance for 2022 early next year. Operator : Next up is Derik De Bruin, Bank of America. Your line is now open. Steve Rusckowski : Good morning, Derik. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is   on for Derek. I wanted to dig into the base business growth specifically within your advanced diagnostic business. Was there any notable trend for cancer and genetic testing, if you could comment on the growth trajectory that'd be great? Steve Rusckowski : John, in our remarks, we're pleased with the recovery we've seen in advanced diagnostics and remind everyone that our definition of advanced diagnostics are entirely molecular and genetics. And when I say recovery and I did say molecular, it does not include our COVID testing. So, it's our base, if you will, molecular and genetic testing. And we saw very good growth in beyond recovery for our prenatal testing feel good about that. And we are seeing nice growth for our genetics business. And as you recall, we did an acquisition with blueprint genetics last year, and that's progressing nicely and give us some nice growth and strength in that business. So, we feel good about the recovery and growth we're seeing in those areas that we're really focused on and genetics in general is one of those areas. Operator : Next up is Mike Newshel, Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Steve Rusckowski : Hey Mike. Mike Newshel : Hey, thanks. So, do -- there's a labor and inflation costs issues you have talked about that you can absorb in your 2022 outlook. Does that have any change in the long-term sort of growth targets that you laid out for post 2022 in terms of earnings growth? Steve Rusckowski : Mark? Mark Guinan : Yes. So, I -- at this point, obviously we have a broad range, but I would say that just like we've done in other periods of time. We'll look for and identify offsets to that. So, I -- it's not significant enough that we should deviate on a multi-year outlook in terms of our earnings growth being in the high-single digits, and we -- although we have identified everything over the next several years. I'm sure as we move through time we'll look for other productivity opportunities to offset some of that. Operator : There are no more questions. Steve Rusckowski : Okay, very good. So, thanks to everyone for joining our call today. We appreciate your continued support and everyone have a great day.

Now I'd like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead, please. Shawn Bevec : Thank you and good morning. I'm joined by Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and President; Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer and Jim Davis, our Executive Vice President, General Diagnostics and Chief Executive Officer-Elect. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and we'll discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K. The company continues to believe that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on future operating results, cash flows and/or its financial condition will be primarily driven by the pandemic severity and duration, health care insurer, governments and clients payer reimbursement rates for COVID-19 molecular tests, the pandemic's impact on the U.S. health care system and the U.S. economy, and the timing, scope and effectiveness of federal, state and local governmental responses to the pandemic, including the impact of vaccination efforts, which are drivers beyond the company's knowledge and control.

Any references to base business, testing, revenues or volumes refer to the performance of our business, excluding COVID-19 testing. Growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections, including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings growth, are compound annual growth rates. Finally, revenue growth rates from acquisitions will be measured against our base business. Now, here is Steve Rusckowski. Steve Rusckowski : Thanks, Shawn and thanks everyone for joining us today. Over the past two years, our 50,000 quest employees have risen to the challenge of COVID-19, innovating, persevering, and remaining committed to the patients and customers we serve. While doing so, they also grew our base business by more than 19% in 2021, achieving record levels. I'm extremely proud of what we have accomplished as a team. So we have a lot of news to cover this morning. And I want to get into that so we can have your questions. So let's get started.  So first, I'll start by sharing some color on the leadership transition we've announced this morning. Then we'll review our performance for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2021. And then finally Mark will provide more detail on our financial results and talk about our financial outlook for 2022. So as you have seen, in our announcement this morning, we've begun implementing a gradual leadership succession plan, under which Jim Davis, Executive Vice President of General Diagnostics will succeed me to become Chief Executive Officer on November 1, 2022. At that time, I will continue to serve on the Quest Board of Directors as Executive Chairman.  Quest Diagnostics is a great company that is well-positioned to continue to deliver shareholder value. As I approached a decade in the role, the Board and I determined that now is the right time to begin to turn over the helm to a new leader. Jim Davis is extremely well qualified to be CEO, having managed a large part of this company in his role as Executive Vice President. He has deep knowledge of Quest, the healthcare industry and the corporate world, gained through more than 35 years of business experience. Jim is widely respected and will be a strong CEO. When I took this role nearly 10 years ago, Quest was not growing, nor realizing its potential. We launched a new strategy, our new Quest to drive transformational change. To drive that change, we built a new leadership team, and Jim has been a key member of that team. We built a business strategy to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence. To drive growth, we focused on improving relationships with health plans, hospital health systems, and expanding fast growing businesses, and advanced diagnostics, and consumer testing.  In addition, we've added about 2% revenue growth on average through accretive, strategically aligned acquisitions over the last several years. We have driven operational excellence, and our Invigorate program has consistently improved quality and customer experience, while generating 3% productivity each year. And we've made more inclusive by increasing the diversity on our Board, and amongst our management ranks. Finally, we established Quest for Health Equity in 2020, over $100 million committed to reduce healthcare disparities among underserved in the United States, particularly communities of color. I am very proud of what we've accomplished together. And if you consider the opportunities in front of us, in many ways, we're just getting started.  We have a strong team and Jim as a key leader in our transformation. He runs our General Diagnostics business, which accounts for more than 80% of revenues and three quarters of our employees. He manages operations, including sales and marketing, patient services, logistics, laboratories, billing and customer services. He also oversees the Drive Operational Excellence strategy, which includes our Invigorate program. He has provided enterprise oversight for pandemic response. And if that wasn't enough, he's also lead the development of Quest ESG strategy.  So Jim, congratulations. I look forward to working very closely with you through this transition. James E. Davis : Hey, thanks Steve, and I really look forward to working closely with you over the next eight months, and ensuring a very successful transition. It's a tremendous honor to have the opportunity to succeed you in Quest and lead Quest into the next stage of our growth. We have a very powerful vision in Quest of empowering better health and diagnostic insights. Our business strategy is straightforward and well understood. And our company has never been more central to patients and to the health care system, as we've seen during this pandemic. I really look forward to working with the management team and all 50,000 employees to build on the strong foundation that Quest has put in place. Quest's future is really bright. And we're extremely well positioned to continue to create value for shareholders, and all that we serve. Steve Rusckowski : Thanks, Jim. Now at the same time Mark is planning to retire this year. Mark has been in his role for more than eight years, and helped navigate us to the strong position where it is today. We have begun a process in which I will be working closely with Jim to identify Quest's new CFO, and Mark will participate in the selection process. He will remain in the role through the transition. Mark, I want to thank you for your many contributions, your partnership and your friendship. You've been a key member of our leadership team and we have transformed Quest and accelerated its growth. Mark Guinan : Thanks, Dave. I appreciate the kind words. I just want to take a minute to say that I'm proud to be part of an important company that makes a positive contribution to the country, and I've enjoyed being part of it. Now it's time for me to step back and retire. I'm looking forward to participating in the process to identify my successor who can support Steve and Jim in Quest's next phase of growth. Steve Rusckowski : Now turning to our results, we closed out 2021 with another record year of revenue, earnings and cash from operations. Our base business recovered throughout the year, and we experienced strong demand for COVID-19 testing services. So for the full year 2021, total revenues grew by more than 14% to $10.8 billion. Earnings per share increased by nearly 49% on a reported basis to $15.55, and more than 27% on an adjusted basis to $14.24. Cash provided by operations increased by more than 11% to $2.2 billion. And for the fourth quarter, total revenues were $2.7 billion, a decrease of roughly 9% versus 2020 when COVID-19 volumes were surging. Earnings per share were $3.12 on a reported basis, and $3.33 on an adjusted basis, both down approximately 26% versus the prior year.  So I'd like to share some perspective on the role of COVID-19 testing going forward. A lot of progress has been made in the battle against COVID-19. But we believe it isn't going away anytime soon. Our molecular product began this year strong, with volumes peaking in January. Testing will continue to play an important part of managing COVID-19, and we believe that molecular testing remains the gold standard. We continued to perform well throughout the surge, maintaining average turnaround times of two days or less for COVID molecular testing. We will continue to maintain appropriate testing capacities and staffing levels to be prepared for any additional surges throughout this year if they emerge. We also continue to believe there will be a bigger role for serology testing, and how we measure COVID-19 protection going forward. Ultimately we expect COVID-19 testing to eventually more flu-like and become a permanent part of our portfolio going forward.  Now turning to our base business, we continue to make progress executing our two point strategy to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence, while we delivered 2% revenue growth on our base business from acquisitions again last year. In the fourth quarter, we acquired the assets of Labtech Diagnostics, a regional independent laboratory, serving physicians and patients primarily in South and North Carolina, Georgia and Florida. This is the first full service laboratory owned by Quest in South Carolina.  We also recently announced our acquisition of Pack Health, a patient engagement company that helps individuals adopt healthier behaviors to improve outcomes. This acquisition will bolster our extended care capabilities. Since 2012, we have completed more than 40 acquisitions, including outreach laboratories, regional independent laboratories and capability enhancing deals. And over the last four years, we've achieved our target of greater than the average of 2% revenue growth on our base business each year from acquisitions. And then finally, our M&A appetite  remains strong. In 2021, we took full advantage of our strong health plan access, which is approximately 90% of all commercial insurer advice in this country. We also made good progress working together with our plans to help companies and their employees save money by reducing denials and out of network leakage. Our clients also recognize the value of working with us and we have grown our health plan revenues faster than our overall revenues to the best level we've ever seen.  Hospital health system revenues have grown more than 20% compared to 2019 levels, excluding COVID-19 testing, driven largely by the strength of our professional laboratory services contract. Our performance in 2021 benefited from our two largest PLS contracts to-date, Hackensack Meridian Health and Memorial Hermann. Altogether our PLS business without COVID-19 exceeded a record $500 million in annual revenue last year. Hospitals continuously faced pressure throughout the pandemic. Post-pandemic we believe the same will be true.  We believe there will be a continued consolidation and ongoing challenges that afford Quest an opportunity to implement our flexible solutions that help hospitals become more effective and productive. Advanced diagnostics is critical to the future of healthcare. We're building strong momentum in our key growth drivers, which include consumer and hereditary genetics, oncology and pharma services. In 2021 these test categories accounted for several 100 million dollars of advanced diagnostics portfolio, and they are growing more than 25% versus 2020, and nearly 33% versus 2019.  We are investing aggressively in areas with potential for future differentiation to grow our advanced diagnostics value proposition, including automatic tests, next gen sequencing, bioinformatics, the sales force and customer service. We're leveraging our scale and expertise to give patients and fighters greater access to important innovations such as liquid biopsy, and digital pathology. Advanced diagnostics is one of the fastest growing areas of our portfolio. Our strategy and investments in this area will enable us to achieve high single digit revenue growth going forward.  Now we're equally excited about the opportunities we see in our direct-to-consumer test vertical. Revenues for QuestDirect services nearly doubled to more than $70 million in 2021, driven by both the base business growing and COVID-19 testing. We expect that non-COVID consumer diagnostic market will experience double digit growth over the next several years. And we're on track to build a $250 million direct-to-consumer business by 2025. We're ramping up our investments in to business, launching a new improved digital experience later this year. And we're also investing in enhancements to the in-person customer experience at our patient service centers.  So lots of good stuff in 2022. We're building on our long term relationships with Walmart by recently launching a consumer initiated laboratory testing on walmart.com, through our solution powered by QuestDirect. And the MyQuest platform now has nearly 23 million users, up more than 3 million in the past quarter. We are very excited about our longer term growth opportunities in advanced diagnostics and direct-to-consumer testing and our increasing investments we made in 2021 to strengthen our business and accelerate growth beyond the pandemic.  These investments were made possible with the record cash and earnings we generated over the past two years. We shared part of our two point strategy is to drive operational excellence. We remain laser focused on improving both operation quality and efficiency which go hand in hand. Through 2021 the Invigorate program exceeded our goal of 3% productivity improvement. We made good progress last year in procurement supply savings as well as reducing unplanned denials, and improving patient collections at the time of service.  While we faced modest inflationary wage pressure in 2021, on the supply cost side, we have more than offset any increases with cost savings from our suppliers. Historically, our Invigorate productivity savings have been net of any inflationary increases. Beyond that we continue to drive additional productivity improvements with platform consolidation and greater use of automation and artificial intelligence. Now turning to our sales force -- excuse me, now turning to our workforce. Quest employees are highly engaged, based on results of our quality surveys. In a challenging labor market, we are focused and are still seeing improvement and engagement in retention. Our team has done a lot to create an inspiring workplace. And we continue to do everything we can to attract, recruit and retain talent. We're entering 2022 in a strong position within the lab industry and more broadly throughout healthcare. Our base business is poised to build off the record revenues we've achieved last year and we're investing to accelerate growth. We expect to see continued demand for COVID-19 testing services, albeit at lower levels than the last two years. The delay of the 2022 PAMA cuts announced last year was a good outcome for industry and Medicare beneficiaries. However, we will continue to be hard at work in 2022, with our trade association and Members of Congress with the goal of arriving at a permanent fix to PAMA. We remain committed to our capital employment strategy of returning the majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders. This morning, we raised our dividend for the 11th time since 2011. We expect to have more than $1 billion in cash available this year for M&A and share repurchases. So putting it all together, our 2022 guidance reflects strong momentum and investment in our base business, balanced with the inevitable but expected decline in COVID-19 testing revenues.  Before turning over to Mark, I'd like to recognize and thank once again, all of our employees who really have been at the frontlines of the pandemic and continue to serve the healthcare needs of patients who depend on Quest every day. Now Mark will provide more detail on our performance and our 2022 guidance. Mark? Mark Guinan : Thanks Steve. In the fourth quarter consolidated revenues were $2.74 billion, down 8.6% versus the prior year. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services declined 8.5% compared to the prior year. The decline reflected low revenue from COVID-19 testing services versus the fourth quarter of 2020, partially offset by continued growth in our base testing revenue. Compared to 2019, our base DIS revenue grew approximately 6% in the fourth quarter, and was up more than 1% excluding acquisitions.  Volume measured by the number of requisitions increased 1.3% versus the prior year, with acquisitions contributing 1.1%. Compared to our fourth quarter 2019 baseline total base testing volumes increased by more than 10%. Excluding acquisitions, total base testing volumes grew approximately 5% versus 2019 and benefited from new PLS contracts that have ramped over the last year. The progress we've made in our base business throughout 2021 continued in the fourth quarter, and base testing volumes remained consistent with our prior outlook. As many of you know COVID-19 testing volumes moderated early in the fourth quarter, following the peak of the Delta wave in September, but then surged again in early December as the Omicron variant spread across the U.S. Together with our JV partners Sonora Quest, we resulted approximately 7.9 million molecular tests. Quest alone resulted roughly 7.3 million molecular tests and nearly 730,000 Serology tests in the fourth quarter. In January, our COVID-19 molecular volumes averaged approximately 120,000 tests per day, and over 139,000 per day, including Sonora Quest, with volumes peaking in the middle of the month.  Revenue per acquisition declined 9.8% versus the prior year, driven primarily by lower COVID-19 molecular volume. In the fourth quarter increases in our base revenue per acquisition were more than offset by the impact of recent PLS revenues. Modest unit price headwinds remained consistent with our expectations.  Reported operating income in the fourth quarter was $536 million, or 19.5% of revenues, compared to $795 million, or 26.5% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis operating income in Q4 was $579 million, or 21.1% of revenues, compared to $860 million or 28.6% of revenues last year. As you may recall, updated 2021 guidance we shared in October contemplated a lower adjusted operating margin both year-over-year and versus 3Q. The year-over-year decline was primarily driven by lower COVID-19 testing revenue and higher COVID-19 testing costs, headcount and wage increases and ramping strategic growth investments.  It's important to note that over time, a growing portion of our COVID-19 molecular testing volumes have come from non-traditional channels, which carry additional expenses and logistics cost. Also spiking COVID-19 positivity rates across the country in December eliminated our tooling capability, which further increased COVID-19 testing costs later in the quarter. In addition, we also experienced higher than anticipated employee healthcare costs in the fourth quarter, primarily related to COVID-19.  Reported EPS was $3.12 in the quarter, compared to $4.21 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $3.33, compared to $4.48 last year. Cash provided by operations was $2.23 billion in 2021, versus $2.01 billion in the prior year. We completed our $1.5 billion ASR in November, and repurchased that additional 310 million in stock in the fourth quarter. This brings total share repurchases to more than $2.2 billion in 2021. And we ended the year with $872 million on the balance sheet. Before turning to guidance, I'd like to comment on recent trends we've seen in our labor costs. As Steve noted, we've been managing through a challenging labor environment, while wage inflation including our annual merit increase is expected to be between 3% to 4% this year. The increase in our total salaries, wages and benefits is expected to be below 3% in 2022, given the reset of our annual performance compensation, and lower expected overtime. As a reminder, all of our employees are eligible for annual performance. Now turning to guidance. We are giving full year 2022 results as follows. Revenue is expected to be between $9 billion and $9.5 billion, a decline of approximately 12% to 17% versus the prior year. Base business revenues are expected to be between 8.3 and 8.5 billion, an increase of approximately 3.5% to 6%. COVID-19 testing revenues are expected to be between $700 million and $1 billion, a decline of approximately 64% to 75% reported EPS expected to be in a range of $7.63 and $8.33, and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $8.65 to $9.35.  Cash provided by operations is expected to be at least $1.6 billion and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million. Before concluding, I'll touch on some assumptions embedded in our 2022 guidance. As Steve said, we're entering 2022 in a strong position. Our guidance assumes COVID-19 molecular volumes to average between 65,000 to 80,000 tests per day in Q1, representing a decline from January wells, and approximately 20,000 to 35,000 tests per day for the full year.  For COVID-19 serology volumes the guidance assumes approximately 3,000 tests per day for the full year. Our guidance does not currently anticipate another COVID wave. We will remain ready from an operational standpoint to handle any future surges. Last month, the public health emergency was again extended another 90 days through April. We assume average reimbursement for COVID-19 molecular testing to hold relatively steady through this period. While the public health emergency could continue to get renewed beyond April, additional extensions are not captured in our guidance.  The revenues generated from COVID-19 testing have afforded us an opportunity to continue to increase investment in our business. As Steve noted earlier, we continued to ramp investment in our growth pillars, particularly the advanced diagnostics and direct-to-consumer testing opportunities. We are planning to invest approximately $160 million in our growth initiatives this year, which represents an additional $90 million in investments in 2022 versus 2021.  We also continue to incur hard costs to manage your business through the pandemic, including expenses to comply with CDC guidelines, address ongoing supply chain challenges and maintain adequate staffing levels. We currently forecast these expenses to be approximately $50 million in 2022.  As a reminder, we originally expected PAMA cuts of approximately $80 million in 2022. These cuts were delayed one year until 2023. Finally, we ended 2021 with approximately 124 million diluted shares outstanding. Our guidance assumes no change in our share count in 2022, and only enough share repurchases to offset our employee equity programs and to meet our commitment of the majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders.  I will now turn it back to Steve. Steve Rusckowski : Thanks Mark. Well, the Sunrise  had another record year providing critical COVID-19 testing for our country and delivered record revenues, earnings and cash from operations. We also grew our base businesses to a record level of 19% versus the prior year. Quest is well positioned in 2022 to deliver on its commitments. I'm proud of the incredible accomplishments of our 50,000 Quest employees throughout the pandemic. And finally, our team is strong, the business has never been better, and Quest's future is bright as we begin a gradual transition to new leadership. Thank you. Be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now open it up to questions at the request of the company. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question. If you have additional questions, we ask that you please fall back into the queue.  And the first question is coming from Jack Meehan, Nephron Research. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : Hey, Jack. Jack Meehan : Hey, good morning. First, I know this isn't the end. But congrats Steve and Mark on the retirement and Jim, congrats on earning the big feat. Agreed, it's very well deserved for you. James E. Davis : Thank you, Jack. Steve Rusckowski : Thanks Jack. Mark Guinan : Thanks Jack. Jack Meehan : So first question. There's been a lot of anxiety around pressures on the lab industry, which I personally find very interesting, because historically, that's actually been the bull case for Quest. So it would just be great to get your thoughts on what you're hearing from hospitals around outsourcing. Have you picked up any new contracts and potential for share gain versus some of these regional independent labs? Steve Rusckowski : Yeah, thanks, Jack, for the question. There is a lot of pressure in our industry, and particularly at hospitals. And so we are seeing continued interest and are working with hospital systems and helping them become more efficient and productive with their professional lab services business. That continues to be a big opportunity. You saw in our prepared remarks it grew nicely over the last couple of years. We have a half a billion dollar business, and therefore that moves, it moves our enterprise a significant level. So that's number one.  Number two, is we are very strong, and we continue to drive operational excellence. As you all know, this is not new, it's institutionalized in Quest. We believe we have the cadence and the capabilities to continue to offset any inflationary pressure we have. And we've done that. We did it last year, we'll continue to do that going forward. And as I said, in my introductory remarks, our array included Invigorate. We talked about inflationary pressures on our cost of sales. By the Invigorate savings is a net number. So any increases, offset by the saving always been positive for us and getting more savings than cost increases.  And so despite, some pressures that we see, because of the current times, we're offsetting that, and going forward, we do see that smaller laboratories will have a tougher time keeping up with some of these structures. And therefore, we do have an advantage. We saw the acquisition, we just did a flap jack in South Carolina; we are achieving that 2% growth from acquisitions. So therefore, we believe our strategy has positioned us nicely going forward to take advantage of the changes in front of us given this different times than we've ever seen. So Mark anything you'd like to add to that. Mark Guinan : Yeah, I think the other thing that's evolving jack that you didn't mention, I'm sure it's on your radar is moves towards transparency in pricing, whether it's surprise billing. Now, certainly is complicated. So even for us, it's not simple, would depend which commercial insurance, depends on who your carrier is and so on. So it's not simple to tell people exactly what their cost is. However, it's absolutely an advantage for the national labs , specifically for Quest. So we're encouraged by some of this. It's kind of one of those secrets that a lot of people aren't aware how much better our value is compared to others.  So we really see that together with some of the things you mentioned as another reason that we're going to continue to pick up share and really return to those historic rates we were having before the pandemic started, with greater access and the knowledge, tools and value that we bring well beyond our price, including our real time estimation tools, including our MyQuest app, and all the other things that really enhance the patient experience. Jack Meehan : Great, and as a follow up on the disclosures around the fourth quarter detection testing system, $7.9 million total, $7.3 resulted by Quest, $600,000, through the referral network. Can you talk about just the profitability on the tests that accrue to referral network versus those resulted by Quest? Because I think people just trying to figure out the relative margin upside versus revenue and wondering if maybe that was a factor we weren't considering. Steve Rusckowski : Yeah, so to be clear, except for referral network, we have a JV with Sonora Quest. So we wanted to make sure that people were aware that we're doing some math around referral on the testing volumes that we don't actually to record that revenue, because we have a minority ownership stake. So we get a proportionate share of the earnings from Sonora Quest, as we do with our other minority holdings, as we do with our majority holdings to equity earnings. So we just wanted to drive that transparency. But in terms of pricing, and so on, so forth, I won't comment specifically on Sonora Quest. But it's not dissimilar, it's not a totally different profit structure than the things that we do ourselves. In Jack, during this less than 5% of our total volume is sent out to a referral lab. At this point in time, its effect on zero. So it's only during a surge, that we have to rely on external partner labs to help us. Yes, what I did refer to Jack, and maybe that's what you were asking about was non-traditional channels. And so that's not where we're sending the work. It's actually how we're getting the specimens. So a lot of the work especially early was through traditional channels, or hospital partners, where we were going anyways, to collect specimens, and we would leverage all the Quest Logistics, in cases where we had people going to our ACE trauma centers, we're leveraging that.  In this case, we're actually getting it from other providers, CVS is the most notable one. As we do that, we have to have an incremental logistics structure with that incremental logistic runs. Then we do pay a fee. You kind of think about it kind of like phlebotomy, but all the work they do to collect the specimen, to engage the administrative costs of the patient to give them the results, and so there is a cost that maybe people weren't aware of when we're not getting that specimen to our traditional infrastructure. Jack Meehan : Great. Thanks for clearing that up. Steve Rusckowski : Operator, next question? Operator : The next question is coming from Ann Hynes, Mizuho Securities. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : Good morning, Ann. Ann Hynes : Good morning. Congratulations to Steve, Mark, and Jim. James E. Davis : Thank you. Ann Hynes : I just want to ask about margins, because obviously, the stock's down or underperforming, year to date versus some peers. And I think there's debate on the street about the margin profile for Quest ex-COVID. I know you guy's saw lot of pressure in q4, it was at worse than expected. And a follow up to that is, again you just got to 2022. People are really focused on what your margin profile will be in 2023. In your prepared remarks, Mark, you did talk about growth initiatives that are in 2020 to $160 million, and I think you said $50 million for incremental costs.  But I guess like, there's so many moving parts with extra labor costs, extra supply cost, you have these growth investments. I guess with -- if we look out to 2023, not giving guidance, like what do you think is repeatable and what is not? Maybe you can just comment on just the health of how you view your base margins, and the base business, that'd be great. Steve Rusckowski : Yeah, so thanks for the question, Ann. It's important one. So first off, we're not deviating from our long term outlook. So we've shared a long term outlook in March of 2021. And while the CAGRs are going to change, because we're going to have a stronger year in 2022, and the carriers I quoted that that time, were putting 2022 forward, the absolute numbers we're not deviating from because they're largely the base fitness. So we still assume that COVID will materially decline, you know, time will tell. At that point, it's really all-round our base business.  So when people are looking at the current profitability of the base business, and I can understand how this happens. One of the flaws of that is that there really -- you can't really do the two in isolation. So let me give some examples. Because we've had such a surprisingly strong year, this year relative to what we expected, driven by COVID, we're paying a significantly higher incentive performance bonus. And that's across the whole employee base. And, right now, that would not be expected to be repeated next year.  So that, quote, inflated our costs. And so to assign all of that cost against the base business, which is what implicitly it's done, when you do COVID revenue times a certain margin drop through, and then you assume back against the base business, that is not accurate. The other thing is, we have significant incremental costs related to the pandemic, which I mentioned in the prepared remarks, around $50 million of cost. If COVID really goes away, we would expect those costs will largely go away. And those costs are really be assigned to COVID, not to the base business.  We had quite a bit of overtime later in the year. And that was related to employee absences driven by the COVID surge, and we spent about $25 million more in 2021, then we historically spend in over time. And we would expect that would go away, as well, as COVID starts to step back. And so again, that that s implicitly put against the big business, when you do the high level math that I've seen a lot of people do. And so the way to think about the base business is obviously from our guidance, we are hundreds of millions of dollars above where we were in 2019.  We expect to be back to the growth that we were experiencing pre-pandemic. I know, it seems like a long time. But if you look at the first two months, and we mentioned this several times of 2020, before the pandemic started, even after a full year of the network access teams we have in 2019, we're still growing mid-single digits. We're going to get back to that growth, okay, in the base business. And the profitability of the base business is going to be similar to what it was before 2019.  So hopefully, that puts all the pieces together for you. Obviously, there's anything I can clarify, I'd be happy to take a follow up. Ann Hynes : No, that's very helpful. And just as a follow up, just to your growth initiatives, like the $9 million incremental in 2022. How should we view that for 2023? Steve Rusckowski : Right, so some of those will ramp down, because there are discrete investments to get us where we need to get to. So for instance, a big piece of that is building what we need for our consumer is fantastic. And to move from where we were to a more Amazon like, not that we'll get completely there, but experience for patients who want to find tests and order it, pay their bill, et cetera is expensive. It takes a lot of work with marketing analytics to do the appropriate marketing and understanding of customer preferences, and respond to customers in appropriate way. A lot of IT investment in the near term to get us to that future state.  Now as we're growing that business to a $0.25 billion, which is what we said we would get to by 2025, there are going to be some ongoing costs, because we're adding people to support that business. It isn't a grown up business. And there are going to be some variable costs with that. However, as we grow those businesses, we're going to grow fast. And so some of those ongoing costs are going to get paid for that faster growth. And then I would say similarly, advanced diagnostics, as we accelerate that growth, some of the resources we're adding today that we're calling out pre that growth are going to be in the run rate and profitability going forward.  So the costs don't go away completely, but they will ramp down because some of this is kind of startup expenses. And then that revenue, obviously in the end, the margin is going to pay for those incremental costs over the next several years. Only it's after that . Remember, when we talked about this year, these investments really started in the back half of 2020. And we talked about an exceptional year in 2020. We talked about an exceptional year in 2021. And therefore we took advantage of the opportunity invested in accelerated growth entirely consistent with what we share with you as our growth portfolio portfolio. And what you're seeing in our results, our ranges, the benefits of those investments, you're seeing great growth in our focus areas of advanced diagnostics. I highlighted those areas of our portfolio that we focus on.  And these are not insignificant portions of our portfolio. I share my  several 100 millions of dollars of focus for us that are growing strong double digits versus last year versus 2019. And then secondly, is our consumer initiative testing business has grown considerably. We talked about $70 billion, almost half to 250 . And so therefore, we're already starting to see the benefits. So as with any of that we certainly expect a business return. We're getting some evidences of return already. '21 looks like more of it than '22. And so when we get into '23, you got to track that.  They were not served in the beginning. What we're putting on right time is exactly what we laid out on Investor Day. That is, we have a baseline coming out of '22 that we believe in, and what we just shared in our '22 guidance is entirely consistent with that. And we will continue to grow our earnings. The high growth, we highlighted 7% to 9%, and that will continue through '23 and '24. So we feel what we've done so far, and what we delivered is entirely consistent with what we believe the prospects of -- we do believe the opportunity in front of us are even more attractive than before, because we found the proceeds, was relative to accelerate the program was real. Mark Guinan : Yeah, just one point of clarification. So the 7% to 9% was when we thought we could do $7.40 $8 in 2022. And we said we'd be at the upper end of that. So you can pick your number between $7.40 and $8, carry forward $7 to $8, through '23 and '24. And that dollar level of EPS is what we're saying we can still do. Obviously, since 2022, is turning out based on our guidance, a lot higher than we said in March, the CAGR is going to be lower. But the absolute numbers we're still committed to at this point. Steve Rusckowski : Operator, we're going to go to the next question. I just want to let everyone know, we won't go past the bottom of the hour. We have a lot of folks in queue. We want to get to all your questions. Operator? Operator : And the next question is going to be from A.J. Rice of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : Hey, A.J. Mark Guinan : Good morning, A.J. A.J. Rice: Hello, everybody. Best wishes on the transition to all. And maybe just to ask M&A pipeline. A, any update on what you're seeing out there, what the opportunity set looks like? B, does the management transition cause you in any way to pull back or to pivot in a different direction in organic growth prospects? And then just maybe finally on the Pack Health deal? That was obviously not a huge deal, but an interesting one. Does that suggest a pivot, and what's sort of the opportunity there with that acquisition? Steve Rusckowski : A.J., thanks. We continue to believe that we can continue to deliver that 2% growth off our base business going forward. We've delivered that in the past, and we have every reason to believe that we will continue going forward. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to see hospitals looking at what we've done with other hospitals, and opportunity for them to rely on us as the testing and that product continues to build. And we continue to look at some outreach purchases with hospitals.  And then, as I mentioned, Labtech was a good example of a regional laboratory and a good piece of the United States that we picked up as well. And we continue to look at acquisitions that build on our portfolio. Remember, we have this lens of focusing on general diagnostics. Jim Davis, runs that business, in addition to that advanced diagnostics. But the third pieces are those services that take the information that we generate, and we provide services, and we do this employer population health. And we built on that business to work with health plans, on helping them manage the risk with the data and providing services that help them do that.  So Pack Health fits into that direction for the company. And we've done some other acquisitions that help us with that direction as well. And you're going to hear more about -- we will continue to invest in that space going forward. And also in your question, does the management change slow us down in any way and here what we might do an acquisition, I would say to the contrary, you know, Jim's been part of the management team for over eight years. He's highly engaged in all acquisitions. He's been instrumental in executing all of our acquisitions. And all the businesses that he participated in are always part of the funnel building that we have.  So Jim any remarks about the 40 acquisitions we've done, and your team to find more opportunities. James E. Davis : No, A.J., as Steve said, I've been part of all 40 of those acquisitions. And it's not going to slow down. We're not going to do -- we're going to do smart deals. We're going to be selective, but we're going to continue to build our base business. We're going to continue to find niche applications to build out our events diagnostics portfolio, and we're going to continue to focus on hospital outreach deals, those that are willing to get out of business. We're right there ready to help out. A.J. Rice: Okay, great. Thanks so much. Steve Rusckowski : Hey, A.J. Operator : The next question is coming from Patrick Donnelly of Citi. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : Hey, Patrick. Patrick Donnelly : Hey. Two questions. Maybe just one on some recent payer negotiations. Obviously, you guys have talked a lot about inflationary pressures and supply chain things. How much does that come up in kind of the negotiations with payers? Are you able to pass that along? I know you guys are in a pretty good place, with payers relative to historic levels. So maybe just talk through some of those conversations and ability to pass price along and price increases in those payer contracts. Steve Rusckowski : Yeah. Thanks Patrick. Well, so there's a lot of attention these days on inflationary pressures. And we think we've handled those questions. We think it's all very manageable for us, in terms of our operational excellence programs, and finding the productivity, we need to offset it. So that's one piece of the equation. The other piece is what you're bringing up, is around pricing. And we feel good about what we delivered in that regard. Matter of fact, if you look at the results for '21, what you find is that their unit price changes, and this is freezing everything from volume in meds, and just looking at unit price changes is below that 100 basis points that we typically are guiding you to dial into expectations going forward. And that's not just for our commercial insurance contract. It's all our businesses, our hospital business, it's our client business, independent of what whose clients might be, physicians or some other organization we work with.  So we continue to make progress on that. And we're particularly encouraged by the discussions we're having with our plans. We've shared in the past that actually, in the past, several negotiations, we've actually introduced price increases. And it is actually helping us that in fact, there is inflationary pressure across all of healthcare. So therefore, we're not alone, since we're a labor based business to pass along some of those costs to them.  So we're making good progress. And I say that the other piece of this, Patrick is, we continue to deliver great value. Our quality gets better, our service gets better. And we do that in a very competitive price already. And many of these plans believe that's in the best interest of them and their membership of growing share, is to make sure they rely on a handful of top flight laboratories, in the case of United Healthcare, they call that for labs network. And we had applied to that. And we had to demonstrate with evidence that, in fact, we have great quality. We have great service, and we're doing at very competitive prices.  So that trend will continue. When you talk about that, we're going to eventually keep on pushing us to deliver more and more value, which helps you in terms of managing your network. We, in many cases are going to start looking at some price increases going forward. So good progress there. Thanks for asking the question. Mark, anything you want to add? Mark Guinan : Yeah, I just want to remind people of what we talked about, over our tenure. We have this Invigorate program, drives about 3% productivity. We call it productivity, because some of it is top line enhancing. It's not all around costs. And we've mentioned the fact that we have these pay fors . And one of them has been priced stretched. One of them has been annual labor inflation. And then we talked about the fact that as we got priced in a better place that actually was helping with margin expansion.  So we have enough productivity to do more than the pay fors. So now we look at where we are today, and as Steve mentioned, a much better position. I can't specifically say it's related to inflation. But I can assure you that that is part of the conversation in addition to PAMA, and the value that we bring in, so and so. We've really moved the conversation dramatically from when we started here, to more about value. And fortunately for us, I can share that in the last three national payer contracts, all three of them, we got an increase. That was modest. But you compare that to where we've been historically, great news.  And that also means that even if we have a little more inflation, and I think we talked about this quite a bit, we've got plenty of Invigorate. And that Invigorate now, doesn't need to cover as much of the price erosion that we have historically. And that price erosion that Steve shared is really heavily in the clientele. And as we've talked over the last number of earnings calls that comes from the hospital clients who are under tremendous pressure, and we shared the reasons for that. And also in some states where physicians can do clientele markup, we have that pressure as well.  And really with the commercial payers, we're in a really good place on prices lately. Patrick Donnelly : That's really helpful. I appreciate it. And then just a quick follow up on COVID. Maybe pricing and volume, you mentioned no expectation for the PHE to continue to be extended in the second half or at least is not baked in, sorry. How do you think about the pricing piece both commercial? Will they follow -- kind of wait for the PHE? And then the volume side, you are expecting it to be endemic. A lot of the diagnostic players have obviously talked about multiple years of COVID revenues going out. Just curious on your take there. Thank you. Steve Rusckowski : Yeah. So what we're assuming in our values is getting some ranges of what we think COVID testing will be. Obviously, it's going to start higher in the first quarter, it's going to go down, as we're hopeful that this current surge will decline throughout the spring and into the summer. And as you mentioned, we did get the 90 day extension. And then we're not planning in the guidance that that will be extended, but we just don't know. So therefore, we're always assuming the worst case. And that if that were to come down, yes, we do believe there will be some price changes, if you will, with some of our partners.  But again, what we've implied in the guidance is kind of volumes and some decline in pricing. And also the assumption that we're not going to get a renewal of the emergency order. But again, we don't know that. So Mark anything you'd like to add? Mark Guinan : Yeah, just to remind you -- not that I need to remind you all that, the rates that CMS determined at $51. And so while we don't assume post PHE that everything falls immediately there, there's a pretty steep ramp down. And then so for the volume that is in our guidance beyond the PHE in late April, we're assuming a significantly lower reimbursement than we've experienced to-date and that we're expecting to get till late April. Steve Rusckowski : Next question? Operator : The next question is coming from Ricky Goldwasser, Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Ricky Goldwasser : Good morning, and best wishes to all of you. Jim you are going to be my fourth Quest CEO I'll be working with. So very excited. James E. Davis : Thank you. Ricky Goldwasser : Dating all the way back to Ken Freeman's days. So I just wanted to go back to sort of what the 2022 baseline is. Since this has got like really the bulk of the questions we're getting from investors sort of how should we think about the 2022 normalized baselines that we can build off for 2023? I know that you kind of said in response to one of the questions that in terms of absolute EPS, you are where you expected to be last year. But if maybe you can give us the range, right? We're getting to somewhere between kind of like $7.60 to $7.80 is a normalized based on for $4.2 as a starting point. Just wanted to kind of like see if we're in the ballpark. And then off that maybe just qualitatively what are the headwinds and tailwinds that we should think about as we think about modeling out to 2023. Steve Rusckowski : Go ahead Mark. Mark Guinan : Yeah, so. I'm sure you understand Ricky, even if I was willing, I can't really give you an EPS number on the face. So I think the best thing I could do is, point you to pre-pandemic, revenue and earnings and tell you that if you look at the growth in the base business based on what we're giving in guidance, the profitability is not dissimilar. So you can kind of directionally place where that business might be. And the reason I can't really give is back to what I talked about earlier.  So where do I assign the $50 million of pandemic expense? Arguably, if we didn't have COVID testing, we would still have that cost. And you'd say, okay, let's go about your base business. But the truth is that we also have the COVID testing in revenue. So again COVID revenue is going to go into the base business. And then importantly, when you talk about headwinds and tailwinds, we would expect that cost to go away and should be temporary, because it is specifically tied to CDC guidelines and other things.  We talked about some of the others, you know, some things including there, like supply disruptions. I don't know how long that's going to last. And we all know, it's not just in our business. It's across all aspects of life today, and it's modeled to go away in 12 months, not sure. That's certainly something we want to absolutely make sure that we have what we need. And so we are paying premium costs right now, relative to what we did pre pandemics in insurance, get to our patient service centers, our laboratories have everything they need. And that's really kind of our insurance, which fortunately, we can afford to do right now. Because we also do have that COVID revenue and COVID margin.  So really, I think that's the best color I could give you which is the base business is in good shape. We activate Q4 organically back to where we were in 2019. We've done significant M&A over the last couple of years, we've built the PLS business. So beyond the organic clinical business, we're hundreds of millions of dollars higher. And while the profitability and all that may not be precisely the same directionally people could feel confident that the profitability has moved at least to that growth . Steve Rusckowski : So to remind you, our base business in '21 was larger than what we had in 2019. So it has grown. So it has recovered. And we're going to grow on top of that. And that's implied in our guidance for base business. And we intentionally broke out basis from COVID assumptions for '22. So you can kind of dissect who or what's going on with that business. And I keep on reminding you of investments that we're making are part of our base business. And we started those investments in '21. They continue in '22, and therefore, that's going to help us accelerate growth.  And as Mark said, we feel very confident about the profitability of our base systems. And by the way, when I said in my introductory remarks, is we do not believe COVID is going to entirely go away. It's going to be part -- a permanent part of our portfolio. So you should assume there's some COVID testing in '23 as well. We will continue to still play a role with our PCR testing. And we believe there's a growing role for serology particularly related to our ability to be able to provide some insight around the protection that individuals have in their bodies. And we're going to have more on that to come.  But you put it together is -- and we believe the prospects for '23 and beyond are quite bright. So thank you. James E. Davis : Ricky, I would add one other thing. And that's as probably Mark stated at the pace business has recovered in 2019 levels are still not going to interject in terms of a headwind. There's still pent up demand for routine clinical care. If you look at the studies around HIV infection rates, hepatitis C infection rates, the data still indicates that there was a lack of routine clinical care during the pandemic. And we do think that should provide some headwinds going into the later part of this year and next year. Steve Rusckowski : Operator, next question. Operator : And the next question is coming from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. Your line is open. Brian Tanquilut : Hey, good morning, guys. And congratulations all around. I guess I'll follow up to that last answer that you gave. Yeah. So as we think about COVID becoming more endemic, rather than what it is today, is it probably more correct to think of this opportunity or this part of your business as something like say, the flu -- the flu test where some of it's -- or most of its point of care, and then a big -- a small chunk of it sent over to you guys? And then how should we be thinking about the economics if that was the case? Steve Rusckowski : Yeah. Well, let me start, and then my colleagues will round it out, I'm sure. So this isn't going away anytime soon. I think obviously, that we're going to have COVID in '23. And we're going to provide testing around that. And as you know, because you're living with it everyday, like the rest of us, when somebody has some symptoms, you're ruling out COVID. In many cases, that is a PCR test, and that will continue. So therefore, you don't think about just being flu, but it's any type of respiratory illness, and it could be a common cold or another respiratory illness. So there'll be continuation of that, going forward.  And also, we keep on highlighting the value of serology. There is going to be increased role for us to provide insight on how much protection people have from vaccines or from natural immunity. And as we know, that's changing over time. And people want to have that insight to, manage the risk and work with their physician on that. So we think there, there's going to be increased value in that. So we do believe, in '23, this is going to be a permanent part of our portfolio.  It's hard right now to scale that and we'll learn more as we get into '22. But when we think about it, we actually think of this as an additional portion of a product line that we didn't have before the pandemic. So we actually decided that it was helpful to, achieve the value we think we have. And then as Jim said, base business continues to be in really strong shape. We crossed the growth of '19 sooner in '21, we're entering '22 in . Our growth prospects, there continue to be ones that we continue to work. So that should continue to be a good opportunity for ourselves. So we're filling our chips together well, and COVID is going to products provide more fuel for us to make these investments in our base business that help us and 23. So we Yes, we're focused on what the costs are, but we only make these investments if in fact, we expect to get the returns and you'll see those returns, both in '22. But also in '23 and beyond. So Mark anything you'd like to that? Mark Guinan : Yeah, thanks. Brian, it's a great question. And we can't predict with any certainty what's going to happen. I think the two unknowns are, how comfortable will physicians be with taking the specimen sample themselves in the office going forward? And maybe they'll be very comfortable like that with the flu where maybe they'll be like, no, I'd rather I'd rather not handle that. I'd rather not do that point of care test and all the risks that come with that. I'll just send it to a lab. But then the other one, really importantly, the economics. So the payers are going to have a lot of influence on whether this is done.  Now yes, point of care testing, arguably, some people do it for faster turnaround times. But a lot of it is done because they make money off of it. So depending on what the payers decide around point of care reimbursement that will have a large influence on how much of this work comes to us and how much that of it stays in the office. Then let me just stop and ask Jim to comment on this. Steve Rusckowski : If you look at our volumes are impressive. We've had a challenge this year, because of the infection rate, and therefore our ability not to be able to fail to deliver on cooling , which is more capacity and lower costs. But that will come back with infection rate, which dropped. But as we go forward with this, we start to see this becoming more of an epidemic and less of a pandemic, then there's a lot of players in this marketplace, and Jim and his team are entirely focused on what we have for sure today, and what we could do going forward to gain some share going forward.  So when you think about the opportunity around COVID, if you look at that market, you think about Quest Diagnostics, you think about the dynamics of the short run, where there's been some opportunistic players. We're not optimistic. This is going to be part of a permanent part of our portfolio. And therefore we also are pushing hard, and making sure that we get what we believe what you have to share in the short term. But also in the long term, we think there might be an opportunity as well to pick up some share. Jim, you'd like to add to that. James E. Davis : Yeah, what we did find during this last surge is we had a series of 10 default partners that we've referred work out to, when we couldn't handle the volume, especially during peak days during the work. And at least 50% of those partners had gotten out of business and decided they just didn't want to rebrand for capacity. So while there may be the physical capacity out there, some of that physical capacity, especially on the PCR side has returned to the clinical kinds of work that those firms were doing, other molecular work.  So that is, I think advantages us in the future, if there is another surge here. Steve Rusckowski : Operator, next question. Operator : And the next question is coming from Pito Chickering of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Pito Chickering : Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Steve and Mark it's been a pleasure working with you over the years. And congrats to you, Jim, on this promotion. A lot of questions thrown around the space business. So let me ask this a different way. I believe you general guide from an $8.50 EPS range for 2023 was from limited COVID earnings. Can you talk about EBIT margins in 2023 versus the 17% range seen in 2019 without COVID? So I believe are within that guidance range are implying essentially flat margins, with Invigorate offsetting inflationary pressures? Is that just the right takeaway, that we should be leaving today's call with? Mark Guinan : Yeah, so we intentionally don't really target or comment on margins, because we believe value creation can come at different levels of margin. Then we talked about specifically on PLS, where it's great growth, great return on invested capital. And those are the two biggest correlators to shareholder value creation. But they come at a lower margin. So we don't worry about margin Pito per se, but I understand others do. And so to answer your question, there's a pretty broad range, you know, obviously, one year less than over multiple years when you put a CAGR with a couple 100 basis points differential on the top line and bottom line.  So there's a lot of different combinations. So what I would say is, your EPS number that you mentioned, is not unreasonable. And you can figure out the revenue based on what we said, at Investor Day, and then what we're guiding to this year in terms of the base business, and yeah, at this point, we're not counting on COVID to be significantly larger than maybe a flu business or something like that. But certainly, we don't know. And there's a chance that it could be larger than that. And that will be determined over the next 12 months or so.  So that's about strongest color I can give you right now, is back to what we said. If you're really good about our base business going forward, we're going to adapt to that growth level. And I want to remind everybody that when we grow organically, the drop down is much higher than that 17% or, the 19.5% that we delivered in Q4, and so on. It drops down at a level, you know, 50% or more depending if it's an existing customer, where we're expanding the menu, or it's a new customer, where we do have to invest a little maybe in logistics and in IT for the interfaces.  But growth brings with it margin expansion, in addition to Invigorate. That's why we're confident we can grow earnings faster than top line, from that period forward. Pito Chickering : Okay, so just if I ask the question just a different way, not on the margin side. Let me -- I just sort of think about 2023 EBIT versus 2019 sort of a cleaner non-COVID numbers, we should be modeling to sort of a low teens EBIT, increase in '23 relative to 2019. Steve Rusckowski : Yeah, I mean, you can -- yeah, I mean, you can do the math. Yes. I mean\u2026 Mark Guinan :  about earnings per share. Steve Rusckowski : Okay, good. So what we -- Mark just said what we said is, we've always provided our outlook and guidance for our mix  per share, because we do have a mix of business, we do have some lower margin business, that might be a good value creating opportunity for us, we're going to go after it like a PLS business. So our guidance for EPS would be expansion of EPS over time, rebasing it, if you will, for these changes that we've seen for the last two years. And Mark has reiterated our belief that our base business will fuel good opportunities for us to continue to deliver against that.  By the way, as we continue to gain share, variable gross margin is quite good. And as I said, we also believe there's going to be some COVID in '23. And it's hard to size it right now, but it's not going to go away soon. Mark Guinan : Yeah. And then the other thing is that, I'm not in any position to provide guidance in 2023. So that's why we're focusing every one of the things there. However, when you think about what can happen, COVID can be larger. We don't know, we're not counting at this point. And then we did mention we've got a -- we expect a billion dollars of cash this year. So between opportunity to quite a bit of M&A, and we'll see, or do share repurchases, those also aren't specifically contemplated.  So that's why like locking down to a specific number is really difficult and probably not productive. So I would point you to what we said at investor day, and kind of assuming that that's reasonable if these things don't play out significantly differently from our current view of what 2043 might bring. Pito Chickering : Great, thanks so much guys. Steve Rusckowski : Operator, next question. Operator : And the next question is coming from Matt Larew of William Blair. Your line is open. Matt Larew : Hi, good morning. The 3% Invigorate target has been aided in recent years as you've consolidated volume onto your two new labs and consolidated into one amino acid platform. I'm curious, what are the keys going forward here to keep driving those gains? And then maybe the second piece on cost would be separate from some of the extra costs you've called out today related to COVID, clearly, you've built up some infrastructure, both personnel and instrumentation for COVID.  I'm just curious how much of that you think goes away as COVID moves to an endemic perhaps you need less extra capacity? Steve Rusckowski : Great, thanks for the question. I'll weigh in and turn to Jim to add to the answer. We've been working on operational excellence for over a decade, and it has become institutionalized in our company culture, and embedded in how we do things. And it is, is a platform for how we're going to continue to grow. So your comment was around costs. We don't talk about cost, we talked about productivity, because there's a lot of aspects of what we do around Invigorate and some actually helps the top line, some actually helps getting more output with less labor. And yes, some helps us to become more efficient by less input from some of the materials that we use.  So we looked at an aggregate, and we continue to be bullish on our prospects. We believe that it is the ingredients for us to continue to deliver great value. That is when we do this we improve our quality, or service gets better. And oh, by the way, we become more and more productive to be able to make investments to fuel the growth. So it all fits together. And when we talk about this, and we talked about at Investor Day. We see an enormous opportunity for us to continue to digitize and innovate in operational excellence. And so some of you have had the opportunity to tour through our latest lab of the future and that's our new facilities -- facility in Clifton, New Jersey. Sometimes if you come in, you'll see what we've done and take some of the learnings out of our Marlborough facility up in the Boston area. We brought that down to Clifton and we built on it. And that also gives us advantages of some consolidation with some of our new platforms. But Jim and the team are now taking that, and thinking about okay, what's next?  Okay, so we think about innovation in our space, yes, there's innovation in terms of testing, and as far as diagnostic information services. But we equally think there's a lot of innovation and opportunity for us to move forward. So we continue to invest. And we talk about investments, we talk about the use of cash. As you notice, we've been putting about $40 million a year into our capital budget, which is investments and frankly, a lot of our innovation that allow us to fuel this productivity game. So Jim? James E. Davis : Yeah, I think Steve has touched on three key themes, automation, use of artificial intelligence, and the continued digitization of so many products. So Marlborough and Clifton are terrific examples of that. But as you know, they're all brand new laboratories. We've got 20 plus other laboratories in our network. And there's opportunities in every one of those laboratories without building new Greenfield sites to continue that automation journey. In particular, in our processing area, and what we call our fluid handling system, handling of blood and urine.  On the artificial intelligence side, you're going to see us move in pathology, psychology, microbiology, we've got some great examples of each of those departments today. We're deploying artificial intelligence systems that help with the readout of those images. And then Steve mentioned just the continued digitization. Now beyond the immunoassay platform where we consolidated around the , there are still other opportunities like that in our laboratories. We recently ran a competition in your analysis, so likely to new vendors is next for that platform. And are rolling out those two platforms across all 23 Plus laboratories, it's going to generate a lot of productivity year over year. So as long as we have healthy third party vendors that continue to innovate, those innovations will come to our labs. And we'll continue along that 3% productivity journey. Steve Rusckowski : So we're bullish on the prospects of continuing to drive productivity. I always react to this as a cost cutting goal. And this is not all about cost cutting goal. This is about working smarter. And this has been a key part of our strategy. And it fuels growth. And Jim mentioned some of the areas. I picture my internship  also digital pathology, which revolutionized our ability to diagnose and treat and to do that more productively. And this week, Jim is going up another laboratory to take a look at where we're going to make our next investment this year.  So we're going to invest in the space. And we have a lot more opportunity in front of us. So it's exciting. James E. Davis : Yeah, I just want to add that, remember, this is not just in the lab. So there's a lot of productivity that's driven outside. And specifically, I'll give two examples, logistics. So we really have an incredible ability to be efficient with logistics, and continue to improve. So we have some cases where we have empty pickups, where we have some customers that don't give us specimens all the time. It's periodic. Now we have the ability and technology to not do that empty pickup. So that's an efficiency. We also get requests for what we call staff pickups, where somebody needs something quick turnaround, et cetera. And so the ability to most efficiently get one of our vehicles there has been enhanced through our technology.  The other one is in our patient draw centers. We really can increasingly move the administrative burdens off the phlebotomist, allow them to do phlebotomy by getting people to go to our website, put in their insurance information, everything. And so the phlebotomist spends a couple less minutes with each patient doing administrative doing phlebotomy. We drive up the productivity in our draw centers.  So those are just a couple examples of productivity gains that aren't really cost reductions, but enhance our ability to do more with the same resources and drive up our quality and everything else outside the laboratory. Steve Rusckowski : Operator next question please. Operator : The next question is coming from Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, guys, this is Kapian  for Tycho. Congratulations to all. Can you maybe talk towards the percentage of COVID testing that was consumer initiated you know whether it's through MyQuest direct or other non-traditional avenues and how do you see that trending in 2022? You mentioned that there are different costs associated with non-traditional avenues of testing. So maybe can you quantify the difference margin profiles between traditional and non-traditional? Steve Rusckowski : Yeah, so what I can share is, go back to what we said in the prepared remarks, our consumer business was about $70 million last year, between the base and COVID, we did $2.7 million of COVID revenue. So the consumer initiated COVID testing was very small, at this point, and, it's strengthening. And again, as I said, we continue to enhance our website, when people go for that ordering, and testing and so on. But there's still more to come in terms of enhancing that experience for consumers and driving awareness for people. As you know, we're competing with a lot of people who see these stand up operations in parking lots, and so on and so forth, which draw their attention.  So we're working on making sure that they know we can do this and initiate themselves as opposed to going to a doctor or hospital for this. And we expect to get stronger and stronger moving forward as we enhance our overall consumer business through these investments we just mentioned. In terms of the margin profile, it's really not -- it's not all that different between the consumer and consumer can add in different ways. They can come to our patient draw center and have it done there. We do have home collection kits where they can be sent to their home. So a little different structure, but not materially different in profitability.  Operator next question. Operator : And the next question is coming from Derrick Brown with Bank of America. Your line is open. Derik de Bruin : Hey, great, thank you for squeezing me in. I'll just make this quick. Can we talk a little bit about, sort of like the real -- PAMA outlook? So you would assume $80 million that again comes back in '23? I mean what are the chances that this actually does get resolved, and that the lobbying efforts pay off and gives the current administration a little bit more or Congress a little bit more willingness to listen to this, and sort of do it? I mean, there's a chance that it gets -- that there's actually some reversion, just given what happened. Thanks. Mark Guinan : Yeah. Before Steve addresses that I just want to remind everybody that that $80 million was built into our long term outlook. We just assumed it would happen this year. So again, although it would be a year on year get to us, you know, incrementally in comparison, in the long term outlets, it was assumed that we would get that in 2022. So it's already built that. Steve Rusckowski : So thanks for the question. And as we said, we were thankful that it was delayed, again, the one year offset, as Mark indicated to 23. We think that's good for us, because it will gave us some time this year, to keep on working on a permanent fix with Congress. And we have been very active working with Congress last year. And as you know, Congress was very busy with the Infrastructure Bill, and other business and therefore we're fortunate enough to get in the postponed it, but it allows us time this year to keep on working on this to get a permanent fix.  We're encouraged by the level of support, brought up the importance of testing and the importance of having a strong industry. We're getting strong, bipartisan support, both from the House and from the Senate. We made a proposal of what we think should be changed to improve the data collection process, the sampling of market based data. We continue to support the notion and the philosophy of PAMA that is we should be paid a commercial rate. But we believe that CMS has it wrong .  And in parallel with the Congress, we continue to have our lawsuit against CMS and the trade association. The judge has heard the arguments we'll see if we get some indication on a decision on that. Hard to call that, but that's still in the works as well. So our work right now this year is to push for permanent fix to PAMA. And we're better positioned now because the pandemic than before the pandemic because of the strength of this industry here in global awareness and appreciation of what we've done and the need for strong laboratory industry going forward. Steve Rusckowski : Operator last question please. Operator : And our last question is coming from Eric Caldwell of Baird. Your line is open. Eric Coldwell : Hey, good morning. Thank you. Masterful job clearing up some of the overriding concerns on core markets today. So thank you. When you went through your list of things that don't repeat or go down significantly as COVID incremental cost overtime staffing challenges, et cetera go away. You mentioned bonuses. And I think it was the one number in the list of call outs that I didn't hear you quantify. I'm curious if we could get the incremental bonus, due to the COVID, upside profitability in '21. How you think that bonus will normalize, whether it's '22 or '23?  And then my follow-up, I'll just stow it in here. I was hoping we could get average way to reimbursement in the fourth quarter. I know you said it would be relatively similar through the PHE. But if you could give us a little more specificity on where AWR came out, in 4Q on COVID PCR testing, that would be helpful. Thanks. Steve Rusckowski : Sure, so let me start with that one. Because I think there was some questions around maybe with their turnaround time suffered, and we didn't get the $25 fee that comes with some of the government payers couple the current pairs. And actually, not really, AWR in Q4 was absolutely similar to what has been in the previous quarters. And our turnaround time performance was outstanding. We did in January when the surge came, we did a little bit, we did have a little bit of a hit to our turnaround time. But obviously, that's all contemplated in the guidance that we just provided and it wasn't a huge amount.  When you -- back to the early question, bonuses, and the bonuses, when we look at the bonuses, you know, most of it is really our 50,000 employees. So people think about bonuses, must be senior management. Most of the cost is really, we pay 3% bonus to even our wage workers. And then obviously, we have other staff members that you know, at higher targets. And every year we budget for what we call, one x whatever that target is. So for most of the people do 3%. And based on performance, and we feel we've had reasonable stretch performances, when we had historically, we have not paid significantly above 1x. And we've had a number of years where it's below 1x.  But the COVID, unpredictability and the surge in revenues, enabled us to pay our employees significant bonuses, in 2020. And again, in 2021. And so if you look at, without getting too specific, and we've shared a number in the past, a $3 billion wage bill, that's gone up in the last couple of years as we've grown the company. So you can kind of as a floor, say 3%, obviously a little higher, because if people want a higher bonus, that's about 1x. And then, we're paying a bonus that's substantially higher than that, in 2021, like we did in 2020.  The other thing is, we did pay out a $500 payment to the majority of our employees to compensate them for COVID expenses. In 2020, we adjusted it out of our adjusted earnings, because we were seeing COVID as temporal and extraordinary. But once you get to your second time doing it, even though I still think it's extraordinary, we just decided not to adjust it out. So we did have over a $20 million payment, late in the year, $500 to our wage employee and some of our lower compensated professionals as well. So those are a couple of things that would go away and not be repeated like somehow, we had another surprising COVID year in 2022 like we had in 2021 Eric Coldwell : That's a great response. I'm not sure I'm smart enough to do 1x 3% plus and insignificant increases there. Any chance you could frame that as incremental $50 million, incremental $100 million just directionally can we get a little closer? Steve Rusckowski : Yeah, let's say it's less than $100 million, but substantially more than $50 million. Eric Coldwell : Okay, that's about what I thought. Okay. Thank you very much, guys. Congrats to everyone. Steve Rusckowski : Thank you. Very good. Well, thanks, it's been a great session with you all. Thanks for all the great questions. And again, thanks for joining the call today and we appreciate your support. You guys have a great day.

Risks and uncertainties, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K. 01:08 The company continues to believe that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on future operating results, cash flows and/or its financial condition will be primarily driven by the pandemic severity and duration, health care insurer, governments and clients payer reimbursement rates for COVID-19 molecular tests, the pandemic's impact on the U.S. health care system and the U.S. economy, and the timing, scope and effectiveness of federal, state and local governmental responses to the pandemic, including the impact of vaccination efforts, which are drivers beyond the company's knowledge and control. 01:40 For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS, and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS. Any references to base business, testing, revenues or volumes refer to the performance of our business, excluding COVID-19 testing. Growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections, including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth, and adjusted earnings growth, are compound annual growth rates. Finally, revenue growth rates from acquisitions will be measured against our base business. 02:14 Now, here is Steve Rusckowski. Steve Rusckowski : 02:18 Thanks, Shawn and thanks everyone for joining us today. Well, we\u2019re off to a good start in 2022. We drove a strong year-over-year growth in our base business, which excludes COVID-19 testing. COVID-19 volumes remain strong early in the quarter and decreased in February and March, in line with the market. 02:42 We continue to make investments to further accelerate growth in the base business, and our efforts to improve productivity are helping us to offset inflationary pressures. So, based on the strength of our business we\u2019re raising our 2022 guidance. This morning, I\u2019ll discuss our performance for the first quarter of 2022 and then Mark will provide more detail on the financial results and talk about our updated financial outlook for 2022. 03:12 But first, I like to ask Jim Davis to give us an update on our leadership transition. Jim? Jim Davis : 03:19 Yeah, thank you Steve. We are making very good progress on the transition. Yesterday, we announced a series of organizational changes and leadership appointments of seasoned executive designed to help us accelerated growth and drive operational excellence. First category is a Senior Vice President of the regional businesses. Kathy has deep knowledge of our business gained through three decades of leadership at Quest. She will oversee the regional and enterprise operations, the commercial organization and marketing. She will also be responsible for driving operational excellence, including   for company's quality and productivity initiatives. 04:01 Next, Carrie Eglinton Manner is taking on an expanded role as Senior Vice President, , Advanced and General Diagnostics Clinical Solutions. For more than five years, Carrie has been responsible for bringing innovative solutions to the market through Quest clinical franchises. Before joining Quest, Carrie had nearly two decades of leadership experience in healthcare and medical technologies. 04:25 Patrick Plewman, who has led our West region and has been with Quest Diagnostics for more than nine years is named Senior Vice President, Diagnostics Services, which is a portfolio of data driven analytics and services businesses, which enabled employers, providers, pharma companies, and others to deliver healthcare more effectively and efficiently. This portfolio includes employer population health, employer solutions, ExamOne, Healthcare Analytics Solutions, and Quest HealthConnect. And before joining Quest, Patrick had over 20 years of leadership experience in the biotech and molecular diagnostics industries. 05:09 Mark Delaney has joined Quest as Senior Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer. Mark has responsibility for the commercial team, including sales and sales operations. Previously, he helped senior sales and marketing leadership roles over his 30 year career at GE Healthcare and Hillrom. 05:29 And finally, Richard Adams has joined Quest as Vice President and General Manager of our Consumer Initiated Testing Business, a new role. Richard has two decades of varied leadership experience in e-commerce, digital marketing, and customer experience, and will lead our rapidly growing direct-to-consumer testing business. These appointments demonstrate the investment strength of our management team and we're really excited about the leadership and expertise that both Mark and Richard Adams will bring to us. 06:00 Additionally, we're making very good progress on our CFO selection process and are on track to name a leader in the next several months. The management transition is going very well and the changes we've announced yesterday are an important step in positioning us for the future. 06:16 Steve, I'll now turn it back to you. Steve Rusckowski : 06:18 Thanks, gentlemen. I agree the transition is going well. Now, turning to our results, our base business continued its strong recovery up more than 6% from the prior year. Total revenues were $2.6 billion; earnings per share was $2.92 on a reported basis, and $3.22 on an adjusted basis. Cash provided by operations was $480 million. 06:50 COVID-19 testing revenues were approximately $600 million in the first quarter and that\u2019s down approximately 28% from 2021. Nearly 60% of the COVID-19 revenues came from the Omicron peak in January. We project  demand for PCR testing through the end of the year and into 2023, albeit at lower levels. 07:16 The public health emergency was extended into July, maintaining our current level of reimbursement. And based on these factors, we raised our COVID-19 revenue guidance for the full-year of 2022 to between $850 million to $1 billion. 07:36 Turning to our base business, in the first quarter, we continue to make progress executing our two-point strategy to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence. So, here are some highlights from the quarter. We continue to make in-roads with our health plans, gaining share and increasing revenues faster than the market. 07:58 Our health plan revenues without COVID-19 grew faster that our overall base business did in the quarter. We also deepened relationships with payers through value based contracting. We currently had about 30% of our health plan revenues are tied to value based elements. And these included patient health outcomes, quality or shared savings. 08:23 We think we could grow this about 50% over the next few years. And we believe these value based contracts are achieving better alignment with health plans, which we believe will allow us to gain shares. 08:37 We're also working with our hospital health system leaders to help them execute their last strategy. A lot of partnerships of Hackensack Meridian Health in New Jersey, Memorial Hermann in Texas, and those which really helped that work in  are performing well. 08:58 Hospitals look to us for their help with through laboratory design, staffing and management and we can enable them to monetize outreach lab assets that help them free-up needed capital. We have continued to make important investments to strengthen our advanced diagnostics capabilities and are already seeing results. 09:21 We continue to make investments to accelerate growth in oncology, hematology, hereditary genetics, genomic sequencing services, and power services. Since we\u2019ve ramped up our investments, and our advanced diagnostics portfolio, we have already accelerated growth by several 100 basis points and expect to deliver the 8% growth earlier than 2024, which we committed to at our 2021 Investor Day. 09:54 We remain excited about the opportunities we see in the direct-to-consumer testing market. As you know, we're ramping up investments in our consumer business and it\u2019s having an impact. 10:06 In the quarter, our direct-to-consumer revenues more of than doubled compared to the prior year, driven by strong growth in both our COVID-19 testing operations as well as our base business testing. We\u2019re seeing continuous solid demand for  comprehensive metabolic panels and complete blood counts. Also our new and approved digital experience is on track to launch later this year. 10:33 Finally, we've been expanding our diagnostics services portfolio. We are collaborating with a small digital  software firm to deliver diabetic retinal imaging services through designated Quest Diagnostic patient service centers across the United States. This will aid in the screening of patients as part of the diabetes management program. 10:58 The second part of our strategies is to drive operational excellence. We remain focused on improving our operational quality, service and costs thereby driving productivity gains. We are not immune to the current inflationary environment, but we're tightly managing our operations and are expecting another good year of the bigger rate savings and productivity improvements to help offset these pressures. 11:26 So, by way of our example, our procurement team continues to work with our strategic suppliers to mitigate potential price increases and improved productivities through our long-term relationships. Also today, the team has effectively managed challenges in our global supply chain. 11:46 We also look to our suppliers to deliver innovation to help us a lower overall cost of testing and improved quality. The most recent example is the rollout of our new   that is being deployed across our laboratory network. 12:04 Our new lab in Clifton, New Jersey has been operational for about a year and we are seeing incremental productivity gains from the investment we\u2019ve made in automation and artificial intelligence. 12:16 Our new   initiative encourages patients to make appointments allowing us to better manage demand and  productivity while enhancing the patient experience. The system has been successfully deployed to over 700 patient service centers. Our continued invested in operations is producing results. And we are well on our way to achieving our targeted productivity gains of 3% of our cost structure in 2022. 12:50 Now, Mark will provide more details on our performance and share more insights and our updated guidance for the remainder of 2022. Mark? Mark Guinan : 12:59 Thanks, Steve. In first quarter, consolidated revenues were 2.61 billion, down 4% versus the prior year. Base business revenues grew 6.3% to more than 2 billion, while COVID-19 testing revenues declined 27.6% to approximately 600 million. Revenues for Diagnostic information services declined 3.9% compared to the prior year. The decline reflected lower revenue from COVID-19 testing services versus the first quarter of 2021, partially offset by strong growth in our base testing revenue. 13:39 Total volume measured by the number of requisitions increased 1.3% versus the prior year and was roughly flat under an organic basis. Total base testing volumes increased more than 6% versus the prior year. Excluding acquisitions, total base testing volumes grew nearly 5%. We experienced some modest softening of base testing volumes in January during the peak of the Omicron surge. The volume has rebounded in February and March. 14:11 COVID-19 testing volumes surged during the spread of Omicron variant during the winter and volumes peaked in January, but declined through the month of February and into March. Together with our JV partners in our Quest, we resulted approximately 7.2 million molecular tests. 14:30 Quest  resulted roughly 6.3 million molecular test, down approximately 2 million tests and 1 million tests versus the prior year in fourth quarter respectively. We also resulted nearly 450,000 serology tests in the first quarter. Our COVID-19 molecular volumes have generally stabilized and the average of roughly 30,000 tests per day over the last four weeks, excluding similar request. 14:59 Revenue per acquisition declined 5.2% versus the prior year, driven primarily by lower COVID-19 molecular volume. Base business revenue per rep was up modestly. Importantly, we continue to see an improving price environment. Unit price reimbursement pressure was less than 100 basis points in the quarter. 15:21 Reported operating income in the first quarter was 513 million or 19.7% of revenues compared to 660 million or 24.3% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was 554 million or 21.2% of revenues, compared to 708 million or 26% of revenues last year. The year-over-year decline in adjusted operating income was primarily related to lower COVID-19 testing volumes, a higher portion of COVID-19 molecular testing volume from non-traditional channels, which carry additional expenses or logistics costs, investments to accelerate growth in our base business and lower average reimbursements for COVID-19 molecular tests. These   were partially offset by strong growth in our base business. 16:16 As many of you have heard, the health resources and services administration or HRSA, stopped accepting claims to pass and treat uninsured patients on March 22, due to insufficient funding.  runs the program to provide funding for COVID-19 testing vaccination and treatment for uninsured patients. Approximately 14% of our COVID-19 molecular testing volume has come from uninsured patients, which is much higher than the 1% to 2% we typically see in our base business. 16:50 As a result, we were unable to build HRSA to over 20 million in COVID-19 testing work that was performed just prior to the March 23 HRSA cut-off date. Moving forward, we are now dealing uninsured patients for COVID-19 testing directly upfront. As a result, we've seen a decline in our uninsured COVID-19 molecular testing volumes in late March and into April, and this is reflected in trends I shared earlier. 17:19 Reported EPS was $2.92 in the quarter, compared to $3.46 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $3.22, compared to $3.76 last year. Cash provided by operations was $480 million in Q1 versus $731 million in the prior year period. And we repurchased 350 million of stock during the first quarter. 17:47 Now, turning to our updated guidance. Revenues are now expected to be between 9.2 billion and 9.5 billion, a decline of approximately 12% to 15% versus the prior year. Base business revenues are expected to be between 8.35 billion and 8.5 billion, an increase of approximately 4% to 6%. 18:10 COVID-19 testing revenues are expected to be between 850 million and 1 billion, a decline of approximately 64% to 69%. Reported EPS is expected to be in a range of $7.88 and $8.38, and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $9 and $9.50. Cash provided by operations is expected to be at least 1.6 billion and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 400 million. 18:43 Before concluding, I'll touch on some assumptions embedded in our updated 2022 guidance, as well as some additional considerations. Our guidance assumes COVID-19 molecular volumes to average approximately 10,000 to 20,000 tests per day for the rest of the year. This reflects modest continued declines in Q2 from the roughly 30,000 tests per day we are seeing in April. And some degree of stabilization during the second half of the year. 19:12 As we look toward 2023, our expectation for COVID-19 molecular and serology testing volumes assumes that the COVID-19 testing run rates in the second half of 2022 continues into next year. 19:27 Last week, the public health emergency was again extended another 90 days through mid-July. We assume average reimbursements of COVID-19 molecular testing to hold relatively steady through this period, while the public health emergency  renewed beyond July, additional extensions are not captured in our guidance. 19:47 We remain prepared for additional future surges collecting COVID-19 testing volume from a range of customers. While the PHE is in effect, we continue to incur incremental costs from non-traditional channels for supplies, special logistics  and channel expenses for this volume, which can represent roughly $30 in incremental cost per test. Therefore, you should not assume the higher reimbursement due to the PHE extension drops right to the bottom line. 20:16 As Steve noted earlier, we're already seeing some returns in our investments to accelerate growth, particularly in the areas of advanced diagnostics and direct-to-consumer testing. And would expect a margin tailwind on these investments in 2023. 20:33 As a reminder, we are planning to spend approximately 160 million on these investments this year. We spent approximately 30 million in the first quarter and are looking for these investments to ramp up in Q2 to support the launch of our new consumer site later this year. A portion of these stand-up IP costs are temporary, but variable marketing costs will increase   launch of the new site. 20:58 We\u2019ll also be adding additional headcount this year to support our consumer offering, as well as bioinformatics capabilities within advanced diagnostics. 21:08 Finally, we know there's a lot focus on expectations for 2023. While it\u2019s clearly too early to provide specific guidance for next year based on everything we know and see today, we expect to deliver topline and earnings consistent with our long-term outlook that we provided at our 2021 Investor Day. I\u2019ll now turn it back to Steve. Steve Rusckowski : 21:30 Thanks Mark. Well to summarize, we're off to a good start in 2022 driving strong year-over-year growth in the base business. We continue to make important investments to accelerate growth and we are seeing the results. Now based on the strength of our base business, we've raised our outlook for the remainder of the year. Now, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : 21:54 Thank you.  Our first question comes from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Ricky Goldwasser : 22:12 Good morning. So, a really nice job in the quarter managing cost and improving margins. So, how has the performance in Q1 compared to your expectations? And how should we think about the margin expansion opportunity for the rest of the year from 1Q level? If we look at that as a baseline? Mark Guinan : 22:33 Yes. Ricky thanks for the question. As you look at the way the quarter played out, Omicron was more severe than we had anticipated, which drove higher COVID revenues, but we also saw the base business impacted by that. So, definitely in January as we mentioned the base business was softer, so relative to our expectations in Q1 more COVID, less base business, but as we exited the quarter and certainly as we talked about in February and March the base business bounced back to our expectations. 23:08 So, while we're very pleased with where we see the base business, growth for the year, it would have been even higher had it not been for Omicron. And the margin is really were what we were expecting. So, we walked through in the last call how some of the margin impacts in Q4 was really temporary around annual incentive plan and some costs related to some special things that we needed to do for COVID testing in that quarter, some over time that we're having in fair amount of  and some things that we really saw as temporary. 23:44 Look  is that once we got the Omicron, those costs, generally did go away and we anticipate further reduction in some of the special expenses related to COVID safety and protection for employees that we continue to advance hopefully and get into the endemic and end of the pandemic. So, I'd say other than the higher COVID revenue and a little lower base in January, generally the  is expected, and that's why we're comfortable raising the bottom and upper end of our guidance at the midpoint. Steve Rusckowski : 24:15 Just like to reiterate what Mark said about the base business, just underscore that we're pleased with what we saw in Q1. It would have been better, if it didn't have the softness that Mark talked about in January. We remind everyone that we posted about 6.3% growth in our base business, which had only about 100-days\u2019 worth of acquisitions. 24:38 So the organic growth was around five. And again, if January was stronger, it would have been stronger than that. So, we feel good about that to be the start of the year, which gives us confidence for the full-year. So feel bit about the start of the year for our base business. And that gave us the confidence to raise guidance for the full-year beyond COVID. Mark Guinan : 24:56 One additional comment on that. When you look at the compares, the easiest compare on the basis was Q1. So, to Steve's point, we've credited that even better. We would have done it better than the 6.3 of January not been impacted by Omicron, but as we go through the balance of the year, it compares to get a little tougher because lot the recovery from other pandemic, occurred late in 2020 and early in 2021. So, the growth going forward is more going to be driven by share and less about utilization and the market recovery. Ricky Goldwasser : 25:35 So, can I just quickly follow-up on that? You talked about the improvement in   with more difficult comps. So, how is demand shaping up in April to date? Mark Guinan : 25:47 Yes. So, the business continues to perform at a high level as it was happening in Q1. So, it wouldn't be updated in our guidance if we weren't confident that what we saw in terms of the performance early is continued. So, we\u2019re more focused on overall growth as opposed to the percentage year-over-year because obviously the compare makes it complicated. So, we're very happy as we get into April and we see the performance of our base business. And as we mentioned, COVID is kind of stabilized. We're not sure how long that will continue. We certainly took a little bit of a volume hit from the change in HRSA. 26:25 And because there's been a little bit of a spike I'd say some of that was partially offset by the market growing a little bit recently. So that's probably the way you get to a reasonably flat level of COVID testing over the last month. Ricky Goldwasser : 26:44 Thank you. Operator : 26:47 Our next question comes from Patrick Donnelly from Citi. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : 26:51 Good morning, Patrick. Patrick Donnelly : 26:53 Hey, good morning. Thank you guys for taking the questions. Maybe just another one on the margins. You touched on a little bit there in the first question. Can you just talk about, I guess given the ongoing growth investments, wage inflation, can you just talk about, kind of your thoughts as we work our way through this year and into 2023. Obviously, the PHE extension should help on that front in terms of kind of the margin side. So, again, I guess, when we look at the earnings raise, how should we think about the base margin piece again ex-ASP as we work our way through this year and again into 2023? Steve Rusckowski : 27:24 Yeah. So, as Mark indicated in his prepared remarks, changing dynamics that are business with investments in the second quarter and then less COVID in the back half of the year and what we indicated we will be coming out of the year in the back half with \u2013 the amount of COVID testing we would expect, there's a good level to think about in 2023. 27:49 And so what we also expect is to continue to get the investment returns that we expect in advanced diagnostics and in consumer testing, starting in the back half, and again, what Mark said in his prepared remarks, and we believe that investment return will be a tailwind for us in 2023. So, this is a transitional year with those investments. Transitional year for COVID, and Mark you like to give a little perspective on Q2 and then the back half? Mark Guinan : 28:22 Yes. And I\u2019ll try to answer your questions Patrick. So, on inflation, we talked about building in an extra 100 basis points or so in our wages costs. And that was in our original guidance. And through 3.5 months of the year we haven't seen anything that suggests that wasn't a reasonable assumption. So, basically, inflation was about where we\u2019re expecting. And I'd say, our non-wage items, such as materials and supplies and so on, surely fuel costs have been bouncing around, but nothing has deviated significantly from our critical assumptions coming into the year around inflation. 29:03 The PHE is significant revenue and from a dollar margin perspective, it certainly is helpful, but from a percentage margin and perspective, I want to be clear that it's not significantly higher than the post PHE world because those costs go away that reference, that are more than $30. So, the people are focused on percentage margins, the base is not a big change in terms of what you will see. 29:03 And I guess the important thing is that as the base volume grows, we've always shared that incremental organic growth in the base business as a very high level of drop through. So, the other margin consideration as we grow as we expected and as we've signaled in our guidance, that that will help drive margin expansion. And then finally, just a reminder that we are in a much better place in price than we've been historically. And so, therefore, a lot of the  productivity savings that in the past help pay for inflation,  inflation is a little bit worse. Certainly the pricing environment is better. So, there's more of that to cover that inflation and also to drive bottom line margin expansion. Steve Rusckowski : 30:16 So remember too as you think about, as we transition for the year, and Ricky asked about April. We have higher level testing in April going on. We do periodically update you on that. And that number we expect in our guidance to come down. And as we indicated as we come out of 2022, we'll be running around 10,000 to 15,000 tests per day. And we're assuming that the PHE will expire because we didn\u2019t know nothing beyond what we've heard so far, which will add sometime in July. 30:51 So, as you think about that transition, and then think about the investments we're making and thinking about the nice momentum we're building in the base business it gives you some perspective of how we're going to come through the three remaining quarters of this year, and then guide us to a reasonable place to be able to deliver what Mark indicated for 2023. Patrick Donnelly : 31:15 Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just on the balance sheet, cash flow obviously has been pretty strong for the past few quarters here, capital allocation is in focus for investors, can you just talk about your priorities there? What the M&A pipeline looks like, what the funnel looks like? And then maybe compare that to kind of the share repo opportunities? Mark Guinan : 31:35 Sure. So, our capital priorities haven't changed. We have that commitment return majority of free cash flow as we shared, you know normal times we get pretty close with the dividend and we do some share repurchases to offset dilution, obviously with the COVID  cash generation, and we've had the inability to deploy more cash. We always preferred to do M&A because we've got very high standards around the deals that we executed. So, would always be the preference, but at given point in time, given our strong cash from the balance sheet and our ability to generate cash, we're not going to sit on it. 32:13 So, the 350 million in the first quarter is more of a reflection of how much cash we had at year-end and the fact that we didn\u2019t do a transaction in Q1 as opposed any change in priority. So, Steve, would you want to comment on the pipeline? Steve Rusckowski : 32:29 Yes. Yes. So, we feel good about again, our commitment of 2% growth through acquisitions. As you know, we've delivered that consistently. We feel good about our ability to \u2013 on a routine basis to deliver the consolidation strategy we've been executing against. We've got a few step we are working on and we still feel that we will be able to get to a number close to that 2% in 2022. So, as I have said in the first quarter, we're lighter than that. This is lumpy, but we do expect that we'll be moving on a few in the second quarter and into the third quarter to deliver what we expect. Patrick Donnelly : 33:09 Great. Thank you. Shawn Bevec : 33:10 Operator, next question. Operator : 33:11 Our next question comes from A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : 33:16 Good morning, A.J. A.J. Rice: 33:19 Hi, everybody. Obviously, the value based arrangements are becoming more significant as you described in your prepared remarks. I wondered if we could get you to step back and talk about a few of the key features of these arrangements and discuss how they allow Quest to do better economically? It sounds like you think you can do better economically under these types of arrangements. And I know you referred to pricing being better. We used to always think a managed care pricing is being a 1% to 2% negative headwind each year, has that dynamic changed and is it mainly because of these value based arrangements? Steve Rusckowski : 33:56 Yes. So, let me start and then I'll ask Mark and Jim to kind of add to this. As we have said in our strategy here and health plan access change there is a big opportunity for us, number one. Number two is, we do plan that gaining share. And number three, we are gaining shares. So, our health plan revenues are growing faster than overall revenues and we believe growing faster in the markets. So, we're making progress. So, in that regard, the second question is the environment has gotten better. 34:29 We've indicated in prior calls and prior quarters, and it's proven to be true as we go throughout this year. As we get into renegotiations with the plans, we believe we have stronger position to negotiate and in some cases, modest prices because we're delivering more and more value. Our quality is improving, service performance is better, and we have an opportunity to help them narrow the network and narrow the number of providers they have with the number of these programs. 34:59 So, it has gotten better and we indicated that less than 100 basis points overall. I'll remind you that when we talk about price, there's a lot of focus around the plans, but we have price pressures in the hospital business and our client build business, but at least on the health plan side, it has gotten better and we have gotten modest increases for some of the contract renewals that we've had. 35:21 In terms of value-based contracting, the biggest opportunity we have, which you indicated in the past is around United. And United is a very different relationship for us and what we had years ago. It is clearly a relationship that we're working different aspects to be able to pick up share. And as part of that, now it's indicated in my remarks, we do have shared savings opportunities and we have opportunities together to do a better job with their membership than their clients. And then beyond United, we have extended that thinking to other parts of our health plant portfolio with other concepts, they\u2019re not all identical. But they have similar characteristics in general where we have better alignment between what they're trying to accomplish and what we're trying to accomplish. 36:13 In the end, we\u2019re all trying to achieve what's been described as the  , which is better quality, better experience, at lower cost, and that's resonating very well in the marketplace. Overall, as you know, this is an entirely focused organizations on that  plan for the greater delivery systems as well. So, Mark you like to add something to\u2026 Jim Davis : 36:37 Yes. So, A.J., personally we think about value based care and arrangements. This is not necessarily being . So, this is being indicated with both United Healthcare  many of these value based care incentives come to us through performance on leakage agreements where they provide us list of physicians that are using how to connect for   and what we move that for, there's a value base, there's an incentive for Quest. 37:07 We proactively work with both payers on moving work out of extensive health system laboratories. If selective  list of physicians that are using that those labs and we go after it. Finally, we worked hand in hand with both of those plans and others on approaching employers and getting employers to see the benefits of steering their employees to the independent labs like Quest Diagnostics. 37:34 When we do enter into these capitated arrangements, I can assure you going forward, we're going to have a much greater stake in what we call the clinical pathways that are used by physicians to ensure that utilization makes sense for the clinical condition that the physician diagnosed. Mark Guinan : 37:55 Yeah. The only thing I'll add, A.J. is, there\u2019s elements in those contracts, that Jim just described. The one I'll add is also  we've talked about in the past, when we do an acquisition of hospital outreach, and instead of the rates immediately dropping to our rates, there's a step down a majority of our large contracts right now. So, we kind to share the value of movement network through an acquisitions, which aligned our incentives and really the greatest value is, is it moves the conversation around away from price being the way they create value and more towards  which Jim talked about and partnering and working together to get connections of work to  better price, but also there's things that come with it that benefit the patients, the physicians, it's our tools and our technology, it's our quality. 38:50 I mean, you know that in the  , it's not about the price, it's really about a couple of the metrics around quality and tools and I mean what is their experience in the patient drop center to how we feed the data to the payer and the frequency in quality. So, there\u2019s a lot beyond price that determines  space and that's where we've been successful in moving the conversation. 39:16 And yes, then within the contracts themselves, there will be shared savings and these other value driven parameters that can get us a better price or more value as we demonstrate to them where we\u2019re creating value for them as well. A.J. Rice: 39:31 Alright, great. Thanks a lot. Operator : 39:34 Our question comes from Pito Chickering from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : 39:39 Good morning, Pito. Pito Chickering : 39:40 Very good morning, guys.   my questions. Back to the guidance question, previously, it didn't assume any share repo besides offsetting dilution, what does your current guidance assume? Back into net income guidance, you know from the previous guidance using 124 million diluted shares in fourth quarter, versus the current guidance at 121 million shares backing into the midpoint range and net income, essentially flat despite revenues up $200 million or at the low-end. So, it\u2019s got us into a margin compression of about 10 basis points. So, a long way of saying, is margin guidance down today versus previous guidance and any ? Mark Guinan : 40:21 Yes. At this point, the share repurchases is definitely done pretty much offset our equity programs. So, it's not there's a huge decline in waste so based on what we've done. And in terms of going forward, it'd be dependent on M&A opportunities versus buybacks. So, there's no material change in our way so contemplated in our guidance so it is to what we gave back to . Steve Rusckowski : 40:52 And as you see in our results,   Q1 with about $700 million worth of cash. And obviously, we're going to put that to use to a good way. We're looking at acquisitions as we talked about. And we'll handle that in due course throughout the remainder of the year. Pito Chickering : 41:17 I think just as you drill into that, you know backing into previous guidance as your current guidance with the share counts you had before versus current share counts, I get to net income of about $1.1 billion for both the current Quest, the current guidance versus previous guidance, despite revenues going up, is that the right math? Does that would imply margin impression about 10 basis points? Mark Guinan : 41:38 Yes. So, I would not want to take away an implication of margin compression Pito. And remember that we don't do point estimates. We do ranges. So, there's a lot of moving parts, everything from topline mix, clinical mix, exactly, precisely, how much COVID testing we get going forward. And share obviously deployment of cash. 42:04 So that's why we give a range. So, we feel very good about the margins. We would expect that the margins would improve on the base business going forward. Certainly, the COVID elements and everything from the PHE to the volume we have could impact margins as well. 42:21 I\u2019ll give you one example if you're looking at income margin, certainly some of the JVs where specifically some of our Quest where they have done a lot of COVID testing, we have no revenue, but we get their earnings contribution from that. So, there's a lot of things that they kind of skew margins, but I think what people really want to understand is the base business. 42:41 So, what\u2019s going to happen going into 2023? We're very comfortable with the base business, we\u2019ll be at or above pre-pandemic levels and we'll have a larger base business in 2023 with some level of COVID testing and in the margin performance that you saw in Q1, we're not expecting it to erode, even despite the factor, we did talk about raising up some of our CIT investments in Q2. So, it's also been contemplated, it\u2019s all in that range of guidance and so it\u2019s kind of hard to pin down specific margin at this point, but it's not bad news. Pito Chickering : 43:16 Great. Thanks so much. Operator : 43:19 Our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo from UBS. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : 43:25 Good morning, Kevin. Kevin Caliendo : 43:28 Good morning. Want to follow-up on the guidance question just a little bit, so you'd beat in the quarter by roughly $0.25 and you raised your COVID revenues by 150 or so, which depending on what margin you use could almost equate to that same sort of $0.25, was the guidance range, was the guidance range raise related to the first quarter beat? Was it related to the COVID increases there an overlap there? How should we think about that? Mark Guinan : 43:58 So, the guidance range was related to the totality of the business. And again, if you look at Q1 as we shared, the base business was  extremely well. Didn\u2019t do as well as we expected when we entered the year because of Omicron. 44:15 So, some of the raise in COVID for the year and the performance in Q1 was really offsetting a slightly softer base business. Now, the good news is that the base business came back. So that softness in the base business was temporary. The other dynamic is that, we do have the PHE being extended and we also have this change in HRSA, which is not insignificant. So, we mentioned there was over $20 million of loss opportunity that will get paid for the uninsured from more than we did in late March. 44:49 So, there's a lot of moving pieces here, and so it's really hard to parse precisely what is driving the rate, it's really our greater confidence in the business performance for the year in totality with all of those pieces. And so again, well a lot people focus as they rightly understood on the midpoint, I'd say just in general business is in better shape and in total than we would have expected 90 days ago and that's why we're comfortable raising both the topline in the bottom line. Steve Rusckowski : 45:20 Yes. As we enter the year, what we indicated for COVID is around 700 to 1 billion and obviously we're delivering 600 million in the first quarter. We have more certainty around what is left within that initial guidance. 45:37 Obviously going into the year, there's a lot of uncertainty of what would happen now,  how fast would decline, and how each testing would go on in the back half of the first quarter. So, the timing up of the range, the asset range is hit by this, as Mark indicated there\u2019s puts and takes of this in terms of the impact on our bottom line. But I'll just reiterate, we feel good about our start with our based business and we're tracking well for a strong year based on our initial guidance. Kevin Caliendo : 46:11 Okay. Just a quick follow-up on the 160 million in investments. You said part of it would be temporary, part of it would be permanent. I think one of the things we're all trying to figure out here is, sort of what the base margins look like in a non-COVID or a COVID would  flat year-over-year or whatever, which seems like we're moving into, what the base margins normalize would look like? So, if we think about how much might linger, any help on that? And maybe the question would be, what do you think base margins look like in 2023 or exiting when COVID becomes endemic versus where they were in 2019? Like, is it possible that those base margins are higher going forward? That you guys have figured out a way to be more productive ? Steve Rusckowski : 47:02 Remember, we're vesting $160 million, we\u2019re vesting   sixty million because we have a strong business piece to get the returns. So, what we had indicated, we are ahead of our plan to get the returns in advanced diagnostics and we feel bullish about the opportunities of the consumer. And the results on both of those fronts have been good news. And so, when we talk about the second part that you mentioned of putting in place a new platform, also where a consumer business we're investing in some marketing to get the growth we expect, and we are getting the results so far and we'll continue to see the results in the back half of the year. 47:43 What we also said is that as we come out of 2022 into 2023, when you think about a year-on-year compare, with the returns we expect from Advanced Diagnostics and the returns we expect from the consumer, that a year-on-year improvement in those businesses will be tailwinds for our margins in 2023. 48:10 So, again, we're investing to grow, we're investing to get a return. We feel good about getting those returns actually quicker than expected, and next year, the year-on-year compare related to that 160 million will be a net tailwind for us in terms of our earnings in 2023. Mark anything you like to add? Mark Guinan : 48:31 Yes. So, just a reminder that we shared a view that we could  business to   by 2025. And remember, especially if you strip out the COVID testing revenue this was a business that was small millions, not that long ago. So, very significant growth projected in this business and we\u2019re still very comfortable and confident. We just talked about the performance in this past quarter and we don't have our new customer experience IT capability that we think is really going to make a difference in terms of the ease and use of that site. 49:09 So, as Steve said, we\u2019ll create tailwinds because we'll be investing less relative to the revenue. But in terms of the margin, what I'd say is, on the business ex-consumer, the margins will be as good or better than you're used to talking about pre-pandemic. But we will have a sizable consumer business that is still an investment mode because we're still looking to grow. So, the overall enterprise margin you should not expect to be expanded. The good news is, we would expect stronger growth. 49:44 And as for some reason that consumer business doesn't deliver and we can turn off the marketing expense. So, it's not as if we\u2019re adding tons of people or infrastructure or costs. So, we\u2019re very confident in our ability to grow that business. We want to invest to optimize that growth for a period of time, it is going to improve its bottom line next year relative to this year and then certainly over the years beyond that, we would expect to have a nice healthy margin on that business as well. And it will be quite sizeable. Steve Rusckowski : 50:15 And as Mark said, as we go through thinking by the way, we indicated in our Investor Day, and we're not going to give you 2023 guidance, so Mark indicated is when we think about 2023, we're still believing we're comfortably in the range we would expect in 2023 in terms of EPS in growth. And the second half sets its up nicely and what we've implied in our guidance for the full-year implies a set-up, so we would be able to deliver what Mark indicated in 2023 and a view that we indicated in our Investor Day in spring of 2021. 50:57 So, we're consistent and we believe we're on track to delivering what we expect and what you would expect in 2022 and 2023. Kevin Caliendo : 51:07 Thank you for all that detail. Steve Rusckowski : 51:09 Thanks. Operator : 51:11 Our next question comes from Jack Meehan from  . Your line is open. Mark Guinan : 51:15 Hey, Jack. Steve Rusckowski : 51:15 Hey, Jack. Jack Meehan : 51:17 Hello, and happy to say, Nephron Research. So, Steve, on 2023, I know still premature to give a specific number, but at the Analyst Day, you talked about 7% to 9% earnings growth, kind of off of an $8 number you were gearing us to at that point? Now, talking about some tale of COVID here too, can you just like make sure we're doing the math right? Can we take 8% grow it, add some COVID on top? There's obviously some other moving parts, but is that the right way to think about it or where am I wrong? Steve Rusckowski : 51:57 We're going to refresh all of your memories of what we said in  through. Mark Guinan : 52:02 Yes. So at that point, we said $7.40 to $8 and then 7% to 9% CAGR from 2022 and beyond. And then as we got further along past Investor Day we started to signal that we would expect it would be closer to the $8 or on the upper end of the range and because 2022 has more COVID revenue, I would just remind everybody, the growth rate in 2023 is going to be below that CAGR, but the absolute number we're saying should still be where you would have calculated it back in March of 2021. So, just happens to be that the pandemic hung around for a little bit longer. 52:47 I also mentioned at Investor Day that we did not assume COVID would go away. So, in that outlook, I had a level kind of a sustained COVID testing, we do expect that COVID testing will be around part of our portfolio. And certainly nowhere here the levels of 2020 and 2021 or even what we're projecting this year, but not insignificant. So, I did not take COVID as upside for that. We certainly have some COVID built into that outlook. Steve Rusckowski : 53:13 Yeah, what we said, remember this is the spring of 2021. We expected 2022 to be able to grow that we indicated both topline to bottom line, but we also said and it continues to this day, we expect that COVID will continue to be part of our portfolio of tests going forward. 53:35 So that was 2021, thinking about 2022 the same is true for 2022 going into 2023. So, we're going to come out of 2022 with some COVID testing. You see the volumes we indicate, which is about 10,000 and 15,000 per day. Obviously, we're assuming right now we're a lower price, we will continue to have COVID testing in 2023 and we\u2019ve always assumed in our outlook going forward for growth in the topline and bottom line will be COVID testing  portfolio. 54:04 And frankly, we think it's a good opportunity. Because if you go through the math, even at lower price points, this is a sizable market and we have a good size share right now. We think there\u2019s dynamics to the marketplace and we're working on plans to actually gain share in the COVID testing marketplace that could be with us for the foreseeable future. Jack Meehan : 54:25 Great. As a follow-up, wanted to ask you about the consumer directed testing. You talked about the growth rate; how much revenue did that area generate in the quarter? And can you also talk about interest beyond COVID? Is there any specific areas of menu that you're targeting or you think are resonating and where that investments getting directed? Steve Rusckowski : 54:48 Well, first of all, Jeff, we like to give you specific numbers for the quarter. What we share with you, it grew nicely double-digits on both the base business as well as on COVID. Jim, why don\u2019t you talk about the portfolio and what we're seeing growth in? Jim Davis : 55:00 Yes. So, Jack, we've talked into the past, there's various segments since consumer initiated testing business. I'll touch on two. One is, we call them watchful warriors, people that have product conditions like diabetes, like cancer, but their insurance company they only pay for, let's just say two A1c test a year and these people worry about the disease that they may come in once the  and get testing. So, it just makes more sense that they do it through us directly rather than have to go to a physician office pay an expensive bill just to get an A1c test. 55:38 So, there's a lot of demand from these types of patients. The second is, we\u2019ve talked about . People who don't want their insurance company to know they are getting tested, they may not want their doctor to know, they may not want their spouse, they may not want their mother or father, you know, some of this is in relation to STD testing. So, it is a big segment for people that value privacy. 56:05 Finally, there's a generation, a much younger generation that may not want to go to the doctor. They don't have a doctor, but they may want to get lab testing done once a year just to check the underlying health of their body. And so, call it the 20 to 26 year old segment that they don't have primary care physicians, but they are concerned about their health. And they come in and get these once a year comprehensive  for overall health. 56:35 There's other areas as well Jack, physical fitness offset, check one more level before marathons and things like that, but those are the primary ones. Mark Guinan : 56:44 Yes. Jack, we've talked about this previously. We moved this \u2013 what we call blueprint for wellness, which was an offering we gave to employers. It is a battery of diagnostic testing that gives you a good blueprint for how your  and other important metrics. And we're actually offering that now on  testing and people really find that interesting. So, an opportunity to get a full run of diagnostic testing like people have gotten who had employers  we do it for our own employee base and it can be very, very valuable. 57:24 And then obviously if there's anything that\u2019s out of range than go to the doctor. Instead of going to doctor first to get the script. Steve Rusckowski : 57:31 Yeah. As Mark said, to, it's a small business particularly on the base business and that number is growing strong double-digits. And what we said is, we're committed to the business dealing of about $250 million in size by 2025. Well, needless to say with the investment that we're making, the new leadership we brought in that Jim indicated and really a very focused organizational model that we have in place. 58:04 We're getting good traction and we believe you're going to start to see acceleration of the revenues we get from it, which should be a net tailwind for us for our growth overall as we go into 2023 and beyond tracking to that $250 million number in  . 58:23 If you just kind of go through the math, you can see this is going to be accretive to our growth in 2023 and 2024 beyond what we've seen so far because the numbers get much more substantial year-on-year to give us a nice lift in our growth rate going forward. Shawn Bevec : 58:39 Operator, next question. Operator : 58:42 Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies. Your line is open. Brian Tanquilut : 58:47 Hey, good morning guys. Good morning. Just one question. Mark, I know you don't give quarterly guidance and you've given us some color for the guidance for the year, but just any considerations we need to be thinking about as it relates to Q2? And then maybe just on that $30 cost, you mentioned that goes away related \u2013 as COVID volumes go down per test? How quickly does that go away? I'm guessing some of that's payroll and headcount. So, just curious like how does that  function progress over the course of the year, in terms of like eliminating that $30 number? Mark Guinan : 59:23 Yes. So, that payroll is actually a fee we pay to a partner and that relationship that we have is only permissible during the PHE. So there's absolutely guarantee that when PHE goes away that that payment goes away. So, it's directly 100% correlated to that in addition to some other costs, I mentioned like logistics and so on and so forth. But obviously if we stopped a relationship and stopped the payment, we don't have the logistics cost as well because we're not making those special runs to areas that normally we wouldn't go to pick up specimens. 60:02 So, I think you probably have other pieces Brian, go through it. So, we've talked about a level of testing that\u2019s been averaging about 30,000 here early in the quarter, we talked about a lower level in the second half. So that's one consideration for COVID, you know the PHE is due to the full second quarter. Certainly that's much more of a revenue impact and dollar margin versus percentage margin. 60:29 A change from Q2 to the back half of the year. And then most importantly, we're back to growth mode and every week, every quarter, gives an opportunity to go out and do what we're doing before the pandemic, win over more work with offices grow organically, and all of that will benefit the back half relative to where we were in Q1 and certainly expect to be in Q2. So, COVID rent continue to ramp down, the base business continued to grow, PHE  at least that\u2019s in our guidance, but then also importantly that those incremental costs with the COVID testing will go away with the PHE ending. Steve Rusckowski : 61:09 And then just to remind you, what we have told you is this $160 million that we\u2019re investing, we said, we spent about 30 so far. And what we said is in Q2, we've got some investments we're making, particularly we\u2019re releasing a new platform. Okay? So, think about that, someone of this is period expense, it's one-off, okay, but some of this is repeatable that we will see in the back half of the year. 61:34 So some headwinds in the second quarter will be with us. The best that we continue to make, we think in a real great opportunity for us to grow long-term. So, think about that as well. And think about the timing of what will happen when throughout the remainder of the year. Brian Tanquilut : 61:52 Appreciate that. Thank you, guys. Operator : 61:55 Our next question comes from Derik de Bruin from Bank of America. Your line is open. Derik de Bruin : 62:00 Thank you and good morning. So I want \u2013 couple of questions on advanced diagnostic testing. First of all, one of the other public labs that does the oncology testing, talked about weaker volumes, so we're coming out of the pandemic. Could you talk about what you have sort of seen in oncology testing through that market and are you gaining share there? And then as a follow-up to that, your other main competitor has been doing a number of acquisitions and things like with biopsy and the other ones, how are you sort of thinking about building out your pipeline for the advanced market,  booking for potential acquisitions feel better area to enhance or is it all  ? Thank you. Steve Rusckowski : 62:46 Absolutely. So, we shared with you strategically what we're doing, okay. Last year, we indicated that our business and our definition of advanced diagnostics is entirely defined around genetics and molecular. In last year, excluding COVID because that is molecular. It was about $1.3 billion in size. Number one. 63:09 Number two is, what we have done is, we have focused on four areas that have indicated in my prepared remarks, that we're putting additional investments in and that \u2013 and those investment dollars are throughout the entire value chain. It's investment upfront and you test in organic convention. It's also in our experience that we work with our physicians and the patients that they serve and that's also around the services that we have to provide, which is not a counseling and with our sales force to be able to have better reach within the markets that we serve. 63:47 So, it's through the full value chain. And what we have been running at historically is to grow 3% to 4% growth in that business. So, what we said in our 2021 Investor Day is we're going to accelerate growth that we\u2019re going to get to high single digits and we indicated today that we're making good progress against that number is about 8%, okay? 64:10 Now in that, majority of the assumption is we're doing that organically with the investments we're making. However, as you know in the past, we paid some selective acquisitions, quick one, particularly Blueprint genetics, which gives us some bioinformatics capability that enhances our capability around genetics. 64:32 And what we indicated last year is that strategy is working. Those areas of growth, okay are growing strong double-digits, and that strong double digits in 2021 versus 2020 and also in 2021 versus 2019 at pre-pandemic levels. So, we feel our organic strategy of investing is working out and then trying with our share is we continue to look at acquisitions that would make sense to enhance our portfolio, but remember we've been very disciplined about doing acquisitions. 65:08 We have very tight criteria for acquisitions where they have to be accretive to our earnings in a reasonable period time, they have to be accretive to our belief around our earnings opportunities around  . They have to be accretive to our growth and therefore when we look at, it's actually buying things versus investing or investing in ourselves, we\u2019re always considering the trade-off of how we continue to build value. 65:35 So, that's been our strategy and our strategy we've put in place is working, it\u2019s ahead of schedule and we feel good about it going forward. Jim, maybe you would like to add to that? Jim Davis : 65:44 Yes, Derik you asked about our oncology performance. And when we think about our oncology business it is hard to say a solid tumor  holding to that basic pathology work that then fold off  needed. That business is doing well. And has recovered from 2019 levels. And then there's a core hematology business, which has always been a real, real strength of Quest Diagnostics and that business continues to expand. 66:12 So, our oncology portfolio is in good shape. You mentioned liquid biopsy, there certainly is a market and what we referred to is the MRD side that\u2019s Minimal Residual Disease side. We're working on an assay that\u2019s also commercially available assays from our suppliers and we\u2019re considering both. 66:37 In terms of pre-cancer or cancer spring assays, that's a bit more out there. Something we watch as you know, there's 63, 65 start-up companies with the name liquid biopsy that received a   of venture capital money last year. And we're certainly keeping an eye in the space on the space as Steve indicated. If we find one that meets all of our criteria, we\u2019ll look closely at it. Operator : 67:07 Our next question comes from Ann Hynes from Mizuho Securities. Your line is open. Steve Rusckowski : 67:14 Good morning, Ann. Ann Hynes : 67:15 Hi, good morning. So, one more margin question. I think the issue is, maybe we are over estimating the margins on COVID back into your big base business, and you refer to your partner, which I'm assuming is CVS that you have to pay that $30 fee, can you tell us what percentage of your test is CVS. So, just to make sure that we are estimating, just kind of the consolidated margin for COVID quickly? Mark Guinan : 67:44 So, when we talk about non-traditional channels, it's not limited to one partner. And what I can share is that it grew before the person changed to where and it was almost up to half of our volume that was coming from the non-traditional channels and a higher proportion of the traditional volumes was uninsured. 68:15 And since the uninsured volumes have dropped off that proportion has dropped off as well as we go, but it\u2019s still significant. And I would not want to comment specifically on any partner and certainly the one you mentioned is not our only partner. Jim Davis : 68:35 Yes. And the range, the percent in our volume that comes through these retail partners actually varies. During searches, I would say it's less \u2013 it reduces because we start to then get a lot of specimens from physician offices, urgent care centers, and hospitals. When COVID subsides then that becomes slightly larger percentage of our mix. Mark Guinan : 69:02 Right. There are  , we can do less cooling and we can take a little bit of a hit on the turnaround time, $25 that is in a lot of the contracts and certainly in CMS\u2019 payments. So, there's a lot of dynamics that can offset each other. And that's why we really  focus people that we can make a reasonable margin on the CMS reimbursement grade on COVID going forward, and it's not the price change will all drop to the bottom line. Steve Rusckowski : 69:34 Going back to what's in our numbers and what\u2019s based and what's COVID, I'll keep on really reiterating. Remember, we took advantage of the opportunity we had in 2020 and 2021 to invest in accelerating growth. And those investments take time and they're ahead of schedule and that's going to help us next year, year-on-year. So, think about that too as it kind of goes through the plan for this year into next. Operator : 70:05 Our final question comes from Rachel Vatnsdal from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Rachel Vatnsdal : 70:11 Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. So, could you just elaborate on the POS contract momentum that you've been seeing, especially  return normal, how should we think about the cadence of those wins and revenue contributions for this year? Steve Rusckowski : 70:24 Yes. So, I mentioned in our prepared remarks  that we've announced and our relationships are strong and beginning to demonstrate that we can bring real value to these  delivery systems. Remind you all what it is, is, one is, yes, we help them run there labs and we see what you see one, but they save money and provide household systems are struggling as you know. 70:55 Volumes, yes, in some cases of recoveries like the acuity level of patients and the beds, are higher and they have fixed reimbursement. And then secondly, as they are having inflationary pressure in hospital systems, which has been tougher that to offset. So, that's the first piece. Second is, when we have our relationship, our advanced diagnostics business in our overall sophisticated testing business, which we call reference testing with hospitals also is an opportunity, so we typically bring in a larger share of that with hospitals. 71:29 And then finally, we have an opportunity in some cases to buy their offerings business, which has been nice opportunity for us to build value, which helps us sort of the acquisition target, but also helps us because eventually they are accretive because we know  is quite well. So, it's worked. right? Yes. And going forward the funnel continues to build. We have a dedicated team. We've invested in that as well. Jim and I are entirely engaged together. 71:56 Working a large number of these accounts. We personally do a fair amount of travel and spend time with the management team, engaged in these opportunities. So, we do believe it continues to yield us a nice opportunity going forward to continue to accelerate growth. So, Jim, anything you like to add to that? Jim Davis : 72:15 I would say that, funnel of opportunities  time negotiate. Obviously,  someone different your helps system laboratory during COVID is that something helps us  trying to. Now that COVID is subsiding, helps us  patients is under control. I think you'll see the deal actually pick-up. Steve Rusckowski : 72:48 Okay, great. So thanks again for joining our call. We appreciate your continued support and you all have a great day. Operator : 72:56 Thank you for participating in the Quest Diagnostics first quarter 2022 conference call.

The entire contents of the call, including the presentation and question-and-answer session that will follow, are the copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics with all rights reserved. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. Now I'd like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead, please. Shawn Bevec : Thank you and good morning. I'm joined by Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; Jim Davis, CEO elect; Mark Guinan, Chief Financial Officer; and Sam Samad, our incoming Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and will provide non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include but are not limited to, those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. The company continues to believe that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on future operating results, cash flows and/or its financial condition will be primarily driven by the pandemic severity and duration, healthcare insurer, government, client payer reimbursement for COVID-19 molecular test, the pandemic impact on the U.S. health care system and the U.S. economy; and the timing, scope and effectiveness of federal, state and local governmental responses to the pandemic, including the impact of vaccination efforts which are drivers beyond the company's knowledge and control. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS. Any references to base business, testing revenues or volumes refer to the performance of our business excluding COVID-19 testing. Growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections, including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings growth are compound annual growth rates. Finally, revenue growth rates from acquisitions will be measured against our base business. Now, here is Steve Rusckowski. Steve Rusckowski : Thanks, Shawn and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We performed well in the quarter, growing our base business year-over-year while increasing our share of COVID-19 molecular testing since March. As we have said before, we believe demand for COVID-19 molecular testing is not going away anytime soon. It will continue into 2023. Based on our overall performance in the quarter and our expectations for the remainder of 2022, we have raised our full year guidance. We also made very good progress on our leadership transition. Jim will give you an update and take you through our second quarter highlights and then Mark will take you through our financial performance in more detail before we get into your questions. But before I turn it over to Jim, I'd like to say a few words about the saving access to Laboratory Services Act, now called Salsa, the important new federal laboratory legislation recently introduced in Congress as well as the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit's recent ruling on our trade associations PAMA lawsuit. We're grateful for the efforts of Senate and House members who introduced this legislation on both sides of the aisle. In our view, Salsa could fix PAMA permanently, setting the Medicare clinical lab fee schedule back on a sustainable path. In 2014, the intent of Congress when passing PAMA was to reform the Medicare clinical lab fee schedule to a single national fee schedule based on private payer rates for the clinical laboratory services. Unfortunately, the first round of data collection failed to collect the data from large significant segments of the marketplace. The result was billions of Medicare cuts over 3 years, with more on their way if Salsa is not passed. Our trade association is coordinated to Congressional Meetings along with public advocacy efforts that involves collaboration with the provider and patient communities. Last week, the D.C. Circuit Court issued a decision in the PAMA lawsuit filed in 2017 by our trade association, ACLA. In short, the court sided with ACLA and called the CMS's exclusion of hospital price data \"arbitrary and capricious.\" Importantly, this case has been rejected for procedural reasons and this is the first opinion based on its merits. Unfortunately, the court is not requiring CMS to recalculate the flawed payment amounts. While disappointing, we believe this favorable ruling will give Congress additional strong grounds to finally fix PAMA's mini flaws by passing Salsa. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Jim Davis. Jim Davis : Thanks, Steve. Our base business performed well despite softer utilization trends which we believe impacted us and the rest of the health care industry. I'm proud of the efforts our team has made to grow our share of COVID-19 molecular testing since the end of the first quarter. We also ramped our investments to further accelerate growth in the areas of advanced diagnostics and direct-to-consumer testing. In the quarter, we announced the selection of our next CFO, Sam Samad. Sam joins us from Illumina, where he served as Chief Financial Officer for 5-plus years. As many of you know, he brings a depth of health care experience that will help us in many ways. Prior to Illumina, Sam held several financial and operational leadership roles at Cardinal Health and Eli Lilly and Company. Sam, welcome to Quest Diagnostics. Sam Samad : Thanks, Jim. It's an honor to join the Quest Diagnostics team. In previous roles, I had the opportunity to observe the many contributions Quest is making to health care. Just arriving less than 2 weeks ago, I've been impressed by the passion and dedication of everyone that I've met so far. I'd like to thank Mark Guinan for his partnership during this transition. I'm excited to be here. Jim, I'll turn it back to you. Jim Davis : Thanks, Sam and I look forward to working very closely with you. Now, turning to our performance in the second quarter. Total revenues were $2.5 billion. Earnings per share were $1.96 on a reported basis and $2.36 on an adjusted basis. Cash provided by operations was $402 million. COVID-19 testing revenues were approximately $355 million in the second quarter, down approximately 31% from 2021 and 41% from the previous quarter. In July, with the spread of the BA4 and BA5 variance, we continue to see the demand for COVID-19 molecular testing, consistent with the volumes we reported in June. Our positivity rate has increased since March and approximately 25% of the tests we performed in the first 2 weeks of July were positive. We believe that the COVID-19 trends since March contributed to the softness we observed in the broader health care utilization. As you've seen, we're successfully executing a strategy to increase our share of COVID-19 molecular testing. A key element of our strategy is to increase the number of testing access points through retail relationships. In addition to our CVS and Walmart relationships, we are now also collecting specimens at Rite Aid locations and the number of access points will continue to grow. Approximately half of our COVID-19 volume in the quarter came from retail channels. Quest is proud to have been selected by the CDC to participate in its increasing community access to testing, or ICATT program for COVID-19 testing. Through this program, qualified uninsured individuals can access COVID-19 molecular diagnostic testing for zero out-of-pocket costs. In addition, we're pleased to be the provider of COVID-19 PCR testing for qualified insured and uninsured customers of Rite Aid nationwide for zero out-of-pocket expense. We now have approximately 6,000 COVID-19 patient access testing sites through retail relationships as well as our own patient service centers. Through these efforts, we estimate that we are performing approximately 8% of COVID-19 molecular testing in the U.S., up from approximately 4% in March. Finally, the public health emergency was extended into October which will help us maintain our current level of reimbursement. Based on these factors, we raised our COVID-19 revenue guidance for full year 2022 to between $1.15 billion and $1.30 billion. Now, turning to our base business. In the second quarter, we continued to make progress executing our two-point strategy to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence. Here are some highlights from the quarter. Our M&A funnel remains strong. We are in late-stage discussions with several hospital health systems on the purchase of their laboratory outreach business. This is in addition to our normal conversations we have with C-suite leaders on performing reference testing and providing professional lab services. While this pandemic paused some of these discussions, it has also created opportunities because of the financial and labor pressures that many hospital health systems are facing. We continue to accelerate growth through health plan access. Excluding COVID-19, health plan volumes and revenues grew faster than our overall base business in the quarter. Health plans continue to see the value of working with us. Over the last 2 years, we have renewed 12 national and large regional health plan contracts with price increases. We expect more renewals with price increases this year. And we're proud to be selected as one of the UnitedHealthcare's preferred lab network providers for the fourth consecutive year, providing physicians and patients with improved access, quality and value. Finally, we're pleased to share today that we have renewed our strategic relationship with Florida Blue. Florida continues to be an important large and growing state for us. Earlier this month, the CMS Transparency in Coverage Final Rules became effective to help consumers know the cost of a covered item or service before receiving care. Beginning July 1, 2022, group health plans and issuers of group or individual health insurance are required to post pricing information for covered items and services. We are leveraging that data to ensure patients and employers are aware of the value we offer. This trend will continue to gather momentum as more pricing transparency requirements will go into effect in the next 2 years. We believe that pricing transparency favors Quest Diagnostics which powers affordable care. We do this by offering clinical innovation, enabling better clinical outcomes through our quality, speed and accuracy of test results, improving the patient experience with accessible and easy-to-use patient resources and finally, reducing the cost of care. We continue to ramp our investments in advanced diagnostics capabilities. In the quarter, we saw growth from hematology, prenatal genetics and pharma services. We also introduced Quest AD Detect, a blood test to aid in the early assessment of Alzheimer's disease. We are seeing good early adoption from both primary care physicians and neurologists. Finally, last week, we launched the lab developed molecular test to aid in the detection of monkeypox. The test can differentiate monkeypox from other orthopox viruses and we will be able to perform nearly 30,000 tests a week by the end of July. In addition, we can expand testing to other laboratories in our network to further increase capacity if needed. We continue to see growth in direct-to-consumer testing, thanks to our COVID-19 offerings and more importantly, our base business testing. Within the base business testing category, we saw strong growth from testosterone, comprehensive metabolic panels and Lyme disease. We're excited about upcoming improved digital experience which we expect to debut later this year. We believe this improved experience will help us acquire, convert and retain more customers who visited QuestDirect digital platform. We expect to have much more to say about our improved digital experience before the end of this year. The second part of our two-point strategy is to drive operational excellence. We remain focused on improving our operational quality, service and cost, thereby driving productivity gains. We have several initiatives underway to make this happen. Focused on attracting and retaining our people, optimizing our network, automating and digitizing our processes and getting paid for the work we do. Here are three examples. One, we're partnering with universities to help build our pipeline of expertise in medical technology, cytology and histology. We're also teaming up with a learning and development recruiting company to provide lobotomy certifications to prescreened candidates in exchange for a 2-year commitment to work at Quest. Two, our schedule at check-in initiative which encourages patients to make appointments has now expanded to 1,000 of our patient service sites. In one area which has implemented the program, we are seeing a 20% decrease in average wait times as well as an improvement in patient satisfaction. We're also building the payment process into the digital customer experience which frees up our phlebotomists to focus on specimen collection, thereby increasing their capacity and improving the patient-employee experience. Three, we continue to implement digital technology to provide end-to-end specimen tracking, including the arrival patterns that enable load leveling across the network which improves our productivity and provides greater transparency for our clients. We're not immune to the current inflationary environment and are managing through rising fuel and labor costs. Like many companies, higher-than-normal employee turnover in some job categories is impacting our ability to drive further productivity gains. However, these increased costs are in line with our expectations and are built into our guidance. We are expecting another year of solid Invigorate savings and productivity improvements to help offset these pressures. Finally, I'm very proud of our recently released 2021 corporate responsibility report and invite you all to download it. You can find it on our website. Among the highlights, in 2021, we launched our first formal materiality assessment to help identify the most significant ESG topics to the company and our stakeholders. Also, to enhance the level of our ESG disclosures, we began reporting in accordance with the SASB guidelines. We're very proud of the contributions Quest is making to empower better health and grateful to our 50,000 colleagues who are making that vision a reality every day. Now, Mark will provide more details on our performance and share more insights on our updated guidance for the remainder of 2022. Mark Guinan : Thanks, Jim. In the second quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.45 billion, down 3.8% versus the prior year. Base business revenues grew 2.9% to $2.1 billion, while COVID-19 testing revenues declined approximately 31% to $355 million. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services declined 3.6% compared to the prior year. The decline reflected lower revenue from COVID-19 testing services versus the second quarter of 2021, partially offset by growth in our base testing revenue. Total volume measured by the number of requisitions declined 1.4% versus the prior year. Acquisitions contributed approximately 100 basis points to total volume. Total base testing volumes increased approximately 2% versus the prior year. Excluding acquisitions, total base testing volumes grew less than 1%. As we have seen in prior COVID surges, we experienced some softening of base testing volumes beginning in April as COVID-19 cases began to rise again throughout the spring. COVID-19 testing volumes were stronger than expected during the second quarter. Together with our JV partnership, Sonora Quest, we resulted approximately 3.7 million molecular tests. Quest alone resulted roughly 3.5 million molecular tests, down approximately 1.3 million tests and 2.8 million tests versus the prior year and first quarter, respectively. Our July COVID-19 molecular volumes have been consistent with the volumes we reported in June, averaging roughly 40,000 tests per day, excluding Sonora Quest. Revenue per requisition declined 2.6% versus the prior year, driven primarily by lower COVID-19 molecular volume. Base business revenue per req was up modestly. As we have highlighted in recent quarters, the pricing environment has improved with unit price reimbursement pressure of less than 50 basis points in the quarter. Reported operating income in the second quarter was $388 million, or 15.8% of revenues compared to $533 million or 20.9% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $435 million or 17.7% of revenues compared to $584 million or 22.9% of revenues last year. The year-over-year decline in adjusted operating income is primarily related to lower COVID-19 testing volume, a higher portion of COVID-19 molecular testing volume from nontraditional retail channels which carry additional expenses and logistics costs, investments to accelerate growth in our base business and slightly lower average reimbursement for COVID-19 molecular tests. In the quarter, approximately half of our COVID-19 molecular volume came through our retail partners versus roughly 1/3 last year. We expect the mix of COVID-19 molecular volumes through this channel to continue to grow in the third quarter. Reported EPS was $1.96 in the quarter compared to $4.96 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $2.36 compared to $3.18 last year. Year-to-date cash provided by operations was $882 million in 2022 versus $1.2 billion in the prior year period. Given the limited M&A activity, we repurchased $200 million in stock during the second quarter. Now, turning to our updated guidance. Revenues are now expected to be between $9.5 billion and $9.75 billion. Base business revenues are expected to be between $8.35 billion and $8.45 billion. COVID-19 testing revenues are expected to be between $1.15 billion and $1.3 billion. Reported EPS expected to be in a range of $8.24 to $8.64 and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $9.55 to $9.95. Cash provided by operations is expected to be at least $1.7 billion and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million. Before concluding, I'll touch on some assumptions embedded in our updated 2022 guidance as well as some additional considerations. Our guidance assumes COVID-19 molecular volumes to average approximately 15,000 to 25,000 tests per day for the rest of the year. As we look toward 2023, we continue to assume our COVID-19 molecular testing run rate in the second half of 2022 continues into next year. Last week, the public health emergency was again extended another 90 days through mid-October. We assume average reimbursement for COVID-19 molecular testing to hold relatively steady through this period. While the public health emergency could be renewed beyond October, additional extensions are not captured in our guidance. As Jim noted earlier, we have successfully grown our share of COVID-19 molecular testing through our retail partners which accounted for approximately 50% of our COVID-19 molecular volume in the second quarter. As these retail partnerships continue to expand, we expect the mix through this channel to continue to grow throughout the remainder of the year. We continue to incur incremental costs to serve this channel. As COVID-19 positivity rates remain in the double digits, our ability to pull specimens for COVID-19 molecular testing continues to be limited. As a reminder, we are ramping investments to accelerate growth this year. We spent approximately $70 million in the first half of the year and we expect these investments to continue to ramp in Q3 to support the launch of our new consumer site later this year. A portion of these stand-up IT costs are temporary but variable marketing costs will increase following the launch of the new site. We'll also be adding additional headcount this year to support our consumer offering as well as bioinformatics capabilities within advanced diagnostics. I will now turn it back to Steve. Steve Rusckowski : Thanks, Mark. As many of you know, this will be Mark's last earnings call as he is retiring next week. Mark, you've been a key member of our leadership team as we have transformed Quest and accelerated its growth. I'm grateful for everything you've done for the company, especially for the last 2.5 years of the pandemic. I would miss your partnership and consult as we navigated many challenges over nearly a decade. I wish you and your family, health and happiness as you approach the next chapter in your life. Thanks. Mark Guinan : Thanks, Steve. Quest is a special place and it has been an honor to serve as CFO for the last 9 years. Thanks to the analysts and investors on this call. I have enjoyed working with all of you. My family and I are excited for what lies ahead. Steve Rusckowski : Thanks, Mark. And to summarize, as Jim shared, we had another good quarter driven by our efforts through share of COVID-19 testing while we believe our base business performed in line with the software utilization trends we're seeing in health care. We have raised our full year guidance based on our performance in the quarter and our expectations for the remainder of 2022. Finally, we're grateful for the efforts of Senate and House members who introduced the saving access to Laboratory Services Act and fully support the passage of this important legislation. Now, we'd be happy to take any of your questions. Operator? Operator :  Our first question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Brian Tanquilut : Mark, congrats on the upcoming retirement and thanks for all the help over the years. So I guess, just my question on the base business, I mean, you called out some of the softness, right? I mean do you guys think that it's more COVID driven with the current mini surge that we're seeing? Or just any color you can share with us on that? And maybe I guess, Steve, taking it a little bit further, how are you thinking about the business today as we face a recession down the road in terms of the defensiveness of the volumes and the business overall as we get past COVID? Steve Rusckowski : Yes, sure. So thanks, Brian, for the question. So as we indicated, we were a little softer in the second quarter where the base business than what we expected in the second quarter. And we do believe there's a relationship, as we have said before, between pickup in COVID infections and the amount of people that are going into their physicians and to some extent, what's happening with hospitals, even though that's a secondary slowdown, if at all. And the second part of your question is longer term with worries about a potential slowdown in our economy and approaching recession. What's our view on that and we're taking a hard look at what happened over the last 10 to 15 years of our business. And things did change quite a bit over the last decade, as you know. The first -- over the last recession, the big -- Great Recession, 2008, we have in parallel with that, the Affordable Care Act. We also had changes with health care policy and we had PAMA, so there's a lot of other effects. And so yes, we do believe there may be some impact in our business related to a slowdown in the economy and the recession. We do believe that we're so essential through the delivery of health care and the need for health care going forward that we believe that utilization will continue to be reasonable throughout any up and down in an economic cycle. So -- but we're taking a look at it and we're seeing if there's any differences this time around, as you know, maybe people were saying this is an unusual set of circumstances given what's happened with health care and what's happened in the economy over the last 2 to 3 years. So Jim, anything you'd like to add to what we see with our base business? Jim Davis : Yes, Steve, what I would add is, look, we're in close touch with the payers. And the payers have indicated to us and you saw UnitedHealthcare's announcement earlier this week, that they saw softer utilization of health care services as well. In addition to that, we track a group of Quest accounts that we know are 100% loyal to us. We call it our same-store sales analysis. And we noticed in the quarter that it was basically flat, those accounts that are 100% loyal. So, the other thing we look at is just the mix business. And we noticed our general health and wellness panels grew at a lower rate than some of our infectious disease, non-COVID infectious disease and chronic care types of testing that we do. So we -- based on all that information, we come to the conclusion that the base was certainly softer this quarter. Operator : Our next question is from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. A.J. Rice: I want to offer my congratulations to Mark and best wishes and welcome, aboard, Sam. Look forward to working with you. Maybe I'll just pivot over to talk about margins. Obviously, within the base business, you've called out some inflationary pressures. They seem like they've been manageable. But you also talked about the Invigorate savings and they're largely offsetting it. I wonder if you could just sort of comment on how you're viewing base business margins? And then I'm assuming also on the COVID-related testing. As long as the PHE is in place, that margin is stable but has there been any reason to think that, that has changed? We get the aggregate margin but I'm wondering about the underlying trends there. If you could just comment on it and how much that factored into your back half guidance outlook as well? Any changes? Mark Guinan : Thanks, A.J., for the questions. Let me start with COVID. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, when you look at our COVID business, the good news was a lot more volume, a lot more revenue, a lot more dollars of operating margin. However, with that also goes less pooling, a larger mix shift towards the retail outlets which have higher expenses. And then we have had some slight erosion versus last year on average reimbursement a couple of dollars, not anything super significant. So the margin percentage was less but still, its contribution to the bottom line from COVID was much higher. As we look into the back half at this point, we don't know where the positivity rates are going to go but we've not assumed a material change in the amount of pooling. We would expect to continue with the current mix or potentially grow that as a proportion of our total COVID volumes. So within the ranges, that's kind of how we're seeing the balance of the year play out on COVID. So if the positivity rate drops down and the positive rate, I'm looking at Jim here, has been as high as we've seen through the pandemic, now a lot more people are doing rapid antigen testing and so on, we believe that the cases are underreported. But we believe that the prevalence of COVID right now is extremely high. And so in the earlier answer that we provided to Brian around the base business, there has been a historical negative correlation between those. And we do believe that the base business has absolutely been impacted by the surge in COVID. We just aren't sure how long it will last. On the base business, we've shared that as we built our plan and the ranges for 2022, we built in a higher SWB, salary work benefits assumption that was in our guidance. And certainly, that's something we control and that's really within expectations. We have a couple of billion dollars that we have long-term contracts. And so really not exposed to inflation in a short window for that. But then we have some other costs where we don't have long-term contracts and there are things that everybody is familiar with and you've heard from other companies as well, things like fuel, things like housekeeping, security, temporary labor. And so those areas have been a little more inflationary than we would have anticipated going into the year. The good news is those are in our results year-to-date during our guidance. We're not expecting that to go away immediately. We certainly hope it's not long-term inflation unlike where if you have wage inflation, you generally expect will continue. If you add contractual inflation with your key suppliers around reagents and other things that might be longer term as well or certainly a couple of years. We don't know how long this spike is going to last. But I can tell you, it's probably like $0.05 to $0.08 a quarter in the first half and we're not expecting that to change. We hope it might but in the guidance that we provided. So hopefully, that's helpful, A.J. Steve Rusckowski : And A.J., just so it's clear. You all know that the Emergency Act has been extended and so we're assuming in our guidance that will be extended through October but we're not assuming in our guidance that it extends past October until we have certainty around that, okay? So that is the assumption and what we've just provided for guidance for the remainder of the year. And I think since you asked, A.J., Jim, why don't you comment a little bit about the opportunities we still see around the bigger rate and you mentioned in our opening remarks about the things we have changed. But why don't you chat a little bit about why we're still bullish on the prospects of improving productivity. Jim Davis : Yes. So A.J., as we've talked in the past, there's still certainly a lot of opportunity around automation of manual processes in the laboratory. I touched on in my comments around some of the automated check-in procedures. So we've long had appointment scheduling. What we've added recently is when a patient walks into the PSC without an appointment, you actually go to the check in and you -- and if the wait room is full, you schedule an appointment at that point. And what we've seen is it really does help productivity in the PSC, as well as if the patient leaves, they may not come back to Quest. If they make an appointment to come back in 2 hours or the next day, we feel like the patient retention is better. But automation, the use of artificial intelligence in terms of readouts of manual curves and laboratories, all of that work continues. And then I'd tell you, the other thing that will help continue to drive productivity is our work around retention of our employees. So our productivity, like all companies, we're seeing a much higher increase in turnover. We feel like it is stabilized, albeit at a higher point. So as we now drive retention higher and turnover lower that will certainly help our productivity efforts in the back half of the year. Mark Guinan : And I just want to add one thing about peace in the back half. Steve talked about the potential for the PHE to not be extended which at this point, we're not assuming it does extend. But I want to remind people that the price drop is not a full margin drop because when we get to beyond the PHE, first off, there's not absolute certainty but most people would expect the positivity rate will be significantly lower. We can pool a lot more. So we can get some margin offset there dollar-wise. And then, the second one is that the retail relationships that we have will change in the structure. We know how that's going to work. And basically, the significant costs we're incurring right now to get that volume for the retail outlets will go away because it's only permitted under the PHE. It's complicated but it will go away. So while the value per requisition will drop to whatever price we end up with and people have talked about the CMS rate that was originally published and certainly, that's potential, over time, that's not all a margin hit because there's some other costs that go away. So we still will make a decent percentage margin, certainly fewer dollars per patient encounter. But I just want to make sure people are clear that COVID profitability doesn't fall completely off the cliff when the PHE goes away. Operator : Our next question is from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Jack Meehan : First, Sam, congrats. I think you're going to be a great for the Quest. And Mark, of course, really enjoyed working together. But before you go, I do have more margin questions for you here. Mark Guinan : Let me go otherwise, Jack, Thanks. Jack Meehan : Of course. So specifically, can you just talk about what was the COVID testing margin in the quarter? Or how did it compare to the overall margin? And I guess what I'm trying to get into is just like how much of the sequential step down in earnings might have been related to the margin impacts you've talked about? Mark Guinan : Yes. So Jack, as you know, we don't provide specific margins on subsegments of our business. But what I can give you directionally is I referred to half of our volume coming from retail channels or nontraditional channels and we talked about dollar-wise, what the incremental cost per counter is there. A year ago, in the second quarter, it was about 1/3 of our volume. So you can see that's pretty significant. In the second quarter last year, we did quite a bit of pooling and that's varied in the interim quarters between that and now but there was quite a bit of pooling last year because the positivity rate had fallen -- very well. I think many of us by June of last year were thinking this might have been behind us before Delta hit us. And this quarter, we expected in our plans to do quite a bit of pooling but in reality, it was not a large amount. So that should give you a little bit of idea. The other thing I did mention a couple of dollars erosion on the average reimbursement. So I think you got all the pieces, not going to provide a specific number but that should help you understand. But I think the key thing is that the dollars we earned off COVID was much better than our plans. And that's -- and we expect it to continue and that's why we're rising guidance. So while the percentage was worse, the dollar bottom line was better. Steve Rusckowski : Yes, Jack, as you know, in Q1, we did about $600 million worth of COVID. And in the second quarter that we're talking about right now, it was roughly $350 million. So that was a material change in COVID. And as Mark has gone through, there's a lot more dynamics in what the margin is in COVID. But essentially, that sequential compare and our margin drop is primarily related to the drop in COVID testing. Jack Meehan : Got it. If I can squeeze in one more on the core business. What are your expectations for merit increases and SW&B this year? Have that changed at all? Steve Rusckowski : Jim, do you want to take that? Jim Davis : No, it hasn't changed at all, Jack. We said 3% to 4% for the year. We're still within that guidance. We've already provided the merit increase for the year. We do that annually in the April time frame. So it's already in the Q2 numbers for sure. Mark Guinan : Yes. As Jim referenced, the vast majority of our increase has already taken place. Certainly, like all other companies, we have some off-cycle adjustments based on promotions and other things. But most of the \"inflationary headwinds\" in SWB were incurred in the second quarter. So if you look sequentially, that's one of the drivers of margin reduction first quarter to second quarter. That's been a historical event as well. That's not new. But we don't anticipate going forward to see significant inflation beyond kind of the run rate we were on in Q2. Steve Rusckowski : Jim and I actually in a couple of financial conferences try to dimensionalize what's going on with our wage bill. And we talked about of the 50,000 people that the most pressure we see is what there really are real frontline people and they're primarily what we call specimen processors. When the specimens come into our laboratories, they do the sorting, it's a tough job. It's at night and we're paying them, we think, fairly and we've increased that for their hourly wages. And the second is couriers. And to give you an idea because it is the area of most pressure, roughly, it's about 10% to 11% of our workforce salary, okay? So -- and at the same time, it represents a larger percentage of our workforce count of the 50,000 people. So that's where we have the most pressure. So even if that number went up, considerably, you get an idea of the impact that would have on our margins. So that's where we see the most pressure, okay? Operator : Our next question is from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Patrick Donnelly : Sam, looking forward to continue to work with you and not to put you on the spot on your first call here. But I'm sure on the way in, as you know, there's a lot of questions as you've seen on this call already in terms of the margin and the margin profile going into kind of next year as we work our way through kind of the high margin COVID coming out, some of the expenses around DTC and retail, wage inflation. I guess when you came in and Mark, feel free in to chime in obviously but Sam, I guess how did you get comfortable with that? It would just be helpful maybe to hear your perspective on that as I'm sure it was a key consideration, something you dug into on your way in and I know investors are hyper focused on that piece as well. So if you're willing, I would love to hear your general thoughts on kind of how we work our way through the margin side as we kind of work our way into next year. Sam Samad : Yes. Patrick, thanks for the welcome and I look forward to working with you and the rest of the folks on the call as well. Listen, it's really early days. I've been here in -- I'm in my second week here. So all I can tell you is coming in, obviously, we're in a challenging environment right now. But Quest has an incredible reputation with incredible people that really provide a significant value to health care. So I've been so far really impressed with the passion that I've seen people here, the knowledge and the contributions that I think we can make in health care. So I'm going to punt a little bit on your question because it's really early days and really ask Mark to more comment on it but I'm very excited about how we can work through these challenges. But it's really early days, Patrick. I'm in my second week here. So I'll let maybe Mark talk about it more. Mark Guinan : Yes. So Patrick, appreciate the question. We know where people's heads are at right now around the business and that's where ours are as well. So I can assure you we're spending a lot of time on that. We've spent a lot of time on that. There's a number of things that we generally control. And then there are some things that are a little bit less in our control. So we do our best to forecast those things. We put together ranges. And then we -- I think and believe we're very transparent with you about how those things play out. So you get a sense of, okay, well, what really is going on in the business? And because of that, I believe that, generally, we've not surprised people. And we've given you delivered on your expectations. We've given you timely updates. We've given you interim information. And based on my time with Sam and I think the team here, I would expect that to continue. So you would expect that with my departure that we're not going to change the way we talk to, the way we share, give all those updates. I think everybody appreciates what a great job Shawn does and know they can call them any time, any place and get him and he'll be as transparent as possible. So really, I think what it comes down to is, I believe we're focused on the right things. And also, I believe we do our best job of being as transparent as possible around all those key drivers. Patrick Donnelly : Yes, that's helpful. I appreciate it guys. And then Steve, maybe a quick one. You've continued to talk about more constructive conversations with some of the covering lives and payers. Can you just talk about, I guess, the kind of outlook on pricing? It seems as confident as you guys have sounded on that front in years. Maybe just talk about how you're feeling on the pricing side given some of those payer conversations? Steve Rusckowski : Yes. So thanks for the question. And we are very pleased with the progress we have made with all payers and where we are today versus when I started which was over 10 years ago. We've got a network now that is the strongest network that we've ever had. And I would say our relationship with all the significant payers, national and regional is very strong. And they are increasingly realizing that it's good for their membership and good for their competitiveness in the market to have us in the network and we bring a lot of value. And so we're entirely focused on what we call powering affordable care which is consistent with what Jim has driven in the company around making sure that we have great quality, great service and a great experience. And you heard earlier from Jim as we continue to push on just working smarter and by working smarter, we're getting more productivity but we're also going to have a better product. And payers understand that. And so as Jim mentioned, we have gotten some increases from the payers over the last several negotiation rounds. We continue to believe that is something we're going to continue to push for because we do bring a lot of value in the marketplace. And we're very competitive in the marketplace. And so if you look at the price effect that we saw in the quarter and what we have typically said in the past historically, remember, historically, we said you should plan at about 100 basis points with the price effect. Well, in this quarter, in the last quarter, we've actually saw less than that. And that's the best position we bet in. And I will share within that envelope, the commercial payer portion of it is significantly less than where we've been historically. But we still see pressure with price, with our hospital business, with our client bill business and that's in that envelope as well. But on the commercial payer side, we're in a very different place than we were before. And I'll share with you a part of Jim and I on my transition is Jim and I are going into the nationals and the regional payers and we're talking about what we've done in the past and more importantly, what we're doing in the future. We just had a meeting last week with one of the national payers and they see us as a much more significant player in the marketplace than what people think about us as which is a laboratory. We're much more of the lab. We actually help them improve the value of health care going forward. So a much better place than where we were in a good place right now. Mark Guinan : And so what I will add is that we really moved the needle on commercial. Over the last couple of years, we've talked about more pricing pressure in the client bill which is, as Steve referenced the hospital and then in some cases, where we contract directly with physicians. But instead of being a headwind on price, I will tell you that starting next year and going forward, I would expect that -- to be at least neutral, if not a tailwind. So we've moved it from a major headwind to be at least neutral and more likely positive. So wanted to dimensionalize a little more why you're hearing the positive comments for us. And it's in really recognition of what Steve said which is our strategic value to them. We're not a commoditized provider of a laboratory result. There's so much more to how we're helping them and then these value-based contracts that we referenced were based on performance, we can earn a better payment for ourselves. And so because of that, we really, really moved the environment and the relationships with the commercial payers. Operator : Our next question is from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Pito Chickering : Mark, it's a pleasure working with you over these years. And Sam, I look forward to working with you in the future. Quick two part on the inflation side. So the first one is a follow-up on the pricing question that you just gave. Can you quantify what the better commercial rates are for 2023 because you priority locked it in at this point versus 2022? And then a follow-up on A.J.'s question just to make sure I understand, you were seeing an additional $0.05 to $0.08 of inflationary pressures. Was that more or less than you expected when you guys gave guidance on the fourth quarter call? And then on previous calls, you talked about sort of the 2023 EPS of $8.50. Should we add those inflationary pressures against that $8.50? Or can you offset those with increased efficiency as well as the new recent COVID retail agreements you've done? Mark Guinan : Well, thanks for all the questions, Pito. I'll start with 2023. We've not locked down our plan. And if we did, we generally don't give specific guidance until our fourth quarter earnings call. And I'll leave it to the management team. I'll be leaving exactly when they decide to do that but we're not going to comment any specifics around 2023. In terms of the amount of the increases, again, I'm not going to dimensionalize. We don't have a planned lockdown. But we have enough contracts that are already set for next year and enough progress on some that are either, as we referenced like Florida Blue or some others that are getting close to being locked down for renewal that I have confidence to say what I said which is, this is not going to be a next year for us on a price perspective... Steve Rusckowski : So just to add to that, so what you're hearing from us is, yes, we hear your comments about inflation. And yes, we have inflationary pressure. And yes, we're managing that. But what you're also hearing from us is we're in a better price position than we've been in. You need to think about that too and thinking about the prospect of what we're going to do in '23. We're not going to provide guidance. But we still feel confident with what we shared at Investor Day in 2021 around the prospects of what we're going to do going forward. Mark Guinan : And yes, so I was going to continue that what you're hearing from us is what's happening now, Pito. And the $0.05 to $0.08 is more inflation than we would have anticipated. However, other things have changed as well. Most notably, we did a lot more COVID. So we delivered a lot more earnings. So just like we don't expect the high level of COVID and we could be wrong to expect and continue into 2023. Also, we'd be really disappointed if the inflation we're seeing in the noncontracted areas were to carry to 2023. But even if it does, we've got multiple pieces that are moving, including a better pricing environment in the commercial book. So in no way, shape or form, are we saying that when you put all these together, that, that $8.50 or in that range is not something we're still confident in. Operator : Our next question is from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Ricky Goldwasser : Mark, wishing you best of luck in the future and really enjoyed working with you. So thank you for all the color always and your patience. In terms of the question, I just want to go back to the utilization environment. I mean you gave some color there but what we're hearing from the managed care companies is that the softness that they're seeing is the ER visits and inpatient admissions which shouldn't really have an impact on lab testing, right, if it's more outside the four walls of the hospitals. So can you maybe give us color on where are you seeing softness in utilization by geography and maybe by end market, i.e., what type of test? And how do you think about it, right, sort of 2.5 years into the pandemic? What's structural in the software utilization versus transition in your view? Mark Guinan : If I can just start quickly and then I'll pass it on to Jim. So Ricky, our source is not just seeing their medical loss ratios. But I'd point to two things in addition to what Jim talked about earlier which is our same-store sales as we call it. So one is we actually get data from the payers, okay, in total. So we know how many patient encounters they had for laboratory work. We know what our volume was and we can see that. The good news is we continue to gain share in those commercial books. However, we continue to see their total volume has been down, certainly in the second quarter. So it's payer data that's being provided by them to us that is the confidence to say, utilization has dipped in our space. The other one is I'd point to the  data which is based on billings of other independent labs. And if you look at that, that certainly suggests that utilization is down. So while you may be hearing its emergency room and inpatient, the data that we have and the best data we have also suggests that the market in which we operate is also depressed in the second quarter. Steve Rusckowski : And the second part is, remember COVID and we're 2 years into it. And every time COVID infections go up, our base business comes down some. And if you think about a physician and what they need to do to run their offices and as you know, a large portion of our business is through physicians in their offices, if there's call outs of their staff or if their patients are missing their appointments because they are now infected, it affects volume. So there's no question there's a correlation. And the good news for us is when that happens, our COVID business goes up, right? So Jim, why should... Jim Davis : Ricky, the last thing I'd say is we're not immune to hospital. The inpatient work -- remember, we get $1 billion a year in reference work. We have another $0.5 billion in PLS. So when inpatient and outpatient procedures are down, that certainly does affect our business on the health system, hospital side. On the physician office side, again, we closely look at a set of accounts spread across the country that we know are 100% loyal to Quest and we measure that we call it same-store sales. Again, our general health and wellness panels from a mix standpoint, were certainly lower than some of our chronic disease panels in the quarter. And then the last thing, geographic mix. We've talked and it hasn't changed dramatically that our book of business in New York City is down still low to mid-double digits. On the other hand, we see incredibly strong growth in the southern part of the country, in the southeast portion as well as the southwest and parts of the West. So if there's been a population migration out of New York City into the southeast, then we're certainly seeing some of that in our business. Operator : Our next question is from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Unidentified Analyst : This is John  on for Derik. And thanks for all the colors and thanks for being out the initiatives for renew  you were going to ask. But in addition to that and in addition to the price increases you're expecting and the plan to clamp down the employee turnover, how should we think about the incremental spend in 2023? Are you thinking about ramping these down to offset the inflationary pressure? And on PAMA, could you just remind us what your expectations are in '23, especially if nothing else happens on the legislative front? Jim Davis : Yes. So in terms of 2023, as Mark said, there's a lot of moving parts at this point. We're committed to investments in advanced diagnostics. We're committed to investments in our consumer direct consumer initiated testing business. Obviously, we can modulate those things if we see inflation getting worse. But at this point, we can't give you any further guidance than what we've given you around those. We're committed to advanced diagnostics, we're committed to our clinical -- our consumer direct -- consumer-initiated testing business. In terms... Steve Rusckowski : So just to add to that, because we've commented on this before, it's important to think about this as you think about '23. We started to make investments in 2020 to accelerate growth beyond what we had already invested in to accelerate growth. So think about '20 and '21 and now we're at to '22. And we obviously would not make investments unless we thought there would be a return. And so therefore, you have heard from us, you're seeing growth rates in advanced diagnostics that have come up, you've heard about us feeling good about our consumer-initiated testing, growing faster than we have seen growing in the past. And as you think about '23, you should think about the improvements you're going to see in those two businesses in relationship with that in what we invested. And so therefore, you should not think about this as headwinds because you really think about it as tailwinds because we will get a return on those investments we made over the last several years. Jim? Jim Davis : Yes. You asked about PAMA. And we've said that it's in our 2023 guidance outlook that we provided at this point and we've said it's about a $90 million headwind. Mark Guinan : So the only thing I would add is that, to Steve's point, when you ask our investments ramping down, I think there's two ways to think of investments. One is what's the P&L net impact and what is the level of spend. So we, at Investor Day, talked about growing our direct consumer business to $0.5 billion by 2025. That is still our intention. So as you can imagine, over the next several years, including 2023, we're expecting significant revenue growth. And in order to drive that revenue growth, we believe we need to spend more. However, the good news is that a lot of 2020 and 2021 was pre-revenue, pre-contribution margin. And as we go ahead, we would expect the net impact to actually be less and to be less of a headwind. So really, we're going to be investing less on the bottom line but spending more money to drive that accelerated growth. And then obviously, when we get to the scale and size that we're aspiring to, then we expect a healthy margin on that business. Operator : Our next question is from Matt Larew with William Blair. Unidentified Analyst : This is actually Madelin Malman  on for Matt Larew. Just going off of the previous question for your investments into the base business. I know previously, you've given a number around $160 million for this year. Do you anticipate it's still being about that? Has inflation driven that cost higher? Any color you have there? And then my other question, just speaking to your investments in advanced diagnostics. You mentioned that you are ahead of schedule for your anticipated 8% growth. Is that still the case? Mark Guinan : Sure. So let me take part of it, then I'm sure either Steve or Jim will jump in. So first of all, inflation really hasn't impacted the level of investment in a material way. And we're on track to spend about what we told you previously. As I referenced a minute ago, we haven't put our final plans together. But at this point, I would expect we're going to spend more next year. And we're going to spend more in marketing but we're going to spend a lot less and not much at all in the IT platform creation. So it's really going to be tied a very high variable cost and highly tied to revenue growth and we'll monitor, as Jim says and I'm sure Sam and Jim will be all over is to make sure we're making the progress and to make sure we don't get the spending ahead of ourselves. But if we do what we expect to do and we need to do to get to $0.5 billion by 2025, the spending will continue to go up. The only other dimension I want to mention here is because when we talk about investments in the base business, there's a little nuance here. Advanced diagnostics absolutely is the base business. But really this consumer business is new. So while a lot of the work we do is similar to what we've done historically in our base business, it's really a new business category or opportunity. And some of it may cannibalize what would have otherwise come through our traditional channels. But we do believe that a lot of it is actually incremental to the overall amount of volume that we perform. Jim or Steve, you want to... Steve Rusckowski : Yes. So as you know, we don't generally give you numbers every quarter about different segments of our business. In advanced diagnostics, we generally give you an annual update and we'll do that again. But we keep on indicating that we believe we are making progress of getting to a higher level of growth, as we indicated in our Investor Day in '21. We feel good about the progress. And we gave you a number in the beginning of the year. And the same is true about our consumer initiated testing. We periodically give you an update to show that we're making progress. So we're feeling good about the investments made, the returns we'll get. And again, you should see more returns in our '23 guidance or the expectations around that because we believe they still remain to be good opportunities. Jim Davis : And just to clarify, the target that we outlined at the Investor Day for the direct-to-consumer business was $250 million by 2025. Mark Guinan : My apologies. Operator : Our last question will come from Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan. Rachel Vatnsdal : So can you spend a minute talking about the monkeypox market? You flagged in your prepared remarks that Quest was 1 of the 5 labs that was selected by the CDC to expand testing capacity and you guys are going to have roughly 30,000 testing capacity for a week. So can you just walk us through the market opportunity there? And then is this contemplated in the guidance at all? Steve Rusckowski : Jim will handle that. Jim Davis : Yes. So at this point, it's hard to anticipate what the market opportunity has been or will be. I can tell you, our testing volumes at this point are modest. If we've done 500, 600 tests that would be on the high side. However, it is growing. And we do see growth. We've only had the test up and running for 2 weeks. And over that 2-week period, it's grown day by day. Right now, we're not yet approved for New York state. We expect that to happen within the next week or 2. I'm sure you're reading that, that is where the major outbreak is in New York City. So we would expect to participate in that market. But most of our volume at this point is coming actually off of the West Coast. And so we'll keep you updated on what we're seeing. Rachel Vatnsdal : Great. And then in line of the  environment, can you just walk us through some initial color on how you're considering use of cash between share repurchases, dividends and then M&A? Mark Guinan : Sure. So we're going to continue with what we've done. And what that is, is that between the dividend and we've already gotten there this year with the share repurchases to deliver a majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders. And with the $1.7 billion guidance and $400 million of capital, says at least $650 million between the dividend share repurchases and we already covered that. As we've also shared, we rather do M&A than share repurchases because we have some very rigorous financial parameters around the deals that we do. And so it's really going to be situational quarter-by-quarter. It may be different. Jim referenced that we have a deep pipeline and actually also commented that we have some negotiations that are well advanced. So I think we'd all be very disappointed if we didn't execute some deals before the end of the year. Don't know the exact timing of those. But certainly, as I said, I'd rather spend more on M&A and I know Steve would and you'll hear from Sam and Jim as they take over the reins, their view but I wouldn't expect it to materially change. So really no change to what we've done in the past. And at this point, no specific plans for cash deployment because we're really -- it's really dependent on that progression of the M&A. Steve Rusckowski : Okay. So thank you, everyone. And again, thank you, Mark, for your time here at Quest. We're going to miss you and we wish you well. So thanks, everyone, for joining the call. We appreciate all your questions and support and we'll see you in our travels. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you for participating in the Quest Diagnostics second quarter 2022 conference call.

Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. Now I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead, please. Shawn Bevec : Thank you and good morning. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m joined by Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; Jim Davis, CEO elect; and Sam Samad, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and then we will discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that may affect Quest Diagnostics\u00e2\u0080\u0099 future results include but are not limited to, those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. The company continues to believe that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on future operating results, cash flows and/or its financial condition will be primarily driven by the pandemic severity and duration, healthcare insurer, government and client payer reimbursement for COVID-19 molecular test, the pandemic impact on the U.S. health care system and the U.S. economy; and the timing, scope and effectiveness of federal, state and local governmental responses to the pandemic, including the impact of vaccination efforts which are drivers beyond the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s knowledge and control. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS. Any references to base business, testing revenues or volumes refer to the performance of our business excluding COVID-19 testing. Growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections, including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings growth are compound annual growth rates. Finally, revenue growth rates from acquisitions will be measured against our base business. Now, here is Steve Rusckowski. Steve Rusckowski : Thanks, Shawn and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. While we had a strong third quarter, we drove 5% growth in the base business despite the impact of Hurricane Ian and we delivered strong earnings despite inflationary pressures and investments in growth areas. Based on our performance, we have raised our outlook for the remainder of 2022. We also made very good progress on our leadership transition, adding management depth and expertise to help us grow in important areas. As you know, Jim will assume the responsibilities of CEO and President on November 1, and I will remain as Executive Chairman. Before I turn it over to Jim, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to say a few words about savings access to Laboratory Services Act Salsa. If enacted Salsa would fix PAMA and put the Medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule back on a sustainable path. Based on the efforts of our trade Association, support for Salsa has broadened and continues to strengthen. As you know, we are currently planning for a Medicare fee schedule reduction under PAMA of $80 million to $90 million in 2023 if Congress does not intervene again this year. However, the work we are doing is aimed at reducing or postponing that burden and unfortunately, Congress has already acted three times to stop further cuts from going into place. It is therefore very important that we continue to build support for the enactment of Salsa when Congress returns to Washington after the election. As I transition to the Executive Chairman, will remain actively engaged on this issue, working with ACLA and other stakeholders. Now I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to turn it over to Jim Davis. Jim Davis : Thanks, Steve. On behalf of our 50,000 Quest colleagues, I would like to thank you for your leadership of Quest Diagnostics over the last 10 years. You turned around a company that was struggling and build shareholder value and transformed Quest into a trusted healthcare partner with a strong foundation for future growth. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m personally grateful for all the help and guidance and friendship that you shared during the transition. Thanks, Steve. Turning to our results. Our base business grew year-over-year in the third quarter with performance rebounding in August and September from the softer volume trends that we saw earlier in the year. In fact, before Hurricane Ian hit in September, we were seeing some of the highest base testing volumes we have ever experienced. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to thank our employees for their incredible efforts to restore our labs and PSCs for our patients and customers in the wake of Hurricane Ian while also enduring personal loss of their homes and belongings. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m also grateful to our employees outside of the impacted areas, who stepped up to provide financial support to our colleagues in need. As many of you are aware of Florida is an important state for us. During the quarter, we grew the base business revenues and continue to invest in advanced diagnostics and consumer initiated testing. To help offset inflationary pressures we have continued to pursue our operational excellence strategy and have been closely managing our cost structure through our invigorate initiatives. In the third quarter, total revenues were 2.5 billion. Earnings per share were $2.17 on a reported basis and $2.36 on an adjusted basis. Cash provided by operations was $502 million. COVID-19 testing revenues were 316 million in the third quarter down 55% from 2021 and down 11% from the previous quarter. After plateauing in June and July, our COVID-19 molecular testing volumes steadily declined. We expect COVID-19 molecular volumes to average 10,000 to 15,000 per day in the fourth quarter. In the third quarter, we continued to make progress executing our two point strategy to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence. Here are some highlights from the quarter. M&A continues to be a driver of growth. We recently announced an outreach lab purchase from Summa Health, a large integrated healthcare delivery system in Ohio. While this is a small acquisition, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a positive indicator. We are seeing that hospital systems are more open to discussions and before the pandemic. Many large and small health systems face substantial financial and labor pressures that make our range of services very attractive. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re pleased with the activity in our M&A pipeline and hope to share additional news with you later this year. We also announced a professional lab services relationship with Lee Health, Southwest Florida\u00e2\u0080\u0099s primary community owned health system to provide supply chain expertise for five hospitals owned by Lee health and selected outpatient centers. We will also continue to perform reference testing for Lee Health. Our implementation plans have been slightly delayed by Hurricane Ian, though we expect this relationship will have a positive impact on revenue growth in 2023.  Turning now to health plans. Both volumes and revenues continue to grow faster than our overall base business in the quarter. Value based care relationships continue to gain traction. Not only does this yield benefit for health plans in their members, but also it enables us to gain share. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve begun to renew some of our value based contracts with national health plans while continuing to engage and expand our value based footprint with other plans. Value based relationships are appealing to health plans because it helps them reduce the overall cost of care, provides insights to better health outcomes and provides an exceptional value to members. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re on track to meet our goal of realizing 50% of our health plan revenues from value based relationships by the end of next year. Also, as we continue to extend and renegotiate health plan agreements, we see increased volumes and pricing from these contracts. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing a more favorable pricing environment. And over the last two years the majority of our renewals have included stable to positive reimbursement. In advanced diagnostics we saw growth from prenatal genetics and genomic sequencing services in the third quarter. We continued to make investments to strengthen our capabilities to accelerate growth in oncology and hematology, hereditary genetics, genomic sequencing services and pharma services. Just last week, we announced the addition of Mark Gardner, our Senior Vice President of molecular genomics and oncology. In this new position Mark, an established leader in molecular genomics next generation sequencing and oncology diagnostics, is responsible for driving growth and expanding our offerings in these areas. The investments we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re making in consumer initiated testing enabled us to recently launch a new e-commerce platform. The new site is more powerful and consumer friendly with a compelling user experience and a number of enhancements. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re encouraged by the early success of the site in the first few weeks of its launch, and we expect to make further progress in the fourth quarter ending in 2023 toward our goal of $250 million of annual consumer initiated testing revenues by 2025. We also launched a new ad campaign to drive broader awareness of our consumer initiated testing offerings which cover everything from women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health tests to allergy testing, and sexually transmitted infections. Check out the new site at Questhealth.com and look for the new ads. The second part of our two points strategy is to drive operational excellence. We remain focused on improving our operational quality, service and cost, thereby driving productivity gains and improving the customer experience. Here are a few examples. As COVID-19 volumes have declined, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve begun to repurpose some of our COVID-19 testing platforms to enhance our quality and reduce costs. Today, 75% of our patients are arriving at PSC with an appointment compared to less than 25% just three years ago. This increased number of appointments allows us to flex our workforce to meet demand within a particular geography, which enables us to serve our patients faster. For patients who walk into a patient service center our new schedule a check in program sets expectations in the waiting room and balances the load for our phlebotomist. Walk-ins now self register when they arrive and learn how long they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need to wait. Our average wait time is approximately five minutes, which is roughly half the level since 2019. Finally, we continue to drive the use of automation and artificial intelligence to drive productivity gains to help offset inflationary pressures. Now I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll turn it over to Sam who will provide more details on a performance and share more insights on our updated guidance for the remainder of 2022. Sam Samad : Thanks, Jim. In the third quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.5 billion down 10.4% versus the prior year. Base business revenues grew 5.1% to $2.17 billion, while COVID-19 testing revenues declined 55% to $316 million. Revenues for diagnostic information services declined 10.5% compared to the prior year. The decline reflected lower revenue from COVID-19 testing services versus the third quarter of 2021 partially offset by solid growth in our base testing revenue despite the impact of Hurricane Ian at the end of the quarter. Total volume measured by the number of requisitions declined 6.2% versus the prior year. Acquisitions contributed 20 basis points to the total volume. Total and organic base testing volumes increased 1.6% and 1.4% respectively versus the prior year. The performance of our base business strengthened beginning in late July as COVID-19 cases and the positivity rates declined throughout August and September. The impact of Hurricane Ian represented a headwind of approximately 30 basis points to volume growth in the quarter. COVID-19 testing volumes continued to decline during the third quarter. We resulted approximately 3.1 million molecular tests down approximately 4 million tests and 0.4 million tests versus the prior year and second quarter respectively. Our COVID-19 molecular volumes have averaged roughly 17,000 tests per day so far in October. Revenue for requisition declined 5.1% versus the prior year driven primarily by lower COVID-19 molecular volume. Base business revenue per rec was up 3.3%. The more favorable pricing environment remained consistent with our expectations with unit price reimbursement pressure of less than 50 basis points in the quarter. Reported operating income in the third quarter was $392 million or 15.8% of revenues compared to $652 million or 23.5% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $423 million or 17% of revenues compared to $694 million or 25% of revenues last year. The year-over-year decline and adjusted operating income is primarily related to lower COVID-19 testing volume and investments to accelerate growth in our base business. We were also impacted by a higher portion of COVID-19 molecular testing volume from non-traditional retail channels, which carry additional expenses. Reported EPS was $2.17 in the quarter compared to $4.02 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $2.36 compared to $3.96 last year. The impact of Hurricane Ian reduced adjusted EPS by approximately $0.05 in the third quarter. Year-to-date, cash provided by operations was $1.38 billion in 2022, versus $1.75 billion in the prior year period. Turning to our updated guidance. Revenues are now expected to be between $9.72 billion and $9.86 billion. Base business revenues are expected to be between $8.38 billion and $8.45 billion. COVID-19 testing revenues are expected to be between $1.34 billion and $1.41 billion. Reported EPS expected to be in a range of $8.52 to $8.72 and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $9.75 to $9.95. Cash provided by operations is expected to be at least $1.7 billion and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million. And when you think about our updated guidance, please consider the following. We are assuming COVID-19 molecular volumes to average roughly 10,000 to 15,000 tests per day in the fourth quarter. We also believe this is a reasonable assumption for run rate COVID-19 molecular testing volumes heading into 2023. Last week, the public health emergency was extended another 90 days through mid January. We therefore assume average reimbursement for COVID-19 molecular testing to hold relatively steady through the end of this year. We expect reimbursements to decline when the PHG expires, which we currently assume will happen in January. Given the timing of hurricane Ian the impact on our business has continued in the first couple of weeks of the fourth quarter. As a reminder, we are making investments this year to accelerate growth. We spent approximately $110 million through the third quarter and we expect to invest more than $50 million in the fourth quarter primarily to support marketing and promotion of our new consumer initiated testing platform. Finally, before getting to your questions, I wanted to say a few words about 2023. I know there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of focus on EPS expectations for 2023. As you might expect, we aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t prepared to provide detailed 2023 guidance today. There are obviously a number of assumptions and dynamics to consider but I see nothing that would prevent us from meeting current consensus estimates for next year within a reasonable range of outcomes. We will continue to review our plans and assumptions and provide our full 2023 guidance in early February. I will now turn it back to Steve. Steve Rusckowski : Thanks, Sam. Well to summarize, we accelerated growth in the base business year-over-year. We grew our base business revenue while continue to make investments which position us well for the future. And we have raised our full year guidance based on our performance in the quarter and our expectations for the remainder of 2022.As Jim mentioned earlier, this will be my last earnings call as CEO and President and I will remain as Executive Chairman. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to thank all of you on this call for your interest in the company. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve enjoyed our many conversations over the last 10 years and I thank you for your time and commitment to understand our business. Finally, to the 50,000 Colleagues of Quest Diagnostics, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been the honor of my lifetime to serve as your CEO. Together, we have empowered better health with our insights, grown the business and provide a critical testing capacity through one of the most challenging healthcare crisis in our history. I will always be grateful what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done to serve our customers. Thank you. Now we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be happy to take any of your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We will now open it up to questions.  The first question in the queue is from Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities. Your line is now open. Ann if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re there, please check your mute button. Ann Hynes : Okay. Sorry about that. Okay, Steve, I just want to say congratulate -- and it has been a pleasure working with you all these years. Steve Rusckowski : Thanks Ann. Ann Hynes : So my first question thanks for the color on 2023. Obviously, it was on top of investor minds, but just for modeling purposes. Do you just maybe tell us what has changed directionally on the positive side and the negative side since you first provided that in 2019 and maybe within that the DTC program. I know it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a headwind to earnings this year. Do we expect you to become profitable in 2003? And maybe talk about the profitability profile in 2024? That would be great. Thanks. Jim Davis : Yes, thanks and good morning. So let me start and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have Sam fill in some color here. So but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of changes since 2019. And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just talk about a few tailwinds and headwinds. from a tailwind standpoint reimbursement has never been better. We were down approximately 50 basis points year-to-date. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a much better environment without PAMA in 2019 was where we were historically losing over 100 basis points. And then PAMA was on top of that. So we feel much better about price going into 2023. Our base volumes are back above 2019 levels. In fact, it points during the quarter. In September, we exceeded the high point February, January of 2020. So feel good about that. You mentioned investments in CIT. Yes, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be a tailwind going into 2023. We feel good about that. And then as you know, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made investments in the business, investing in our advanced diagnostics portfolio, and we expect to get above normal growth rates out of that side of our portfolio. Now we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re dealing with some headwinds, as well as you know. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve built into our plan, a third round of PAMA cuts $80 million to $90 million next year COVID, which we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t obviously have in 2019. We expect going into next year there. Early part of next year, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be at the 10 to 15 point. And we have some inflation that we certainly didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see in 2019 that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s running through our business. We estimated $0.05 to $0.08 a quarter and we expect that inflation to continue into the early part of next year. Sam, any other caller? Sam Samad : Yes, I think you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve captured it. Well, Jim. I mean, again, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re, going to give guidance in February, we wanted to just capture some of these maybe changed assumptions, or at least varying assumptions. But listen, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen so far that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen so far, that prevents us from meeting the current consensus estimates again, within a reasonable range of outcomes. In terms of share repurchases, we have made share repurchases this year 950 million throughout the first three quarters of the year, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll provide a lift as well, in terms of earnings next year. Steve Rusckowski : Yes let me just make another comment about some of the investments we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made, because I think there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a little bit of a misunderstanding about that adding to our cost, and not helping us as we get into \u00e2\u0080\u009823 and \u00e2\u0080\u009824. And Ann you alluded to that. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve mentioned that, this year, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be investing about 160 million. And as you recall, in 2021, we started the investments. We took some of the proceeds from COVID and made roughly a quarter of a billion dollars worth of investments in two businesses. One advanced diagnostics and as Jim said, we probably four we have already started to see have faster growth rates because of those investments. And the second is our consumer initiated testing. And we will only make investments as you would expect if we expect to get a return. And so what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to see in 2023, is particularly around CIT are starting to get a return for that investment for CIT. And even though we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t report the financials, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see less of a drain on our earnings in 2023 because of the growth rate we will get from CIT and that will be a tailwind for \u00e2\u0080\u009823. And you asked about 2024, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going to give exact details, because we will throttle that investment at that a good part of the how fast the market grows, and where we have some capacity to accelerate growth. And so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll hold back on give you an exact number about profitability, but we are going to get to return from that $250 million. And let me just close by saying that $250 million, some of it is permanent, because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re building these two businesses, advanced diagnostics, and CIT but some of it was temporal. And so when you think about modeling for through 23, and you look at what you might expect for expenses from us for 2022. And these are total expenses R&D and SG&A what we have modeled and working on is actually expenses in \u00e2\u0080\u009823 coming down versus 2022. So that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a change because some of these investments were temporal. So I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just leave it there. Thank you. Ann Hynes : Thanks. Operator : Next question is from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Your line is now open. Kevin Caliendo : Thanks, actually want to expand on Steve\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comment right there because thinking through this, thinking through the guidance and getting to the numbers, versus sort of what the run rate is coming out, there has to be a pretty meaningful amount of expenses coming out. So of the 160, should we be thinking about that, as is like, half of that goes away to get to sort of, including PAMA we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking $80 million to $100 million of expenses that would need to come down unless you think volumes are really accelerate and the incremental margins on us. So can you maybe give us a little bit more on the expense side? And how to think about modeling that? Is it just like percentage of that 160 that comes out? Sam Samad : Yes. So Kevin, as you think about next year, I mean, yes, we are taking expenses down. So there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be some reductions as we look at expenses given the macro environment that we are in. I would not assume right now, strategic investments necessarily coming down. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not an assumption that I would make. And we also have our invigorate program where we expect up productivity in the business and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an ongoing program that we do, that we have every year. But we are in a way reinvigorating and invigorate to have further productivity from the business. So I think as you look at margins, you have to consider those things. We have maybe a consistent inflationary environment is the assumption wages increasing by salaries, wages and benefits increasing by 3% to 4%. But we are taking expenses down next year and other areas. And we are focusing on invigorator. Kevin Caliendo : Maybe I can ask it a little bit different way. Your base margins. I know you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think about base margins versus COVID margins. But we all try to model it that way. If we were to think about it, would you then think that base margins could look or be better than what they were in a pre-COVID setting? Steve Rusckowski : So that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s we should talk about kind of the assumptions that we have right now for 2022. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going to comment right now on base margins versus total COVID margins. But I think the way to think about it is the pricing environment is improving. So we are seeing a less of an impact in terms of price reductions. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the PAMA impact for next year. But we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing historically low pricing pressure on our business, which as we said in the quarter was 60 basis points. So that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an improvement. I talked about some of the cost reductions that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to make. And I talked about the invigorate productivity savings that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to make. So we are going to definitely see some productivity improvements in the business but I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give a specific base margin number there. Kevin Caliendo : I tried. Thanks so much, guys. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really helpful. Operator : Next question is from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Your line is now open. Jack Meehan : Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to ask about utilization. So there was a lot of worry heading into the quarter because of -- your base growth actually accelerated to 5%. So I am just curious what you think is going on here driving the relative out-performance versus what it looks like the market might be doing? Steve Rusckowski : Yes. So thank Jack. As we mentioned in the opening comments, our volumes improved every month through the third quarter. So July was weak, August was better. And September, even with the hurricane impact was obviously much better than the average that we reported. In addition we reported 5.1% revenue growth in the quarter on the bass business. And a chunk of that did come from revenue per rack. Despite a 50 basis point headwind on price, our clinical mix and business mix improved in the quarter, which contributed to that strong base performance. And so we were happy with the utilization levels. Physician offices appeared to be strong and even our health system segment, which is a combination of our reference testing in PLS was also strong in the quarter. Jack Meehan : Maybe just trying to dig in a little bit more. I think everyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trying to understand the market growth and share dynamics, are you, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your dialogue, like with hospitals now around either outreach sales or more kind of reference work getting sent out? Or have you heard more about labor being an issue? Just any thoughts on that would be great. Steve Rusckowski : Sure, Jack. So I can tell you that our opportunities with health systems has never been stronger on multiple fronts. Now in the quarter, we announced the Summa health outreach acquisition. Summa as the health system in Akron, Ohio. We announced a PLS new PLS relationship with Lee Health in Florida. And the funnel of opportunities continues to grow. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a day that goes by that we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t read in one of the journals about health systems reporting, margin pressures and exacerbated by some of the pressures they have with wages, particularly on the nursing side. So it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very opportunistic us to go into health systems and explain to them how we can help them reduce their lifespan by upwards of 10% to 15% to 18%. And so, or monetize their outreach book of business to provide some cash infusion to them. So it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an opportunistic time for us. Operator : Next question is from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Erin Wright : Hi, could you give us an update on your relationships in negotiations with the commercial payers and offsets in terms of pricing dynamics there? And where are we at in terms of those preferred relationships helping to steer volume? And do initiatives such as United laboratory benefit management that was more recent, does that have any impact on your business at all? I believe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s targeting some over testing on the esoteric side. Thanks. Steve Rusckowski : Yes. So thank you, Aaron. So our relationships with commercial payers, if you want to measure the output of the relationship, again, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll turn to the pricing environment. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s never been better. We are only down 50 basis points in the quarter and you go back to 2018, 2019, we were losing 100 basis points. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also said that the majority of the negotiations we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had with payers over the last two years have resulted in either flat to positive price increases and so we consider that a victory. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also said that the number of value based relationships that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re entering into meaning that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opportunities for us to create value for them and earn value back for us by working very closely with the likes of United Healthcare and we work together as teams and we target physicians that are using out of network labs. We target physicians that are using health, expensive health system labs, and collectively our teams work this day in and day out and yes, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been able to move Rex from high price institutions to better quality lower price labs like Quest Diagnostics. Jim Davis : Yes to comments on Jack\u00e2\u0080\u0099s question and Erin first of all, or plan is to gain share. And so one element of gain share is that relationships without plans and we do believe we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re making progress to that progress will continue as we pick up more she are particularly with the Nationals. Just want to make sure we remind you that 50 basis points is not exclusive to commercial payer pricing, but all pricing. So commercial payer pricings within it and that is improved to Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comment vastly versus where we were. But we have price pressure with client relationships, with physicians we have price concessions with hospital reference work. So there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s other price concessions in that number. But on the commercial payer side, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s less than 50 basis points that much improved of where it was years ago. Operator : Next question is from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Your line is open. Brian Tanquilut : Hey, good morning, guys. Congrats on the quarter. So as I think about just the core testing, obviously COVID is declining here. How should you be thinking about your outlook here for 2023 especially given the economic backdrop that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing and the broader inflation trends that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing? And how that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impacting the consumer, essentially, the patient? Steve Rusckowski : Yes. So thanks, Brian, for the question. The way I would think about it is again, COVID, continues to come down. Although we may be at an inflection point here on COVID. Too early to tell, but obviously, these two new variants, the BQ1 and BQ 1.1 are growing in terms of concern, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s now 11%, 12%, of all new cases, higher in the east, reported to be over 20% in the New York City area. But as of now, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re thinking 10,000 to 15,000 a day, as we go into next year. We reported that our base business, the volumes recovered, as we move through the third quarter, we expect that trend to continue. And but remember, physicians are only part of it. Again, we feel great about opportunities to help our health system partners whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s additional reference testing, or PLS and then we feel great about our acquisition funnel and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking at several outreach opportunities. We announced one that closed but stay tuned. There should be some more announcements as we get into the early part of next year. Jim Davis : Just to remind you all that there is a correlation between COVID volumes that are based business. And so as COVID improves, we believe that could help our base business. And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve clearly started to see that in Q3 and to some extent, as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve talked before, we have somewhat of a natural hedge, because of COVID goes up and base softens. We have seen that in the past. And therefore the improving COVID situation should be a tailwind on base growth going forward. And as we said before, most of our major markets have recovered, we still have not seen full recovery in New York City. And we still believe that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll gradually step by step improve over the next couple of years. And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go back to where we were in 2019. So that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only major metropolitan area that we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen full recovery. So from an overall perspective, the COVID direction should be favorable to base. Operator : Next question is from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. A.J. Rice: Looking to working together. Maybe just to talk a little bit about capital deployment. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about obviously, you did a lot on the share repurchase here today, as you mentioned. So that continues to be part of the store. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got these hospital opportunities. There are other M&A potentially talking deals out there. And then some of the investments consumer direct and so forth. Does that, how do you see capital priorities and capital deployment as we exited this year and think about the next year or two? Sam Samad : Yes, thanks, A.J. for the question. This is Sam. So as you think about our position, right now we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve generated 1.38 billion of operating cash flow through three quarters of the year. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re sitting on a very healthy amount of cash of 700 million. When you think about our capital deployment philosophy, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very consistent. We said that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to return the majority of our free cash flow back to shareholders. And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to focus on making sure that obviously, we invest in the business that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, we talked about the strategic investments. This year, we expect to make 160 million of strategic we have net of the 400 million of capital, whatever free cash flow that we have, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to return back to shareholders in the form of dividends, in the form of share repurchases and M&A. Now, to the extent that I think we have a robust pipeline of M&A transactions and opportunities, as Jim mentioned, to the extent that we, we are going to be very disciplined about M&A though, I mean, to the extent that we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a creative deals that we believe really add strategic value to us and produce the meet the ROIC threshold that we have in our accretive then we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to return back that cash in terms of share repurchases. Operator : Next question is from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Pito Chickering : Hey, good morning, guys. And Steve, thanks for all your help, over the years different questions for the fourth quarter guidance of $1.91 analyzes to 764. And as the good guys, the improved base pricing business as well as strong COVID pricing. So if we put of PAMA in that one, that would be the launch pad in 2023. Is 713, which seems like a pretty big gap versus 850 consensus numbers. So can you give us some more color on how to bridge the gap between 713 and 850 between revenue growth and cost cutting? Steve Rusckowski : Yes. Thanks, Pete. Let me start and then I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have Sam, pipe in here. So first our long term guidance on the growth rate of the company remains. We expect to grow our top line on the base business 4% to 5%. And we expect to get nice margin accretion off of that 4% to 5%. So we still feel good about that 4% to 5%. Next year, obviously, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said to percentage, roughly two percentage points of that can come from acquisition. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got a great list, a good funnel of both tuck ins from outreach, as well as a few what I would call deals that enhance our capabilities, fill in some gaps in our portfolio. So feel good about that. We also feel good about our invigorate program and continuing to work that, as Sam said, reinvigorating our invigorate program to offset some of the margin pressures that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen from inflation. So we feel good about. We feel good about the investments that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re making in ADX and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said that, consumer initiated testing next year should be a tailwind to us. And then finally as Sam and Steve said, we are fine tuning the cost structure, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make the necessary rebalances in the cost structure to deliver what we need to deliver next year. So we feel good about that. Jim Davis : Yes maybe I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll add a couple of comments to Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. So just we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going to give you obviously guidance right now, but just maybe directionally give you some things also to build into, or to think about as you build your model for next year. Expense reductions is an important one, Jim mentioned that. The fact that CIT investments will drive growth in that consumer segment. And so they will be less dilutive, as you look at next year versus this year. The fact that when you think about pricing it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a definitely improving environment for us as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said, 50 basis points in Q3. So that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an additional number that maybe some of you use the 1% pricing negative pricing impact is no longer the case in terms of what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing, because of all the things that we talked about around value based contracts with the health plans. And then when you think about COVID I mean, COVID is obviously the assumption going into 2023 is that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 10,000 to 15,000. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s variability around that. But that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s our assumption right now. And the 10,000 to 15,000 is so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coming down. COVID testing is coming down, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an improvement in the base business as a result of that. But also the fact that with the PHE ending, at least our assumption is that it ends in January, even though that average reimburse price comes down, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a straight impact the margin because we have cost that we incur in the non traditional retail channels right now that will no longer, that we will no longer incur after the end of the PHE emergency. So you can also take you know, the margin on COVID as being completely impacted by that price reimbursed or by that reimbursement decrease. Steve Rusckowski : Pito remember that our base business is growing in \u00e2\u0080\u009823. Guys when you say think about modeling it off the fourth quarter remember the base will grow. Okay. And then secondly, just to underscore Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comments is this company and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue under Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and Sam\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leadership has a long track record of productivity improvements. And so Jim, in his prepared remarks talked about our operational excellence program. We have a specific program called Invigorate. And that Invigorate program is to drive 3% productivity. So when you think about 2023, and you think about potentially getting a PAMA cut you need to think about the expense reduction, base growth, as well as Invigorate offsetting some of the inflationary pressure, as well as potentially. And I can tell you we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve highlighted this before, in our investor presentations, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot more room for us to drive productivity, particularly around automation, and digitalization going forward, and Jim will be driving that as he leaves the company. Operator : Next question is from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Your line is now open. Patrick Donnelly : Hey, guys, thank you for taking the questions. Maybe one, on a similar vein, at least on the cost side, just in terms of some of the labor retention, labor inflation that you guys have seen us talk about against where we are in that process? And then secondarily, kind of on the back of that the supply chain as well, I know, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a bit of a kind of issues pop up and you guys handle them well. Has that plateaued getting better? Maybe just a little bit of color, that would be helpful. Steve Rusckowski : Yes, so thanks, Patrick. So first, on the labor inflation. So what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing this year is between 3% and 4%, and our plan next year is to have a merit increase of roughly 3%, across the company. But we would expect to have to make some other equity adjustments along the way. So I think from a planning modeling standpoint, that 3% to 4% range still feels good from a labor utilization. But I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell you on our employee retention and attrition is that it has stabilized here in the third quarter, albeit, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stabilized at a higher level than we would like, which obviously affects productivity. So we continue to work really hard on making classes the employer of choice, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just about wages, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of other things, as you can imagine that go into that. In terms of inflation on the supplies and materials front we purchase north of $2 billion worth of what we call pre analytical and analytical supplies. And on that roughly $2 billion, about 80% of it is locked up in terms of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s under contract. And most of those contracts that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve entered into in previous years, actually do not contain price indexes or price going up. If anything through the contract period, sometimes prices improve. So, we feel good about that, but 20% of roughly 2 billion is a big number that is not completely locked up. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where we do see some inflationary pressures. In addition to the pre-analytical and analytical supplies we have a lot of, we have roughly $88 million, $900 million of other spend, that is logistics, professional services, janitorial services. Travel living expenses. So, all of that is really not under contract. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where we see the majority of inflation in our business today. We will it get better next year, will it get worse next year. Hard to predict. But everything that the Fed is doing, will hopefully slow those inflationary pressures that we are seeing. But again we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re committed, and we work real hard for our Invigorate program to offset as much of this as we possibly can. Operator : Next question is from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning, Steve. Thanks for all your time and patience with me, appreciate it over the years. I guess a couple of questions. A lot of might have been answered already. But are you expecting any sort of relief from you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d expect to solve for the past and sort of like your update in PAMA and then the follow up on that, or another one you know, as we sort of head into a recession and inflation picks up, I mean, are you seeing any increase in debt from your customers. Any concerns on people opting not to pay bills as they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re sort of struggling right now. Thanks. Steve Rusckowski : So let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s start with the Salsa PAMA comment. So as we said, for many years now, you should plan on PAMA caught in 2023. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what we assumed. And until we have news that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s better than that, we should assume that. Number two is, in my prepared remarks to talk about the effort on Salsa. What I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll add to those comment is the support congressional support. And this is on both sides of the aisle. And both in the House and in the Senate is very strong. So there is alignment that we need to have a permanent fix to the implementation of PAMA. But as you can imagine Washington is busy. There is a lot of topics on the table. And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to find a vehicle that we can attach it to. And I would expect, if we were successful with Salsa, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be late in this year, that will know that. And also, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to cost money. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in the process of getting a score from CBO. And there needs to be a pay for so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re working through that. But I can tell you the alignment and the support of my colleagues throughout this industry has never been stronger. And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve going doing grassroots efforts to send letters into Washington. So really a full court press to get set Salsa over the goal line. Now, if we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, or if we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not successful with Salsa the question is, can we get another year of relief. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got that in the past. Again, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to indicate that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to get that again. But if we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get Salsa there, obviously will be a pivot to ask for another year of relief. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll push on that. But again, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not planning that during our 2023 planning. Jim Davis : Yes. This is very good question on are we seeing an uptick in patient concession rate or patients unless -- no we are not seeing any impact as of yet on that. In fact, our patient concessions have actually improved rate and has actually improved year-over-year and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to build into next year. We do a lot of things to work this and we work real hard. We have what we call real time adjudication. So, patient comes into our PSE, we take the requisition and we can literally adjudicate that claim x-the payment coming to us. So we know real time what tests on that requisition are going to be approved or denied, and we know what the patient balance is. And then we provide multiple ways for that patient to pay the bill or give us a form of payment so that when the claim is adjudicated, we know how to charge the patient. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re working on things to actually move that whole process upstream. So when the patient makes an appointment, and that requisition is already been delivered to us, because physician has sent it to us electronically, we can do that pre-adjudication, if you will, as the patient is making an appointment online. So even before they come into the PSC we can pre-adjudicate that claim. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to build the capability to do that. And so it improves our PSE productivity as well as gives the patient knowledge of what they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to be billed before they walk into the PSE. So lots of things we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing to make it easier to pay to inform the patient. And all of those things help our patient concession rate. Operator : And the last question in the queue is from . Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks very much. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to come back to a topic that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been hit a few times but maybe ask a different way. The base revenue per requisition very, very strong here. I know we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard a lot of comments on pricing improving or really being less bad down 50 bibs, which would I think imply that your mix component and other components must have been something more like 4% growth on a per test basis. So I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m curious if you can quantify for us or give us some qualitative color on what type of mix improvements you saw? What categories of testing, were you seeing the number of tests per requisition go up this quarter more than normal? Was there a changing impact from PLS volumes and the numbers this quarter? Or were there some nuances with value based contracts that maybe aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fully understood by the street that could have been driving some of this upside mixed driven revenue? I know I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m throwing a lot at you, but it feels like that was a pretty big number. So want to dig into it. Jim Davis : Yes. So. Thanks Eric. So as you know, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of things that go into the calculation. So let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s take price per test out, because we already said that was down about 50 basis points. So your math is directionally correct. All of the things that were up about 3.8% in the quarter. there is really three very different types of mix that enter into that. There is clinical mix, business mix and payer mix. And from let me just start with clinical mix. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just tell you that the investments we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re making in advanced diagnostics are paying off. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting a higher mix of molecular and other genetic and advanced based tasks. Hematology was good. Caner testing really good in the quarter. From a business mix standpoint there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of things there. First, from a commercial payer standpoint, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a mix of cap and fee for service, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just tell you in the quarter fee per service was better and cap was lost. And if cap was less than, obviously, you got to fix payments. So that certainly helped us. Our health systems business was actually just a pure reference was good in the quarter and that tends to mix up our rep per and then finally there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s payer mix issues. What portion is coming from commercial? What portion is coming from Medicare? What portion is coming from Medicaid? And that was favorable in the quarter. And then finally, CIT, our consumer initiated testing business has a higher revenue per rack. The pricing is better in that market, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting some left from our CIT business. So a lot of factors go into it. But that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of the summary of it. Steve Rusckowski : Okay, I think that was the last question. I again, thank you for your support over the years, we added up the math and this is my 42nd call. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a pleasure working with all of you. Thank you for all your support. And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to be seeing me around in our travels. So thank you and have a great day.

The entire contents of the call, including the presentation and question and answer session that will follow are copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics with all rights reserved. Any redistribution of retransmission of the rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. Now I\u2019d like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President, Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Please go ahead. Shawn Bevec : Thank you and good morning. I\u2019m joined by Jim Davis, our Chief Executive Officer and President, and Sam Samad, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and will discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, that may affect Quest Diagnostics\u2019 future results include but are not limited to those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.  For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS, and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS. Any references to base business, testing, revenues or volumes refer to the performance of our business excluding COVID-19 testing. Growth rates associated with our long term outlook projections, including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth, and adjusted earnings growth are compound annual growth rates. Finally, revenue growth rates from acquisitions will be measured against our base business. Now here is Jim Davis. Jim Davis : Thanks Shawn, and good morning everyone. Quest had a strong year in 2022 with base business revenues growing more than 6% in the fourth quarter and 5% for the full year. As we expected COVID-19 testing revenues declined but still exceeded $1.4 billion in 2022. Our strong performance over the last several years would not have been possible without the commitment and compassion of our nearly 50,000 colleagues who rose to the challenge of COVID-19 while growing our base business. I am incredibly proud of how this team has worked together during an unprecedented period in the lab industry to deliver insights to help create a healthier world. This morning, I\u2019ll discuss our performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2022, then Sam will provide more detail on our financial results and discuss our 2023 guidance. In the fourth quarter, total revenues were $2.3 billion, earnings per share were $0.87 on a reported basis and $1.98 on an adjusted basis, cash from operations was $334 million. For the full year 2022, total revenues were $9.9 billion, including more than $8.4 billion in base business revenue. Earnings per share were $7.97 on a reported basis and $9.95 on an adjusted basis. Cash from operations was $1.7 billion. As you saw this morning, we increased our quarterly dividend approximately 8% to $0.71 per share and increased our share repurchase authorization by $1 billion.  Before discussing additional highlights for 2022, I\u2019d like to share some recent positive regulatory updates. First, Congress delayed Medicare reimbursement cuts under PAMA that were scheduled to take place in 2023, which would have impacted our revenue between approximately $80 million and $85 million. While we are pleased with the delay, we continue to work closely with our trade association to seek a permanent fix to PAMA. Second, CMS increased Medicare reimbursement for specimen collection fees for the first time in nearly 40 years. This could provide Quest with a benefit of approximately $35 million to $40 million this year. Regarding COVID-19 testing revenues, while we did see a steady ramp upward in COVID-19 volumes throughout Q4, our volumes have steadily declined since late December. We expect our COVID-19 revenues to be significantly lower in 2023 compared to 2022. We have lowered our prior COVID-19 volume expectations in 2023 from 10,000 to 15,000 molecular tests per day to 5,000 to 10,000 tests per day. In addition, we continue to negotiate coverage and reimbursement policies with commercial payors following the end of the PHE in May. I will now share some recent highlights in how we are growing this business. In the fourth quarter, we completed our acquisition of the outreach laboratory services business of Suma Health, a large integrated health system serving communities in northeastern Ohio. We also entered into an agreement to acquire select assets of Northern Light Health\u2019s outreach laboratory services business located in Maine. We will also provide professional laboratory management services for nine of Northern Light\u2019s hospital laboratories along with its cancer center lab. Our M&A pipeline is strong, including potential deals with health systems, small regional labs, and other capability-building assets. In particular, the funnel of opportunities with health systems, which are facing major margin pressures due to labor challenges and mix shift from inpatient to outpatient care, is very active. Quest can help through lab management, population health analytics, mobile services, and/or by monetizing their outreach business. In health plans, we continue to gain traction with value-based contracts where we see meaningfully higher growth than with traditional contracts. Also, we\u2019ve started to benefit from incentives related to these value-based contracts which helps demonstrate the value of these strategic relationships. With CMS\u2019 recent increase in Medicare reimbursement for specimen collections, we\u2019ve begun discussions with our health plan customers about getting paid appropriately for the phlebotomy services we provide to their members. Higher specimen collection fees enable us to make continuous investment in patient services so their members continue to have the broadest access to high quality and low cost lab testing. In advanced diagnostics, we generated strong double-digit growth in prenatal genetics and pharma services in 2022. In 2022, we also launched a solid tumor expanded panel as a laboratory-developed test. This 523 gene test relies upon the Illumina TruSight Oncology 500 assay to help oncologists with therapy selection by providing comprehensive genomic profiling of a patient\u2019s tumor. This test extends our capabilities beyond tissue pathology to offer faster turnaround time from cancer diagnosis to therapy selection. Throughout 2022, we continued to make investments to strengthen our bio-informatics capabilities which support some of the faster growing opportunities of our portfolio, like genomic sequencing services, prenatal and hereditary genetic testing, and pharma services. We also invested in our women\u2019s health sales force which will position us well for continued strong growth in prenatal genetics.  We continue to make progress executing our consumer initiated testing strategy. Last year, we recorded approximately $96 million of both base and COVID-19 consumer testing. In the fall of 2022, we launched our new digital platform, QuestHealth.com. Consumers have found this to be a simpler, more intuitive way to order lab tests. Following the launch of our new consumer sight, we began ramping up marketing spend through the fourth quarter. We saw some of the strongest order volumes to date following some Cyber Monday promotional advertising, and we are encouraged by the acceleration of growth in base testing in December. Shifting to operational excellence, in 2022 we approached our goal of 3% productivity improvements and savings through our Invigorate program. Those savings and productivity improvements did not completely offset the inflationary pressures in our business, as well as the impact of a modest unit price decline. Following the pandemic, we like many companies have faced significant inflation and wage pressures. We are increasing our efforts to drive productivity and expand margins in our base business.  We continue to drive additional productivity improvements with lab platform consolidation and greater use of automation and artificial intelligence. Last year, we began a new automation conversion project in our Lenexa laboratory. This new project builds on what work we\u2019ve done in our Marlborough and Clifton labs. We\u2019ve introduced a new microbiology platform that is highly automated and makes use of artificial intelligence to assist with sample analysis. Finally, we\u2019ve begun to realize savings from the urinalysis platform conversion that we announced early last year.  Filling and retaining our frontline positions continues to be a key priority for us. Although we have experienced higher than average turnover in some of our job categories, we have taken actions to stabilize our workforce and improve frontline employee engagement and retention. We expect these actions to help enhance our productivity in 2023. We have also taken actions to reduce our SG&A by approximately $100 million in 2023, including workforce reductions of approximately 1.5% primarily in corporate support functions. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Sam to provide more details on our performance and our 2023 guidance. Sam? Sam Samad : Thanks Jim. In the fourth quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.33 billion, down 15% versus the prior year. Base business revenues grew 6.3% to $2.15 billion while COVID-19 testing revenues declined 75% to $184 million. Revenues for diagnostic information services declined 15.3% compared to the prior year, reflecting lower revenue from COVID-19 testing services versus the fourth quarter of 2021, partially offset by strong growth in our base testing revenue. Total volume measured by the number of requisitions declined 11.2% versus the fourth quarter of 2021 with acquisitions contributing 20 basis points to total volume.  For the quarter, total base testing volumes declined 0.6% versus the prior year. The year-over-year decline was primarily related to lower employer drug testing volume and adverse weather events during the quarter, which together represented a volume headwind of more than 1.5%.  COVID-19 testing volumes contributed to the decline during the fourth quarter. We resulted approximately 1.9 molecular tests in the quarter. This was down 1.2 million tests versus the third quarter and down approximately 5.4 million tests versus Q4 of 2021. After rising modestly throughout the fourth quarter, our COVID-19 molecular volumes declined to an average of roughly 17,000 tests per day in January and currently make up less than 3% of our daily volumes. In the fourth quarter, revenue per requisition declined 5.1% versus the prior year, driven primarily by lower COVID-19 molecular volume. Base business revenue per req was up 6.8%. This strong increase in revenue per req was driven by a number of factors, including test and payor mix, the more favorable pricing environment with health plans, including incentives under our value-based contracts, and lower patient concessions. Unit price reimbursement pressure remained consistent with our expectations at approximately 50 basis points in the quarter. Reported operating income in the fourth quarter was $135 million or 5.8% of revenues compared to $536 million or 19.5% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $330 million or 14.2% of revenues compared to $579 million or 21.1% of revenues last year. The year-over-year decline in adjusted operating income is related primarily to lower COVID-19 testing revenues and to a lesser extent the negative impact of adverse weather on our volume, as well as higher investments to accelerate growth in our base business. Additionally, in the fourth quarter we experienced a significant increase in employee healthcare costs.  Reported EPS was $0.87 in the fourth quarter compared to $3.12 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $1.98 compared to $3.33 last year. Cash from operations was $1.72 billion for full year 2022 versus $2.23 billion in the prior year period.  Turning to our full year 2023 guidance, revenues are expected to be between $8.83 billion and $9.03 billion. Base business revenues are expected to be between $8.65 billion and $8.75 billion. COVID-19 testing revenues are expected to be between $175 million and $275 million. Reported EPS is expected to be in a range of $7.61 to $8.21, and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $8.40 to $9. Cash from operations is expected to be at least $1.3 billion, and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million.  For our 2023 guidance, please consider the following. As Jim highlighted, we are now assuming COVID-19 molecular volumes to average roughly 5,000 to 10,000 tests per day for the full year. We expect volumes to continue to decline through the spring and summer but could see a modest uptick during respiratory season in Q4. We assume average reimbursement for COVID-19 molecular testing to continue near recent levels through the end of the PHE. CMS has indicated that reimbursements will be $51 when the PHE expires in May. We continue to negotiate with health plans regarding coverage policies and reimbursements for COVID-19 testing post-PHE. Note that our COVID-19 testing revenue guidance for 2023 is approximately $150 million lower than the expectations we had back in October. With COVID-19 testing becoming a significantly smaller portion of our overall business, we expect an earnings cadence that is more in line with pre-pandemic seasonality this year, with Q1 typically being the lowest quarter of the year at roughly 22% to 23% of full year earnings.  We have also taken actions to reduce our SG&A by approximately $100 million in 2023, including workforce reductions of approximately 1.5% primarily in corporate support functions. The benefit of these actions will be modest in Q1 and will expand in the second quarter.  With that, I will now turn it back to Jim. Jim Davis : Thanks Sam. To summarize, we delivered strong growth of 5% in our base business in 2022. COVID testing revenues as expected declined last year and will represent a significantly smaller portion of our business going forward. We are increasing our efforts to drive productivity and expand margins in our base business. We look forward to sharing more of our strategy during our upcoming investor day on March 16 at the New York Stock Exchange. Look for an announcement soon with more details on this event. Now we\u2019d be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator instructions] The first question in the queue is from Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities. Your line is now open. Ann Hynes : Hi, good morning. Thank you.  Maybe if we talk about major assumptions in the low end of guidance versus what\u2019s embedded in the high end of guidance. Can you also discuss the incremental $115 million to $125 million that is now benefiting 2023 versus when you reiterated that mid-$8 range back in Q3 earnings? How much has fallen to the bottom line, and how much do you expect to reinvest in the business? Thanks. Jim Davis : Yes, let me just speak first about the revenue guidance. As we indicated in the remarks, our COVID guidance, which had originally been 10,000 to 15,000 requisitions per day in \u201923, we\u2019ve revised that downward to 5,000 to 10,000 per day, and it\u2019s really just based on the trends we\u2019re seeing. It peaked in December. We averaged roughly 17,000 a day here in January, but that\u2019s had a downward slope, so we continue to expect COVID volumes to decline and it\u2019s really had about $150 million change in revenue versus what we thought last fall. Again, the guidance we\u2019ve suggested - you know, a midpoint of about $225 million in COVID revenue for the year. On the base business, without acquisition help, we\u2019ve assumed a 2.5% to 3% revenue growth on the total base business, so really that\u2019s the explanation on the revenue side. Sam Samad : Yes, so maybe I\u2019ll add a couple of comments, Ann, and thank you for the question - this is Sam.  Versus what we shared back when we talked about in Q3 of 2022 around the fact that we were somewhere in that 850 range, obviously some positives that you mentioned, which is I think what you are referring to as the $115 million to $125 million, which includes the PAMA delay, which includes also the reimbursement of the specimen collection fees, which we now benefit from. But there are a couple of things also that have changed to the negative, really the key one being--or just one thing, really, that\u2019s changed to the negative, I should say, which is COVID.  The COVID assumptions that we had back then were, as Jim just said, 10,000 to 15,000 a day. Now we\u2019re seeing volumes, as we mentioned on the prepared remarks, 17,000 a day in January, and January is typically around the peak of the respiratory season and then it starts to come down from there, so our expectations of 10,000 to 15,000 a day for the year are, I would say, realistic. But in terms of the range itself and what differentiates the bottom versus the top, I think it\u2019s going to be really around the COVID assumptions. But again, keep in mind we\u2019ve taken COVID down by $150 million in terms of total revenues versus what we really shared back in October, when we expected 10,000 to 15,000. We\u2019ve also--from the benefit itself, you know, the $115 million to $125 million that you referenced, we\u2019ve also carved out a small amount for investments in the business, strategic investments that, as we said a couple of months ago, we said we will reserve some of that benefit to invest in the business for long term growth. Ann Hynes : Great, thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Your line is now open. Patrick Donnelly : Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Sam, maybe one for you. Margins came in a little light of where we were expecting 4Q. Can you just talk about the puts and takes there between DTC growth investments, inflation, pricing; and then going into \u201923, it seems like the base business margins need to step up - you know, you called out the $100 million SG&A cut. Are you guys changing any plans for DTC investments? Just want to get comfortable with that margin bridge from the lower 4Q number and the moving pieces. Thank you. Sam Samad : Sure Patrick, yes, and thank you for the question. Let me talk a little bit about Q4 and the margin rate in Q4, the 14.2%. Here are some of the headwinds, some of which we were seeing throughout the year, but obviously we also had a drop in COVID revenues in Q4 which was significant versus Q3, at least sequentially, which impacted the margin as well.  In terms of the margin rate itself, we had inflation, I would say per expectations but still elevated. We had growth investments of roughly about $40 million that impacted Q4, which were fairly in line with Q3, what we had in terms of investments, so not necessarily a sequential driver. One driver in Q4 that impacted our margin rate was higher employee healthcare cost. That was higher than our expectations and some of it driven by higher utilization, especially towards the end of the year after employees have met their deductibles, but also higher cost of healthcare in general. That was about 80 basis points of impact on the quarter in terms of negative rate impact, so that was another thing. I talked about--obviously if you\u2019re looking at things sequentially, you have to factor in that COVID revenues were $184 million roughly versus approximately $313 million in Q3, so a big drop in COVID revenues. Now if you look prospectively in 2023, here are some of the things that obviously give us confidence that we can achieve the rate that we have in our projections and that\u2019s factored into the guidance that we gave. We have taken $100 million in SG&A reductions, and I would say 90% of those have already been implemented. Now, you won\u2019t see the benefit starting in Q1, you\u2019ll probably see it in the latter part of Q1 and really taking effect in Q2 more fully, but that\u2019s $100 million in SG&A reductions that we expect to see over the course of this year. In terms of investments, you referenced that, we expect investments to be less dilutive in 2023 versus 2022, because we start to see the benefit from some of these investments towards the growth of our business. Then finally, obviously the margin rate is going to benefit from the specimen collection fee reimbursement that we have, and we have a volume growth assumption as well and a revenue growth assumption that at the midpoint of the guidance range is, on base business, approximately 3%, and so that\u2019s going to drive also additional margin improvement based on the drop-down from those revenues. Patrick Donnelly : That\u2019s helpful, thanks Sam. Sam Samad : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : The next question is from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Your line is open. Jack Meehan : Thank you, good morning. I had a few questions on Quest Health. First, of the $96 million you talked about of sales, is there a breakdown you can share of COVID versus base; then second, on the base sales, how did that ramp after the fall push? Then finally, just what are your expectations for consumer initiated testing revenue and investment for 2023? Jim Davis : Yes, so Jack, let me start. On CIT, our consumer initiated testing business, the total $96 million, more of it was COVID than our base business; however, our base business, once we launched the new platform, once we launched the marketing spend actually performed as expected in November and December. We got significant growth year-over-year, over 50% growth in the month of December based on the initiatives we put in place.  As we\u2019ve said, this year we expect that business to be less dilutive versus 2022. In terms of the total revenue projection for CIT, you know, we\u2019ll give you something at investor day. Obviously COVID will significantly ramp down, but we expect our base to significantly ramp up, and we\u2019ll give you a better view of that at investor day. Jack Meehan : Great, and then one follow-up on COVID. If we do a look back on 2022, is it possible to call out how much of the sales came from serology, your CDC contract or anything outside of the core molecular, and just what you\u2019re assuming there for 2023? Jim Davis : Here\u2019s what I\u2019d say. As we indicated, the volume is coming down, right - we said 10 to 15 last fall, we now expect 5 to 10 for the year. The one thing I\u2019ll say on serology, we had a significant contract with the CDC, it was simply a test add-on seroprevalence study. That contract, as expected, ended in December. The CDC just doesn\u2019t need that information anymore. What does remain, in addition to the PCR volume, is we\u2019ve got a roughly $25 million contract with the CDC to do continuous sequencing work of the positive cases to help inform the CDC and others about the spread or development of new variants that continue to pop up. Jack Meehan : Super, thank you Jim. Jim Davis : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : The next question is from AJ Rice with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. AJ Rice : Yes, hi everybody. Thanks. Obviously there continues to be a steady pipeline of hospital-related deals. Can you tell us whether--I know your closest peer is announcing transactions too. Do you see any change in the competitive landscape for those deals, on the terms on which those deals are being done? You also mentioned seeing some more activity in small regional labs. What do you attribute that to - is it COVID testing is as running off, are you seeing some of the regional labs express more interest in potentially aligning with you? Jim Davis : Yes AJ, thanks for the question. I would tell you no, there\u2019s no real change in the competitive dynamic in terms of pursuit of these hospital outreach deals or professional lab services types of engagements. What I would tell you is the funnel is as big as it\u2019s ever been. We expect to close several deals here in the first half of the year, so still feel very good about that. In terms of small regional labs that are out there, first I\u2019d say there\u2019s not that many left out there that are of significant size. Certainly those that participated in COVID testing, and now that that volume is declining, yes, we are seeing a few raise their hands and put up the retirement flag and potentially sell out, so we look at each and every one of them. If we think it adds to our competitive position in a certain geographic marketplace, we\u2019ll look at it. If we don\u2019t think we need it from a competitive standpoint, then we take a bye on those. AJ Rice : Okay, thanks a lot. Jim Davis : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : The next question is from Pito Chickering from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Pito Chickering : Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Quest has a very long track record of finding cost efficiencies through Invigorate, so I\u2019m curious how the SG&A cost cutting of $100 million compares to what Invigorate usually finds in SG&A, or most cost savings via Invigorate usually done and cost of services and fixed cost leverage on volume. Jim Davis : Yes, so first, the $100 million cost takeout is incremental to our Invigorate plan for 2023. With our Invigorate plan, we target roughly 3% of our entire cost base for the company, so call that $6.4 billion-ish, 3%, call it $180 million, $190 million a year. We actually got very close to that target in 2022. As we\u2019ve said in the prepared remarks, it did not completely offset wage inflation and the slight price headwind that we did see, along with just other non-labor inflationary pressures. Now as we go into 2023, we\u2019ve got a full funnel of productivity ideas, productivity initiatives that we\u2019re driving through the company. I would say the other thing that we think will really help us in 2023 is simply the stabilization of our workforce. Attrition has a really major impact on your productivity when you\u2019re constantly churning phlebotomists, logistics and specimen processing, so that has stabilized, it\u2019s coming down. We feel good about it and we feel good about the overall productivity plan in terms of offsetting inflation, which we expect to be slightly softer, easier in 2023, and we expect price all-in across Quest Diagnostics to actually be a positive for 2023. Sam Samad : At the risk of being redundant here, I\u2019m still going to repeat something from what Jim said at the beginning, because it\u2019s really important for all your assumptions. The productivity improvements and the Invigorate actions, which is the 3% that we expect to get, that\u2019s in addition on top of the $100 million of SG&A reductions that we\u2019ve already taken for the most part. Pito Chickering : Got it, and sorry, two quick follow-ups. You talked about phlebotomists. Just curious where the phlebotomist hourly wage is today and if you think is the right level to compete against retail channels. The second one is the public lab supply companies have been talking about pricing for a while. Just curious as one of the largest labs in the U.S., what you assume for supply inflation for \u201923, or can you offset that inflation simply by changing vendors and/or leveraging your scale? Jim Davis : Yes, so our phlebotomy rates vary by region of the country. What I would tell you is our increase in wages for phlebotomy were certainly in line with the 3% to 4% wage impact that we saw last year. It\u2019s what we\u2019re planning for 2023, and as I indicated, our retention has improved. Our attrition has certainly stabilized and declined, so we feel good about that. Pito Chickering : Then on the supply inflation, just curious--? Jim Davis : Yes, I\u2019m sorry, the supply inflation. Again, 70% of what we purchase each year is under contract. When those contracts come up, they generally represent an opportunity for deflation, meaning we\u2019re going to run a competition between the vendors and we look for improvements from a cost, quality and turnaround time perspective. Where the inflation hit us in 2022 is really on some of the non-supplies, the reagents and things like that. Some of that could have been pre-analytical supplies, masks, gowns, things like that, as well as just the normal inflation that you all see in your businesses, which could be hotels, air travel and things like that. Now again, we think that\u2019s softening here as we get into 2023, and we certainly put guardrails on travel and living expenses and things like that. Pito Chickering : Great, thanks so much. Operator : The next question is from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Brian Tanquilut : Hey, good morning guys. Jim, just a quick question on rates from payors. I think in the past, you\u2019ve expressed some optimism in seeing a little bit of rate improvement in the commercial side. But I think in your prepared remarks, you called out a little bit of reimbursement pressure at 60 basis points or so, so just curious how do we reconcile that, and maybe just broadly speaking what you\u2019re seeing in terms of payor receptivity to increasing rates on the reimbursement front. Thanks. Jim Davis : Yes, I think we said in the prepared remarks that our pricing was down about 50 basis points, which actually represents the best that I\u2019ve seen in my time with Quest Diagnostics, so we feel good about that. We\u2019ve also said that as we renegotiate new contracts, and every one of these contracts is four to five years in length so you can expect that 20% to 25% will renew this year, which they will, and the preponderance of those contracts we\u2019ve seen rate increases at a minimum rate--you know, holding rate flat to prior contracts, so we view that as a very positive. What we\u2019ve also said is, look - we\u2019ve got a $35 million to $40 million rate increase through Medicare draw fee increases, and today we get reimbursed on roughly 25% of the commercial draws that we do. We\u2019re going to push hard not only to expand that 25% but those that do reimburse us to take those rates up as well, so we are pushing hard at every turn to increase prices across this business. The last thing I\u2019d say is, look, there\u2019s a portfolio of $700 million to $800 million of other businesses in Quest Diagnostics - that can be our Exam One business, our employer solutions business, our employee population health business, and we\u2019ve pushed for 2% to 3% price increases on that portfolio of business and we\u2019ve largely gotten those in place for 2023. Again, this is the most optimistic price outlook that we\u2019ve put forward since I joined Quest in 2013. Sam Samad : Yes, maybe just to put a couple of points of emphasis around it, in the prepared remarks we talked about a price impact in Q4 of roughly 50 basis points year-over-year of price headwind. As we look towards 2023, what\u2019s reflected in our guidance right now is actually a positive price impact year-over-year, and obviously that\u2019s benefited from the reimbursement of the specimen collection fee. It\u2019s definitely a positive. We\u2019ve managed to really make some good progress in terms of our pricing. Jim Davis : The other thing I want to mention is we\u2019ve talked about these value-based contracts, and over 30% of our health plan contracts have some type of incentive for us to earn additional value, which we actually don\u2019t put into the price equation, but it\u2019s really good payor mix. These incentives could be based on share of spend with Quest Diagnostics, it could be based on leakage, it could be based on the movement of requisitions from high priced hospital labs into laboratories like Quest Diagnostics, so those value-based incentives are an important part of our business, and as we succeed in achieving that value for the health plans, there\u2019s rewards that come back to us. Shawn Bevec : Brian, this is Shawn. Just one last thing I wanted to add. Most of the price impact that we saw in 2022 was largely driven by some of the client bill, largely with the hospitals. The health plan book was actually pretty good, pretty stable, so. Brian Tanquilut : Got it. Very helpful, thank you. Operator : The next question is from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Your line is open. Kevin Caliendo : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I\u2019m really just trying to understand all these puts and takes a little bit. I guess my first one is, is the $100 million of SG&A, it\u2019s incremental. Is that--you know, Invigorate typically offsets some other inflationary pressures, labor costs and the like. Is this $100 million incremental such that it drops to the bottom line, or are there other offsets there? Two, is there any change with the pricing benefit that you\u2019re talking about, better pricing is certainly a tailwind, I would think for \u201923, so how do we think about that in terms of--or is there an offset there on mix on the margin for, basically, your volume mix, something to that effect? I\u2019m just trying to understand the puts and takes. Jim Davis : Yes, again the $100 million, it is incremental to our Invigorate plan of record, and yes, it drops right to the bottom line. In terms of pricing, no, the improvement drops to the bottom line as well. We\u2019re not suggesting any other offset at this point. Obviously we had strong [indiscernible] both in Q4 and for the year. That benefit, we would put in three buckets : test mix, which was very positive for the year; we saw a big surge of flu and RSV testing along with COVID, but flu and RSV that came in Q4, that has since moderated; and then our business mix was good in terms of payor mix. Then finally, year-over-year we made nice improvements in patient concessions, so our ability to collect, our ability to reduce denials and get paid for the work we do was certainly a positive tailwind for us in 2022. Kevin Caliendo : And if I can just ask one quick follow-up, should we assume in our models the billion dollar buyback gets used in 2023? Sam Samad : No, Kevin. The billion dollar share authorization increase, that\u2019s in addition to the $311 million that we currently have on the previous authorization, but you should not expect that that is what\u2019s assumed in the guidance. What we\u2019ve assumed, actually, is that any share buybacks we do are to offset equity dilution, so essentially the share count is roughly flat with where we are at the end of the year, so don\u2019t assume the $1 billion to be built into the projections. Kevin Caliendo : Very helpful, thank you guys. Operator : The next question is from Andrew Brackmann with William Blair. Your line is open. Andrew Brackmann : Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions.  Maybe as it relates specifically to COVID test reimbursement with the PHE ending, maybe just give us a little more detail on how those conversations with commercial payors are trending and how we should be thinking about expectations there. Then I guess just related to that, how are you thinking about any permanent changes to your respiratory testing portfolio broadly, now that we\u2019ve lived through three years of COVID? Thanks. Jim Davis : Yes, so again, CMS--and we\u2019ve had direct discussions with them, it\u2019s very clear that once the public health emergency ends, the rate will go to $51. We are certainly expecting and driving those discussions with commercial payors that we expect that rate to be $51 as well. It\u2019s a new test that should be treated as such. Some may have a slightly different opinion on that, Andrew, so that\u2019s where we negotiate. In addition to that, there\u2019s coverage policy decisions that all need to be worked out as well, asymptomatic versus symptomatic testing, so we\u2019re bullish that the country needs these tests, commercial payors need these tests, and we\u2019re going to drive these discussions in the most favorable way that we can. In terms of respiratory panels, obviously with COVID still out there, it\u2019s not going to go away in 2023. When patients presented in the fall, winter and here in January with respiratory symptoms, some physicians ordered three tests, some physicians ordered one and then re-flexed to others, depending on if the first one turned out to be negative, so there were a variety of patterns that were out there. But you know, we don\u2019t expect COVID to go away in 2023, so whether RSV and flu tick up like they did in 2022 remains to be seen, and so we\u2019ll just have to see how it plays out in the late fall, early winter. Operator : The next question is from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is open. Derik de Bruin : Hey, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. One quick housekeeping question and then a follow-up. The housekeeping question, just expectations for net interest expense for the year, and then how should we think--and also then, how should we think about the M&A contribution that\u2019s embedded in your revenue and your volume growth in the \u201923 guide, and should we still think about that 2% bogey at the way to look at it for going forward on the revenue contribution? Thanks. Sam Samad : Yes, so I\u2019ll handle the questions, but I missed the part on the expense. What type of expense? Derik de Bruin : I\u2019m sorry - net interest expense. Sam Samad : Oh, net interest expense - okay. That\u2019s roughly flat, I\u2019d say year-over-year in terms of \u2018222 to \u201923, Derik, is the assumption to take there.  In terms of M&A, what we have assumed in our guide for 2023 is really no material prospective M&A, so essentially what\u2019s closed already, what was included in \u201923 in terms of deals that have been made - any outreach, for instance, hospital deals that have already closed in \u201922, those you\u2019ll see a benefit from in \u201923, but there is no prospective M&A included. When you think about our long term target that we had talked about, around 2% contribution from M&A, we have not assumed any prospective M&A in \u201923 on top of our base revenue growth. Derik de Bruin : All right, so with completed M&A, then what\u2019s the contribution for \u201923? Sam Samad : It\u2019s not significant. We\u2019re not going to give the exact contribution, but it\u2019s really not that material in terms of what we have this year that carries into next year. Shawn Bevec : Derik, we had one month of Pac Health, because that\u2019s what closed last year at the end of January, and then the Suma Health and the Northern Light outreach acquisitions, those were pretty small. Derik de Bruin : Great, thank you. Operator : The last question in the queue is from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Elizabeth Anderson : Hi guys. Thanks so much for the question. I had a question about advanced diagnostics and your assumptions for \u201923, including contribution and then more specifically on the positive impact in pricing, and any kind of incremental investments that you think specifically for 2023 will be necessary to sustain that growth, accelerate it. Jim Davis : Yes, so we\u2019ve talked about our investments in really three categories. First, consumer initiated testing, which we covered, that business will continue to grow on the base side of our testing in 2023, and as we\u2019ve indicated, it will certainly be less dilutive than it was in 2022. The second big area of investments has been in oncology and what we call genomic sequencing services, and really building out what we call our integrated genomics platform. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we brought up a new LDT in Q4 using the Illumina platform - it\u2019s referred to as the TSO 500, but it is a Quest LDT, and it\u2019s really important in therapy selection decisions for cancer. We\u2019re really happy about that. We brought it up at our SJC facility and we\u2019ll be expanding that to a second facility here in early 2023, so we certainly expect that business to grow.  On this integrated genomics platform, look - the world has moved from micro array testing to whole exome to whole transcriptome, and now moving quickly to whole genome testing, and we expect with this platform to have a really good sample to complete information platform, low cost, high throughput, really good turnaround time, and we\u2019ll update you more about that at our upcoming investor day. The final thing is--you know, we referred to it as pharma services, which grew over 15% last year, and this is us participating in companion diagnostics. We participate in phase 1 clinical trials, either from a pharma company or from a CRO, and then we do a lot of testing and validation work for our IVD partners in the industry, and that business continues to grow as well.  The last thing I\u2019d say is, look, we felt really good about our growth in prenatal testing this year and other rare genetic disorders, so it\u2019s a business that continues to grow in the high single, low double digits for Quest Diagnostics. Operator : There is one more question that popped in the queue from Rachel Vatnsdal with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Rachel Vatnsdal : Perfect. Thanks guys for taking the question. First up, we\u2019ve previously talked about some of the uneven recoveries by geography. Last quarter, you noted that New York City was still not fully recovered, so can you just give us the latest update on the recovery there in New York? Then my follow-up is just on the analyst day this March, can you walk us through some of the topics that you plan on hitting on, any expectations for that? Thanks. Sam Samad : Yes, thank you, Rachel, for the question - this is Sam. In terms of the geography, I think it\u2019s consistent with what we said before, and let me repeat what we said because we haven\u2019t seen really a major change in the dynamic yet. We are back to pre-pandemic levels and above across most geographies, the notable exception being the east, where New York City, I think we\u2019ve seen roughly 3% to 5% outflow from the city in terms of population, 3% to 5% of the population leaving the city. We haven\u2019t seen that fully come back yet, even though the city is much more vibrant and there\u2019s more activity. But I don\u2019t think in terms of people coming back and getting health care in New York City, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s back to where it was pre-pandemic by any means. The other thing we look at is ridership on public transportation as an indicator, as a key metric to see how is that also coming back, and it\u2019s still about 35% or so below pre-pandemic levels in terms of ridership, based on the last data points that we got. The punch line here being that the east is still lagging, but everywhere else is above pre-pandemic levels in terms of utilization. Jim Davis : Yes, and then Rachel, thanks for the question on investor day. I think there\u2019s really four broad topics that we\u2019re going to talk about. First around growth, we\u2019ll go deep on what we\u2019re doing from an oncology and genomic sequencing standpoint. We\u2019ll give you a lot more color on our consumer initiated testing business, the progress we\u2019re making and why we continue to be excited about that, and then we\u2019ll also address the core part of this business, which is serving physicians, serving health systems, and what we\u2019re doing to continue to drive growth in those segments. Finally and as always, we\u2019ll address what we\u2019re doing to improve the customer experience and drive productivity in this business. It\u2019s a never-ending part of what we do and we continue to drive productivity, and we\u2019ll give you our plans for \u201923 and beyond. Finally, just as a reminder, it is March 16, it will be at the New York Stock Exchange, and we\u2019ll obviously provide our long term outlook as part of that session. Operator : I\u2019m showing no further questions in the queue. Jim Davis : Okay, so I wanted to thank everybody for joining the call today. We look forward to seeing you all on March 16 at the New York Stock Exchange, and have a great afternoon. Thanks everyone. Sam Samad : Thank you everybody. Operator : Thank you for participating in the Quest Diagnostics fourth quarter and full year 2022 conference call.

At the request of the company, this call is being recorded. All lines have been placed on a listen-only mode until the question and answer portion. The entire contents of the call, including the presentation and question-and-answer session that will follow, are the copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics with all rights reserved. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. I would now like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead, please. Shawn Bevec : Thank you, and good morning. I\u2019m joined by Jim Davis, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and President; and Sam Samad, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and will discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics\u2019 future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS, and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS. Any references to base business, testing, revenues or volumes refer to the performance of our business excluding COVID-19 testing. Growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections, including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings growth, are compound annual growth rates. Finally, revenue growth rates from acquisitions will be measured against our base business. Now here is Jim Davis. Jim Davis : Thanks, Shawn, and good morning, everyone. We\u2019re off to a strong start in 2023. Our base business grew double digit compared to prior year, driven by strong performance across physician and health system lab services. This morning we announced the acquisition of Haystack Oncology. Later in my remarks I\u2019ll describe how this transaction is aligned to the molecular genomics and oncology strategy we shared last month at Investor Day and how it positions us well in the fast-growing category of minimal residual disease testing. Now, turning to the first quarter. Total revenues were $2.3 billion. Total base business revenue grew 10%, supported by base business volume growth of nearly 8%. And earnings per share were a $1.78 on a reported basis and $2.4 on an adjusted basis. Now, let's look at some of the highlights from the quarter. The strong volume growth we experienced in our base business across all customer types, points to a continued return to care in the quarter. We saw a faster growth in number of test per requisition across a broad range of clinical test categories. This suggests more people are returning to the healthcare system for routine care after delaying care during the pandemic. Health plan volumes also continue to grow faster than the overall business. This trend is directly related to our ongoing efforts to partner with health plans to actively steer patients to high quality, lower-cost providers like Quest, thereby saving money for the health plan, employers and plan members. During the first quarter, base revenues from health systems grew approximately 7%. At Investor Day, we said this book of business would grow at about 5% to 6% CAGR, and we're having success across the board with new wins in our reference and professional lab services offerings. Some of these highlights include : in February, we announced that we're helping Tower Health in Pennsylvania manage its laboratory supply chain in addition to performing reference testing. Our Northern Light Health PLS relationship began to ramp up in the quarter. Northern Light is a large integrated health system in Maine, where we are providing services for all nine of its hospital labs and its cancer center. We also closed our acquisition of Northern Lights outreach lab assets. Finally, we completed our strategic laboratory services acquisition with NewYork-Presbyterian, with new test volumes starting to flow into our Clifton, New Jersey laboratory earlier this month. This is the third outreach acquisition we completed in the last six months. As we enter the second quarter, our pipeline of new health system business remains strong, including many additional PLS opportunities. Now I'd like to say a few words about our announcement this morning regarding our planned acquisition of Haystack Oncology. Haystack is an early stage oncology company, focused on minimal residual disease, or MRD testing. Haystack has developed a highly sensitive liquid biopsy technology that can detect circulating DNA from residual or recurring tumor cells. The technology was licensed from Johns Hopkins where it was developed by genomics and cancer pioneers. Most patients treated for cancer must be monitored for years following surgery and initial treatment. This is because there\u2019s always the potential that some cancer was missed and may recur. At Investor Day we talked about Quest\u2019s strong position in the mature cancer areas of screening and diagnosis and that we will also play a leading roll in therapy selection with our TSO500 assay. Haystack liquid biopsy technology, combined with our strengths in screening, pathology and sequencing will now position us to play a leading roll in a fast growing MRD category. We expect to focus initially on colorectal, breast and lung cancers and to start generating revenue next year. We are also encouraged by other recent developments in advanced diagnostics. In the area of brain health we saw strong growth which we attribute largely to Quest AD-Detect Alzheimer's blood test. This proprietary test launched last year, helps us assess the risk of Alzheimer's disease. We are now introducing additional tests to help us assess the inherited risk of Alzheimer's and provide personalized recommendations to lower risk. We also saw strong growth in our advanced cardiometabolic portfolio; prenatal genetics, our blood-based tuberculosis screening and hepatitis B and C testing. We are encouraged by the CDC's recent decision to recommend one-time screening for hepatitis B. In consumer health, we continue to add to our test menu with new services, including long COVID and menopause testing. We also generated strong year-over-year volume growth in allergy and general health testing, as consumers utilize our offerings as a complement to the care provided by their physician. In the coming months, we plan to launch a new consumer genetics panel as well. Turning to Invigorate. We are well on our way toward achieving our 3% annual productivity savings target. Here are some recent examples among the many contributors. We are improving the efficiency of our patient services network. In some cases, we're closing smaller draw sites and adding staff to larger, higher volume locations. At the same time, we're making it easier for walk-ins to register and be seen through our schedule at check-in service. We are adding new features to the pre-registration process, which improves both collections and patient convenience. During the pandemic, we relied heavily on third-party logistics to supplement our own team's collections of COVID-19 test and other specimens. COVID-19 volumes have declined and the labor market eases, we are reducing our dependence on these vendors, which will generate savings for our logistics operations. Finally, we're continuing to enhance our labor staffing models across our lab network to reflect post-pandemic total volumes and drive productivity. As we have said before, we continue to closely manage the cost of our corporate and support functions. The actions we've taken will start to help margins beginning in the second quarter. Finally, I'd like to give you an update on where we are with Medicare clinical lab fee schedule cuts. As you know, PAMA cuts were suspended for 2023. We strongly support the recent bipartisan reintroduction of the legislation in Congress to fix PAMA through the Saving Access to Laboratory Services Act, or SALSA. We are working with our trade association on driving advocacy for SALSA through a campaign to stop lab cuts, aimed at congressional outreach on the importance of lab services. Now I'll turn it over to Sam to provide more details on our performance and our updated 2023 guidance. Sam? Sam Samad : Thanks, Jim. In the first quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.33 billion, down 10.7% versus the prior year. Base business revenues grew 10% to $2.21 billion, while COVID-19 testing revenues declined approximately 80% and to $119 million. Revenues for diagnostic information services declined 11.1% compared to the prior year, reflecting lower revenue from COVID-19 testing services, versus the first quarter of 2022, partially offset by strong growth in our base business. Total volume, measured by the number of requisitions, declined 3.8% versus the prior year with acquisitions contributing 10 basis points to total volume. In the quarter, total base testing volumes grew 7.9% versus the prior year. Recall, our base testing volumes in the first quarter of last year were negatively impacted by surge in COVID-19 cases due to the spread of the Omicron variant. If we normalize for the impact of the easier comps due to the Omicron surge in Q1 2022, we estimate base volume growth at approximately 4%. COVID-19 testing volumes continued to decline during the first quarter. We resulted approximately 1.3 million molecular tests in the quarter, down approximately 5 million tests versus Q1 of 2022. The Revenue per requisition declined 7.7% versus the prior year, driven by lower COVID-19 molecular volume. Base business revenue per req was up 2.3%, due primarily to more tests per acquisition, as well as positive payer and test mix. Unit price was roughly flat, which was consistent with our expectations. Reported operating income in the first quarter was $305 million or 13.1% of revenues compared to $513 million or 19.7% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $350 million or 15% of revenues compared to $554 million or 21.2% of revenues last year. The year-over-year decline in adjusted operating income is related primarily to lower COVID-19 testing revenues, partially offset by growth in the base business. Reported EPS was $1.78 in the quarter compared to $2.92 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $2.04 compared to $3.22 last year. Cash from operations was $94 million in the first quarter versus $480 million in the prior year period. The decline in operating cash flow was primarily related to lower operating income and an additional payroll cycle during the quarter versus the prior year. Now turning to our updated full year 2023 guidance. Revenues are now expected to be between $8.93 billion and $9.08 billion. Base business revenues are expected to be between $8.78 billion and $8.88 billion. COVID-19 testing revenues are expected to be between $150 million and $200 million. Reported EPS expected to be in a range of $7.52 to $8.02 and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $8.45 to $8.95. Cash from operations is expected to be at least $1.3 billion and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million. There are some things to consider for the remainder of the year. We have lowered our COVID-19 revenue guidance, which now assumes very modest COVID-19 revenue following the end of the public health emergency in May. COVID 19 molecular volumes have declined faster than we expected over the last several weeks. And we now expect minimal volume contribution from the retail channel post PHE. We have raised our base business revenue guidance to reflect stronger base volume trends and the recent close of the NewYork-Presbyterian transaction. We expect the Haystack Oncology transaction to close in the second quarter. Our updated EPS guidance reflects the expected dilution from this transaction in 2023. We expect this deal to be modestly dilutive to EPS over the next three years and accretive to earnings by 2026. We anticipate Haystack Oncology to begin contributing revenue in 2024 and to have a positive ROIC by the end of 2025. With that, I will now turn it back to Jim. Jim Davis : Thanks, Sam. To summarize, we're off to a strong start in 2023 and our base business grew double digits compared to prior year. We are excited about our announced acquisition of Haystack Oncology. With Haystack, we expect to build on our strengths in cancer screening and diagnosis to play a leading role in the higher growth areas of MRD detection. And finally, we're well on our way toward generating our targeted 3% Invigorate savings and productivity improvements. Now, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We will now open it up to questions. At the request of the company, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. If you have additional questions, we ask that you please fall back in the queue. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Ann Hynes of Mizuho Securities. Your line is open. Ann Hynes : Great. Thank you. My question is focused on the base volume growth, which was strong. And in your commentary, you talked about health plans that you're gaining more market share there and you are winning more market share, I think you said with, reference labs. So maybe can you give us more detail on that? Is it existing health care partners? Do you have a new health care partner? Is your relationship with existing partners may be changing? And I'm just trying to figure out how much is a return to normal versus maybe actual market share you could be gaining? Thanks. Jim Davis : Yes. Hey, thanks, Ann and good morning. So our growth in the quarter, again, 10% base revenue growth was strong across all channels, our physician segment and our health systems segment. Now within the health systems segment, we look at our reference business and our PLS business. Our reference business was powered by growth from existing accounts as well as we had several new big wins that, we actually win those deals in previous quarters, but the start-up was in the first quarter. On the PLS side, our professional lab services, our growth at existing site same-store sales was very strong. But we also added, as you know, a couple of new PLS sites, both in the fourth quarter that were ramping up and in the first quarter. Those were Lee Health in Florida, as I mentioned in the script, Tower Health and then Northern Light in Maine, a multi-hospital health system up in Northern Maine continued to wrap up in the first quarter. So broad-based growth, physician business was very strong, health system business strong and PLS certainly helped the average growth rate in the quarter. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Donnelly of Citigroup. Your line is open. Patrick Donnelly : Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the questions. This might be one for Sam. Just on the margin side. As we look at the base margins back in COVID, shaking out somewhere around 13%. I guess when you look at the go forward, even getting into next year, kind of approaching that 17% type number. Can you just talk about -- I don't know if it's a bridge or just the progression towards that how you work your way towards that, particularly as COVID continues to come out of the model a little bit. I just want to focus on that base margin piece and how we think about the step up there. Sam Samad : Sure, Patrick and good morning. Thanks for the question. So listen, we had 15% operating margins in Q1. I'll talk about some of the drivers in terms of -- to your question, looking forward and how we get to that approximately 17% that we guided to on Investor Day, and we're still committed to that approximately 17% number that we guided for 2023. So here are some key drivers. First of all, Q1 margins came in on the base business strong. And, overall, as expected, we had a negative impact from COVID revenues, both coming down more precipitously than expected, but also the mix on COVID. We saw more testing done at the PLS sites that at other sites, which are lower cost for us. But in terms of Q1, came in as expected. As we look forward, we start to see a few things help margins. First of all, keep in mind, Q1 is usually our weakest quarter as well. But as we look forward, you expect Invigorate savings to or productivity improvements to ramp up, and that has already started but will ramp up over the course of the year. We set our SG&A reductions of approximately $100 million will really take effect more so in Q2 onwards. And so, that will help margins going forward as well. We're seeing, as I said, good strong base business growth and volume that's going to help us. We're seeing good tailwind from pricing. Our pricing environment is the best that it's ever been. We're seeing a modest benefit from pricing this year compared to the 50 basis point headwind that we saw last year. And before that, we used to have even more headwind than that. So all of those factors, as you look forward in terms of productivity, in terms of SG&A improvement, in terms of volume growth, give us confidence about getting to that 17%. Jim Davis : Yes. The last thing I'd add, Patrick, is our test mix in the quarter was strong. Our investments in advanced diagnostics continue to pay off. We saw, as I said in the script, really nice growth in advanced cardiometabolic testing, prenatal genetics, hep B, hep C. So these are all margin accretive types of tests. So we feel good about that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. Your line is open. Brian Tanquilut : Hey, good morning, guys. Congrats on the quarter. A question for you guys. As I think about the call out you made on test per req being up in the quarter. Maybe if you can give us some color on what is driving that and how you think that will progress going forward? Yes, that's all. Thank you. Jim Davis : So I think there's evidence of a strong return to care. So I just said that our advanced testing portfolio was certainly up in the quarter. We also saw just strong growth in routine testing, routine cardiometabolic, lipid panels, chemistry panels and things like that. Generally, general health and wellness visit has high test per req, because you're testing across the entire human body. So I think our test per req were really powered by that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson, Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Elizabeth Anderson : Hi, guys, thanks so much for the question. I was wondering if you could talk more about your visibility into pricing and contract renewals, particularly with payers this year, should have -- how far along are you in terms of the renewals and sort of what incrementally have you been seeing? Or is it sort of similar to what you called out on current trends? Thank you. Jim Davis : Sure. So I think as everybody knows, in general, our contracts with commercial payers average three to five years. So on average, every year, we're going to renegotiate about 25% of our health plans contracts. We're now a-third of the way through the year, and we've progressed nicely on two of the contracts that have been renewed. We have a few more to do throughout the rest of the year. So what I would tell you is, look, we have a great value story. Consistently, we're able to move requisitions from high-priced institutions, health systems and out-of-network labs into Quest Diagnostics. And we try to negotiate incentives for doing that. And when we do that work, we get paid incremental value. So these value-based contracts are on the rise. And we certainly make the case around inflation and things like that. But as I've said in the past, we don't lead with that. We lead with the fact that we offer great value, and we want to get paid for that value. So negotiations are going well. We said in the quarter that price was flat, which we haven't been able to say in a long time. Q4, we were down 50 basis points. Q1 we're flat. So we continue to make improvement and expect to make improvement throughout the rest of the year. Elizabeth Anderson : Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo of UBS. Your line is open. Kevin Caliendo : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the Haystack acquisition. Can you maybe talk through the process there, why now, why this company? Talk through any -- I know there's some regulatory and commercial milestones this company has coming up? And also, maybe just talk through how we should think about the dilution in terms of modeling it and where would show up through the P&L. Jim Davis : Yes. So let me just have Sam address the dilution first, and then I'll come back and talk about why Haystack and why now, Sam? Sam Samad : Yes. So, Kevin, first of all, thanks for the question. So we said this deal will be modestly dilutive this year and modestly dilutive for the next three years and will be actually accretive for us in terms of earnings in 2026. We haven't shared exactly how dilutive of it is for 2023. But let me give you a couple of, maybe, nuggets or qualitative directional comments. First of all, in terms of our overall guidance, as you saw, we kept our guidance midpoint the same. We narrowed the guidance by $0.10 on EPS, so I'm referring here specifically to adjusted EPS. And the drivers of that were, improved base business, which is taking us higher, lower COVID, which is going the other way, and some modest dilution from the Haystack acquisition. But all in all, if you put all those together, we're still at the midpoint of the adjusted EPS guidance that we were last quarter. In terms of going forward, the annualized EPS dilution from Haystack next year is actually less than what we expect to see this year. So it starts to improve. It's -- next year is the peak dilution for the deal. And in 2025, the dilution is lower. So it's actually a year-over-year EPS improvement. And then in 2026, as I said, it's accretive for us from an EPS perspective. ROIC wise, as I said, it turns positive by the end of 2025. And we expect it to have a -- it definitely clears our hurdle for ROIC expectations in the next five years. Jim Davis : Yes. So Kevin, let me talk a little bit now about why Haystack and why now. So first, as we talked about at Investor Day, when we are looking to close a capability gap, if you will, in our portfolio, the first thing we do is we reach out to our IBD partners. And over the last several years, we've had deep discussions. We know what their road maps are. And we didn't think that was a pathway to follow to get into this space, at least in the next several years, let's just say. Over the last three years, we've had many discussions with many of the players in the MRD space. We got to know Haystack over the last year. We think they have the lowest limit of detection of any MRD assay out there. In terms of just raw numbers, they can detect one part per million, meaning you have 1 million floating dead cells, as they die they release DNA, the fragments of DNA and there's a lot of DNA in your bloodstream and these guys with this assay can find one fragment of cancer DNA per 1 million parts. That is an incredibly low limit of detection. The sensitivity of the assay at Landmark is very, very high, 80% to 90%. And so we think it's a best-in-class assay. The work they've done on some of their preliminary trials, 450 patients across 23 Australian centers. I'd refer you to the New England Journal of Medicine article in June of 2022. So we think it's the right assay, the right time. As you know, CMS is reimbursing for these assays, and we think we can scale it. We think we can drive further commercial reimbursement. The last thing I would say is, look, it is a tumor-informed assay and when you're looking for a needle in a haystack, hence their name, when you're looking for a needle in a haystack, you actually want to know what the needle looks like. And hence, we believe that a tumor-informed assay is a much stronger assay than an uninformed assay. Sam Samad : One other thing, just to wrap up on the financials. Kevin, back to your question around dilution. I do want to mention, for the longer term, we are committed to the Investor Day guidance that we gave around long-range guidance, which said mid-single-digit revenue growth and high single-digit EPS growth. The Haystack acquisition actually modestly improves on that as well. So I just wanted to provide this for the long-term guidance, given that we just shared at an Investor Day not too long ago Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jack Meehan of Nephron Research. Your line is open. Jack Meehan : Thank you. Good morning. Wanted to stick with the Haystack deal. Very interesting, great tech, pricing is pretty reasonable with other deals in the space. I had a few more questions for you. First is in terms of coverage, just wanted to confirm, I assume, is the plan to go through Moldex there? Then number two, do you think reimbursement looks similar to other MRD tests on the market? And then finally, can you just comment, are there any royalties attached to the deal? Thank you. Jim Davis : Yes. So, yes, Jack, first, thanks for the question. Yes, on Moldex absolutely plan to go that route. Look, what we have to do is finish the commercialization of the assay. We'll be doing that for the rest of this year. We plan on bringing the assay up in one of our large oncology testing facilities. As you know, there is limited coverage for Medicare and Medicare Advantage patients, as dictated by CMS. Two companies have coverage for that today. I would also tell you, there's a handful of Blues company -- the Blues plans that are reimbursing for the test. So similar to NIPT -- remember, NIPT started out very high-risk women, very limited coverage. And we, as well some other industry members drove that throughout the commercial payers. And that test is wide open to women today. So that's our plan. On the royalty question, look, as we mentioned in the comments, the -- some of the original IP came out of John Hopkins. I'm not going to disclose royalty payments. But as you can imagine, there's intellectual property that comes with this, and there's modest royalties that will come with it. Shawn Bevec : Operator, next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Erin Wright of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Erin Wright : Great. Thanks. Two part question. Just first on basic routine testing. Where are we now relative to pre-COVID baseline levels? Are we fully back to normal here? And then on capital deployment, I understand there's a balance of capital deployment dedicated to the innovation assets like Haystack, but how rich is the pipeline now for the tuck-in deals around hospitals, or local players and have you seen any changes in the urgency around those types of deals? Thanks. Jim Davis : Yes. So our routine testing levels are above pre-COVID levels, whether you look at our volume versus all of 2019 or you look at our volume versus the first two months of 2020, we're substantially above that. So the recovery is no longer really even a topic of discussion for us. In terms of the funnel of opportunities on the health system side, namely outreach deals is stronger than ever. And I think now that COVID is behind us, the deal completion will start to accelerate. So we feel good about what's in the funnel. They generally take a while to negotiate. You got to get a lot of people on board, pathologists on board, referring physicians. But once you get them all on board, it can move quickly. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Pito Chickering of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Kieran Ryan : Hi, there. You've got Kieran Ryan on here for Pito. Thanks for taking the questions. Just going back to margins, I was just wondering if you can talk a little bit about FTE wage inflation, hiring and turnover, how that ran in 1Q compared to what you're seeing in the second half of 2022? And then, just kind of how that fits into getting back to that 17% margin next year? Sam Samad : Yes. So the guidance we gave for the year, we said our wage inflation would be in the 3% to 4% range. No surprises there. We still feel good about that overall guidance that we set for the year. Our turnover rates have improved from Q1 of last year. Sequentially, for most job categories, it improved from Q4 to Q1. And we continue to see the trend back towards a normalized attrition rate. When I say normalized, sort of, pre-COVID levels. It is not yet back to those levels unlike volume, but it is trending in the right direction, and we feel good about where our wage inflation was in the first quarter and for the year. Jim Davis : Yes. And I'll just mention a couple of things real quick. I mean, productivity in terms of the Invigorate actions that we have, helps also offset that, which is how we get to the margin target that we have. And I think you mentioned, Kieran, the 17% next year, actually, our guidance is to get to approximately 17% this year in terms of operating margin. So I just want to be clear on that. Operator : Thank you. Our next comes\u2026 Shawn Bevec : Operator? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Brackmann of William Blair. Your line is open. Andrew Brackmann : Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just to go back to Haystack for a minute and appreciate all the commentary today on that. But can you maybe just sort of talk about any expectations for a halo effect that this can create for you guys commercially. And I guess, just as you sort of think about that, how are you thinking about any changes to the commercial strategy, just between calling on pathologists and then the oncologist here. Thanks. Jim Davis : Yes. It\u2019s a good question. Absolutely, a halo effect. Remember at Investor Day, we said in 2022, ex-COVID, we had $8.4 billion in revenue. And of that $8.4 billion, $1 billion of that is in the cancer space. And we said about half of that or $0.5 billion is in the screening space, routine screening, PSA, Pap Smear, HPV, some common cancer markers, but we then said that the other $0.5 billion is anatomical pathology. So we have the -- and once we have that specimen, it's only logical for the medical oncologists to start to, once it's declared cancer -- the next question, post surgery is there still cancer cells in this human being, or the next question, if the answer to that is yes, and then there's therapy. The next question is, did the therapy work? Do we still see remnants of DNA from the tumor. So we think this absolutely fits into our overall cancer strategy and Quest Diagnostics today. In particular, again, there is a halo effect. We will own the block, we will own the specimen and doing the testing on that for both treatment monitoring as well as treatment selection, we think, is just a natural. Now, from a commercial standpoint, we have a pretty mature oncology distribution today that calls on pathologists and medical oncologists. And, yes, we are absolutely going to strengthen the team as we finish the commercialization of this assay and to have a more robust channel calling into the medical oncologist space. So good question. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from A.J. Rice of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. A.J. Rice: Thanks. Hi, everybody. Maybe two quick ones here, if I could slip them in. A strong rebound in the base business line. We've talked for a while about the fact that the New York region had not come back as quickly as other regions. Did you see any outsized performance there that's contributing to the strong base business? Or was the strength pretty much across the board geographically. And then you didn't do anything on the buyback front this quarter. I know you've Haystack now and you've got hospital deals. I wondered what's your thought about additional share repurchases as we progress through the year. Jim Davis : Yes. Thanks, A.J. So, on your first question, I'll let Sam take the second part. Again, 10% revenue growth on the base business in the quarter, 8% volume growth. I mentioned that health systems was 7%. So our physician book of business actually grew higher than that, if you do that math. And the answer is, we saw strong growth across all of our regions. Did the Northeast grow at a faster rate? Slightly faster rate, yes. So we saw maybe a bit of a rebound there. But look, our comparisons now in the Northeast region are with 2022. There's been population shifts that some of that population is just not going to come back to the Northeast. Now, we see a stronger growth -- continued stronger growth in the Southeast and the Southwest, and that very much could represent some population shift that we're seeing in the country. The last thing I'd mention, although it didn't influence our Q1 numbers, we did mention the startup of our NewYork-Presbyterian outreach deal that's going well. It's going to be a strong contributor to growth in the East region and will be a strong contributor to our overall growth for the rest of the year. So Sam, do you want to take that? Sam Samad : Yes. And thanks, A.J. On the buyback, so what's assumed in our guidance in terms of adjusted EPS is that we will offset equity dilution in terms of share buybacks. So we'll do enough to offset equity dilution. We are still committed to returning the majority of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. So that's still our commitment. We communicated it on our Investor Day. We're obviously still committed to it. But we also said that we're going to scale share buybacks up and down depending on also the M&A pipeline and the impact that might have on growth and driving our strategy and also our long-term growth. We had -- in the quarter, we talked about -- or at least, recently, we talked about NewYork-Presbyterian and the fact that, that's a $275 million capital deployment. We talked about now today, Haystack and that's an additional capital deployment of $300 million. So we've got good progress here on the M&A front. So that's also why we didn't do any share buyback in Q1. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from Derik de Bruin of Bank of America. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. Good morning. This is John [ph] on for Derek. Jim Davis : Good morning. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, good morning. I wanted to ask about the consumer initiated testing business. in terms of contribution, if you're allowed to say how much contribution you saw monthly in terms of sales and how much of an impact has made on the margins. Just curious if that\u2019s something I should look out for in terms of the margin progression here. Thank you. Jim Davis : Yes. So we are really happy with our consumer-initiated testing performance in the quarter. It showed nice growth from progressive growth from Q4. And so, I'm going to talk about the growth. COVID obviously declined in that segment of our business as well. The majority of our CIT business now is our routine base business. We saw a nice progression from Q4 to Q1. We are happy with that. We saw a nice progression Q1 to Q1, really nice progression there. We continue to be excited about a couple of growth categories within CIT. Number one, you probably read allergy season has really taken off and taken off early. So seeing some nice growth there. Just our general health and wellness offering in CIT was really strong in the quarter. And we surveyed some of those general health and wellness customers and found some interesting things. One of the main reasons they're coming to Quest and paying out of pocket is because patients were -- consumers, patients were having a hard time getting in to see their physicians. We're hearing about three-month delays to get to see their doctor. So rather than wait to see their doctor and get their lab testing, they just come in, because they want to know. And then finally, I'd say, our STD category continues to exhibit very strong growth. The CDC just declared again several types of STDs, gonorrhoea, syphilis at epidemic levels. They also indicated that 50% of all new cases that they're seeing across the country are aged 15 to 24. And that's a segment that wants to remain anonymous and just pay out of pocket for lots of reasons. Finally, as we've said about margins, our CIP business is going to be less dilutive this year than it was last year. And I think you can assume that each quarter through the year. Sam Samad : Yes. So, John, just to add to that, it is dilutive in Q1 to margins. But as Jim said, it's going to improve throughout the year. So that's another aspect of why our margins overall improve, although this one is more modest. Shawn Bevec : Operator, are there any more questions? Jim Davis : All right. Well, I want to thank everyone for joining today, some really exciting news here, but let me just summarize. Look, we're off to a really strong start here in 2023. Our base business performed stronger than expected, stronger than we expected in the quarter. We feel really, really good about that. and it's certainly offsetting some of the COVID decline that we saw in the quarter. Second, hopefully, you can tell, we're really excited about the Haystack Oncology. We think the technology is the right technology, but more importantly, it's the right team. We are really impressed with the team that will join Quest Diagnostics. And as you know, in these types of acquisitions, it's not just investing in the technology, we\u2019re really investing in a group of people and a team, and we feel really, really good about that. We feel great about the MRD space and we believe it's starting to mature from both a physician ordering perspective as well as from a reimbursement perspective. And then, finally, we're well on our way to generating the Invigorate savings that are needed to offset wage inflation, and we feel good about the progress we're making there. So, again, thanks for joining in, and we look forward to seeing you out on the road over the next few months and joining us at our next earnings call in July. So thanks for joining, and have a great day. Operator : Thank you for participating in the Quest Diagnostics First Quarter 2023 Conference Call.

Now I'd like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead, please. Shawn Bevec : Thank you, and good morning. I'm joined by Jim Davis, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and President; and Sam Samad, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and will discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.  For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS. Any references to base business, testing, revenues or volumes refer to the performance of our business excluding COVID-19 testing.  Growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections, including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings growth are compound annual growth rates.  Finally, revenue growth rates from acquisitions will be measured against our base business. Now here is Jim Davis. James Davis : Thanks, Shawn, and good morning, everyone. We had strong base business performance in the second quarter with nearly double-digit revenue growth year-over-year. Demand for our services remains strong across all regions boosted by the collaborations we have formed with health plans, hospitals and physicians amid an environment where people are returning to care.  We are particularly encouraged by the revenue growth in our base business of nearly 10% from our health system customers. Also in the second quarter, we made substantial progress improving the profitability of our base business compared to the first quarter and prior year despite persistently high employee turnover.  Total adjusted operating margin improved more than 170 basis points compared to the first quarter despite a decline of approximately $80 million in COVID revenue.  This morning, I'll discuss highlights from the second quarter, then Sam will provide more detail on our financial results and talk about our updated financial guidance for 2023.  Now let's turn to some of the highlights from the quarter. As we shared at Investor Day, our strategy is to drive growth by continuing to meet the evolving needs of our core customers, physicians, hospitals and consumers as they navigate the changing landscape in health care. We will enable this growth with an intense focus on faster-growing clinical areas, including molecular genomics and oncology.  In addition, acquisitions will continue to be key drivers of our growth. Finally, our strategy includes driving operational improvements across the business with strategic deployment of automation and AI to improve quality, efficiency and service.  So let's review progress we've made in each one of these areas. In Physician Lab Services, we delivered strong base volume growth from physicians, largely through our partnerships with health plans, which have expanded our access to the market. A growing number of these involve value-based arrangements and are generating faster growth and share gains than the traditional relationships. These arrangements position us as a more strategic partner with health plans as we work together on leakage, shared savings and redirection programs.  In addition, NewYork-Presbyterian's recently acquired outreach assets brought us new volume from the physicians.  In Hospital Lab Services, base revenue from health systems grew nearly 10% in the quarter. The Professional Lab Services business had a very strong quarter as we saw solid growth from both new and existing PLS relationships. We are particularly encouraged by progress with our new PLS partnerships with Northern Light Health, Lee Health and Tower Health. As hospitals continue to experience financial challenges, we are here to help whether through professional lab services, reference testing or purchasing the hospital's outreach assets. We are now seeing growing momentum with a significant pipeline of potential deals with large health systems.  In Consumer Health, we had strong base business growth on questhealth.com. We continue to optimize our marketing efforts to target our customers more strategically and now expect consumer-initiated testing to be profitable through the balance of 2023. Also during the quarter, we launched Genetic Insights, our first consumer-initiated genetics health test on questhealth.com. This saliva-based test leverages our expertise in Next-Generation Sequencing to analyze 3 dozen genes for inherited risk of conditions ranging from breast and colon cancer through carrier status for cystic fibrosis and Tay-Sachs. We are encouraged by initial demand for this new offering, which adds to our growing test options for health-minded consumers.  As discussed at Investor Day in March, a key pillar of our strategy is to support faster growth across all customer segments through highly specialized advanced diagnostics. These offerings include molecular genomics and oncology tests such as germline testing to assess prenatal and hereditary genetic risk and somatic testing for tumor sequencing. Advanced Diagnostics also encompasses other key areas, including neurology, women's reproductive health and cardiometabolic health. In neurology, we continue to achieve strong growth from our innovative Quest AD-Detect, portfolio of Alzheimer's blood tests, which help identify early indications of beta amyloid and ApoE status. AD-Detect strongly positions Quest to lead in this rapidly evolving Alzheimer's landscape. Emerging therapies for Alzheimer's represent a new era in treatment and testing for this disease. Like many diseases, early intervention in Alzheimer's may promote better outcomes. Our AD-Detect portfolio enables accessible and convenient evaluation of Alzheimer's risk potentially at early stages and the monitoring of progression. AD-Detect is now available to our physician customers in the U.S., and we believe it also has the potential to generate strong consumer demand.  In addition, we continue to see strong growth in our cardiometabolic, endocrinology, infectious disease and carrier and prenatal genetic screening services. In June, we completed our acquisition of Haystack Oncology, which positions us to enter the high-growth area of minimal residual disease or MRD testing. Haystack has developed a highly sensitive technique for early detection of residual or recurring cancer with the potential to improve outcomes for patients being treated for cancer. The integration of Haystack is on track, and we continue to expect to introduce our first MRD test in early 2024. We intend to launch this test from our Oncology Center of Excellence in Lewisville, Texas, where we also recently introduced our solid tumor expanded panel for tumor sequencing and therapy monitoring.  I'd like to say a little more about our M&A strategy. Haystack is a capabilities acquisition. And as we've said, it will initially be dilutive for earnings per share. However, our primary focus in M&A continues to be on traditional hospital outreach purchases and tuck-in lab deals that are accretive to earnings in the first year.  To underscore what I said earlier, our M&A pipeline is robust as hospital systems faced continued margin pressures due to labor challenges and a shift from inpatient to outpatient care.  Turning to operational and productivity improvement, our Invigorate program is well on its way to delivering our 3% annual productivity savings target. As we discussed at Investor Day, Invigorate includes deploying automation and AI to improve quality, efficiency and service. In the quarter, we implemented our automated microbiology solution in Lenexa, Kansas. Next up is Lewisville, Texas. When complete, 4 of our major laboratories will use automated microbiology lines with embedded artificial intelligence identifying positive and negative cases leading to improved quality and productivity.  We are also excited by results of a pilot in our Clifton lab that showed AI speed data collection in specimen processing and expect to implement this AI solution across all of our major regional labs later this year. In genomics, we're utilizing AI in bioinformatics to improve and speed variant classification and prioritization. These are just a couple of the many examples of our use of AI and automation to continuously improve our operations. In addition, we believe generative AI has great potential to deliver insights and content not only to better target and serve customers, but also to create innovations that help standardize our lab operations. We are encouraged by preliminary results of pilots that use generative AI and our customer service center to automate call their sentiment analysis and quality control and in our marketing operations to improve market research and customer targeting.  Now before I turn it over to Sam, I'll close by saying that we always knew 2023 would be a challenging year as we transitioned away from COVID-19 testing and supported the nation's return to care. Our dedicated employees on the front lines and everyone else who supports them, have done a magnificent job of bringing our purpose to life, working together to create a healthier world, one life at a time. I'm really proud to be leading this Quest Diagnostics' team. And now I'll turn it over to Sam to provide more details on our performance and our updated 2023 guidance. Sam? Sam Samad : Thanks, Jim. In the second quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.34 billion, down 4.7% versus the prior year. Base business revenues grew 9.5% to $2.3 billion while COVID-19 testing revenues declined approximately 88% to $41 million. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services declined 4.9% compared to the prior year, reflecting lower revenue from COVID-19 testing versus the second quarter of 2022, partially offset by strong growth in our base business. Total volume, measured by the number of requisitions, grew 0.2% versus the prior year, with acquisitions contributing 50 basis points to total volume. Total base testing volumes grew 7.4% versus the prior year as we continue to see a broad-based return to care throughout the quarter. Revenue per requisition declined 4.9% versus the prior year, driven by lower COVID-19 molecular volume. Base business revenue per req was up 2.5% due to more tests per req, changes in test mix and benefits recognized with certain value-based arrangements.  Unit price reimbursement was flat in the quarter, consistent with our expectations. Reported operating income in the second quarter was $348 million or 14.9% of revenues compared to $388 million or 15.8% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $389 million or 16.7% of revenues compared to $435 million or 17.7% of revenues last year. The year-over-year decline in adjusted operating income is related primarily to lower COVID-19 testing revenues, partially offset by growth in the base business. Compared to the first quarter, we made strong progress improving the profitability of the business. Adjusted operating margin expanded 170 basis points sequentially while total revenues were essentially flat versus Q1. We also absorbed higher SG&A costs related to an increase in the market value of the obligations in our supplemental deferred comp plan in the second quarter, which lowered adjusted operating margin by 30 basis points. This has no impact on EPS. We continue to closely manage the cost of our corporate and support functions. Since last fall, we have taken a series of actions to reduce support costs, which will save more than $100 million this year.  Those savings largely began in Q2, and we're on track with our estimates in the quarter. Frontline employee turnover improved marginally earlier this year, but the pace of improvement has not met our expectations, and it remains well above historical levels. We continue to feel the effects of the tight labor market, which has had an impact on productivity and wages.  Turnover continues to be a drag on productivity despite the strong base business growth. Reported EPS was $2.05 in the quarter compared to $1.96 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $2.30 compared to $2.36 last year. Cash from operations year-to-date was $538 million versus $882 million in the prior year period. The decline in operating cash flow was primarily related to lower operating income.  Turning to our updated full year 2023 guidance. Revenues are now expected to be between $9.12 billion and $9.22 billion. Base business revenues are expected to be between $8.92 billion and $9.02 billion. COVID-19 testing revenues are expected to be approximately $200 million. Reported EPS is expected to be in a range of $7.52 to $7.92 and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $8.50 to $8.90. Cash from operations is expected to be at least $1.3 billion, and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million.  There are some things to consider for the remainder of the year. We've raised our base business revenue guidance to reflect our strong performance through the first half and our expectations for the remainder of the year. Note that the year-over-year comparison for the base business becomes more difficult in the second half of 2023 as we begin to lap some PLS wins later in the year. Also, we are not expecting demand for respiratory panels to be as strong as we saw in last year's flu season, which could be a headwind to revenue of nearly 100 basis points in the back half.  We expect revenue and adjusted EPS to be more even in the third and fourth quarters, which is a slight departure from our typical earnings seasonality due to the following factors : Unit price reimbursement is expected to improve in the back half. Our CIT business turned profitable in Q2 and is expected to be more accretive to both revenue and earnings as we move throughout the second half of 2023. And cost actions taken throughout the first half of the year will continue to improve the overall profitability of the business. Finally, as I noted earlier, we continue to experience higher frontline turnover and a tight labor market, which has had an impact on productivity and wages. Higher SG&A costs related to our supplemental deferred comp plan also lowered the operating margin by 30 basis points in the first half of 2023, but had no impact on EPS. As a result, our updated guidance reflects an adjusted operating margin of approximately 16.5% for the full year.  With that, I will now turn it back to Jim. James Davis : Thanks, Sam. To summarize, we had strong base business performance in the second quarter with nearly double-digit revenue growth as our collaborations with health plans, hospitals and physicians enabled us to benefit from strong demand amid a broad return to care.  We made substantial progress improving the profitability of our base business compared to the first quarter and prior year. This was slightly offset by persistently high employee turnover, which weighs on productivity and increases cost. And finally, our updated guidance reflects our expectations for revenue growth and improved profitability in the base business. Now we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Jack Meehan : I wanted to start and ask about kind of the health plan commentary. Is it possible to tease out how much of this growth could be share gain related versus just strong underlying demand and somewhat related, we have heard more discussion about national payers being more active around payment integrity. I was just curious if you're seeing that at all, could that be a positive or negative for Quest? James Davis : Yes. Thanks, Jack. So it's always hard to discern in this industry what is share gain versus demand return to care and things like that. We don't get perfect data on it. But our sense is it's some of both. On the share gain side, we look closely at our growth through each of the commercial payers. And when we see gains that are above and beyond the average and we see the benefits of those programs, those value-based programs that we work with them, which is around leakage. It's around focusing on physicians that are using out-of-network labs, we see the benefits of those programs, and therefore, conclude its share gain. Certainly, there's been some strong return to care.  On the Payment Integrity side, I can tell you that, look, it's a never-ending effort here in Quest Diagnostics to continuously work denials, to make sure that we understand the payer policies, what are the diagnostic that support those policies and then work back through our physician base to make sure that the tests that they're ordering are appropriate tests. So we haven't seen any discernible impact with some of those policies you're referring to. But we work collaboratively with the payers to understand them and then work back with our physician base to try to correct any errors. Jack Meehan : Super. Sam, one question on margins. Sorry if I missed this. What is the guide now assume for margins for the year? And can you just talk about what you're assuming in terms of the pace of productivity improvement? Sam Samad : Yes. Thanks, Jack. So we are assuming for the year, operating margins to be at approximately 16.5%. In terms of productivity, you've seen good benefits from our Invigorate program. And we expect those to, if anything, continue for the rest of the year and even accelerate in Q3 and Q4. So we are seeing good momentum on our Invigorate programs. We're seeing the $100 million of SG&A savings that we've talked about. We're seeing those materialize as of the beginning of Q2, and they will continue for the rest of the year as well for a total year impact of $100 million.  On the other side, we are also seeing, as you heard in the prepared remarks, a tough labor and turnover and macro environment. So turnover continues to persist to be higher than we expected, and that's driving pressure also on margins. But we are expecting approximately 16.5% for the year in terms of OM. James Davis : Yes. Jack, I would just add, obviously, you can see the base -- you can see the margin improvement from Q1 to Q2. That comes through pretty clear. You can do the math on the base margin improvements from Q2 of last year to Q2 of this year, when you make the assumptions on the drop-down of the COVID revenue, which you've -- you're in the range with the numbers you've used in the past. So we're really pleased with the base margin improvement from Q2 of last year to Q2 of this year and very pleased with the improvement from Q1 of this year to Q2 of this year. Operator : Our next question is from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI. Elizabeth Anderson : Congrats on a good quarter. My question is, I realized there was a ton of noise this quarter on the deferred comp and how that nets out. How -- could one -- what is your assumption in terms of what's embedded in your guidance for the back half of the year? I appreciate that it can be different based on what happens to the future stock price. But I just want to understand whether it's sort of continuing the forecast of last year's trajectory into this year or 2Q going forward or what have you?  And then secondarily, how do you think about you mentioned the labor productivity and sort of the still elevated turnover. So how do you think about sort of the cost benefit of analysis of perhaps like investing more in wages or something like that versus the productivity gains that you would -- you could potentially receive from that? Sam Samad : Okay. Thanks, Liz, and I appreciate the congrats. So let me talk about DCP deferred compensation, and I'll turn to Jim for productivity and some of the trade-offs that you're referring to there. So in terms of DCP, let me just clarify what it is and the impact.  So first of all, the expense that we saw, which impacts SG&A is the -- related to the increase in the market value of obligations in our supplemental deferred comp plan. That does not have an impact on EPS because it is offset on the nonoperating income line with a benefit. So it's a net neutral on EPS, but it does impact operating margin. Sometimes we don't see it materially impact us. It's related to market movements.  This quarter, it impacted us materially to the tune of 30 basis points impact on operating margin percent. So if you exclude that, it would be our operating margin percent would have been 17%. If you compare it to last year, because last year, and this is where it gets maybe a bit more complicated. But last year, we actually had a benefit in terms of expenses on -- related to deferred compensation, plan market value -- the fair market value change. And so compared to last year Q2, it's an impact of 1%.  So actually, if you compare Q2 2023 OM versus Q2 2022 OM, we would have been relatively flat in terms of operating margin percent quarter-over-quarter last year even despite the drop in COVID revenues, a significant drop to the tune of approximately $300 million that we saw year-over-year in terms of COVID revenues. Now as you look towards the rest of the year, Liz, we don't forecast deferred compensation plan. I mean that's not something that we forecast. We assume it's a net neutral impact, both on the P&L, on EPS and on operating margin. So the impact that we saw in the first half, which is roughly about 50 basis points of operating margin or 30 basis points, I should say, is carried through for the rest of the year. And so that 16.5% full year operating margin is impacted by the DCP in the first half. So that's the best way I can characterize it. James Davis : Yes. And Liz, on the labor front, at Investor Day, we showed a chart that said pre-COVID, our turnover of what we call our frontline roles, which is phlebotomy, logistics, specimen processing, our call centers, was in the 14% range, our total turnover. We showed a chart that said in the fourth quarter, it was upwards of 23%. It's come down modestly in the first part of the year, but still hasn't come down to the levels, obviously, pre-COVID or to where we would like them. Now you're right. It's a trade-off between increasing wage rates and the price -- and the cost you pay for this turnover. We've estimated that each turnover, each person can cost us upwards of $8,000 to $10,000 depending on the role. And that's simply the lost productivity or the time it takes to get somebody from day 1 to as efficient in that role as a person who's been in the role for 2-plus years.  So it's about $8,000 to $10,000 which if you do the math on that, could have upwards of a $20 million impact in the second half of this year. Now we're at the high end of our wage rate guidance that we gave. We said 3% to 4%. We're certainly at that high end. And if we need to make adjustments, we obviously look at the ROI on that. And we're faced with those decisions. And in certain markets, we will make adjustments to get the turnover to a place that we're comfortable with. Operator : Our next question is from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. A.J. Rice: Maybe just to pivot over and ask you about your Health System Business. I think last quarter, you said in aggregate, it was growing about 70%. And this quarter, the press release says it's just under 10%. And I suspect with NewYork-Presbyterian and so forth coming online fully in the back half, it might be even higher than 10%. When you think about your margin targets and what you're shooting for, can you comment on how the growth in that side of the business is impacting margins and the opportunity? And if there's any updated thoughts on the pipeline that you're seeing, maybe give us that as well. James Davis : Yes. Thanks, A.J. Just on the NewYork-Presbyterian book of business, when we buy that outreach book of business, it actually is in our Physician bucket, not our Health System bucket, because it's physician offices, and we build third-party payers for that.  Our Health System business in the quarter was really helped by the PLS side. Our reference book of business was strong as well, but our PLS growth was very, very strong. excited by the 3 deals that we mentioned in the script with Tower Health, Lee Health and Northern Lights being some of the newer ones. So it was -- that generated substantially more growth in the quarter.  Now as we've always said, PLS has slightly lower operating margins than our normal physician office book of business. But we really like the ROIC on that, okay? So it's got a strong return on capital and that's why we continue to do this. So in terms of the outlook, our funnel of opportunities is strong. We hope to have more closed in the second half of this year on both the PLS side as well as new reference wins. So we're optimistic that the Health Systems portion of our business will continue to grow. Sam Samad : Yes. And one additional comment, A.J. So with regards to the expectations in the second half on PLS, as Jim said, we are seeing strong growth in that business. In the second half, from a year-over-year perspective, we had some big wins in the first half of last year as well that ramped up in the second half of last year. So from a year-over-year perspective, we do lap some of those PLS wins and that mutes our revenue growth to some extent. But we're seeing really great momentum on the PLS side of the business. Operator : Our next question is from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Patrick Donnelly : Sam, again, that 16.5%, is that now the right number to work off in terms of the long-term guide? And you talked about a few of the moving parts, the unit pricing, maybe looking a little better, labor hitting it. Any of these things onetime that would wear off? And then on that pricing, I know you guys negotiate kind of 1/4 of the contracts annually. Can you just talk about the pricing environment at the moment? Sam Samad : Yes. No, it's -- so the 16.5% would be the launching point if you're thinking about the 3-year outlook, Patrick, and the improvement that we guided in the -- in Investor Day, which is the 75 to 150 basis point improvement. That's still the right number to be thinking about longer term off of the 16.5% launching point at the end of this year.  In terms of a couple of things that you mentioned, onetime items I think we talked about the DCP, which was more significant in Q2 and for the first half of the year, maybe you can call that onetime. But although it is recurring, but we don't forecast for it. Sometimes it's a benefit. Sometimes it's a negative in terms of an operating margin percent. Last year, in the first half, it was actually a benefit. This year in the first half, it's a negative.  Pricing environment is very good. It's really good. We're seeing good momentum with the health plan value-based contract arrangements that we have. And we expect the pricing environment actually in the second half, where the pricing benefit in the second half to improve versus the first half.  Now as we think about '24, we've talked about before that PAMA is still an uncertainty. And so until we have more certainty around whether there's another PAMA delay or a SALSA bill that gets passed, there's still some uncertainty there for '24. Operator : The next question is from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Brian Tanquilut : Congrats on the quarter. Sam, maybe I'll follow up just on Patrick's question, right? So as I think about your previous comments on 2024 guidance or targets for operating margin, does this push out what you had previously kind of guided to for 2024? And maybe kind of related to that, as I think about the $100 million of corporate savings that you've outlined that began in Q2. I mean is there more to squeeze or is it sort of the target run rate and we're just going to see it flow through the P&L into next year as well? Sam Samad : Yes. So with regards to -- thank you, Brian, first of all, for the question. So with regards to 24, we didn't guide 24. We gave some long-term targets around what we expect our operating margin to look like over the next 3 years as we continue to execute on productivity improvements, Invigorate and apply cost savings into the business. The $100 million that you referred to, which, by the way, next year will be part of our run rate. So we wouldn't expect to see an improvement year-over-year in '24 versus '23 because we're -- except for maybe 1 quarter.  But I would say the 16.5%, as I mentioned to Patrick, becomes the launching point for the future. And we do expect with continued Invigorate offsetting inflation with the cost reductions in the business that we've applied and now will continue and that are generating the expected improvements, we do expect to drive improvement in our operating margins long term. There is the uncertainty about PAMA, which is what drives the range of either 75 to 150 basis points improvement over the 3 years. James Davis : Yes. Then in terms of the cost take out $100 million. Look, we're always looking to be the most efficient we can and obviously, spend every dollar as wisely as we can. But we're also going to continue to invest in this business. We've made strong investments in CIT. And I think as you heard in our script, it's paying off for us. We've got really nice growth out of that. It's now turned profitable. The Alzheimer's test that we've brought to market that requires investment, and we're going to continue to invest in that space. We're going to continue to invest in molecular genomics and oncology because we're getting growth in that space. And with the Haystack acquisition, we're going to continue to invest there to try to get the test to market as quickly as possible and build a stronger presence. So we're always going to balance the 2. But we're investing in this business for the future. Operator : The next question is from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Philip Chickering : There's been a big debate among both the corporates and investors on the sustainability of the current trends of utilization. Can you sort of talk about what you're seeing in July and sorry if I missed this, but how much of the 2Q organic growth was sort of organic versus the PLS transactions? And how should we think about organic growth continuing in the back half of the year? James Davis : Yes. So we're optimistic that the growth will continue here. In the second half of the year, July to date has been strong consistent with what we saw in June. We generally don't break apart our PLS growth from the growth in our core business. We've said externally that our PLS growth is -- our PLS business is about a $600 million franchise. We said the health system market grew at 10%, PLS grew north of that, reference grew less than that.  So I think you can get a sense for what that contributes to our total growth. But we're optimistic on the prospects with our health systems. The funnel of PLS opportunities remain strong. Health systems need our help, and we think we've got a great offering that helps meet their needs. Sam Samad : And Pito, maybe I can give a couple of additional comments on sort of second half versus first half, which is I think, where you're driving at here. So listen, we've had a great first half, close to 10% revenue growth. But as you think about the second half, there are a couple of things to keep in mind. First of all, we had some easier compare in the first half versus 2022. Obviously, we were in the midst of COVID, base business was impacted by that. So there was some easier compare in the first half that we don't expect to repeat in the second half.  On the prepared remarks, we talked about the COVID flu panel, which is about a 1% negative impact on growth in the second half, definitely compared to the first half. We talked about lapping some PLS wins, which also has a muting effect on our growth in the second half. So when you factor all of these combined, obviously, you can look at our implied growth in the second half based on guidance and it's well lower than the first half, and it's driven by some of these factors that I just gave you.  In terms of July, we are still seeing higher than our traditional utilization. So we're still encouraged by what we're seeing in terms of utilization in July. So -- but we're being appropriately conservative in the second half in terms of what the utilization would look like. Operator : The next question is from Andrea Alfonso with UBS. Kevin Caliendo : It's Kevin Caliendo. So I guess, if I can just bridge all this, if we just take -- go back to the starting point with 17% and then the operating margin then went to 16.8% with Haystack, now it's 16.5%, and we had this sort of onetime issue in the quarter with DCP, which took that down. But you're also calling out some labor trend issues. Maybe -- is the delta the expectation around the labor cost and churn? Like is there a way to quantify that? And should we expect that to continue going forward? I'm just trying to bridge all of these things and then think about the impact of '24 how we get the sort of margin expansion that was originally expected for '24 with these sort of headwinds that are playing out? James Davis : Yes, Kevin, let me take the labor piece, and then I'll turn it over to Sam here. So on a previous question, we talked about pre-COVID, our attrition rate of our frontline positions was in the 14% range. In December, Q4 it was 23%. The chart we showed at Investor Day in March, it's slightly better than that. We have quantified it. We've said it's about $8,000 to $10,000 per employee. And in the second half of the year, we think it can be upwards of a $20 million impact versus where we would want it to be at this point in the year. So now, is the labor market is easy? Unemployment rate sits at 3.6% right now. The Fed has signaled that they're trying to actually get the unemployment rate back upwards of up to 4.1%, 4.5%. The interest rates are going to take a notch up again today. So we think there's going to be easing in the markets going forward, but it's hard to predict. And so right now, I think we're being appropriately conservative on the guidance in the second half. Sam Samad : Yes. And so Kevin, let me give you some commentary around second half versus first half margins and why you should have confidence in the margin outlook that we gave, the approximately 16.5% for the year.  So first of all, and just to remind everybody, in Q2, our margins expanded by 170 basis points sequentially despite an $80 million drop in COVID, roughly $80 million drop in COVID. So we had some great momentum in terms of operating margin.  As we look towards second half versus first half, here are some of the dynamics that you should factor. Our CIT business, which was net dilutive on operating margins in the first half, becomes accretive in the second half. So we expect to see that business -- as we're very encouraged by the momentum and it becomes actually, it's become profitable in Q2, and it's going to be accretive for the second half of the year. Pricing is a net -- also net accretive and will continue to improve in the second half, and it's definitely a step-up from the first half.  SG&A, we started to achieve those $100 million annualized savings in Q2. And so we expect to achieve the remainder in Q3 and Q4, we didn't have that benefit in Q1 of this year. We talked about DCP, and I don't want to focus too much on that, but it was a headwind in the first half, which we don't expect in the second half. Offsetting that is the fact that we have some lower COVID revenues in the second half because right now per our guidance, we're expecting approximately $40 million in the second half, which is definitely well south of the $160 million that we achieved in the first.  So -- but as you look at this momentum of all of these things, plus the ramp-up of Invigorate improvements that we expect to see in the second half -- and yes, there is some Haystack dilution, which is to the tune of about $0.15 to $0.20 for the year. But as you look at all of these factors, we are very confident about the ability to achieve the outlook that we gave in terms of operating margins. James Davis : Kevin, the last thing I'd add is when you think about price in this business, we tend to always think about commercial payers, Medicare and Medicaid. You have to remember that there's another $2.5 billion on an annual basis where we price directly to Health Systems, to Physicians. And then we have $800 million worth of other businesses between employer solutions, our drug testing business, our wellness business, and our ExamOne business, which serves life insurance companies.  So we are getting price in those segments of our business. And as Sam indicated, our price performance will be better in the second half than it was in the first half primarily from the lift we're getting on that side of our portfolio. Operator : And our next question is from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Lisa Gill : I just want to go back to your earlier comments around value-based care where you talked about leakage out-of-network opportunities. But can you maybe just talk about how you see this over time and how you see the evolution of value-based care as it pertains to lab. Is this a margin-enhancing opportunity or just more of a volume opportunity? One, how do I think about that? And then just secondly, I've heard you talk about the pipeline of Health Systems. Is there any way to size what that current pipeline looks like? James Davis : Yes. So on the first question, I just want to make sure we're not confusing terminology here, value-based care and value-based incentives. So when we talk about value-based care, these are generally arrangements where Medicare has put lives directly into these ACO reach programs for Medicare Advantage plans delegate lives into large integrated physician groups.  Now in both of those situations, we are contracting directly with these ACO REACH organizations and directly with these large physician groups. And we believe that those value-based care programs that Medicare and Medicare Advantage are driving are very good for the lab business because generally, they delegate lives at a fixed price, and in fact, labs become much more useful in terms of helping physicians ensure that diseases and conditions do not progress. So we feel good about that.  I think what we're generally -- when we talk about the health plans and we talk about these things called value-based incentives. So these are programs that we structure with the health plans to help them reduce leakage to out-of-network labs and to help us redirect requisitions that are flowing into more expensive health system laboratories and have those requisitions flow directly into Quest Diagnostics.  So when we are successful in those efforts, there can be value-based incentives that we earn when we help them earn the -- when we achieve those targets of reducing leakage and moving work from higher-priced hospital labs into independent labs like Quest Diagnostics. So we seek to do more of both of those programs, value-based care programs with ACO REACH and these value-based incentive programs with our large payers. Operator : And our last question is from Eric Coldwell with Baird. Eric Coldwell : I have two. First one, a bit higher level, more strategic. So United Healthcare Preferred Lab Network was updated in July. I saw that they removed Mayo, but were there any other notable changes in that contract or your relationship there? And then broadly on that same topic, what's the outlook for other MCO opportunities to narrow networks or move the National Labs like you and LabCorp into, say, more preferred roles? Are there opportunities being discussed in the market today? James Davis : Yes. So on the first part of your question, we did not note any other notable changes with respect to the preferred lab network. We still remain part of that preferred plan network, and that's our plan going forward. In terms of narrowing networks, when we speak to all our commercial payers, we always think it's better, from their perspective, to have both independent labs in network that actually improves their ability to make sure that requisitions are going to lower cost, lower price environments, which is good for the payer. It's good for the employer, and it's good for the patient. And so we don't see any change in that trend to narrow networks that restrict access to independent laboratories.  Now having said that, there's laboratories that play on the fringe that could be expensive single-type test environments. And I think the payers are always looking at specialty labs versus independent labs that can do some of that specialty work as well. Eric Coldwell : Okay. My other question, and I apologize if I think you got close to answering this a few times, and I've been toggling a couple of events this morning. But did you quantify or could you quantify the reduction in investment spending seen year-over-year in the second quarter and also the portion of the incremental $100 million plus cost action that you actually captured in 2Q. So we have a sense on what's left for the rest of the year. Sam Samad : Yes. Sure, Eric. So no, we didn't quantify the reduction in investment spend. We did have lower investment spend in Q2 versus Q2 of last year, but we haven't quantified how much it is.  With regards to the SG&A benefits and the $100 million, I think the assumption that you can make is it's about 1/3 of that $100 million that was realized in Q2 and we expect the same to occur in Q3 and Q4. James Davis : Yes. I just want to remind, we're going to continue to invest for growth in this business. As we mentioned, again in the script, we've invested in CIT, and we're really starting to see the fruits of that investment. We look at a metric called return on ad spend, it's now positive. So we're going to continue to invest there because we believe it's driving growth, and it's now driving profitable growth.  We talked about our Alzheimer's portfolio of tests. We're going to continue to invest in that area. These blood-based tests, we have the AB42, 40 test up and running. We have the ApoE up and running. These are blood-based tests. These are going to be more useful than CSF or PET scans and less costly to the environment. We're going to continue to invest in the molecular side of our business. We're going to continue to invest in the oncology business. And that's going to -- all of these things are going to position us for the higher growth segments of the laboratory industry and ensure our long-term outlook. Operator : We did have one more question come in. Our last question is from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Unidentified Analyst : This is John on for Derik. We talked about this quite a bit, but talked about the focus of the M&A pipeline will be on the deals you've traditionally done before. And it seems you certainly have plenty to come in the coming quarters and you have lots of balance. And of course, you're investing in Alzheimer's portfolio and whatnot. But as you look to launch your first MRD product in 2024, could you talk about potential deals or products that you can -- you see would complement your current oncology portfolio that you don't have in your current internal pipeline? James Davis : Well, we think with the combination of Haystack, which, as you noted, is centered on minimally residual disease testing post cancer diagnosis. And we brought up our own internal assay for therapy selection. So from a therapy monitoring and therapy selection standpoint, we believe we're very well positioned for future growth. We continue to invest on the genetics side of our business, hereditary genetics, genetic offerings for diagnostic purposes and then the family planning and prenatal genetics is also an area that continues to receive focus.  So we believe we're well positioned on the cancer side. We continue to make some investments on the genetic side and that's where the -- we think we're well positioned. Now again, our focus right now, we'll continue to focus on hospital outreach deals and other small tuck-ins that are accretive to our business. Operator : That was our last question. James Davis : All right. Well, thank you, everyone. We -- again, I believe we had a strong quarter here. The outlook for the second half. We've taken up our revenue guidance, feel good about that, and thank you for supporting Quest Diagnostics. Have a great day.

Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. I would like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead, please. Shawn Bevec : Thank you, and good morning. I'm joined by Jim Davis, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; and Sam Samad, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and will discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS. Any references to base business, testing, revenues or volumes refer to the performance of our business excluding COVID-19 testing. Growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections, including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings growth are compound annual growth rates. Finally, revenue growth rates from acquisitions will be measured against our base business.  Now here is Jim Davis. Jim Davis : Thanks, Shawn, and good morning, everyone. We grew our base business nearly 5% in the third quarter, largely by driving growth in our physician and hospital channels. Our consumer channel also continued to produce solid base business revenue growth. In addition, we are pleased that we have now successfully completed negotiations for all our strategic health plan renewals that were scheduled for this year. These strength and collaborations will position us to build on growth opportunities going forward our Invigorate program is on track to deliver 3% annual productivity improvements and savings. In addition, the productivity of our base business improved sequentially and year-over-year. Given the strength of our business and a robust pipeline of professional lab services and M&A opportunities, we are well positioned for continued growth. This morning, I'll discuss highlights from the third quarter, then Sam will provide more details on our financial results and talk about our updated financial guidance for 2023. Now let's turn to some of the highlights from the quarter. Our strategy is to drive growth by continuing to meet the evolving needs of our core customers, physicians, hospitals and consumers. We are enabling growth across our customer channels through advanced diagnostics with an intense focus on faster-growing clinical areas, including molecular genomics and oncology. In addition, acquisitions remain a key driver of our growth with an emphasis on accretive hospital outreach purchases as well as smaller independent labs. Finally, our strategy includes driving operational improvements across the business with strategic deployment of automation and AI to improve quality, efficiency and service. Here are a few key updates on the progress we have made in these areas. In Physician Lab Services, we delivered mid-single-digit base business revenue growth driven by the strength in our cardiometabolic and general health and wellness testing. Our strong relationships with health plans were also a key driver in the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we successfully completed negotiations for all our strategic health plan renewals that were scheduled for this year. Our success is a result of the clinical and economic value we deliver to health plans and their members. Today, more than 50% of the health of the health plan revenues are generated from these value-based contracts, which are fueling double-digit growth compared to our traditional health plan contracts. Together with the health plans, we have a renewed focus on initiatives to reduce leakage to high-cost out-of-network labs. In addition, we are working together to redirect volume from high-cost labs to Quest. Importantly, this is good for both patients and employers which are paying for the majority of health care costs. In hospital lab services, base revenues grew high single digits in the quarter as we saw strength in hospital reference testing and continued progress with our most recent PLS relationships, including Northern Light Health, Lee Health and Tower Health. Our hospital strategy is to help health systems improve productivity and patient care by delivering innovative laboratory testing that is high quality, accessible and affordable. We continue to manage a robust pipeline of professional lab services and hospital outreach acquisition opportunities. Health systems continue to face labor and cost pressures, which are prompting more of them to reach out to us for help with their lab strategy and in some cases, monetize their hospital outreach business. Our professional lab services can help manage hospitals labs, supply chain and workforce. We are also providing insights from our analytical solutions to guide hospitals to deliver the right test to the right patient at the right time. In addition, hospital outreach acquisitions enable health systems to focus their expertise and capital on the areas of their business that support patient care and drive growth. In Consumer Health, we generated solid base business revenue growth from our consumer-initiated testing channel in the quarter. In addition, our consumer channel was again profitable this quarter. We attribute the strong performance to continuing demand for our expanded test menu, including STIs, comprehensive health and tuberculosis blood testing. Underpinning each of these key channels, physician, hospital and consumer is our advanced diagnostics. These highly innovative higher-growth test areas include molecular genomics and oncology as well as several other key areas. During the quarter, we grew revenues double digits in multiple clinical areas including neurology, women's and reproductive health, cardiometabolic and infectious disease and immunology. We are particularly encouraged by growth in our Alzheimer's disease portfolio, which features our AD-Detect blood testing services. These innovative services use highly sensitive mass spectrometry technologies to provide insight into Alzheimer's risk based on amyloid proteins and the APOE genetic risk marker. During the quarter, we saw strong demand for our Alzheimer's cerebral spinal fluid panel as well, which helps providers identified levels of both amyloid and tau proteins as well as the APOE status. We also grew significantly in women's and reproductive health, especially in non-invasive prenatal and carrier screening tests. During the quarter, the FDA granted breakthrough designation for our adeno-associated virus called AAV companion diagnostic, which we developed in collaboration with Sarepta Therapeutics for the Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene therapy. This FDA designation places us at the forefront of AAV test innovation in the growing area of cell and gene therapies and positions us to build collaborations with other biopharmaceutical companies. Finally, the integration of Haystack Oncology remains on track. The acquisition positions us to enter the high-growth liquid biopsy area of minimal residual disease or MRD testing. We expect to launch our first MRD test in early 2024 from our Oncology Center of Excellence in Lewisville, Texas. Now turning to operational and productivity improvement. Our Invigorate program is well on its way to delivering our targeted 3% annual productivity improvements and savings. I'd like to share 3 examples of how we're improving operations. First, we are deploying front-end automation to enhance specimen processing in our Pittsburgh and Dallas laboratories, which will improve quality and productivity. More sites are planned to receive front-end automation during 2024. We are expanding the use of optical character recognition, or OCR, to scan in data from samples coming into our labs. By freeing up specimen processors from this manual data entry, we will improve our productivity of paper-based recs coming into all of our regional labs by 30%. Finally, we continue to optimize our real estate footprint. Post pandemic, we need less space for some of our call center and administrative functions. We've reduced our real estate footprint by nearly 250,000 square feet by consolidating functions into existing spaces. Before I hand it over to Sam, I'd like to offer our perspective on the rule recently proposed by the Food and Drug Administration that would regulate laboratory developed tests as medical devices. Lab developed tests are essential medical innovations that providers use to guide care for patients every day. These services are highly regulated under federal legislation known as CLIA. In addition to the oversight by states, accredited bodies and Medicare as it makes coverage determinations. If enacted, the FDA's proposed rule would impact patient care by compromising access, slowing diagnostic innovation and adding unnecessary cost to our health care system. We agree with the long-standing assertion of our trade association, ACLA, that the FDA does not have the statutory authority to unilaterally regulate LDTs under its existing medical device authority. Now I'll turn it over to Sam to provide more details on our performance and our updated 2023 guidance. Sam Samad : Quarter consolidated revenues were $2.3 billion, down 7.7% versus the prior year. Base business revenues grew 4.6% to $2.27 billion while COVID-19 testing revenues declined 92% to $26 million. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services declined 7.9% compared to the prior year reflecting lower revenue from COVID-19 testing versus the third quarter of 2022, partially offset by growth in our base business. Total volume, measured by the number of requisitions, declined 0.5% versus the prior year, with acquisitions contributing 50 basis points to total volume. Total base testing volumes grew 5.7% versus the prior year. Revenue per requisition declined 7.2% versus the prior year, driven by lower COVID-19 molecular volume. Base business revenue per rec declined 0.4% due to growth in our PLS relationships and lower demand for respiratory panels, partially offset by an increase in unit price reimbursement and test mix. Positive unit price reimbursement was consistent with our expectations. Reported operating income in the third quarter was $342 million or 14.9% of revenues compared to $392 million or 15.8% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $380 million or 16.6% of revenues compared to $423 million or 17% of revenues last year. The year-over-year decline in adjusted operating income is related primarily to lower COVID-19 testing revenues, wage increases and higher benefit costs, partially offset by growth in the base business, lower performance-based compensation and headcount reductions. We continue to closely manage the cost of our corporate and support functions and our actions to reduce support costs by approximately $100 million this year remain on track. Reported EPS was $1.96 in the quarter compared to $2.17 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $2.22 compared to $2.36 last year. Cash from operations year-to-date was $745 million versus $1.38 billion in the prior year period. The decline in operating cash flow was primarily related to lower operating income and timing of collections. Turning to our updated full year 2023 guidance. Revenues are now expected to be between $9.19 billion and $9.24 billion. Base business revenues are expected to be between $8.99 billion and $9.04 billion. COVID-19 testing revenues are expected to be approximately $200 million. Reported EPS narrowed to be in a range of $7.61 to $7.71 and adjusted EPS narrowed to a range of $8.65 to $8.75 with the midpoint of $8.70, unchanged. Cash from operations is expected to be approximately $1.3 billion and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million. With that, I will now turn it back to Jim. Jim Davis : Thanks, Sam. To summarize, we delivered solid base business revenue growth of nearly 5% in the quarter. We successfully completed negotiations for all of our strategic health plan relationships that were scheduled for this year. We also drove improved productivity in our base business as we have done throughout 2023. Finally, given the strength of our base business, combined with a robust pipeline of professional lab services and M&A opportunities, we are well positioned for continued growth ahead. And now we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities. Ann Hynes : Can you just comment on progress on what's happening with the turnover? And do you still feel good about your 16.5% margin goal for 2023? Jim Davis : Yes, the employee turnover, again, improved from Q2 to Q3. So we're certainly seeing improvements as we've marched from Q1 to Q2 to Q3 and expect to see more improvements as we go to Q4. Having said that, we're still not back to 2019 or pre-COVID levels. But we feel optimistic that as we go into next year, it will actually be a continued tailwind for us. Sam, do you want to comment on... Sam Samad : Yes, sure. Ann, thanks for the question. So as you recall on the Q2 call, we talked about operating margin expectations being approximately 16.5%. As Jim mentioned, we're seeing slight improvements in terms of turnover. We have made some investments and are going to be making some investments in terms of frontline phlebotomist in anticipation of volumes coming into the winter season here, but also the strong utilization that we've seen. And with regards to margins, we now expect to be slightly below the approximately 16.5% for the year. We're making really good progress on all the cost initiatives and also the productivity improvement initiatives. Volumes have been strong, but we -- especially in light of volumes, we have to make some targeted investments in terms of frontline staff and phlebotomist. Jim Davis : Yes. Ann, let me just make one other comment on the margins. If you go back and start with Q1 of this year. In Q1, we were just slightly north of 15% and in that quarter, we did $120 million of COVID revenue. And as you know, the reimbursement was still at $100 that quarter. We go to the second quarter, and we improved our margins up to 16.7%, with COVID going from $120 million down to $41 million. And then the second quarter COVID was at a blended rate of, call it, $75. Now we go back into the third quarter and COVID is really insignificant in our results. It's only 1% of our total revenue and the reimbursement on that small 1%, as you know, for the whole quarter was at $50. And we hit 16.6%, so basically in line with Q2, so we're really proud of the productivity efforts and it's really coming through in these numbers and the progress that the teams have made from Q1 to Q2 to Q3. Operator : And our next call is David Westenberg with Piper Sandler. David Westenberg : So just -- thank you for the commentary on the FDA's proposal on LDTs. I'm not sure if you can answer it yet because, I mean, right now, it's still kind of maybe a little bit more hypothetical here. But how should we anticipate potential cost if it stands the way it is. I mean, is this about going back to the FDA with some of the more high-value tests? Or is this maybe about switching out to maybe IVD-cleared products. I mean how does this look for Quest and I get some of this is maybe theoretical right now because we don't know what it's going to look like in a month. Jim Davis : Yes. I think your last statement is accurate. It's largely theoretical at this point because we don't know what it's going to look like. And the FDA certainly opened this up to commentary and response back from industry and ACLA and other associations. Look, having said all that, LDTs are not the most significant part of our operations. In fact, it's -- on a volume basis, it's less than 10% of what we do. And the 3 labs that we do are LDTs, most -- the majority of our LDTs in are actually ISO certified. We do companion diagnostics, which is a regulated form of testing, right? You're on label for a pharmaceutical drug, so it's just not -- it's not a huge deal for us right now. Now having said all that, we're going to work with our trade association. We don't believe the rule makes sense. We don't believe it's fair. And we'll continue to work to arrive at something that we do think is good for everyone. Operator : And our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JP Morgan. Lisa Gill : I'm just curious if you have an update as to how we should think about PAMA or SALSA going into 2024 given the current environment in DC. James Davis : Well, you're right, the current environment is a little uncertain at this point. But here's what I would say. The current standstill in Congress, I think we'll make what we call a comprehensive PAMA reform more difficult, right? So SALSA, I think, will be more difficult to get through this year. Having said all that, PAMA, a delay in the cuts of PAMA, again, went to the CBO. So this is a new analysis from the CBO updated versus last year. And again, the CBO scored a 1-year delay as a significant cost savings to the government. And again, the reasons for that is because if you continue to delay the PAMA cuts, you're going to continue to delay a new data collection process. And we, our trade association and obviously, the CBO is convinced that a new data collection process will lead to higher rates. So we feel good that the likelihood of a fourth PAMA delay will occur. But certainly, it has to be part of some broader health care package. And there's a lot of things that will be in that health care package that are important to a lot of different constituencies. So we're confident that something will get done there. Operator : Our next question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Kieran Ryan : You've got Kieran Ryan on for Pito. Just looking at the sequential margin progression implied from 3Q to 4Q this year. It looks like it's materially better than kind of what you averaged in that pre-COVID 2017 -- 2019 range. So is that just really the tailwinds you have around CIT Invigorate better turnover and lower deferred comp just combining to drive better trends than normal. And I was just wondering, is there any offset there on some of these oil and commodity-related costs that we've seen step-up relatively recently? Sam Samad : Yeah, Kiran, this is Sam. Thanks for the question. So I think some of the drivers that you would expect in Q4 are, you know, what we've been executing and seeing in Q3 and earlier in the year. I mean, Jim talked about the sequential improvement in operating margins despite the fact that COVID is coming down significantly. So what we would expect in Q4 is the following that helps our margins, which has been playing out so far over the course of the year. One is price. We continue to see a healthy positive environment around price and we, in fact, saw positive price in Q3, and we expect to see positive price in Q4. And that's driven by all the work that we're doing around the strategic plan, the third-party plan renewals and some of the value-based contracting that we're doing there. So definitely, the healthiest pricing environment that we've seen in a while. CIT, as you said, is a factor. It was dilutive in the first quarter. It turned profitable in the second quarter. It was profitable in the third, and we expect it to be profitable again in the fourth. We continue to do the cost -- I mean, we see the benefit of the cost reductions in Q4. We talked about $100 million of annual impact of cost reductions on the SG&A line, and we expect to see that at least 1/3 of that be in Q4 as well because those savings started in Q2 and then we're taking a lot of actions as well around improving productivity. Invigorate is one of them that you mentioned, but that's also factoring into margin. So all of that is driving the better than pre-pandemic trends that you've talked about. Now as I said earlier, we are still seeing turnover in -- higher than what we would expect. It has improved slightly in Q3, but it is still trending higher than where it was pre-pandemic. And as I said, given the strong utilization that we're seeing across the business, and we saw that in Q3 as well, we're having to make some targeted increases across frontline staff and phlebotomists to help service some of these volumes. And we expect that to be an impact in Q4 and offsetting more of a headwind of an impact. Operator : Our next caller is Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore. Elizabeth Anderson : I guess I just want to double click on the gross margin a little bit more in the third quarter. I think in different answers, you've given us bits and pieces. But if you could just talk either sequentially or on a year-over-year basis, sort of rank or either if you have dollar amounts or sort of rank order the biggest contributing factors? And then secondly, it sounds like you have some good sightline into the Invigorate savings in fourth quarter and some continued productivity initiatives. How do we think about the flow-through on sort of that -- as we start to think about 2024 and sort of what we might be expecting from those sort cost saving in Invigorate programs? Sam Samad : Yes. Thank you. So with regards to gross margin, gross margins in Q3 were in line with our expectations. I mean, the key driver, I would say, for them being below Q2 levels, were the fact that we had lower revenues of $45 million going in Q3 versus Q2. So sequentially, we saw a $45 million lower revenues. Now a portion of that was COVID, not the biggest portion. It was about roughly $15 million lower revenues in terms of COVID. And then because of seasonality, as expected, we saw lower revenues on the base [Technical Difficulty] as well. So when you think about the impact on gross margins and gross margins were down a percentage point sequentially, that's almost entirely driven by revenue, the revenue decline. And then on COVID, we're also talking about -- or what we are seeing in Q3 was a lower price around COVID. In Q2, driven by the fact that the PHE didn't end until midway through the quarter, we saw a higher price on average for COVID, we saw a lower price in Q3. So that has an impact on gross margin as well. So those are the key drivers on gross margin. It's in line with our expectations. Invigorate, and Jim will make a couple of comments on Invigorate here. But with regards to Invigorate the actions are yielding the 3% productivity improvements and cost reductions that we expected. And those will continue into 2024. But Jim, maybe make a couple of comments. Jim Davis : Yes, certainly, Elizabeth. So we're going to set targets going into 2024 that are similar to what we've done in the past. So we expect to generate approximately 3% variable cost productivity throughout our entire operations. That's phlebotomy, logistics, the front end of our lab and then actually all of the processing. We've talked broadly about the use of automation. We're Driving that as fast and furious as we can. We've talked about the use of artificial intelligence to do some of the manual work that our lab text, this could be automated reading of curves. We've talked about in the past, the use of artificial intelligence and microbiology, hematology, urinalysis, and then we continue to work the standard things that we always work as a business, reimbursement and denials is always a big bucket of opportunity for us. Paper [reqs], I talked in the prepared remarks about implementing OCR technology to read all of these paper [reqs] that still come in. We work them down every single year, but there's still a fair number. Even if it's 15% to 20%, when you do the math on that, close to 200 million rec, there's still a ton of opportunity there. So we feel good about our productivity efforts going into next year. We invest in it. We put talented teams around it, and we'll continue to drive it hard. Operator : Next caller is Derik De Bruin from Bank of America. Derik De Bruin : I've got two. The first one, just going back to PAMA. In 2023, it got delayed, and I think it will probably get delayed in '24. But in '23, we didn't see a lot of the savings dropped down to the bottom line because of Haystack and some of the other investments that you're doing. I guess, for '24, does that drop down, if we're to get delayed, i.e., is it accretive to what your plans would be is that you're going to do it? Or does it get offset by that? So that's the first one. And then I've got a follow-up. Jim Davis : Yes. Well, first, I'd say with respect to the drop down, when we look at the drop-down on the incremental growth we've gotten through our base business and we look at the drop-down on that growth, we're pretty happy with it, okay? And that is after the dilution effect that we've seen from Haystack, the investments we're making there, which are going to propel future growth. As we go into next year, we will take -- we're not going to give guidance today, but we're going to take a close look if PAMA does get delayed, we'll obviously look at both investment opportunities to drive future growth. We'll look at investment opportunities to drive margin improvement, Invigorate investments. And then we'll also obviously look at returning like we always do, the majority of our free cash to shareholders. Derik De Bruin : And just a follow-up on the Alzheimer's diagnostics, are you going to seek FDA approval for that? I'm just sort of curious on reimbursement, patient cost, what's the test cost in doing it? I'm just curious on sort of what your strategy is there given that it is a new diagnostic category. Jim Davis : Okay. So there is reimbursement for the test today. CMS has established about $100 reimbursement for the blood-based AD 4240 test. Having said all that, the preponderance of our orders and the preponderance of our reimbursement actually comes from client build, where we directly bill health systems that are carrying for these patients. And I would tell you that the reimbursement is better than what we see on average from Medicare because it's an incredibly value-added test. So we price it appropriately. At this point, we're not seeking FDA approval for it, it's an LDT like many of the LDTs that we run. And so, we're pretty happy with it. The growth has been substantial and I would also tell you that the growth of our CSF testing, the cerebral spinal fluid testing is also significantly up in the quarter as clinicians are using both CSF and blood-based biomarkers to make to help with the diagnosis of patients. Sam Samad : And Derek, maybe just to come back to the PAMA question and add a couple of points there for you and others that are on the call. Given the uncertainty around PAMA, we will plan today as if PAMA is going to come back and will not be delayed in 2024. I'd say that's the prudent thing to do. That's the only thing we can do at this stage given the uncertainty. So we will plan as if prices will come down next year because PAMA will come back. Now if -- as we -- I would say, on balance, I'd say there's a likely chance that PAMA will get delayed. And if that were to happen, and as we've talked about before, we could see an $80 million to $90 million benefit as a result of that delay, not benefit versus this year, but benefit versus our planning. And when that -- and if that happens, I should say, then we will assess how much we invest in the business to everything that Jim said earlier to how much potentially could drop to the bottom line to EPS. But that decision is not made yet. We'll make that decision when we set guidance. And will evaluate investments that we can make and then evaluate what we can drive as EPS improvement. Operator : Our next caller is Andrew Brackmann with William Blair. Andrew Brackmann : Jim, I want to go back to your comments around reducing leakage to high cost labs. I think you talked about in your opening remarks. I know that's sort of part of the strategy here, but can you maybe just sort of talk about that opportunity broadly and just sort of quantify how big that could be for your growth going forward? Jim Davis : Yes. I think there's 2 buckets of opportunity there. One is reducing leakage to out-of-network labs. And then the second is what I would call steerage of work from high-priced in-network labs generally in health systems to independent labs like Quest Diagnostics. So generally 2 different initiatives, but it really starts with just very strong and tight collaboration with our commercial payers. We work hand-in-hand with them. They provide us the information on what physicians are using out-of-network high-priced laboratories, and they provide us the information that what doctors are sending work into health system labs, which, as you know, not good for patients who are going to pay higher deductibles, higher co-pays and obviously not good for the people that are paying for the health care in general, that's still employers in the country. So it's a really tight partnership. We get the information. We distribute that information out to our commercial team. We call on the customers, try to convince them to move the work. At the same time, we're always messaging as are the commercial payers out to patients to remind them that they can save money by using independent labs like Quest Diagnostics. We continue to message physicians and providers, and that's why we're seeing significantly higher growth rates with the commercial plans where we have established these types of relationships. Operator : Our next caller is Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Kevin Caliendo : Congrats on the contract renewals with your major payer partners. Can you maybe talk a little bit about if there's anything new in the contracts, the duration of the contracts? Is there -- the last time you did this, there were incentives that actually benefited you in terms of driving volumes. Just wondering if anything has changed, both positively or negatively, pricing, duration, terms, incentives, that kind of thing? Jim Davis : Yes. We generally don't talk about the terms, duration and things like that. But what I will tell you is that the trend continues. We seek to establish a fair price first and foremost. And then second, as I just mentioned in the previous question, where we can move these requisitions and improve our share of the commercial payer spend. We try to design incentives around that. In addition, we try to design incentives, when we do a hospital outreach acquisition and the prices go from 300% of Medicare as an example down to our rates, we try to step those rates down over a period of time so that we derive benefit and the commercial plan derives benefit. So we work hard to build those types of incentives into the agreement and I think the trend just continues in the direction we want. Kevin Caliendo : Does this lead to sort of more value-based care potential for you guys going forward? Jim Davis : Well, I separate again, value-based care from value-based contracts. These are what we call value-based contracts, meaning when we deliver value back to the commercial payer, there can be incentive payments involved in that. When we talk about value-based care, these are really our arrangements with some of these ACO reach organizations and some of the other large physician groups that have taken on risk from Medicare Advantage plans. And we continue to embed ourselves when these within these ACO reach programs and continue to work closely with large physician groups that take on this risk. And as we said in the past as we said in the past, when these types of relationships are really good for the lab industry, they -- if you're managing risk, you're managing the cost of health care to a fixed number every year, you're generally going to be incented to provide early care and early diagnostics so that you don't let disease progress into more expensive inpatient care and we continue to work towards that. Operator : Our next caller is Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Jack Meehan : I have a couple of cleanup questions for Sam. First is on collections. So seeing a little AR build? I know you called it out, but anything -- any color you can add on that? And then second is on the base growth, 5% pretty good. I was just wondering if weather weekdays had any impact could have actually been better on an underlying basis? Sam Samad : Yes. Sure. I'll take the first one, Jack, and Jim will talk a little bit about the -- any one-timer, so to speak, whether days. Listen, collections nothing of note there. I think AR trending or DSO is trending a bit up. That's really more normal trends given the reduction in COVID. With COVID, I think that would help our DSOs overall a shorter collection window and DSOs were down as a result of a higher mix of COVID. But if you look back to pre-pandemic, I think the DSOs are kind of trending back to where they were pre-pandemic. So really nothing of note there. There's some timing at the end of Q3 as well, but that's just normal timing within quarters. So I would say, in general, collections are on track, and we're happy with where things are. But Jim, did you want to make a couple of comments around base earning growth and any one-timers? Jim Davis : Yes, weather and days and things like that, versus last year, weather was a slight help I mean, not significant at all, Jack, but it was a slight help because last year's hurricane in September was worse than this year's hurricane. The only other comment on days that I would make is early in the quarter in July. The fourth of July fell on a Tuesday this year versus a Monday last year. So in essence, your Monday and Tuesday are really, really bad days versus a year ago. You only had one bad day called a Monday because the fourth fell on a Monday. But again, that's one day out of 90. So yes, I mean, a little bit of an impact there, but not that significant. Operator : Our next caller is Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Patrick Donnelly : Maybe a couple of follow-ups on Haystack. It sounds like still a 24 time line there. Can you just talk about I guess, any more specific timing and the catalyst set there when we could expect to see some data? And then just also the spend expectations related to getting that through the approval process as we work our way through \u201824 would be helpful. Jim Davis : Yes, as we've said, Haystack continues on the timeline that we set for ourselves, for the team. There's been evidence generation, obviously that's what we made our -- was part of our decision-making process. Now as we get the assay, what I call ready for commercial release, commercial production, we're in the process of establishing relationships with some of our key oncology partners. So when the assay is ready, we'll start to do some of the testing likely we'll use a lot of that early testing to then seek reimbursement once we get a substantial buildup of testing that we feel good about approaching the Maxon and so far, so good. We're bringing up the assay, as we mentioned, in our Lewisville, Texas Oncology Center of Excellence and feel good about that. I'll let Sam touch on the financials with respect to... Sam Samad : Yes, sure. I mean with regards to spend, I'll talk in dilution terms and EPS terms here this year, and then I'll talk -- address your question around '24, Patrick. So again, very pleased with the progress that the team is making. This year, we're expecting EPS dilution to be in the $0.15 to $0.20 range. We talked about that on the Q2 call. It's still in the same range, $0.15 to $0.20. If you look towards '24, what we've said and this still applies, is that the annualized dilution in 2024 is going to be less than what we expect to see -- what you see this year. So the $0.15 to $0.20, if you annualize that, that's $0.30 to $0.40 next year. So we expect on an annual basis next year to be less than where things are trending this year. So improvement just on an annual basis. And then as we look forward, we expect 25% dilution to be lower than 24%, and then we expect 26% to actually be accretive. So that's consistent with what we said when we announced the deal consistent with what we said on the Q2 call. Operator : Our next caller is Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Erin Wright : You laid out some of those key profit drivers for the fourth quarter. And as we think about what kind of continues into 2024, I think you mentioned in the previous question kind of -- or a previous question, productivity gains should continue, and I understand there's PAMA dynamics as well that are somewhat unknown. But should we anticipate a deviation from the long-term profit guidance is like 50 to 100 basis points operating margin expansion next year? Sam Samad : Well, let me clarify, Erin, and thanks for the question, by the way. So what we talked about at Investor Day is an improvement of 75 to 150 basis points over the 3 years and that's off of the rate that we have for 2023. So we had said at the time the rate was approximately 17%. We said we could improve over the next 3 years by 75 to 150 basis points in terms of operating margin with the lower end being PAMA did come back in '24 and the higher end of 150 being either if we had comprehensive reform around SALSA or PAMA gets delayed. So the 75 to 150 over the 3 years still applies. That has not changed. Now it's going to apply off of a lower base in 2023 because our operating margin expectations have come down. As I said earlier on the call, we expect it to be slightly below -- marginally below the approximately 16.5% that we talked about on the Q2 call. The positive drivers and by the way, that operating margin expansion was for 3 -- over the 3 years, not for 2024. But the positive drivers in 2024 still apply. I mean, first of all, first and foremost, I would say, is the pricing environment. We are very encouraged by the pricing environment. We talked about the strategic relationships that have been renewed, and we're seeing positive price ex PAMA, depending on what happens next year, but we're seeing positive price, and we expect that to continue. We're seeing the growth investments starting to yield fruit and CIT being one of them. And we talked about that becoming profitable. Productivity improvement, both in terms of Invigorate and also hires that we do, for instance, phlebotomist that we're adding we expect that productivity or their productivity to improve next year as well as they gain more experience and they're more productive. So all of those drivers we expect to continue. Turnover is a bit of an uncertain item. We don't necessarily expect it to become worse than it is today. But it's too early to say right now whether that improves markedly in 2024. The early signs that we saw in Q3. Right now, we're encouraging. We saw some slight improvement, but it's too early to say to project what that would mean for 2024. Jim Davis : Yes. Erin. The last thing I'd say is we're encouraged by the volume trends. And as you know, incremental volume coming into the business in a business that has lots of fixed costs certainly mixes up the existing margin rate. So we feel good about the volume trends in our physician office. We feel good about the volume trends in health systems. And as I mentioned in the script, we feel good about our funnel of M&A opportunities that are in front of us as we march through the fourth quarter and early next year. Operator : Our last caller is Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Brian Tanquilut : I guess, Sam, just to follow up on Erin's question really quickly. If we think about the composition of margin between gross profit and G&A, is this the right baseline to build off of factoring all the things that you mentioned, such productivity gains and maybe PAMA. And then maybe just, Jim, a quick follow-up. Hospital deals. Obviously, you've had some growth there. How should we be thinking about the pipeline and your ability to sustain the growth rate given what's in the pipeline today? Sam Samad : Yes. I mean with regards to the first question, Brian, we believe it is the right baseline to build off of. 2024 is not the period to look at in terms of that improvement that we talked about, the 75 to 150. There are a couple of factors in there. One of them, there's the uncertainty of PAMA, obviously. But the other one is COVID, which is approximately $200 million this year, is going to be a factor next year in terms of the drop off. It's going to be a negative factor. Again, albeit a much smaller one than what we saw from '22 into '23, but it's still going to be a factor in terms of the approximately $200 million going to something we believe much less than that as it becomes just another regular test like a flu test, for instance, but the baseline, we believe, is the right one, and we are still confident about the 75 to 150 basis point improvement on operating margin over the 3 years. Jim Davis : Yes. Brian, as I said in the script, we're encouraged by the breadth and depth of our funnel of opportunities in hospital outreach as well as PLS. And I say that our teams are working them very hard. And the trends are pointing in our direction, right, with the cost of capital going up for health systems, their investments, I think, are truly focusing on the things that will drive growth for health systems, whether that's investments in neurology, cardiology, cancer, obstetric, those are the things that drive growth in health systems. And so when you make all those investments, albeit now at capital costs that are significantly higher, they can turn to us to make the investments they need in laboratories. When you see institutions like New York Presby sell their outreach book of business and really focus their investments on the things that are driving their growth. I think that's a good sign of how health care systems, they're really good strategic ones are really thinking today. Operator : That was our last question for the day. Jim Davis : All right. Everyone, thanks again for joining our call today. We certainly appreciate all your continued support. I also want to thank the Quest Diagnostics team who, as we've transitioned away from COVID, have really done a magnificent job in continuing to drive growth in our base business, drive productivity and continue to satisfy our patients, providers and all those that use Quest Diagnostics. So thanks, everyone, and have a great day. Operator : Thank you for participating in the Quest Diagnostics Third Quarter 2023 Conference Call.

The entire contents of the call, including the presentation and question-and-answer session that will follow, are the copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics with all rights reserved. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. I\u2019d now like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Please go ahead, sir. Shawn Bevec : Thank you, and good morning. I'm joined by Jim Davis, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; and Sam Samad, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and will discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS. Any references to base business, testing, revenues or volumes refer to the performance of our business excluding COVID-19 testing. Growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections, including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings growth are compound annual growth rates. Finally, revenue growth rates from acquisitions will be measured against our base business. Now here is Jim Davis. Jim Davis : Thanks, Shawn, and good morning, everyone. For the full-year 2023, we delivered strong revenue growth of 7% in our base business and delivered on our earnings commitment as we transitioned away from COVID testing. The results we announced this morning reflect a strong fourth quarter and full year for our base business, in which we made substantial progress on our strategy to drive top-line growth across our core customer channels and improve profitability. Throughout the year, we advanced our growth strategy with innovative testing solutions, new and expanded relationships with health systems and a robust pipeline of M&A and professional lab services opportunities. We also delivered double-digit revenue growth in several clinical areas, including advanced cardiometabolic, prenatal and hereditary genetics and neurology. We also strengthened our oncology offering with a strategic investment in higher growth, minimal residual disease testing. In addition, our efforts to improve quality and productivity delivered our invigorate goal, which helped us to offset the cost headwinds we faced throughout the year. This morning, we issued guidance for 2024 that reflects a return to overall revenue growth, while balancing the earnings tailwinds and headwinds we see for the year. Looking beyond 2024, we are well-positioned to deliver our long-term financial outlook to drive mid-single-digit revenue growth and high single-digit earnings growth. I'm grateful to our dedicated Quest colleagues for making this happen. Every day, they bring our purpose to life, working together to create a healthier world, one life at a time. Before discussing highlights from 2023, I'd like to share some recent regulatory updates. First, as you know, Congress once again delayed Medicare reimbursement cuts and the next data collection process under PAMA that were scheduled to take place in 2024. While we are pleased with the delay, we continue to work closely with our trade association to seek a permanent fix to PAMA through SALSA, the saving access to Laboratory Services Act. ACLA's highest priority this year is to secure passage of SALSA. Second, ACLA and nearly 7,000 other individuals and groups submitted comments last quarter on a rule proposed by the FDA to regulate laboratory developed tests as medical devices. Lab-developed tests are essential medical innovations that are already highly regulated under federal legislation known as CLIA. In addition to the oversight by states, accredited bodies and Medicare as it makes coverage determinations. If enacted, the FDA's proposed rule would compromise patient access to a central lab testing. It would also slow diagnostic innovation and add unnecessary health care costs. We agree with ACLA that the FDA does not have the statutory authority to unilaterally regulate LDTs and believe that resuming discussions with the FDA, Congress, ACLA and other stakeholders on a legislative solution is the most prudent path forward. Now I'll recap our strategy and discuss highlights from the fourth quarter. Then Sam will provide more detail on our financial results and talk about our financial guidance for 2024. Our strategy to drive growth is focused on delivering solutions that meet the evolving needs of our core customers : physicians, hospitals and consumers. We enable growth across our customer channels through advanced diagnostics with an intense focus on faster-growing clinical areas, including molecular genomics and oncology. In addition, acquisitions are a key growth driver with an emphasis on accretive hospital outreach purchases as well as smaller independent labs. Our strategy also includes driving operational improvements across the business with strategic deployment of automation and AI to improve quality, efficiency, workforce experience and service. Here are some updates on the progress we have made in these areas in the fourth quarter. In Physician Lab Services, we delivered mid-single-digit base business revenue growth. We attribute this growth to return to care, overall market growth and share gains driven by the competitive strengths of our scale and innovative offerings. We continue to execute hospital outreach and independent lab acquisitions, which generate volume for our physician channel. In January, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire select assets of Lenco, an independent New York-based laboratory company and expect to complete the transaction later this quarter. In addition, we acquired outreach assets of Steward Health Care, which will deepen our reach to patients in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Ohio. As we said earlier, our acquisition pipeline is very strong, and we expect to complete additional transactions in 2024. Our strong relationships with health plans were also a key driver of growth in 2023 as we grew revenues from health plans by high single-digits versus the prior year. As we've indicated, we successfully completed negotiations for all our strategic health plan renewals that were scheduled in 2023. Health plans and self-insured employer clients recognize the clinical and economic value we deliver to them and their members. To date, more than half of health plan revenues now come from value-based contracts, which enable faster growth compared to our traditional health plan contracts. In addition, working with health plans, we continue to reduce so-called lab leakage to high-cost out-of-network labs, partly by redirecting the volume to Quest. Importantly, this is good for both patients as well as employers, which pay for the majority of health care costs. In hospital lab services, we drove high single-digit base business revenue growth in the fourth quarter with strength in both reference and professional laboratory services. Hospital reference testing, in particular, grew much faster than historical trends and well above our estimated growth for the market. Increasingly, health systems recognize that our innovative laboratory testing and collaborative lab management solutions can help them improve quality, productivity, affordability and care. They also continue to face labor and cost pressures prompting more of them to reach out to us to help with their lab strategy. Our professional lab services help manage a hospital's lab, supply chain and workforce. We also provide insights from our analytical solutions to help hospitals manage utilization to deliver the right test to the right patient at the right time. In the fourth quarter, we completed two PLS relationships that will contribute modest growth in the first quarter of this year. We also provide health systems the opportunity to transition their non-core outreach laboratory assets to us through acquisitions. By selling their outreach assets to Quest, these hospitals are better able to redeploy scarce capital to areas of their business that have a greater impact on patient care. Our consumer-initiated testing service, questhealth.com, generated revenues of approximately $45 million in the full year 2023, with strong base business growth. Our return on ad spend and customer acquisition costs remained favorable in the fourth quarter. Another element of our CIT strategy is to drive revenue growth through channel partners. In 2023, we generated more than $30 million through this channel. We are also excited about new product releases in 2024, including blood testing for PFAS or forever chemicals via questhealth.com. PFAS chemicals have been used in industrial and consumer products for decades and may contaminate food and water. In late January, the CDC issued new guidelines that recognize the value of PFAS blood testing for individuals that may have elevated exposure levels, which may increase risk of kidney cancer, eye cholesterol and other health conditions. According to a study in the Journal of Endocrine Society, PFAS chemicals accounted for approximately $22 billion in U.S. health care costs in 2018. In Advanced diagnostics, we experienced double-digit growth across several clinical areas in the fourth quarter, including advanced cardiometabolic, prenatal and hereditary genetics and neurology. Growth in neurology was driven largely by our Alzheimer's disease portfolio of tests, which is among the most comprehensive in the fast-evolving field of Alzheimer's care. Our innovations include our AV detect blood test for early risk assessment based on amyloid beta proteins and Apo lead genetic risk. This week, we also added P-Tau181 to our AV detect blood test line to complement insights from amyloid beta testing. In addition, our Alzheimer's disease test portfolio includes several CSF tests for diagnosis and monitoring based on amyloid beta, P-Tau181 and Apo lead. We intend to add additional biomarkers later this year and continue to expand our menu. In molecular genomics and oncology, we are on track to launch our Haystack minimal residual disease test to physicians later this year from our Oncology Center of Excellence in Lewisville, Texas. We also believe Haystack MRD can help support clinical research and recently announced clinical trial collaborations using this innovative technology with the Rutgers Cancer Institute, Alliance Foundation trials in TriSalus Life Sciences. In the fourth quarter, we announced a collaboration with Universal DX, which has developed an innovative blood test for screening for colorectal cancer, including precancerous lesions. We look forward to supporting Universal's effort to gain regulatory approval for this test. Through our collaboration with Scipher, we are expanding patient access to the PRISM-RA test for aiding treatment selection for rheumatoid arthritis. Turning to operational excellence. Our Invigorate program delivered our targeted 3% annual cost savings and productivity improvements. Here are three examples of how we're improving operations. First, we continue to make progress in using front-end automation to enhance specimen processing. In 2023, we completed front-end automation upgrades in our Pittsburgh and Dallas laboratories, which will improve quality and productivity. This year, we'll add five additional sites. Second, we also expanded the use of AI to improve quality, efficiency and workforce experience in several clinical areas. AI can quickly identify patterns that signify possible disease and digital images of patient cultures and slides. In 2023, we expanded the use of AI in microbiology to help identify bacteria as well as in cytogenetics to identify chromosomal abnormalities. Looking forward, we are encouraged by the opportunities to use AI in several additional clinical areas including cytology, pathology and parasitology. Third, in 2023, we deployed an AI tool at our Clifton lab that helps laboratory staff continuously identify ways to be more productive in their daily routines. And we look forward to introducing this AI job helper in other labs and support processes. Finally, we made significant progress improving the margins of our base business in 2023. I'd like to personally thank our Quest colleagues whose efforts have helped make this possible. With that, I'll turn it over to Sam to provide more details on our performance and our 2024 guidance. Sam? Sam Samad : Thanks, Jim. In the fourth quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.29 billion, down 1.9% versus the prior year. Base business revenues grew 4.7% to $2.25 billion. While COVID-19 testing revenues declined approximately 80% to $37 million. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services declined 2% compared to the prior year, reflecting lower revenue from COVID-19 testing services versus the fourth quarter of 2022, partially offset by strong growth in our base testing revenue. Total volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 1.9% versus the fourth quarter of 2022, with acquisitions contributing 50 basis points to total volume. Total base testing volumes grew 5.2% versus the prior year. Revenue per requisition declined 3.5% versus the prior year driven primarily by lower COVID-19 molecular volume. Base business revenue per rec was up 0.2%. Unit price reimbursement was positive and consistent with our expectations. Reported operating income in the fourth quarter was $267 million or 11.7% of revenues compared to $135 million or 5.8% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $338 million or 14.8% of revenues compared to $330 million or 14.2% of revenues last year. The year-over-year increase in adjusted operating income is related primarily to growth in the base business, actions taken in 2023 to reduce support costs and lower performance-based compensation, partially offset by lower COVID-19 testing revenues, wage increases, higher employee health care costs and higher deferred compensation expense. Reported EPS was $1.70 in the quarter compared to $0.87 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $2.15 compared to $1.98 last year. Cash from operations was $1.27 billion for full-year 2023 versus $1.72 billion in the prior year, driven primarily by lower COVID-19 testing revenue. Finally, our Board of Directors has authorized a 5.6% increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.71 to $0.75 per share or $3 per share annually effective with the dividend payable in April 2024. The company has raised its dividend annually since 2011. Turning to our full-year 2024 guidance. Revenues are expected to be between $9.35 billion and $9.45 billion. Reported EPS is expected to be in a range of $7.69 to $7.99 and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $8.60 to $8.90. Cash from operations is expected to be approximately $1.3 billion and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $420 million. We have posted a presentation on the Investor Relations page of our website that includes an adjusted earnings bridge, which shows some of the key elements to bridge from our 2023 adjusted EPS to the 2024 adjusted EPS guidance we shared today. Our 2024 guidance reflects the following consideration. We are no longer providing detailed base business and COVID revenue guidance. However, note that we are assuming that COVID revenues will decline at least $175 million in 2024, which will partially offset the growth we expect from the base business. Most of the COVID headwind in 2024 will occur during the first quarter as we generated $119 million of COVID revenue in Q1 last year. In terms of M&A, our guidance only contemplates acquisitions that have been announced or closed to date, including the outreach acquisitions from NewYork-Presbyterian and Stewart Health Care, as well as Lenco, the independent lab Jim mentioned earlier. We will absorb the full year of dilution from our acquisition of Haystack Oncology with an increment impact of approximately $0.20 to adjusted EPS in 2024. We made strong progress improving our base business operating margins in 2023 and expect margin expansion in 2024. We anticipate net interest expense to increase to approximately $190 million in 2024 as a result of higher borrowings following our debt issuance in November. We assume a roughly flat share count compared to the end of 2023. We are expecting adjusted EPS in Q1 to be roughly 21% of our full year earnings. This is slightly below the typical seasonality and reflects the significant amount of weather disruption we've experienced in January. At this point, we anticipate a weather headwind of $0.05 to $0.07 in Q1. And finally, as Jim mentioned earlier, we are well-positioned to deliver our long-term financial outlook to drive mid-single-digit revenue growth and high single-digit earnings growth. With that, I'll now turn it back to Jim. Jim Davis : Thanks, Sam. Finally, I'd like to take a moment to remember Dr. Paul A. Brown, who passed away in January of this year. In 1967, Dr. Brown founded MetPath, the predecessor company of Quest Diagnostics, providing basic lab services from his apartment in New York City. Dr. Brown was a pioneer who invented the blueprint for our industry that today is recognized as essential to quality health care, and we are grateful for his vision and leadership. To summarize, we delivered strong base business revenue growth in 2023 and achieved our EPS commitments. Our guidance in 2024 reflects a return to total revenue growth while balancing the earnings tailwinds and headwinds we see for the year. Looking beyond 2024, we are well positioned to deliver our long-term financial outlook to drive mid-single-digit revenue growth and high single-digit earnings growth. And I'm grateful to our dedicated Quest colleagues who bring our purpose to life every single day, working together to create a healthier world, one life at a time. Now we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We will now open it up to questions. At the request of the company, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. [Operator Instructions] And our first question of the day will come from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Patrick Donnelly : Probably one for Sam, just on the margin outlook for '24. Can you just expand a little bit on expectations there, including maybe the cadence for the year. And then just on the margin front with PAMA, obviously, the push out, it's not a function of you getting any windfall by any means, but just that potential headwind being alleviated. Were there investments that you guys were kind of holding off on until you got more clarity on the outcome there? And then as you plan the budget, you green lit with some more of those as PAMA got pushed out. Just wondering how you thought about that expense piece there and a bit more color on margins? Sam Samad : Yes. Thank you, Patrick. So listen, we made a lot of great progress in 2023 in terms of expanding our margins and offsetting the COVID headwind that we saw in '23. In terms of '24 expectations, as we mentioned on the prepared remarks, we're looking to expand margins, to continue to expand margins in '24. With, again, the key drivers of that are going to be volume growth, the expectation of volume growth that we have in the plan, that's going to be the biggest impact in terms of driving margins. We're going to be looking at continuing the great work that we're doing on Invigorate and offsetting any cost headwinds. We're assuming the labor inflation to be in line with what we saw in 2023. So somewhere in that 3% to 4% growth range, not necessarily expecting it to get worse, but not necessarily expecting it to get better either. In terms of your question on PAMA, Patrick, you're absolutely right. It's not a positive. It's the absence of a negative. So essentially, the delay gives us certainty now for '24 that we're not going to see a decline. And had PAMA occurred or had PAMA come back in 2024, you're right in the sense that we would have had to potentially defer certain investments. We would have had to make some potentially difficult cuts to offset some of that impact. And the fact that we have a delay affords us the ability now to make certain investments and to avoid some of those difficult cuts that I referenced. But I think the key punchline for 2024 is that we continue to expand operating margins. Jim, you wanted to make a comment. Jim Davis : Yes. So Patrick, you heard me discuss in our prepared remarks. We're going to continue to invest in our Alzheimer's portfolio of tests. There's still one important blood-based biomarker that we will bring up later this year. And that will complete our investments in our Alzheimer's testing from a blood-based standpoint. You heard me mention that PFAS testing. We're bringing that test up. We'll be launching that here in the first quarter. We have gotten significant consumer and physician demand to bring that test up. And then finally, we're upgrading some of our laboratory information systems in a couple of our esoteric labs. And so, the lack of this PAMA cut gives us the ability to continue to make those investments. Operator : The next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI. Elizabeth Anderson : I have a sort of unrelated two-part combo one. One, can you talk about sort of the progress you're making on Haystack? I know sort of you ended up sort of on the higher end of the dilution. Is that because you're sort of accelerating test pushout, didn't have seen incremental progress on that side? And then secondarily, can you remind us on your thoughts about share repo for the year? I know that's not in your current base guidance assumptions, but just wanted to hear your updated thoughts on that for capital deployment. Jim Davis : Okay. Let me address the progress on Haystack, Sam will take the second question. So Haystack is proceeding as we expected. There's no incremental investment versus what we thought. We said last year, $0.15 to $0.20 for the half year. And then likewise, $0.15 to $0.20 incremental this year. We are bringing the assay up in our Lewisville, Texas Cancer Center of Excellence. It's proceeding as we expected. We announced -- you heard in my prepared remarks, discussions of three clinical trials. So we are doing testing right this moment. Obviously, we're not getting paid for that testing as we continue to validate the assay. But we expect to have it launched here in the first half of the year for commercial purposes. Sam Samad : Yes. And I'll take the second question, Elizabeth. Just to be clear, the Haystack dilution in 2023 was in line with our expectations. It was $0.15 to $0.20. That's what we had called and that's where it came in, in that range of $0.15 to $0.20. With regards to share repo, so we did $275 million of share repo in Q4. Our current expectations are to basically offset equity dilution -- sorry, I said in '24, it's '23 in Q4. And our expectations are to offset equity dilution in '24. And that would work out to something in the similar range that we did in Q4. So somewhere around $250 million to $275 million. That's the base assumption, which is to offset equity dilution. Operator : Our next question will come from Pito Chickering of Deutsche Bank. Pito Chickering : There are a lot of moving pieces in the 2024 bridge you provided. If we look at operating margins, excluding Haystack dilution, how are operating margins in 2024 versus 2023? And then 4Q margins missed a street by a decent amount. Can you help us bridge the 4Q margins to what you're guiding to for 2024? Sam Samad : Sure. Why don't I take that, Pito. So first of all, in terms of operating margin for 2024, what's implied in the guide at the midpoint is expansion of operating margins. We're not calling out specifically what the operating margin rate. But there's definitely growth in terms of the operating margin rate and operating margin dollars in '24 versus '23 where we came in. And that's what's implied in the guide that we gave. With regards to the moving parts around Q4 and then how you bridge that into 2024, listen, there were three things that really impacted us in Q4 from an operating margin rate perspective. We came in at 14.8%. It was still growth year-over-year, significant growth year-over-year despite a significant drop in COVID revenues. But in terms of versus expectations, yes, we missed in terms of operating margin for three key reasons. Number one was employee health care costs. So I would weigh these three reasons, by the way, equally, so one-third, one-third, one-third. But basically, employee health care cost was one-third of that miss. They came in higher than expected in Q4, and we can talk a little bit about what we're doing in '24 with regards to that. Additional -- some additional investments that we made towards the end of the year and some higher costs that we made not necessarily related to labor costs, but some investments that we made targeted investments in Q4, namely IT. So that was one-third of the miss as well. And then one-third was deferred compensation expense, which came in higher. Now remember, that's not an EPS impact. That's an operating margin impact that gets offset on the non-operating expense line. but that impacted our margins again to the tune of one-third of that miss versus our expectations. Now if you look towards '24, the employee health care costs, I mean, we've factored that into our guide. We've also taken steps to lower employee health care costs by -- I mean, we had frozen for the last three years, the employee contribution part of our employee health care cost plans. And we're having now to pass some of that on back to employees in 2024 because we had, as I said, frozen them over the last few years, even with the significant inflation that you've seen in terms of health care. So that's already assumed in 2024. As I mentioned to Patrick, what's assumed is also volume growth that's going to help us grow margins. The deferred compensation, that's just noise. We don't really budget for that. If there's a headwind or a tailwind in '24, that just gets offset on the non-operating line and it shows up as neutral in EPS. And then as I said, we made some additional investments in Q4 to position the business for 2024, and that's factored into the guide in terms of any additional investments that we make in '24. So we feel confident about our growth in terms of operating margins next -- this year. Jim Davis : Yes. Pito, let me just go back to Q4 just to talk about the progress we made year-over-year. So as Sam indicated, our revenue in Q4 versus '22 was down $45 million. And if you look at the mix of that revenue, COVID was down $145 million year-over-year. And remember, we were getting paid $100, a record at that point. Our base business offset $100 million of that, which is why we were down $45 million. Despite that, bad mix and the lower revenue, we still improved our operating margin by 60 basis points. So we made significant progress in the quarter and that progress will continue as we march into 2024. Operator : The next question comes from Jack Meehan of Nephron Research. Jack Meehan : Thank you. Good morning. Jim, I was hoping to hear from you, like what are you assuming in terms of core utilization in terms of the guide? You've had elevated rates the last couple of years coming out of the pandemic. Do you think that can sustain? Or are you seeing moderation in any areas? Jim Davis : Yes. So for the fourth quarter, Jack, we saw volume growth of 5.1%. For the total year, we had volume growth of 6.5%. Now, I would tell you at the very beginning portion of this year, the first two to three weeks with the weather that we saw across the U.S., volume growth was stunted a bit. But in the last week or so, we\u2019ve seen volume recover to the normal rates and expectations that we have for the year. So you\u2019ve heard several of the health plans have reported higher utilization in the fourth quarter. We, ourselves, because of our own health care costs, we know there was higher utilization of our own employees. So we expect it to continue at slightly above the normal market rates, albeit the first month of the year has been tempered a little bit by weather. Operator : The next question will come from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. Brian Tanquilut : Maybe, Sam, as I think about all the comments from Jim on how it looks like the revenue outlook is good, right? You have all these tailwinds potentially going forward with new tests and whatnot. Help us bridge to getting back to that EPS or earnings growth in the long-term outlook that you've provided? Because obviously, '24 is an aberration. Are there some one-timers here? But how do you guys comfortable in that long-term earnings growth, '25 going forward? Sam Samad : Yes. Thanks, Brian. So first of all, let me say definitively that we are absolutely still confident about our long-term growth guide that we gave, which is essentially to grow revenues in the mid-single digits to grow EPS in the high single-digits. So long-term growth is unchanged. As you yourself mentioned, there are some headwinds in 2024 that I think are transient or temporary that we see this year. So we've got a COVID revenue decline, which is approximately $175 million or roughly $0.50 year-over-year. You've got -- and we've called this before, but you've got Haystack dilution, which is now full year dilution versus a half year dilution that we saw in '23. And then you've got interest expense, which is to the tune of about $0.25, which is really as a result of the additional debt that we took on and the higher borrowing costs driven by the macro environment that we\u2019re in. But that\u2019s really to fund acquisitions and to fund growth in the business as well in the base business. We\u2019ve got a strong pipeline, and we feel really confident about the M&A landscape and the M&A opportunities ahead of us. And we upsized the issuance in November to basically partly pay for the acquisitions that we made in \u201823, Haystack and to some extent, NewYork-Presbyterian, but also to fund the future acquisitions, some of which are not included in this guide. So I would say the punchline is we\u2019re definitely still confident about the long-term growth of the business and the EPS guide that we gave. Operator : The next question comes from Kevin Caliendo of UBS. Andrea Alfonso : It's Andrea Alfonso in for Kevin. Unfortunately, I'm in the enviable position of asking yet another question around margin expectations. But I guess my question is, when we think about just the expansion of margins you expect and thinking about the puts and takes into next year. I guess I want to isolate like what gets better? I know that there's maybe some assumption in there around the M&A you've absorbed so far? Is that mildly accretive or just sort of in line or maybe below the margin. Some of your -- in one of your slides, I think there was some mention of GAAP charges around workforce reductions, et cetera. Is that sort of just lingering on from 2023 or is that a new tranche? Just trying to get an understanding on those two items. Sam Samad : Yes. So thank you for the question. With regards to margin expansion, I mean as I mentioned earlier, a big factor is going to be driven by volume growth that we see in 2024. That's really the key factor. We're going to continue to invigorate actions that we have talked about to the tune of 3% cost reduction across our entire cost base. And that's -- we actually met that target in '23, we slightly exceeded it. And in '24, it's going to be continuing with those initiatives. With regards to any workforce reductions, there aren't any workforce reductions planned right now. Usually, when we have -- when you look at that GAAP to non-GAAP, we just have a placeholder for potential workforce reductions there or potential restructuring charges. But there isn't anything that's related specifically to any headcount cuts. Now we do have the cost reductions in '24 that we continue to see. So in Q1, for instance, we have some benefit from some cost reductions that we didn't see in Q1 of last year, but then we'll continue to be very disciplined about our P&L as we go forward in '24. Yes, so that's really the key driver in terms of our margin growth. Operator : The next question will come from Lisa Gill of JPMorgan. Ms. Gill, please check the mute button on your phone. Lisa Gill : You talked a lot about volume growth this morning, but I'm just curious on the price side. So if I go back to the last couple of quarters, you talked about stabilizing pricing with health plans. You talked earlier about health plan leakage and the opportunity there. So maybe can you put those two pieces together for us as we think about the growth for next year of how much is volume and how much of that is on the price side? Jim Davis : Yes. So let me just recap '23 and then we'll get into '24. So in 2023, price, pure price, price per test provided us a slight lift year-over-year, okay? So our base rev per req that we've reported was up 1.2% and price was a positive contributor towards that. Now going into 2024, we expect, again, price to be flat to slightly up for the year. We concluded all of the significant health plan renegotiations in '23. Obviously, there's a new tranche that always comes about one-third -- 25% to 33% renew every year. But we feel confident that prices will remain flat to slightly up as we enter 2024. Operator : The next question will come from Derik de Bruin of Bank of America. Derik de Bruin : So changing track a little. Look, the LDT legislation looks like it's making more progress than it has. It's like -- can you quantify what your exposure is to LDTs and sort of your thought process here? I mean, you're introducing a bunch of new tests would qualify for that. So how do you think about incremental investments if that goes through? And would you discontinue to test there? And then as a follow-up, there's been some legal movement lately on the MRD space. There's been some litigation that's happened that has blocked some other players from the market. Does Haystack have freedom to operate as you sort of look at what's changed in the IP landscape on that? And how do you think about your IP portfolio on Haystack and being able to not get sued? Jim Davis : Yes. So let me address your second question first. We have no risk with respect to the IP on the underlying technology that we're using in Haystack. We feel very confident about it. Much of that IP comes out of John Hopkins University, and we're solid there. So no risk. In terms of LDTs, I think we've said in the past about 10% of our tests are considered LDTs. We'll wait to hear from the FDA in April what the final rule is, and then we'll make decisions as an industry from there. What I would tell you is that we do a significant amount of work for the pharmaceutical industry today, and we do a significant amount of work for four international laboratories. Both of those require us to be ISO certified. And when you're doing work for the pharmaceutical industry, especially for companion diagnostics, you're essentially operating already under FDA regulation. So it's not going to be anything radical that we don't know what we need to do. Will there be further investments and steps required to get all of our laboratories that do LDTs accredited? Yes, there will be. But it\u2019s not a heavy lift for Quest Diagnostics. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The next question will come from Andrew Brackmann of William Blair. Andrew Brackmann : I want to go back to the Alzheimer's offerings and the investments that you're making there. Can you maybe just sort of talk at a high level about the opportunity that you see for that category? Should we sort of think about this market kind of ultimately looking at something like oncology where you have screening therapy selection monitoring et cetera? Or does it sort of take a different path for you guys? Jim Davis : Yes. So thanks for the question. It's a great question. So first, I would say that there's just broader awareness of testing options that are now available to both consumers and to physicians. In part, this is because of new therapeutics that have been introduced has just created widespread awareness. As you know, the majority of testing today for Alzheimer's is conducted via PET-CT, which are expensive $2,500 to $4,000 exams or CSF testing, cerebral spinal fluid, which is not an expensive lab test. However, the procedure to extract CFS out of the human body is an expensive procedure. And likewise, the total cost of that is roughly $1,000. We have brought up blood-based assays for ApoE, which is a genetic risk for Alzheimer's. We brought up a blood-based assay for what we call AB42/40, which is generally considered the earliest indicator amyloid plaque, the earliest indicator of dementia and/or Alzheimer's onset. And then we brought up one of the two protein markers that are also involved, the Tau markers. We brought up 181 and there's a second one 217 that we will be bringing up later this year. That, in essence, completes our blood-based offering. And I think there's widespread consumer interest, widespread interest amongst primary care physicians. And we've had double-digit growth all year long in both our blood-based assays and CSF testing, and we expect that double-digit growth to continue on in 2024 and beyond. Operator : The next question will come from Stephanie Davis of Barclays. Stephanie Davis : So I was hoping to dig in a little bit more on to the AI question you're having and discussions around the prepared remarks. Could you tell me just a little bit more about what you'll be investing into and how maybe the rollout of things of the AI job, the AI job helper will help you guys out? And then I guess on a follow-up to that one, is it safe to assume that you'll have more IT investments as you develop some of these AI solutions that will then have more out year yield for your margin opportunity? Jim Davis : Yes. So good question. The AI tool that we referred to with respect to our Clifton lab, is really -- it was a tool that we used to analyze the workflow within several departments in the Clifton Laboratory, that actually looked at from fairly simple things like steps and movement between equipment, loading and unloading of certain racks and we reviewed it and you find some really quick easy simplification efforts to adjust equipment, move equipment to minimize the human content or labor involved in each one of these steps. More broadly, we've deployed AI in two critical areas. One is in microbiology. Microbiology, as you know, you grow things in a dish, you look at it under a microscope. But with one of our partners, we now -- we can take digital images of what's growing in the dish and the system actually reviews those images and makes the initial call of a negative or positive. We still review the positives by high, but it's a digital image as opposed to doing it under a microscope. But it's a much quicker read because the system has generally indicated -- this system is already indicated if it is positive. We're also in the process of deploying artificial intelligence and digitizing pathology. So as you know, pathology is generally read under a microscope. We're in the process of implementing digital systems that allow for one to read off of a monitor versus under a microscope. And once you\u2019ve digitized that slide, you\u2019re now able to apply algorithms to, again, at least help with what we call region of interest, pointing out to the pathologist where they should look and inevitably helping the pathologists make the proper diagnosis. Operator : And the last question for today's call will come from Eric Coldwell of Baird. Eric Coldwell : I have actually going to have a couple here. First, the -- I missed this. What was the M&A contribution to revenue growth in 2024 guidance? Sam Samad : So it's about 50 basis points right now is what's in the guide, Eric. And it really reflects, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, the carryover that we have from the acquisitions that we did in '23, which is really NewYork-Presbyterian, The Steward Health Care, the Lenco acquisition that we signed. And really, that's it. Eric Coldwell : So if I take mid-point revenue guidance at $1.6 million, remove the COVID headwind, you get to about 3.5% on the base and then take out 50 bps from M&A, you're at 3% organic on the base. Sam Samad : Yes, that's correct. Eric Coldwell : Okay. Second question, a higher mix of hospital reference testing, it sounds like. You talked about trends in hospital reference being above plan being above long-term history. What kind of an impact does that have on gross margin in the quarter? Jim Davis : Yes. So in general, our reference testing, which is more LDT like than it is the routine testing, as you know, Eric. In general, that carries a higher test margin, higher gross margin. And in general, right, we're not drawing specimens that are derived or taken in hospitals. So there's a very little phlebotomy cost involved in reference work. So generally, the operating margin of our hospital-based tests are going to be higher than the average of the business. So that business did grow at a faster rate than our overall book of business, both in Q4 as well as for the total year. So it was good mix. Operator : And that was our final question for today. Jim Davis : All right. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining our call, and we look forward to further updates through the year. Everyone, have a great day.

I'm joined by Jim Davis, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; and Sam Samad, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and will discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS. Any references to base business, testing, revenues or volumes refer to the performance of our business excluding COVID-19 testing. Growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections, including consolidated revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings growth are compound annual growth rates. Finally, revenue growth rates from acquisitions will be measured against our base business. Now here is Jim Davis. Jim Davis : Thanks, Shawn, and good morning everyone. In the first quarter, we delivered nearly 6% base business revenue growth, continuing the strong momentum of recent quarters. We also grew total revenues for the first time since the height of the pandemic nearly three years ago. Our strong commercial focus on physicians and hospitals, combined with our broad health plan access, enabled us to take advantage of sustained high rates of healthcare utilization and drive new customer growth. Our investments in advanced diagnostics also enabled double-digit growth within multiple key clinical areas, including brain health, women's health, and advanced cardiometabolic health. In addition, our Invigorate initiative, which includes ongoing investments in automation and AI, continued to improve productivity as well as service levels and quality. Given the strength of our business, we are raising our guidance for the full year. Before turning to highlights from the quarter, I'd like to briefly discuss the FDA's proposed rule to regulate laboratory-developed testing services. We still encourage the administration to withdraw the proposed rule and engage in advancing appropriate legislation that preserves the critical role of laboratory diagnostics. We are disappointed that the FDA continues to move forward with this regulation, which we believe, if enacted, will compromise patient access to critical lab testing, slow diagnostic innovation, and add unnecessary healthcare costs. We also believe that the rule raises serious legal issues, including that the FDA lacks the statutory authority to unilaterally regulate these services. While we will be prepared to comply with the rule, we will continue to work with our trade association, ACLA, on potential next steps. Now I'll recap our strategy and discuss highlights from the first quarter. Then Sam will provide detail on our financial results and talk about our updated financial guidance for 2024. Our strategy to drive growth is focused on delivering solutions that meet the evolving needs of our core customers, physicians, hospitals, and consumers. We enable growth across our customer channels through advanced diagnostics with an intense focus on faster-growing clinical areas, including brain health and molecular genomics and oncology. In addition, acquisitions are a key growth driver, with an emphasis on accretive hospital outreach purchases as well as smaller, independent labs. Our strategy also includes driving operational improvements across the business, with the strategic deployment of automation and AI to improve quality, service, efficiency, and the workforce experience. Here are a few key updates on the progress we've made in each of these areas. In Physician Lab Services, we delivered high single-digit based business revenue growth driven by sustained high healthcare utilization, overall market growth and share gains. This growth also reflects new customer wins and our strengthening relationships with physician practices of all sizes, including large multi-specialty physician groups and those owned by large retailers. A significant driver of our success in the physician channel is our broad health plan access, as approximately 90% of health plan members in the U.S. have access to laboratory services at Quest Diagnostics. Health Plans value our size, scale, and innovation. We partner closely with them to reduce laboratory costs through programs that redirect volume from hospital outreach labs and out-of-network labs, which often charge significantly higher prices than we do, raising healthcare costs for patients and employers. We also remain disciplined in our pricing strategy as we increase our investments in improving the customer experience, such as through digital platform enhancements and adjustments to Frontline Pay. As we highlighted previously, we successfully renegotiated our large health plan contracts that were up for renewal last year. In addition, more than 50% of our health plan revenues now have some type of value-based incentive. In Physician Services, our recent acquisition of Lenco, an independent lab in New York, also contributed to growth in the quarter. Our M&A pipeline continues to be robust, and we are making progress with several promising opportunities. In Hospital Lab Services, we grew base business revenues by mid-single digits. Hospital reference testing, in particular, continued to grow faster than pre-pandemic trends, maintaining the momentum from last year. Hospitals are sending us more reference testing, largely because of our innovation, our quality, and our value. They also face persistent challenges with staffing certain roles in specialized fields like histology, microbiology, and cytotechnology, which we can more easily fill with our talent and our technology. In general, as hospitals face both staffing and cost challenges, they continue to reevaluate their lab strategies. Additionally, as the cost of capital continues to rise, some are revisiting their investment priorities and are directing more capital into other clinical areas that generate better returns. Quest provides hospitals with a range of ways to help optimize lab operations, whether through reference testing, savings and efficiencies through professional lab services, or access to capital by selling their outreach programs. Many hospitals and health system leaders are approaching us with a heightened sense of urgency for help with their lab strategies. As a result, our pipeline of both PLS and outreach opportunities remains very strong. Consumer-initiated testing revenues grew double digits, while base business revenues nearly doubled, building on the gains that we delivered last year from our consumer-facing platform, questhealth.com. Some of our most popular test categories included general health panels, STDs, and tuberculosis testing. We also continue to expand our test menu, such as with our launch of PFAS testing for assessing potential exposure to dangerous forever chemicals, and are extending our reach through various channel partners. In Advanced Diagnostics, we generated strong double-digit revenue growth within several key clinical areas, including brain health, women's health, particularly prenatal and hereditary genetics, and advanced cardiometabolic health. Growth in brain health was driven largely by our Alzheimer's disease portfolio of tests, which includes our Quest AD-Detect blood tests for early risk assessment of Alzheimer's disease and our CSF Tests for diagnosing and monitoring. We are launching our Quest AD-Detect pTau-217 blood test to providers this week, and we intend to add additional biomarkers this year to further expand our menu. In molecular genomics and oncology, we completed the validation of our Haystack MRD test in March and have oversubscribed our Haystack MRD Early Experience Program with nearly 20 leading cancer institutions as participants. The Early Experience Program is the final step to prepare for our broad national launch of the clinical test later this year. We are also excited about the opportunities in early blood-based cancer screening. This quarter, our Lewisville, Texas site received the first specimens for the PROMIS Clinical Trial on a liquid biopsy screening test for colorectal cancer from our partner, Universal DX. We look forward to supporting Universal's efforts to gain U.S. regulatory approval for this test. Lastly, our STEP500 somatic tumor sequencing service, which helps providers select therapy for late-stage cancers based on tumor mutation profiles, is generating interest from large cancer centers. Our investments in cancer screening, treatment selection, and monitoring are positioning us to be a leader in the MRD space and other fast-growth molecular genomics and oncology markets. Turning to operational excellence, our Invigorate program aims to deliver a targeted 3% annual cost savings and productivity improvements. During the quarter, we continued to deploy automation and AI to improve productivity as well as service levels and quality. For instance, we made progress creating what we term a digital front door, which will use AI in our website and service center kiosks to answer basic questions from patients, reducing workload on Phlebotomist and calls to our customer service team. We also recently automated elements of the specimen preparation process in several labs and expect to deploy these systems across other sites in 2024. These systems make our front-end operations more efficient and improve quality while also freeing our employees to focus on other value-added work. Finally, I'd like to personally thank my Quest colleagues for delivering a superior customer experience. Our industry just celebrated Lab Week, which reminds us of the key role labs play at the heart of healthcare. I'm proud that our nearly 50,000 employees bring Quest's purpose to life every day. Working together to create a healthier world, one life at a time. And with that, I'll turn it over to Sam to provide more details on our performance and our 2024 guidance. Sam? Sam Samad : Thanks, Jim. In the first quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.37 billion, up 1.5% versus the prior year, while base business revenues grew nearly 6%. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services were up 1.7% compared to the prior year, reflecting strong growth in our base testing revenues, partially offset by lower revenues from COVID-19 testing services. Total volume measured by the number of requisitions, increased 1.6% versus the first quarter of 2023, with acquisitions contributing 60 basis points to total volume. Total base testing volumes grew 3.3% versus the prior year, despite the impact of severe weather in the first two weeks of January. During the quarter, weather negatively impacted volume growth by approximately 30 basis points. Revenue per requisition was up slightly versus the prior year, driven primarily by an increase in the number of tests per rec and favorable test mix, largely offset by lower COVID-19 testing. Base business revenue per rec was up 2.6% due to an increase in the number of tests per rec and favorable test mix. Unit price reimbursement was flat. Reported operating income in the first quarter was $300 million, or 12.7% of revenues, compared to $305 million, or 13.1% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $349 million or 14.8% of revenues compared to $350 million or 15% of revenues last year. Adjusted operating income was relatively consistent versus the prior year due to strong growth in the base business, largely offset by lower COVID-19 testing revenues, wage increases, and higher benefit costs. Reported EPS was $1.72 in the quarter compared to $1.78 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $2.04, flat versus the prior year. Cash from operations was $154 million in the first quarter versus $94 million in the prior year. Subsequent to the end of the first quarter, we repaid $300 million of senior notes which matured on April 1st. Turning to our updated full year 2024 guidance. Revenues are expected to be between $9.4 billion and $9.48 billion. Reported EPS expected to be in a range of $7.57 to $7.82, and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $8.72 to $8.97. Cash from operations is expected to be approximately $1.3 billion, and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $420 million. The following are some key assumptions underlying our guidance to consider as you update your models. COVID-19 testing revenues to decline approximately $175 million for the full year. In terms of M&A, our guidance only includes acquisitions that have been announced or closed to-date. No change to our expectation for dilution from Haystack Oncology of an incremental $0.20 to adjusted EPS for the full year. Operating margin to expand for the full year driven by volume growth and improved productivity. Net interest expense to be approximately $190 million. Weighted average share count to be flat compared to the end of 2023. While we are only one quarter into the year, given the strong volume trends in Q1, we have raised our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.10 at the midpoint, which more than offsets the $0.05 to $0.07 headwind we experienced from weather in January. With that, I will now turn it back to Jim. Jim Davis : Thanks, Sam. To summarize, our business delivered strong revenue growth across our core customer channels, physicians, hospitals, and consumers, building on trends from 2023. Our strong customer relationships, broad health plan access, and investments in advanced diagnostics are enabling us to take advantage of sustained high healthcare utilization and drive new customer growth. We are steadily improving productivity as well as service levels and quality, giving us confidence in improved profitability in 2024. Now we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question for today will come from Patrick Donnelly of Citi. Your line is open, sir. Patrick Donnelly : Hey guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I want to focus on the margins Sam. Obviously, a big story throughout last year. Nice to see them come in a little bit better than expected this quarter. Can you talk about the moving pieces? It sounds like Haystack was as expected in terms of the dilution for the year. You are kind of maintaining that expectation. But can you talk about the better performance this quarter and then expectations as we work our way through the year, the right way to think about the cadence there? I just want to make sure we have that metric kind of ironed out as we think about the progress as we work our way through 2024 here. Jim Davis : Yeah, sure Patrick, and good morning. So maybe the best way to look at it is think about it in terms of year-over-year. We were 14.8% operating margins in Q1 of this year compared to 15% last year. So some moving parts for you to consider and think about, because you can look at this in many different ways. But versus last year, obviously a big headwind in terms of COVID, both in terms of volumes, but also price. We had $90 million less COVID this quarter versus last year same quarter, at a much lower price as well, because we were getting reimbursed at $100 price back then. If you think about other smaller headwinds, I mean Haystack as you said, we still expect it to be $0.20 incremental dilution versus last year for the full year, well you saw that in Q1. But then offsetting these headwinds, the biggest one being COVID, was base volume growth and productivity improvement. So we actually offset almost the majority of the COVID headwind through base improvement in terms of margins. The consumer-initiated testing business also expanded operating margins as well. We continue to see great momentum in that business and good improvement in profitability. Our base gross margins actually improved quite significantly from Q1 of last year, so very encouraged by the start that we've had and the momentum that we see going forward. In terms of cadence, I think to answer your second question, it's I'd say normal seasonality that you would expect going forward. A step up in Q2 in terms of operating margins, maybe consistent operating margins to Q2 and Q3, and then a step down in Q4, which is, I would say normal pre-COVID seasonality for us. Operator, next question. Operator : Yes. The next question will come from Ann Hynes of Mizuho Securities. Your line is open. Ann Hynes : Great, thanks. Good morning. So you beat consensus by 11%, but only raised EPS by 1% \u2013 I mean, I'm sorry 1%. Can you tell us what Q1 came in versus your internal expectations? And should we view that differential as conservatism, or is it something else we should consider as we model? Thanks. Sam Samad : So let me start, Ann. Thank you for the question by the way. This is Sam, and Jim if you want to add anything as well, by all means. We beat in Q1, both in terms of versus external expectations, but also versus our own internal expectations. So we came in better. We had called out at the beginning of the year on the Q4 earnings call that we expect to see a $0.05 to $0.07 headwind from weather, in terms of EPS headwind from weather. That was at the time driven by the fact that really the first two weeks, three weeks of January were quite tough for us in terms of utilization and in terms of weather. We offset a significant portion of that. I mean, you heard on the prepared remarks that we had a 30 basis point headwind impact as a result of weather, but really we offset most of the headwinds in terms of the EPS impact. So the $0.05 to $0.07, largely we feel good that that's behind us and that's essentially taken off the table. So we felt comfortable increasing our EPS by $0.10 at the midpoint. Now, we're only in the second quarter here. We still have three quarters to go. Utilization was really strong, especially base business utilization in the first quarter. We're expecting in the next three quarters that we go back to, I would say, more normal utilization, not what we saw in Q1. So that's what our EPS range is also driven by. But I would say very pleased with the beat that we had in Q1 and taking the weather headwind off the table. Jim Davis : Yeah. The only thing I'd add Ann, is that the volume growth was broad-based. We saw it across all physician channels and we saw it in health systems as well. So it did beat our internal expectations after a slow start in January. It came back very nicely in February and March and we finished strong. Ann Hynes : Great. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Kevin Caliendo of UBS. Your line is open. Kevin Caliendo : Hey, thanks for taking my question. So, I wanted to ask a little bit about LDT. I'm sure you\u2019re hoping that the ruling was going to come out before you reported, so that you can actually address it. But maybe talk a little bit, now that you've had some time to go over the initial proposal and maybe what you are expecting in the final proposal? Maybe can you let us know about the scope of the tests that you think are going to be included, and any sort of financial implications that you might have for fiscal \u201824? Did it change the way you were guiding? Is there anything in the guidance for this? And maybe how you think it plays out with regards to, are you going to try to get an injunction or anything like that through an ACLA? Jim Davis : Yeah. So thanks, Kevin. So look, we don't know what the final rule is yet. We've all seen the proposed rule. It largely follows 21 CFR Part 820, which is the regulated device code. So we're preparing for it, but let me just tell you, look, we start with a strong quality management system and a very strong quality organization in Quest Diagnostics today. As you know we follow the CLIA guidelines. CLIA was implemented in 1988. It's a very robust and strict set of guidelines that we follow, and we feel good about that. I would also tell you that myself and many other people in Quest Diagnostics have come from regulated device manufacturing companies in the healthcare space, so we know what to do, we know how to do it. Certainly there's gaps between what CLIA recommends and what 21 CFR recommends, and we'll address those gaps once we know what the final rule is, but we'll be prepared. There's not going to be any impact on earnings or EPS here in 2024. As you know the timeframe laid out was a three to four year timeframe. So we'll address this in a thoughtful way. We'll be prepared, and we've got the confidence and quality organization in place to do it. Operator : The next question will come from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. Your line is open. Taji Phillips : Good morning. You've got Taji on for Brian. Thank you for taking my question. So first, just on the M&A contribution, obviously called out 60 basis points, contribution to total volume. Just curious, is the 50 basis point expectation for the full year contribution to revenue still stand? Thank you. Jim Davis : Well, if we don't do any other acquisitions this year, then yes, the 50 basis point trend will continue for the following quarters. But, as we mentioned in the script, our funnel is good, it's robust and we would expect to close some additional transactions this year. But timing is involved and these things do take time. We're cautiously optimistic. Sam Samad : Yeah, just to be clear, our consistent approach is always going to be, that we will include in the guidance that we provide only the things that have been announced and our carryover acquisitions. So, anything that we haven't announced will not be included in our guidance. To Jim's point, if we do close any other transactions, we will include them in our guidance perspective going forwarded. Operator : The next question will come from Erin Wright of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Erin Wright : Great. Thanks. I wanted to ask on just the broader advanced diagnostic segment. How that's tracking relative to kind of internal expectations. You've made advances in areas like Alzheimer's, for instance and now you did Haystack acquisition. Can you talk a little bit about potential holes in your offering that you see as opportunities? And then on the Haystack front, just what's the next catalyst on that front? Thanks. Jim Davis : Yeah. So, from an advanced diagnostic standpoint, it certainly met and even exceeded our expectations here in the quarter. So, let me talk about brain health first. The uptake of our AB 42/40 test, which is a blood-based test for amyloid plaque has again exceeded expectations. We're really, really pleased with how that test is doing. We announced yesterday in a press release that we've added a p-tau217. We had already introduced p-tau181. So we feel like the brain health blood-based portfolio is in great shape. The CSS side of the portfolio continues to do well as well. On the women's healthcare side, prenatal genetics and carrier screening are doing very well. We continue to see double-digit growth there. With respect to Haystack, as you know, it's still pre-revenue, but we are about to embark on what we call our early experience program. We said in the script that we were oversubscribed. We saw it somewhere between 15 and 20 partners to start the program with, and we filled that up a lot more quickly than we thought and had to cut it off at 20 customers. So, feel good about that. We're going to run that early experience program for the next several months, which will position us for a broader national launch later in the quarter. So, feeling good about the contribution of advanced diagnostics across our portfolio of tests. Operator : The next question will come from Michael Cherny of Leerink Partners. Your line is open. Michael Cherny : Good morning. Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe, Sam, if I can turn back to the guidance you talked about, the dynamics of utilization and the expectation that it will be a slightly more normal environment. As you think about that, how does that factor into your expectations for organic volume, not only on the total number, but also on mix and how that... Sam Samad : Hey, Mike, sorry. We kind of lost you for two seconds there. Can you please repeat the question? Because I missed a portion of it. Michael Cherny : Is this better? Sam Samad : Yes, this is much better. Thank you. Michael Cherny : Okay, I'm going to try to fix my headset after this. Apologize for that. So, it's a question just on the dynamics of what's ingrained in the organic volume expectations, is included both from a normalization of the market, but also a mixed perspective and how that factors into your expectations for margin expansion, and where are the push and pull points that will allow you to make sure you hit the margin expansion versus areas that you could potentially fall short? Sam Samad : Yeah, I can start, and by all means, Jim you can add some color as well. I think as Jim talked about earlier, Mike, we've got some areas within advanced diagnostics that are growing in the double digits, which really helps us from growing some of the key tests that we have in that portfolio, and also helps us from profitability standpoint as well. But overall base volumes, we grew in revenues 5.7%, grew less than that in volumes in Q1. Our expectation is that we're growing in the sort of close to mid-single digits, maybe slightly below that in terms of volumes, and that drives a lot of productivity and improvement in terms of our margins as we look forward. So, both in terms of mix and some of these advanced diagnostics tests that we have, but also in terms of volume growth overall for the remaining three quarters, we expect that to drive an improvement in terms of productivity. Now remember, we are \u2013 in the next three quarters, we're not assuming that we continue at the same level and same rate of whether you call it base revenue growth and maybe to some extent base clinical volume growth. We do expect that some of this \u2013 as utilization starts to come down and normalize. Maybe that's a conservative assumption, not sure, but at this point, we're more comfortable saying that it's going to be, volume growth is going to be closer to that, just slightly lower than mid-single digits. Jim, anything you would add there? Jim Davis : Yeah, I would just say, the mix in the quarter was really good. On a total basis, so all in, even with COVID we still had 10 basis points of growth from a rev-per-rec standpoint, pricing relatively flat. So it suggests that test-pa rec and test-mix were really, really strong. Remember, that offset, as Sam said in the script, $90 million worth of COVID decline. COVID that last year was at $100 per test. So, we completely offset that from a mix standpoint and still saw growth in rev-per-rec. So, really happy with the mix that we saw in the quarter. Operator : The next question comes from Jack Meehan of Nephron Research. Your line is open. Jack Meehan : Thanks. Good morning, guys. I was hoping you could unpack the core growth a little bit more. So, nearly 6% that was a 3% beat versus what I was looking for. Historically, the lab has been a pretty steady business. So, to post a beat like this, it's pretty notable. Can you just lay out the factors for why maybe outside of core utilization growth came in a lot stronger in the quarter? Any thoughts on share gains? Was that a dynamic? Thanks. Jim Davis : I think it's all of the above, Jack. Certainly, the utilization remains strong, consistent with what we've seen in the last three or four quarters. But, we also said that, yeah, we think we're picking up share. We closed several large transactions with two integrated large physician groups in the quarter. Our core physician volume growth was strong. Our hospital reference growth was strong. Our PLS volume relatively strong in the quarter. So, that suggests utilization in hospitals was also up, and our pathology business contributing as well to growth. So, we see it across all physician types, all physician channels, retailers, as well as these large physician groups. It's a combination of utilization plus share gain. Sam Samad : Yeah, and Jack, this is Sam. I'll mention one other thing as well. If you're looking at overall base business growth, I mean, the Quest Health Consumer-Initiated Testing business as well was a very good strength and tailwind in the quarter. Basically, that base business excluding COVID almost doubled in the quarter \u2013 year-over-year. Operator : The next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Elizabeth Anderson : Hi guys. Maybe a slight two-parter for me. First just to pick up Sam, what you were just saying about the consumer business. Can you talk about when you sort of think about, how you think about the margin progression of that and sort of like what your expectations are for that to get more towards the corporate average? And then secondarily, could you just comment on the continued labor environment? How are you seeing sort of wages and turnover versus the prior quarter? Thank you. Sam Samad : Yeah. Hey, I'll address both. So the margins on our consumer business are consistent with the margins in the overall business. So, it's right there. It's at the meeting for the company and it continued to improve all last year and so feel good about that. In terms of the labor environment, we definitely saw a tick down or a tick up, let's just say, in our retention rates. Not yet back to pre-COVID levels, but below in the high teens, below the 20% threshold that we were running at last year. So, we feel good about that. We saw a downward tick in logistics attrition, our specimen processing. It was across the board. All front-line jobs improved in the quarter and feel good about the direction that that's moving in. Operator : The next question comes from Lisa Gill of J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much. Good morning. In your prepared comments, you talked about 50% of health plans now having some type of value-based care arrangement. Can you maybe just give us an example of what that looks like and talk about what that means to the margin? Jim Davis : Yeah. So we call it value-based incentives is what we're talking about here. Generally there is two types. So, one is related to acquisitions. So when we acquire an outreach book of business, and let's say the health plan was paying that health system 200% to 300% of Medicare, it is not going to come down to the rates that we are contracted with that health plan with on day one. It will step down over time. In fact, there's \u2013 again, since it doesn't step right down to our rate, we're getting paid a higher price for that work over some period of time. The second incentive types are broad-based or types of incentives are really related to volume movement. So, movement of high-priced requisitions from health system laboratories or from out-of-network laboratories into Quest Diagnostics. In essence, you're getting paid for share gains at that health plan that are tied to share gains coming from, moving those requisitions from, again, health systems and out-of-network labs. So, really those are the two types of value incentives that we get. Lisa Gill : Just to confirm, there's no impact from the change cyber-attack at all on Quest in the quarter? Jim Davis : No, less than 2% of our requisitions were ever moving through those pipes from an adjudication standpoint. There's somewhere between a $15 million and $20 million cash impact, but no revenue impact in the quarter. Sam Samad : And just to be clear, the cash impact is really a delay, not necessarily any impact to revenue. Lisa Gill : Okay, great. Thanks for the comment. Operator : This question comes from Michael Ryskin of Bank of America. Your line has opened, sir. Michael Ryskin : Hey, guys. Thanks for the question and congrats on the quarter. I want to follow up on an earlier point you touched on, the COVID headwind that you overcame in the quarter and just how to think about price for the rest of the year. So as you said, impressive that you saw revenue for requisition growth, despite some of that headwind. How should we think about that through the rest of the year? I mean, and again, that's kind of a two-parter in terms of COVID headwinds and fading as you go through the year and then the pricing benefit. You had some major health plan renegotiation that concluded last year. Is that what's driving some of that growth and anything else in that arena that we should be thinking of for the rest of the year? Thanks. Jim Davis : Yeah, so let me start and then I'll let Sam make some comments. So, remember, in the rev-rec calculation, there's multiple moving parts here. The first one is pure price. We said it was flat in the quarter and we expected to be flattish for the rest of the year. We also said in the rev-rec calculation is test-per-rec \u2013 test-per-rec, test-mix, and then payer-mix. Test-per-rec, positive in the quarter, we expect that to continue. Test-mix was favorable in the quarter. We expect that to continue. So all told, we like the trend that we saw in the first quarter. Now, there's always puts and takes as we move through each quarter and, we'll have to see how it plays out. But Sam, do you? Sam Samad : Yeah, I mean, I'll add maybe a couple of things. First of all, the COVID point, Michael, COVID is not really material for the rest of the year. We said for the full year, it's going to be a $175 million decline. We've had $90 million of that decline happen in Q1. So, the biggest impact really was going to be felt in Q1. But yeah, there is a price impact related to it, given the fact that \u2013 a small, minor price impact, actually, because the price went down middle of May last year. So really it's a minor price impact. Then just a little bit of color on the pricing dynamics. As Jim said, it's flattish for the full year in terms of price impact. If you look at the ingredients within that, the health plans, we expect them to be, modestly up in terms of price. The health systems is a negative impact in terms of price. Then we have some other businesses where we've had some price increases that helps. So overall, I think the net neutral in terms of price impact for the year. Michael Ryskin : Great. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Stephanie Davis of Barclays. Your line is open. Stephanie Davis : Hey, guys. Congrats on the quarter. Thanks for taking my question. You touched a bit on the automation opportunity in your centers in your prepared remarks. So I was hoping you could help us tease out what the mix of the cost structure looks like in the centers. How should we think about the Phlebotomy talent that would be difficult to improve with AI solutions, versus how much of that cost is more admin or front desk and could have that AI opportunity coming up? Jim Davis : Well, Stephanie, we've always said that about 50% of the cost structure in the company is wages, labor and within the laboratories, it's obviously higher than that. Within the Phlebotomy, it's mostly a people expense, although there's supplies and rent for our patient service centers. I would say in the laboratories, much of the automation efforts continue in the specimen processing area, what we call sorting, aliquoting, pouring off tubes of urine, and things like that. That's where our automation efforts continue to pay dividends for us. On the Phlebotomy side, as I mentioned, yes, it's a highly labor-intensive operation. Now, in a typical 10 to 12 minute draw time, there's still probably five to six minutes of that time doing manual paperwork, computer entry type of stuff. The biggest opportunity there to improve that is still the movement from paper requisitions to electronic requisitions. What still comes into our patient service center today is 35% to 45% paper that we end up having to input that information into our Quest system. So we work back through the physician offices that send us that paper and try to convert that. I would tell you also, we're working on some other kits that could allow for some self-draw. So these are early stages, early stage development. But, we continue to work on some other things that should make our Phlebotomy staff even more productive. Operator : And our final question. Stephanie Davis : Thank you. Operator : Our final question of today, will come from Andrew Brackmann of William Blair. Your line is open. Andrew Brackmann : Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just following up on some of the questions related to advanced diagnostics from earlier. I guess it's been about a year since you guys announced that Haystack acquisition. So, can you maybe just talk about how your views on the MRD segment or that asset in particular may have evolved since then? I know you mentioned no change in dilution or spending related to it this year, but how so we'll be thinking about potential additional investments here in the future to drag some of those share wins. Thanks. Jim Davis : Andrew, our thesis hasn't changed at all on the Haystack acquisition. The MRD market continues to grow by our estimates strong double digits. I mean, there's one primary competitor in that space today that is doing very, very well with the test and making inroads in the market, and we applaud them and they're doing terrific. So, we think having a second, third credible offering in the marketplace that has a very, very, good basis for competition, very strong and very low limits of detection. So, feel good about that test. We still feel great about the investment and where this market is going. We're going to build on that. We've launched our STEP500, assay as well that allows cancer doctors, medical oncologists to get advice from a treatment planning therapy \u2013 therapy planning standpoint. So we feel good about that. We like, by the way, on Haystack it's a tumor-informed test. Again, we feel good about the technology. As we mentioned earlier, we've signed up 20 pre-launch customers for this early experience program. These are a broad base set of customers from community-based oncologists to academic medical centers. So, we like the mix of customers that have come to us right away for this. Once we wrap this early experience program up, we'll be launching on a national basis later this year. Sam Samad : Andrew, just to add, this is Sam from a dilution standpoint. So our expectations this year have not changed. It's still in total 35% dilution, which is $0.20 of incremental dilution versus last year. For next year, we expect less dilution from Haystack. So on a year-over-year basis, it's actually a tailwind, and then we expect to be basically to start being neutral to a creative as we look towards \u201826. So, nothing has changed from a dilution or financial expectations, and we're really thrilled about the interest in the early experience program that Jim referenced. Operator : And that was the final question. Jim Davis : All right, thanks, operator. And thanks again for joining our call today. We really appreciate your continued support. Have a good day, everyone. Operator : Thank you for participating in the Quest Diagnostics first quarter 2024 conference call.

Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. Now I\u2019d like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Please go ahead, sir. Shawn Bevec : Thank you, and good morning. I'm joined by Jim Davis, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; and Sam Samad, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and we'll discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS. Any references to base business, testing, revenues, or volumes refer to the performance of our business excluding COVID-19 testing. Growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections, including consolidated revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth, and adjusted earnings growth are compound annual growth rates. Finally, revenue growth rates from acquisitions will be measured against our base business. Now, here is Jim Davis. Jim Davis : Thanks Shawn and good morning, everyone. We delivered another strong quarter, with base business revenue growth of nearly 4% and total revenue growth of 2.5% as well as continued improvement in productivity and profitability in the base business. This performance is due to growth of new physician and hospital customers, more favorable test mix that includes greater adoption of advanced diagnostics and continued strength in healthcare utilization. We also made progress improving our operational quality and efficiency through greater use of automation and AI. In addition, we are excited to announce four acquisitions that meet our criteria for growth, profitability and returns, and that will enable us to expand in strategic growth areas. Our planned acquisition of LifeLabs, a trusted name in laboratory services for millions of Canadians, will enable us to grow in Canada, which has a population that is growing, and aging faster, than in the U.S. LifeLabs is especially strong in two of Canada\u2019s largest and fastest growing provinces, British Columbia and Ontario, which collectively account for about half of the country\u2019s population. We are familiar with the Canadian market, having delivered reference testing to many providers there for over 20 years. LifeLabs has been one of those reference partners for about a decade, so we know firsthand that their business, team and reputation is strong, and provides a solid foundation for growth. We expect to complete the transaction by the end of the year. Our recently announced acquisition of Select Lab Assets of Allina Health, a leading non-profit health system, will enable us to extend our reach in Minneapolis and throughout Minnesota and Wisconsin. We also announced our plans to acquire the outreach lab assets of OhioHealth, a nationally recognized charitable health system in Ohio. Both transactions will broaden our presence in geographic areas of the United States where we\u2019ve had limited access to providers due to the predominance of health systems. These acquisitions show our ability to attract and partner with top, growing health systems that share our commitment to expanding patient access to innovative and more affordable testing. We expect to complete both transactions in the third quarter. We also completed our acquisition of PathAI Diagnostics, which provides a readymade platform on which to scale digital pathology and AI to help health systems and other providers improve quality, speed and efficiency in cancer diagnosis. These acquisitions take time and involve teams of dedicated individuals. I want to personally thank my Quest colleagues for delivering on our M&A strategy, and we will now turn our attention to the hard work of integrating these deals. Now, I\u2019ll recap our strategy and discuss highlights from the second quarter. Then Sam will provide detail on our financial results and talk about our updated financial guidance for 2024. Our strategy to drive growth is focused on delivering solutions that meet the evolving needs of our core customers, physicians, hospitals and consumers. We enable growth across our customer channels through advanced diagnostics, with an intense focus on faster growing clinical areas, including within brain health and molecular genomics and oncology. In addition, acquisitions are a key growth driver, with an emphasis on accretive outreach purchases as well as other independent labs. Our strategy also includes driving operational improvements across the business, with the strategic deployment of automation and AI to improve quality, service, efficiency, and the workforce experience. Here are some updates on progress we have made in each of these areas. While we grew total volumes from Diagnostic Information Services 1.1% with base business volume growth of 1.7%, volumes from our base clinical business grew 3.2% in the second quarter, due to the strength among physicians and hospitals. In Physician lab services, we delivered another quarter of high single-digit base business revenue growth. This growth was driven by continued strength in healthcare utilization, as well as overall market growth, and share gains due to new customer wins. We drove favorable test mix as well as growth in test per requisition, which we attribute to greater utilization of our expanding portfolio of advanced diagnostics. Finally, we also saw strong volume and revenue growth within Medicare Advantage plans, where narrow network strategies direct testing to high quality, cost-efficient options like Quest. Our broad health plan access, which extends to approximately 90% of covered lives in the U.S., enabled us to take advantage of high demand for lab services, consistent with recent quarters. Health plans value our ability to improve access, scale innovation and drive costs out of healthcare. We are also working to develop opportunities to serve new geographies with our health plan partners. In Hospital lab services, we grew base business revenues by nearly 4%. Growth of reference testing remains higher than historical levels as hospitals struggled to fill open positions, especially in technical fields, such as histotechnology, microbiology and cytotechnology. Our advanced diagnostics portfolio provides a compelling alternative for hospitals to send us more reference work. Hospitals face several challenges, including high supply costs, high wages and decisions about how and where to deploy their capital. Patients want better value from lab services as well as easier access. Plus, diagnostic innovation is evolving at a fast pace. These dynamics are contributing to an accelerating trend of outreach acquisitions and professional lab service arrangements with the national labs. Our specialization and scale empower us to deliver a breadth of quality, innovative and accessible services that are often far more affordable for the patient. That\u2019s why top hospitals are choosing Quest for reference testing, professional lab services and outreach asset sales that deliver quality and efficiency. In consumer-initiated testing, our consumer facing platform, questhealth.com, grew total revenues nearly 40% while base business revenues grew more than 50% versus the prior year. As we learn more about our customers as our portfolio expands, we are improving growth and marketing productivity. Today, about 25% of our revenues are from existing customers and 20% of our revenues are from tests we introduced in the past year. In Advanced Diagnostics, several key clinical areas drove double-digit revenue growth, continuing the trend in recent quarters. This growth was particularly strong in brain health, women\u2019s health, particularly prenatal and hereditary genetics, and advanced cardiometabolic health. Our Alzheimer\u2019s disease portfolio was the primary driver of growth for our brain health offering. Demand was strong for our AD-Detect blood tests which assess risk based on amyloid, p-tau and APOE biomarkers. Demand was also strong for our CSF test options for aiding treatment decisions. Yesterday, we introduced our Neurofilament Light Chain test, which helps assess neuronal damage that may signify Alzheimer\u2019s disease as well as multiple sclerosis and other neurodegenerative conditions. In molecular genomics and oncology, we are encouraged by early results of our Haystack MRD Early Experience program prior to the broad national launch later this year. Physicians from leading cancer institutions are using the Haystack MRD blood test to assess cancer recurrence and treatment response for a range of cancers, including colorectal, lung and breast. We also grew the body of evidence on the clinical and economic value of ctDNA blood testing in cancer care. A study published in JAMA Health Forum in June found that MRD testing could reduce costs for health plans, particularly commercial payers, by identifying patients that would benefit from chemotherapy after stage II colon cancer surgery. In addition, research presented at the June ASCO conference showed that Haystack MRD testing identified complete clinical response to immunotherapy for patients with colorectal cancer earlier than standard assessments, such as PET,MRI and endoscopy scans. Finally, we recently expanded our Haystack research collaborations to include Lisata Therapeutics, which will use Haystack MRD to study an investigational treatment for advanced pancreatic cancer. Turning to advanced cardiometabolic testing, we are seeing interest in several biomarkers that improve early detection of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases like diabetes and kidney disease. These include insulin resistance, which can identify pre-diabetes risk before AIc tests, and ApoB, a more precise marker of heart attack risk than traditional lipid panels. They also include Lp(a), which is an inherited marker of heart disease risk found in up to 20% of the population and for which several therapies are now in development. Turning to operational excellence, our Invigorate program aims to deliver a targeted 3% annual cost savings and productivity improvements. During the quarter, we expanded our use of automation and AI in order to improve productivity as well as service levels and quality. For instance, we advanced our use of automation in front-end specimen processing to now include five of our labs, freeing more of our processors to focus on value-added work. We also expanded our AI capabilities in microbiology to include the ability to segregate out specimens with no evidence of microbial growth so our medical scientists can concentrate on reviewing those with the greatest likelihood of disease. In addition, we broadened our use of AI in customer service to help our representatives access answers more quickly, improving their efficiency and service quality. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Sam to provide more details on our performance and our 2024 guidance. Sam? Sam Samad : Thanks, Jim. In the second quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.4 billion, up 2.5% versus the prior year while base business revenues grew 3.8%. Organic base business revenues grew by 3.1%. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services were up 2.8% compared to the prior year reflecting strong growth in our base testing revenues partially offset by lower revenues from COVID-19 testing services. Total volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 1.1% versus the second quarter of 2023 with acquisitions contributing 40 basis points to total volume. Total base testing volumes grew 1.7% versus the prior year. Total revenue per requisition was up 1.6% versus the prior year, driven primarily by an increase in the number of tests per req and favorable test mix, partially offset by the timing of certain value-based arrangements in the second quarter of 2023 that did not repeat this year and lower COVID-19 testing. Base business revenue per req was up 2.4%. Unit price reimbursement was flat. Clinical base business revenues were up 5.1% while volumes grew 3.2%. This primarily reflects growth through our physician and hospital channels, which comprise approximately 90% of our total revenues, and excludes the impact of lower volumes primarily in our employer businesses providing workforce drug testing and employee population health services. Reported operating income in the second quarter was $355 million, or 14.8% of revenues, compared to $348 million, or 14.9% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $398 million, or 16.6% of revenues, compared to $389 million, or 16.7% of revenues last year. The increase in adjusted operating income was due to strong growth in the base business, partially offset by lower COVID-19 testing revenues and wage increases. Reported EPS was $2.03 in the quarter compared to $2.05 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $2.35, versus $2.30 the prior year. Cash from operations was $514 million year-to-date through the second quarter versus $538 million in the prior year. Turning now to our updated full year 2024 guidance. Revenues are expected to be between $9.5 billion and $9.58 billion. Reported EPS expected to be in a range of $7.57 to $7.77, and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $8.80 to $9.00. Cash from operations is expected to be approximately $1.3 billion, and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $420 million. Given the uncertainty around when the LifeLabs acquisition will close, we are not including this transaction in our updated 2024 guidance. However, in the first 12 months after closing the acquisition, we expect the transaction to generate approximately $710 million in annual revenues and to be slightly dilutive to GAAP EPS, due primarily to amortization of intangibles and other items, but approximately $0.10 to $0.15 accretive to adjusted EPS. These assumptions include the impact of expected debt financing to close the acquisition. With that said, the following are some key assumptions underlying our updated guidance for you to consider. The increase in our revenue guidance reflects the recently announced acquisitions of PathAI Diagnostics, Allina Health, and OhioHealth as well as the strength of our base business. The PathAI Diagnostics acquisition closed in June, while Allina Health and OhioHealth are expected to close in Q3. The revenue contribution from these acquisitions represents the majority of the increase in our updated revenue guidance. As a reminder, new acquisitions are typically breakeven to slightly profitable initially with profitability expanding over several quarters. Therefore, we are not expecting a material contribution to earnings from these acquisitions in 2024, but do expect increasing profitability next year. No change to our expectation for dilution from Haystack Oncology of an incremental $0.20 to adjusted EPS for the full year. Operating margin to expand for the full year, driven by volume growth and improved productivity. Net interest expense expected to be approximately $190 million. This does not include interest expense related to debt financing for the LifeLabs acquisition. Weighted average share count to be flat compared to the end of 2023. Finally, our operations were affected by the worldwide IT outage last week, which limited our ability to collect and process specimens on Friday and through the weekend. Our labs were processing specimens by Friday afternoon, and the rest of our operations, including patient service centers, were largely restored to normal by yesterday morning. At this point, we estimate the IT outage and a minor impact from hurricane Beryl in Texas earlier this month could amount to a roughly $0.06 to $0.08 headwind on our Q3 earnings. This is currently reflected in our updated full year guidance. With that, I will now turn it back to Jim. Jim Davis : Thanks, Sam. To summarize, our business delivered strong total and base revenue growth across our core customer channels, due to strong commercial execution, innovative offerings and ongoing strength in healthcare utilization. We announced four acquisitions that meet our criteria for growth, profitability and returns and position us for growth in new geographic and service areas. We improved productivity as well as service levels and quality, through greater use of automation and AI. Finally, I\u2019d like to personally thank my nearly 50,000 Quest colleagues for our strong performance this quarter, which is largely the result of the dedication, care and collaboration that they show patients, customers each and every single day. This commitment was exemplified by the tireless efforts of our teams to restore outstanding service for patients and customers this past weekend following the global IT outage. I\u2019m proud to work with so many talented people committed to living our purpose, working together to create a healthier world, one life at a time. With that, we\u2019d be happy to take your questions. Operator. Operator : Thank you. We will now open it up to questions. [Operator Instructions]. The first question will come from Ann Hynes of Mizuho Securities. Your line is open. Ann Hynes : Hi, good morning. I just had a follow-up question on volume. I believe you said the total base volume is up 1.7%. But if you exclude employer base, it's up 3.2%. Can you just give us more detail on what's happening in that business? Is it just the overall job market? And maybe if you can provide some like profitability versus staff position-based business versus the employer-based business and whether or not it was in line with your estimates? Then my second question just has to do around the Canadian acquisition. Can you just give us more details on that market? How is it different than the U.S.? Why you view it as attractive? Maybe some long-term growth revenue algorithms versus the U.S. business? Is it growing in line with the business? Is it higher growth? That would be great. Thank you. Jim Davis : Yeah, good morning Ann. Let me start here. So, on the employer side, we have two principal businesses that serve employers. One is our Employee Drug Testing Business, second is our Employer Population Health business. There is a third business as you know called ExamOne that does health risk assessments for life insurance companies. Taken together, all three of those businesses showed meaningful declines in the quarter, and really largely represent the difference in the 3.2% that Sam referred too and the 1.7%. In the drug testing market, there's a couple of shifts going on. Number one, a lot of the job growth is still coming in the services industry, hotel workers, restaurant workers. A lot of those industries just have given up on drug testing. Other companies that still do drug testing, as you probably know, many have eliminated marijuana off the panel, so that has created some pressure. Then the final thing I'd tell you, is there's a shift going on in employee drug testing, where more companies are doing what we call on-site or oral testing, and if that test is positive, it eventually reflexes back to a central lab. But if it's a negative test, it's just an on-site screen and the employee passes and we don't get that work. On the Employee Population Health, we're just seeing companies not spend as much money on these wellness events that they've typically done in the past. Finally again, ExamOne, our life insurance business, that does risk assessments for life insurance. Just the life insurance policies, we saw a spike. During COVID people started to get life insurance again. Post-COVID, that negative trend has continued, which we were seeing actually pre-COVID. Now, let me turn to the Canada market for just a minute here. So look, there's a lot to like about the Canadian market. First of all, a population of roughly 41 million people. The population growth rate is actually faster than the U.S. The population growth there at about 1.1%. Here in the U.S., population growing less than 50 basis points. The aging of the population there as well is a good trend that we like and LifeLabs is really centered in two key markets, British Columbia and Ontario; Ontario being the biggest province in Canada, British Columbia being the second largest province. Collectively, those two provinces are over 50% or close to 50% of the Canadian population. We like the reimbursement model in Canada. It's steady. It's consistent. We think it will fill growth over the coming years. When we look at things like test per req, when we look at the types of testing done here in the U.S. versus Canada, we think there's opportunity to grow the types of testing that we bring into that market from an esoteric standpoint, from an advanced testing standpoint. So we feel great about entering the Canadian market. By the way, it's a market we know. We've served that market for many, many years as a reference provider. We've served LifeLabs, we've served other independent labs and hospital labs up in Canada. So we know the market, we're familiar with it, and we think it's a great opportunity for Quest Diagnostics. Sam Samad : Maybe a couple of comments to add on the services businesses Ann, just to give you some financials behind them or at least some percentages. I mean, the Workforce Health Solutions businesses, Employer Population Health, and the Employer Solutions are less than 5% of our overall revenues. So just to give you a sense of bucketing of how much those businesses are. So they are not that material or not material to our overall revenues, but as Jim said, they have been impacted post-COVID somewhat significantly and with some of the market dynamics in the drug testing business, so they are impacting our growth rates. And then ExamOne is on top of that, but it's also impacted by some of the dynamics that Jim said coming out of COVID. So these businesses are down significantly year-over-year, but we don't expect further deterioration as we look forward. So there is a year-over-year impact, but we don't expect that to further amplify as we go forward. Shawn Bevec : Operator, next question. Operator : Yes, the next question will come from Kevin Caliendo of UBS. Your line is open. Kevin Caliendo : Thanks for taking my question. It's not usually your want to raise guidance by more than a beat, in any particular quarter. Yet you did, and now we find out there was actually from what appears to be a core, even a greater upside in the second half than what you had originally had, if you back out the impact of the strike and the hurricanes and the like, the IT issues, I mean. So, is that mostly driven just by core? Are you expecting margins to expand a little bit on a year-over-year basis more than what we saw in the second quarter? I guess, I just want to understand what's driving the enthusiasm for the second half improvements. You had the M&A stuff that you mentioned, but you said there wasn't a lot of contributions. So I'm guessing its core, but I'm wondering, is it expected volume? Is it expected mix? Is it expected cost to come in better? You know wage, labor, churn, that kind of thing. Sam Samad : Yeah, so maybe I'll start Kevin, and Jim can add comments. First, let's kind of talk about the details in terms of what we shared. We said we're going to take up revenues by $100 million. We said we're going to take up EPS \u2013 and this is at the midpoint. We're going to take up EPS by $0.05 to $8.80 to $9. Within the $100 million that we talked about, the majority of that is really new M&A. So essentially M&A that we have signed, that we expect to close sometime between mid Q3 and the end of the year, and those reflect the M&A related to, or the transactions which are Allina Health, OhioHealth. We have some upside from PathAI as well, which we closed in Q2, but wasn't in our original guidance. So the revenue has a majority \u2013 the majority of the revenues is really driven by the M&A that we expect to close. The EPS increase is related to contribution from this M&A, although as we talked about in the prepared remarks, M&A ramps up in terms of profitability, so 2024, in the second half, very little contribution in terms of profitability from M&A. The remainder, I would say is contribution from the base business and some M&A, but little. And we are absorbing as you said, the impact of the IT outage, which is $0.06 to $0.08 in Q3 that we expect to, that we have now sized. This is preliminary. We'll get better detail as we go, but we are absorbing that impact. So, in terms of what's driving this improvement or the raise of EPS, we're basically continuing with a lot of the productivity work and the cost reductions that we have talked about. We have a lot of the AI and productivity improvements that Jim mentioned, a lot of the focus on improving margins. Importantly, base volumes continue to be very strong, and that's the biggest, I would say driver in terms of improved margins in the business. We continue to see base volumes be strong, utilization be strong. So really, that's the key driver. It's strength of volumes. It's continued productivity and cost improvements. It's also the fact that we have, as we've talked about many times over previous calls, a positive pricing and reimbursement environment, which is now stabilized, which is now flat to improving, as opposed to a negative price impact that we used to see in prior years. Jim Davis : Yeah. Kevin, you probably saw a meaningful improvement in rev per rack in the quarter, and as Sam mentioned, within that rev per rack calculation, price per task, flat to last year. So the improvement is really coming in three areas. One, test per req continued to be very strong, north of four. Pre-COVID, that was a number that was south of four, it was in the threes. So that's a nice uptick, and that's coming from some of our advanced testing around allergy, tick testing, cardiometabolic testing, the neurology testing. And in that also is a mixed improvement that comes from some of those advanced tests. The final thing I'd say is, we saw again, strength in our overall Medicare Advantage and Medicare Book of Business. That pricing as you know, tends to be better than the average, and we also see more advanced tests coming on those requisitions versus our normal general health and wellness requisition. So we expect those trends to continue into the back half of the year, and that's contributing to the improvements that we're laying out there. Shawn Bevec : Operator, next question. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Cherny of Leerink. Your line is open. Michael Cherny : Good morning and thank you so much for taking the question. Maybe if I can just dive a little bit into the market. I know there's still some small moving pieces. I appreciate the color you've given so far on some of the employer testing. If I sort through all of the data points you have, the $3.2 billion base business volumes, (A) I just want to make sure I got that number correctly. And then (B) as you think about that number, how do you think about that in terms of translating where you see the health of broad-based market utilization versus where your competitive position is allowing you to take share? I guess just trying to understand fully where you see utilization baked into the implied second half guidance versus what we've seen over the last six to 12 months on a baseline business. Thanks so much. Jim Davis : Yeah, again, the 3.2% represents the volume growth that we see through what we call our core or base business. And that means our physician business, our hospital reference business, our hospital PLS business, and embedded in that is both clinical, as well as anatomical pathology. So that entire book of business, which is about 90% of the company, the volumes grew 3.2%. Down from Q1, but the compare in Q2 was higher. But again, the 3.2%, we feel really good about that. Now that 3.2% volume growth again translated into 5.1% revenue growth, and that was coming again on the strength of test mix plus the test per req increase that we've been seeing year-over-year. So we feel good about that, again, going into the second half of the year. In terms of the implied growth in the second half of the year, it's in the 3.7% revenue range. So again, and that's just the base or organic, that's without acquisition. The timing of the close of these acquisitions we've set in Q3 with Allina and OhioHealth, we just don't know when in Q3, okay, so there's still some uncertainty about when these deals will officially close. A - Sam Samad : And Mike, good morning. Maybe I'll add a couple of comments just in terms of utilization. I mean, as we have been mentioning, utilization continues to be strong. We've seen it strong in Q1. We've seen it strong in Q2. The year-over-year compare in Q2 was maybe a little bit tougher versus Q2 of 2023. We had some lapping of some wins, and just overall we saw more of a resurgence in the base business in Q2 of last year. But in terms of the dynamics there, we do believe that both in terms of \u2013 there's strong utilization out there. We think some of it is return to care, but also just general strength of utilization by just additional testing, and that's reflected in the higher number of tests per req that we're seeing, but also we are gaining share. We do believe that we are gaining share, and we're gaining share through some of these also outreach acquisitions that we're doing that help us direct more testing to Quest. Shawn Bevec : Operator, next question. Operator : The next question comes from Patrick Donnelly of Citi. Your line is open. Patrick Donnelly : Thanks for the question guys. Sam, maybe just to expand on the utilization piece. Obviously, you guys have seen pretty nice elevated levels there the past couple of quarters. Can you just talk about what you are seeing and then what the guide implies in terms of how you're feeling about it? I know previously, the guide just assumed normal utilization. Obviously, it stayed a little bit elevated here. And just how you are thinking about the trend? Does it gradually come down to normal? We'd love to just discuss that a bit. Thanks. Sam Samad : Yeah, I mean, as we've talked about before Patrick, we do expect eventually utilization to level off to essentially what we've talked about in terms of our long-term growth algorithm, which is roughly around 3%-ish in terms of organic growth. And then as we said before, in terms of long-term growth, we expect 1% to 2% contribution from acquisitions. So we still think longer term, if you are thinking over the next, let's say, longer period. I'm not going to necessarily bracket it with a time period, but I think that's the right algorithm to be thinking about. In terms of for us, our current guide, right now at the midpoint we're saying total growth is close to 3%, 3.1%. Our base revenue guide is somewhere around 5% for the full year. Our second half, if you think about second half, that's essentially on the base revenue growth. It's about a 5.3% second half growth. Now recall the 5.3% in the second half, and this is revenue. It includes as we said, the majority of the $100 million take up of the guide is acquisitions. So in that 5.3% second half, there is a significant portion which is acquisitions. So in effect, if you look at just organic as Jim just alluded to, it's actually a slightly slower second half than what we saw in the first half. So embedded in that is the expectation Patrick, that this utilization doesn't continue at the same level, but starts to slow down a bit. So again, total growth, first half base \u2013 or sorry, full year base is 5%, second half base is 5.3%, but within that there's some acquisition, so the second half is closer to something between 3.5% to 4% in terms of base. Shawn Bevec : Operator, next question. Operator : The next question comes from David Westenberg of Piper Sandler. Your line is open. David Westenberg : Hi Noah. Thank you for taking the question. I just wanted to take it a little bit more of a long-term and look at the business here. How should we think about digital pathology, in light of the acquisition with PathAI? Can we see a more immediate path to incorporate it more broadly? If so, would there be cost savings in the intermediate term? And then, is there any maybe potential for pricing benefits given that a human plus AI kind of reading probably is a better outcome and so maybe would justify kind of a higher price and just as a background. Can you talk about maybe a broader framework for how much revenue of your business is pathology overall? Just anything you feel comfortable with. Thank you. Jim Davis : Yeah, we said in the past, just on our revenue from anatomical pathology, that it was \u2013 and this was pre-PathAI diagnostics, said it was roughly a $500 million book of business. But we're excited about the digital pathology opportunity on numerous fronts. On the surface, unlike radiology, digital pathology does not naturally lower your cost, because you're actually, you still need to create the slide. Once you've created the slide, then you digitize the slide, okay, so there's actually an extra step in the process. Now here is where it creates productivity and as you said, we think better quality. Number one, we do anatomical pathology in over 20 locations across the country, because you want the pathologist to sit right near where you are preparing the slide, so that you don't have to move slides and vehicles and things like that. So we believe that it's going to \u2013 digital pathology will allow us to collapse the network of sites that actually do what we call the histology work or the preparation of the slides. So there will be cost savings when we collapse that network. Second is, it allows us to route the image to expert pathologists wherever they sit in the country. So if our guru for breast pathology sits on the west coast, you move those slides out there. If the prostate guru sits on the east coast, you move those slides there. So, and yes, we believe once you've digitized that slide, there's many companies out there that are working on algorithms. There's one or two that have been FDA approved that allow you to apply algorithmic analysis to the digital image in order to improve the quality of the read. In terms of reimbursement, we absolutely believe there's a strong case to be made for a higher reimbursement using these algorithms. The final thing I would tell you is that, with digital pathology, it opens up a realm of new just histology-only types of operations. Meaning, we will take on the histology work for a health system. They'll still keep the pathologists, but they'll shut down their histology operations. We'll do the slide preparation, digitize it, and send that back to the hospital pathologist for them still to do the reading. We call this a technical-only solution, and it's a solution that's starting to take off and the margins on the technical component of histology are quite good. So we're bullish on the overall market opportunity here. Shawn Bevec : Operator, next question. Operator : The next question comes from Erin Wright of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Erin Wright : Great. Thank you for taking my questions. I have a two-parter here. On value-based care contracts, you mentioned that you lacked some of the payments that were made through those contracts or relationships last year. I guess how much did that benefit you last year and how should we be thinking about modeling that on a quarter-to-quarter basis? Will those incentive payments or contributions, are they relatively one-time in nature? Is that something you'll be breaking out for us going forward and how material have those payments been, I guess, year-to-date? And then a second part of my question would just be more on the regulatory environment. Just what you are thinking in terms of PAMA and SALSA and your expectations into 2025 on that front? Thanks. Jim Davis : All right, so let me start with your value-based care comment. I'll ask Sam to add some color, and then I'll come back and address PAMA and SALSA. So, on the value-based care, it made positive contributions in the second quarter of this year. They just weren't bigger than the second quarter of last year. Last year we had a meaningful gain. We acknowledged that last second quarter. Again, this year it was positive, but the delta between last year and this year was a headwind for us. It is very difficult for us to give you guidance on how to model these things. There's really two principal components to these value-based payments. One is from shared savings from acquisitions, and those are lumpy. They are based on the acquisitions they do. And in some cases, payments can be six months post-deal closure. In some cases it could be a year post-deal closure. It just depends on the contract. The other type of value-based incentive payment that we have with some of our payers is around the movement of requisitions from high-priced, either out-of-network laboratories or high-priced health system laboratories. And again, that could be a once-a-year true-up, and depending on when we sign that contract, it could be in June, it could be in January, it could be in April, so very, very hard to model these things. So Sam, any other color on this. A - Sam Samad : I think you've really captured it, Jim. The key thing there Erin is, it's difficult to give you a sense as to how the pacing is going to be. We\u2019ve always said these are lumpy and sometimes there's also accounting nuances on these, where if it's a shared service, shared savings commitment for instance, we might accrue for that shared savings as if we're not going to achieve it, but then when we do achieve it, we have to release that accrual so to speak, and get a benefit in that quarter. Suffice it to say that these continue to be a positive for us in terms of our overall pricing in Q2 of 2024. It was a pricing or a positive benefit for us in the quarter, but on a year-over-year base, we had a significant benefit in Q2, 2023. So it impacted us negatively in terms of total revenues on a year-over-year basis. So I think everything that Jim said stands in terms of the difficulty of giving you a modeling algorithm for these. And then PAMA, Jim, did you want to comment? Jim Davis : Yeah, in terms of PAMA in SALSA, while we continue to, we and our trade association and other independent labs continue to push the case for SALSA, we acknowledge it's going to be difficult to get that through in a year with an election year, especially now given many of the changes that occurred in the last week. Having said that, we will continue to push very hard for another one-year delay in PAMA. The recent CBO scoring on this was actually bigger than it was last year. They projected it would save the government over $3 billion. And in addition, the committee in the House that overlooks this is looking for a pay for program to pay for continued telehealth benefits. So this becomes a really nice pay for program that can satisfy the requirement to fund the telehealth. So we're confident that at a minimum that would be a one-year delay in PAMA, and hopefully we can get this done and figure it out in the October-November timeframe as opposed to waiting for the December timeframe like we've seen in the past. Shawn Bevec : Operator, next question. Operator : The next question comes from Brian Tanquilut of Jeffries. Your line is open, sir. Brian Tanquilut : Hey, good morning guys, and congrats on the quarter. Maybe Sam, as I think about your comments on Haystack, I understand maintaining the drag guidance for this year. But how are you thinking about the ramp on that as we think about 2025 and given some of the announcements you've made on new partnerships there? So just curious how we should be thinking about the development and the ramp of Haystack going forward? Thanks. A - Jim Davis : Yeah, sure. Good morning, Brian. So as we said in the prepared remarks, Haystack dilution this year will be somewhere in the $0.35 to $0.40 range, which is about a $0.20 increase in terms of dilution from prior year. For 2025 Brian, the way we see it is, it's still going to be dilutive, but it's going to be less dilutive than we see in 2024, because we will start to recognize revenues on the assay as we launch later this year. In 2026, we expect this \u2013 we expect Haystack to be slightly accretive. And we expect by the end of 2025 also to get to a positive return on invested capital from this acquisition. In terms of all the things that we've seen, the early launch has been really successful. We've had a very, very high interest in terms of number of key thought leaders and cancer centers that have signed up for this. So everything that we see today is really encouraging. And you touched on the partnerships that we've made as well. We continue to sign new partnerships in terms of cancer centers that are, or companies that are partnering with us to evaluate the use of the assay and MRD in a specific type of cancer. So really excited about the upcoming launch. I think the early launch has been very positive, and hopefully this gives you a sense as to the, you know the financial impact in terms of accretion dilution. Shawn Bevec : Operator, next question. Operator : The next question comes from Lisa Gill of JP Morgan. Your line is open. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much and good morning. Since you last reported the LDT rule that came out, can you maybe just talk about what the impact is there? I heard your comments on PAMA and SALSA, but anything else on the regulatory front that we should be aware of? Jim Davis : Yeah, thanks Lisa. So as you know, our trade association filed a lawsuit in the Federal Court of Texas, District Court of Texas, and work by outside counsel that the trade association has retained. It continues \u2013 we expect movement in the case in the latter part of this year, November, December, and probably into January of next year. Having said that, the rule is in place. We are running the company and operating the company with the rule in place. There's certain requirements that we need to have in place by May of next year, including a complaint handling unit up and running, as well as the ability to report adverse events. And these capabilities, some of which we had in the company, some of which we have to add are ongoing as we speak. We continue, we've launched training for the organization, in particular our R&D teams, our product marketing teams around design controls. And again, we're living with the rule and implementing things for the directive of the FDA. We've said this year, it's not going to add a material cost into the business, but we continue to evaluate what we need to be fully compliant, especially if the lawsuit is not successful. Shawn Bevec : Operator, next question. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Ryskin of Bank of America. Michael Ryskin : Hey. Thanks for taking the question guys. I'm going to stay on the regulatory side. It's still fairly recent, but we had a couple of questions coming from investors on Chevron deference, and the Supreme Court ruling to overturn the Chevron to outshine what could mean for deregulation. It's still kind of a hypothetical I think, but just curious what\u2019s your take on that, given your place in the industry. Jim Davis : Well, it certainly doesn't hurt the case that we believe is in front of, again, the Federal District Court in Texas. I'm not a legal expert by any means, but as you know, look, Congress is the one that sets the operating parameters for various departments that exist like the FDA. We believe what Congress authorized the FDA to do, is to regulate medical devices. Congress also authorized the CLIA Act of 1988 that talked about the regulation of clinical laboratories. So we believe it's very clear what Congress intended. Obviously, others don't see it that way, but we do believe that yes, what has come out of the Supreme Court recently is favorable and clearly dictates what should occur within the four walls of regulatory bodies. Shawn Bevec : Operator, next question. Operator : The next question comes from Jack Meehan of Nephron Research. Your line is open, sir. Jack Meehan : Thank you. Good morning. Either for Sam or for Jim, I was wondering if you could give an update on what you're seeing in terms of cost trends, how are wage costs trending, an update on turnover. And sorry if I missed this Sam, what's the full year margin target? Thank you. Jim Davis : Yeah, so from a wage standpoint, we said at the beginning of the year that we expected wage increases to be in that 3% to 4% range. We're still operating within that 3% to 4%, so we're comfortable with that estimate for the back half of the year that it'll play out in that range. In terms of turnover, last year all-in for our frontline physicians, patient services, logistics, specimen processing, our laboratory workers, we were north of 20%. In the first quarter we came down below 20% into the mid-18s, and we kind of hung there in the second quarter. So we feel good that generally you can see an uptick sometimes after your first quarter, after bonus payments and things like that, but we've maintained a relatively flat position. We obviously have some hot spots around the country in certain job categories that tend to be competitive-related, either with health systems or with other industries. So we address those hot spots and we expect to make meaningful improvements in the back half of this year. Sam Samad : Yeah, and for a margin target Jack, we didn't give one, so you didn't miss it. But we did say that operating margins are expected to be up year-over-year, which is what we had shared also on the Q1 call. Shawn Bevec : Operator, next question. Operator : The next question comes from Andrew Brackmann of William Blair. Andrew Brackmann : Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Sam, maybe one for you, just on the balance sheet and the upcoming debt maturities. Anything that you can sort of share in terms of your expectations for timing or interest costs associated with those refinancing? And I guess just related to that, any color that you can provide on the debt assumptions for the LifeLabs acquisition. Thanks. Sam Samad : Sure, Andrew, and good morning. So, let's start with the LifeLabs. What we are assuming, I mean, I shared in the prepared remarks that we expect the acquisition. First of all, we're not expecting LifeLabs to close this year, at least in our guidance assumptions. It could, but we're not assuming it's in guidance. But for 2025 it's a $0.10 to $0.15 EPS accretion, or at least in its first year, let's call it that. It's $0.10 to $0.15. We're assuming that it's funded by a combination of debt and cash. But within that assumption of $0.10 to $1.15 is that 75% of that purchase price is funded with debt. So the roughly $1 billion purchase price, 75% of it is debt funded, which is what drives the $0.10 to $0.15 accretion in the first year. In terms of just broadly on debt assumptions and liquidity, etcetera, I think here you talked about balance sheet assumptions. Listen, a lot of that is going to depend on market conditions and depend on the timing of the close of some of these acquisitions, not just LifeLabs, primarily LifeLabs, but also we have OhioHealth, Allina Health. We also closed PathAI in June. So as we've been talking about, we've had a busy M&A pipeline and it's starting to come to fruition. So we're going to evaluate market conditions. We've got the flexibility to access the capital markets. We've got very strong short term liquidity through the access to our facilities. But our goal continues to be to target a 2.5x to 3x leverage ratio, that's our goal. There could be some slight tip above that higher end of 3x, but then we expect to de-lever back to somewhere within that 2.5x to 3x in short time, given the growth and the accretion from these acquisitions. So again, no specific debt number right now, but we'll keep you posted as we get more timing on the closes of these acquisitions. Shawn Bevec : Operator, next question. Operator : The next question comes from Pito Chickering of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open, sir. Pito Chickering : Good morning, guys. Thanks for fitting me in. A multi-part question here. How are volumes looking at from your preferred network customers versus everyone else? Looking at both the physician market and the hospital market, are you losing, gaining, or maintaining share? Any quantification of any of those would be helpful? Jim Davis : Okay. So, on volume from our payers with preferred arrangements. The volume with several and of them Patrick, is higher. Now, some of that can be also driven by Medicare Advantage, the various size of the Medicare Advantage books of business. But in general, when we operate within these preferred networks where we have incentives in place to move, share from out-of-network labs, high-priced health systems, we definitely see benefits. In terms of market share statistics around our physician book of business and our health system book of business, it's hard to tell, right. There's just not great industry reports that talk about that. But I can tell you, when we said that that book of business was up 5.1% from a revenue standpoint, our physician growing faster than that, health system growing slightly lower than that, but still they are growing in ranges that are significantly above what we saw from a pre-COVID standpoint. So that leads us to believe, and also just based on the number of new wins with large physician groups, the number of new wins in our reference book of business, it leads us to believe that, yes, we are picking up share in this industry. Much of that share, we believe, is coming from health systems that potentially aren't as aggressive on some of that outreach book of business, from specialty labs and also from small, very small little regional labs. Shawn Bevec : Operator, next question. Operator : We have time for one last question, and that is from Stephanie Davis of Barclays. Your line is open. Stephanie Davis : Hi guys. Congrats on the quarter, and thank you for fitting me in. I was just curious if there's anything that's changed either the environment or maybe in strategy that had this pick up in M&A so much this year. And how sustainable is this or how much of this is to kind of strike them while the iron is hot? Thank you. Jim Davis : Yeah, no change in the strategy at all Stephanie. And as we've been saying for many quarters in a row, the M&A funnel is full. Now, we don't go into a year planning on getting four deals announced in one quarter. It just, in fact, you would prefer to space these out a little bit, but there's always somebody on the other end that you are negotiating with, and these things sometimes take time. So, look, we're really excited about all of these. Allina Health in Minneapolis, it represents a market where the independent labs basically have really, really low share in that market space, so really excited about the Minneapolis marketplace. We're also very excited about Columbus, Ohio, dominated by two health systems, very difficult for independent labs to operate there, and so this gives us a substantial foothold within that Columbus marketplace. Obviously excited about the Canadian marketplace as we talked, and again, PathAI represents both, a nice opportunity in the Memphis marketplace itself, where we believe we can grow our book of business there. As well, it doesn't really matter where that lab is located, because a lot of the work is done digitally, so it accepts specimens from all over the country. I would tell you that there's still opportunities within the funnel. The emphasis continues to be on these outreach tuck-in deals. It continues to be in, to focus in markets where our share position or access to independent labs is waning, and that's where our focus will be in the second half of this year. Sam Samad : One other thing I'd add, Stephanie, is all of these acquisitions that we announced meet our criteria. They basically hit the mark on all of the criteria that we have. Accretive in the first year, they meet our return on invested capital threshold. They meet our MPV criteria. So again, the activity would depend also that these acquisitions are going to hit our profitability criteria and our heroic hurdle rate, and they do. Jim Davis : Okay, so that concludes our call today. We really appreciate everybody joining. Thanks for your support, and have a great week ahead.

Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Shawn Bevec, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Sir, please go ahead. Shawn Bevec : Thank you and good morning. I\u2019m joined by Jim Davis, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, and Sam Samad, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and will discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics\u2019 future results include but are not limited to those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS, and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS. Growth rates associated with our long term outlook projections, including consolidated revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth, and adjusted earnings growth are compound annual growth rates. Now here is Jim Davis. Jim Davis : Thanks Shawn, and good morning everyone. Before we get into the details from the third quarter, I want to recognize the Quest employees who are working hard to serve our patients and customers impacted by Hurricanes Helene and Milton while also contending with the effects on their personal lives. I\u2019m inspired by their commitment to our values, especially customer focus, collaboration and care during this very difficult time. They bring to life our purpose, working together to create a healthier world one life at a time. Now turning to our results. We delivered a strong third quarter with total revenue growth of 8.5%, including 4.2% organic growth, driven by new customer wins and expanded business with physicians and hospitals, as well as acquisitions. During the third quarter, we completed three acquisitions. We finalized our acquisition of LifeLabs, a trusted lab leader serving millions of Canadians. LifeLabs provides a strong foundation for us to expand in Canada, and we are excited about the growth opportunities serving a population that is growing and with more favorable demographics than in the U.S. We also completed our transaction with Allina Health, a leading non-profit health system serving Minnesota and western Wisconsin; and at the end of the quarter, we acquired the laboratory business of three physician groups in New York. During the quarter, we also announced the plans to acquire select outreach lab assets from Ohio Health and University Hospitals, two leading non-profit health systems in Ohio. We completed the transaction with Ohio Health just last week and expect to complete the acquisition with University Hospitals later this quarter. Our recent outreach acquisitions highlight our ability to attract top health systems seeking to evolve their lab strategies to improve access and affordability. They also position us to expand in geographic areas of the U.S. where the influence of health systems had previously limited our reach. We are now on track to complete eight acquisitions this year that meet our criteria for growth, profitability and returns. Now I\u2019ll recap our strategy and discuss highlights from the third quarter, and then Sam will provide detail on our financial results and talk about our updated financial guidance for 2024. Our strategy to drive growth is focused on delivering solutions that meet the evolving needs of our core customers : physicians, hospitals and consumers. We enable growth across our customer channels through advanced diagnostics with an intense focus on faster growing clinical areas, including brain health and molecular genomics and oncology. In addition, acquisitions are a key growth driver with an emphasis on accretive outreach purchases, as well as other independent labs. Our strategy also includes driving operational improvements across the business with the strategic deployment of automation and AI to improve quality, service, efficiency, and the workforce experience. Here are some updates on the progress we have made in each of these areas. In physician lab services, we delivered another quarter of high single-digit revenue growth. Our performance was driven by new customer wins and expanded business, largely due to increased utilization of our advanced diagnostics. Our acquisitions also contributed to growth within this core customer channel, and as a reminder, volumes from both hospital outreach and independent lab acquisitions originate in physician offices. We also continued to see strong volume and revenue growth within Medicare Advantage plans, where narrow network strategies direct testing to high quality, cost efficient options like Quest. During the quarter, we also made progress to expand into new geographies through our health plan partnerships. We renewed a large national health plan agreement with Elevance Health that will extend our reach in Virginia, Georgia, Colorado and Nevada, markets in which we had previously limited access. We also broadened our access in Virginia and Florida with our recently announced arrangements with Sentara Health Plans. In hospital lab services, we grew revenues mid single digits, which is above historical levels. Hospitals continues to struggle to fill specialized lab positions, including histology, cytotechnology, and microbiology. In addition, the range and scope of testing being ordered is increasing as hospitals take advantage of our expanding advanced diagnostics portfolio rather than building their own in-house capability. These dynamics contributed to strong continued demand for reference testing. Our expertise managing laboratories can help hospitals improve quality and efficiency in their core lab operations. During the quarter, we formed a professional lab services collaboration with a leading health system in New Jersey that includes reference testing as well as laboratory and supply chain management. Quest specializes in scaling diagnostic innovations to improve access, quality and affordability. This ability enables us to help hospitals address the many challenges that they face, from workforce shortages to capital constraints to the demand for more affordable care from patients, health plans and employers. That\u2019s why premier health systems continue to seek us out for a range of collaborations, ranging from reference testing to professional lab management to outreach acquisitions. In consumer initiated testing, our consumer-facing platform, QuestHealth.com grew total revenues more than 40%. Our repeat customer rate has grown to 30% from less than 10% two years ago, driven by demand for comprehensive health, chronic disease, and STI testing. During the quarter, we also introduced micronutrient blood tests to help identify vitamin and mineral deficiencies. In addition, we continued to expand our partner network with resellers and ecommerce providers. In advanced diagnostics, we drove double-digit revenue growth across several clinical areas. The growth was particularly strong in areas of brain health, especially for our AD-Detect blood-based Alzheimer\u2019s disease testing as well as in women\u2019s health, cardio-metabolic health, and autoimmune disorders. Our investments in advanced diagnostics enable us to deliver and scale innovative services that improve patient care and drive growth. In molecular genomics and oncology, we are pleased with the results to date from our Haystack MRD early experience program through which providers from many leading academic and community oncology centers have used our Haystack MRD blood test to assess cancer recurrence and treatment response for solid tumor cancers. We are on track to make Haystack MRD available nationally to providers in the fourth quarter. Our growth in women\u2019s health was largely driven by prenatal and hereditary genetic testing, consistent with recent quarters. We also saw continued robust testing demand in genital tract infections, which includes several STIs. This month, we introduced a specimen self-collection option at our 2000 patient service centers that give women a fast, convenient and discrete way to access GTI testing. In the area of autoimmune disorders, we saw strong demand for our testing solutions which help primary care physicians comprehensively screen for autoimmune disorders in order speed diagnosis and care by specialists. Finally, we were pleased to have been selected by the CDC to be one of a handful of diagnostic service providers to support the development of laboratory tests for H5N1 avian flu and oropouche viruses. We plan to introduce an H5N1 avian flu test later this month. Now turning to operational excellence, our Invigorate program aims to deliver 3% annual cost savings and productivity improvements driven largely through the use of automation and AI to improve productivity, as well as service levels and quality. During the quarter, we completed the build-out of full end-to-end automation for our core routine tests at our Lenexa, Kansas laboratory, making it the third fully automated lab in our national network. We are now piloting automated specimen accessioning in our Clifton lab, which will help increase productivity in specimen processing and improve quality. Finally, we are pleased to extend our collaboration with Hologic to include their automated cytology solution, the Hologic Genius digital diagnostic system which utilizes AI to help analyze cervical cell samples. We expect this solution will help us improve quality and efficiency in cervical cancer screening. Now before I turn it over to Sam, I want to take a moment to recognize the decision by Congress to delay Medicare reimbursement cuts and data collection scheduled under PAMA for 2024. While we are pleased with the delay, we continue to collaborate with our trade association, ACLA, to encourage Congress to secure a permanent legislative solution that provides fair reimbursement. Now Sam will give more details on our third quarter performance and our updated guidance for 2024. Sam? Sam Samad : Thanks Jim. In the third quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.49 billion, up 8.5% versus the prior year. Consolidated organic revenues grew by 4.2%. Revenues for diagnostic information services were up 9% compared to the prior year, reflecting strong growth in our key physician and hospital channels as well as the contribution from recently closed acquisitions. As a reminder, our acquisition of LifeLabs closed towards the end of August, and our outreach acquisition from Allina Health closed in September. Total volume measured by the number of requisitions increased 5.5% versus the third quarter of 2023, with acquisitions contributing 5% to total volume. The impact of weather and the Crowdstrike global IT outage in July negatively impacted volume by approximately 40 basis points in the quarter. Total revenue per requisition was up 3.3% versus the prior year, driven primarily by an increase in the number of tests per req and favorable test mix driven by advanced diagnostics demand, partially offset by the impact of the recent LifeLabs acquisition which carries a lower revenue per requisition than our typical average. Unit price reimbursement was stable, consistent with our expectations. Reported operating income in the third quarter was $330 million or 13.3% of revenues compared to $342 million or 14.9% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $385 million or 15.5% of revenues compared to $380 million or 16.6% of revenues last year. The increase in adjusted operating income was due to strong organic revenue growth and the impact of recent acquisitions, partially offset by the impact of weather and the Crowdstrike outage, as well as wage increases and higher performance-based compensation. We estimate the impact of weather and the IT outage on operating margins to be approximately 50 basis points. LifeLabs had a negligible impact on operating margin rates in the quarter. Reported EPS was $1.99 in the quarter compared to $1.96 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $2.30 versus $2.22 the prior year. We estimate the EPS impact of weather and the IT outage to be approximately $0.08 in the quarter. Cash from operations was $870 million year-to-date through the third quarter versus $745 million in the prior year. In the third quarter, we issued $1.85 billion of senior notes with an average coupon of approximately 4.8%. Turning now to our updated full year 2024 guidance, revenues are expected to be between $9.8 billion and $9.85 billion. Reported EPS is expected to be in a range of $7.55 to $7.65 and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $8.85 to $8.95. Cash from operations is expected to be approximately $1.3 billion and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $420 million. The following are key assumptions underlying our updated guidance for you to consider. The increase in our updated revenue guidance is related to recently announced and closed acquisitions, with the majority being from LifeLabs. As a reminder, new acquisitions are typically breakeven to slightly profitable initially with profitability expanding over several quarters, therefore we are not expecting a material contribution to earnings from these acquisitions in 2024 but do expect increasing profitability next year. We are projecting the disruption from Hurricane Milton to negatively impact revenues by approximately $15 million and EPS by approximately $0.08 in the fourth quarter. Operating margin is expected to be down versus the prior year due to the integration of LifeLabs and the combined impact of weather and Crowdstrike headwinds. Excluding the impact of these items, full year operating margin is expected to be up. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $200 million, weighted average share count to be flat compared to the end of 2023. We have narrowed our adjusted EPS guidance and maintain the midpoint of $8.90 despite the impact of Hurricane Milton in the fourth quarter. While we aren\u2019t prepared to provide 2025 guidance today, I\u2019d like to share some initial considerations as you think about next year. We are reaffirming our long term outlook from 2023 through 2026, which assumes a mid single digit revenue CAGR with at least 1% to 2% growth from acquisitions, and a high single digit earnings CAGR with approximately 75 to 150 basis points of margin expansion over the three-year period. Given the eight acquisitions we expect to complete in 2024, we will exceed our 1% to 2% revenue growth targets from acquisitions next year. Excluding LifeLabs, we already expect to be towards the high end of this range due to the carryover contribution from the other acquisitions that will be completed this year. Interest expense is expected to increase next year as a result of our recent debt issuance. As I noted previously, we raised $1.85 billion of senior notes with an average coupon of approximately 4.8% in August, and in March of 2025 we plan to retire $600 million of senior notes with a coupon of 3.5%. Finally, as we consider all the moving pieces heading into 2025, we expect to deliver earnings growth consistent with our long term outlook in the high single digits. With that, I will now turn it back to Jim. Jim Davis : Thanks Sam. To summarize, our business delivered strong total and organic revenue growth driven by new customers wins and expanded business with physicians and hospitals, as well as acquisitions. We are now on track to complete eight acquisitions by year\u2019s end that meet our criteria for profitability, growth and returns. Our growing advanced diagnostics offering and increasing health plan access positions us to drive new customer business next year. Given the strength of our business and revenue from acquisitions, we are well positioned to drive accelerated revenue growth and earnings growth in 2025. With that, we\u2019d be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We will now open it up to questions. [Operator instructions] Our first question will come from Ann Hynes of Mizuho Securities. Your line is open. Ann Hynes : Good morning. Thank you. Thanks for all the details on 2025. When you think about next year, how do you think the organic growth profile of the business will do? And within that, can you remind us with Haystack, is there any change in your assumptions now that you\u2019ve had the asset for over a year on how you think it will do in 2025? Thanks. Jim Davis : Yes. So good morning, Ann. We just came off a very strong quarter of organic growth of 4.2%, driven by good volume growth and really nice improvements in rev per req, those improvements in rev per req coming with basically price being about flat, price per test, but really nice increases in tests per req and test mix. So as we enter into 2025, we would put out there at this point approximately 3%, I mean, it\u2019s hard to judge what\u2019s going to go on with utilization, but by all means and based on some of the payor report outs earlier in the week and last week, it appears that utilization remains strong. So I think an assumption of roughly 3% is solid. In terms of Haystack, we\u2019ve said the dilution this year is approximately $0.20. We said the dilution going into next year would be less, and we\u2019re still on track to achieve that. Sam Samad : Yes, with regards to Haystack, Ann, the incremental dilution this year is $0.20, so it\u2019s a total of $0.35 to $0.40 dilution, and it will improve next year. And we are preparing to launch the assay in the next few months here and expect to get reimbursement as we go forward as well. Operator : The next question is from Michael Cherny of Leerink Partners. Your line is open. Michael Cherny : Thanks so much for taking the questions. Maybe if I can go back to just some of your commentary about the marketplace and your positioning, if I heard correctly, I think you had some incremental share gains from Elevance, obviously, you have a combination of inorganic growth. As you think about building on Ann\u2019s question a bit relative to the organic side, how much do you feel like the growth profile is within your control relative to that share pick-up, relative to what you\u2019re doing on the pricing side versus market driven? If there\u2019s any we can break that down, that\u2019d be great. Jim Davis : Yes. So first, thanks for the question, Mike. With respect to Elevance, none of those changes take effect until the first of the year in 2025, and those changes, which are allowing us to be in network in the states of Colorado and in the states of Nevada, with expanded access in Georgia and Virginia. But again none of those changes have any impact on our third quarter results, but we expect those to help fuel organic growth going into next year. Sam Samad : Maybe if I add also, with regards to pricing and share gains, I think in terms of pricing, we still expect flattish to slightly improving reimbursement dynamics within our business - I think that\u2019s the expectation going forward, as it is this year, so we\u2019re seeing a positive improvement in reimbursement dynamics. And in addition to the increased access that Jim just talked about, we are also seeing share gains as a result of the hospital outreach acquisitions that we\u2019ve made, where we\u2019ve gained some -- we\u2019ve shifted share and we\u2019ve gained some good market share recently as a result of these acquisitions. Shawn Bevec : Operator, next question, please? Operator : The next question will come from Patrick Donnelly of Citi. Your line is open. Patrick Donnelly : Hey, guys, thank you for taking the questions. Sam, maybe one on LifeLabs, nice to see that close early. Can you just talk a little about both the margin impact that you see near term there, I know obviously accretive to earnings, but just the margin impact; and then the progression on the earnings accretion as we get into next year? I know there\u2019s some accounting stuff that maybe holds it back a little bit and then it should step up, but it would be helpful just to talk through that profile. And then lastly just Jim, on the M&A side, since we\u2019re on the topic. What the pipeline looks like? Should we expect continued smaller deals versus something like LifeLabs, being a much larger one, and what you\u2019re seeing there? Thank you, again. Sam Samad : Yes, you\u2019re welcome, and good morning, Patrick. So with regards to -- I\u2019ll talk maybe briefly about operating margins first, and then I\u2019ll talk about how LifeLabs impacted it in Q3 and what the trajectory is going forward, just at a high level. We won\u2019t go into too much details in terms of the actual specifics around the deal. But in Q3, operating margins were 15.5%. I would say adjusted for weather, that was closer to 16%. We had both weather and CrowdStrike impacted us by about 50 basis points. There was a slight negative impact from LifeLabs as well in the quarter. As you know, we had about five weeks\u2019 worth of LifeLabs revenues in there. The deal is scaling up in terms of profitability. There are some adjustments at the beginning as well in terms of some accounting adjustments, as you mentioned. But really, the margin profile of the deal is expected to increase as we go forward. Now, we talked about potential $0.10 to $0.15 EPS accretion from the deal in year one, and that was assuming that the deal would close basically at the end of the year, so we\u2019d have a full year in 2025. So, the deal closed a bit earlier, so we still -- we\u2019ll give more color on the Q4 call in terms of what the expectation is for 2025 specifically. But listen, at a high level, Patrick, I would just say that the operating margin to start will be below our overall operating margin as an enterprise. So it\u2019s going to be a bit dilutive in terms of operating margin rates but accretive in terms of operating margin dollars and EPS. And it\u2019s going to ramp up over the next two to three years to eventually be at the level of Quest operating margins, but that\u2019s going to take some time. So, I\u2019d say focus more on operating margin dollars and EPS accretion that we get from the deal, as opposed to the operating margin rates in the short term. Jim Davis : Yes. Patrick, in terms of your question on -- the last part of your question on the funnel and the M&A pipeline. So it does remain strong, and lots of discussions going on with various health systems around the country. But what I would say now is we\u2019re in this phase of integration and digestion of the deals that we\u2019ve just completed, including the lab assets of PathAI, Allina Health System, Ohio Health, University Hospitals, the three physician office labs here in New York, and then obviously LifeLabs. So we are hard at work at integrating these and getting the margin accretion that we\u2019ve talked about. Our appetite will continue for small outreach deals, and we\u2019re always on the look for those. Operator : The next question will come from Pito Chickering of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Pito Chickering : Hey, good morning guys. Can I go back to the questions on Elevance and Sentara Health, on those contracts you talked about earlier? I guess, why weren\u2019t you in those contracts previously? Did you have to give any pricing concessions in any states in order to go in those markets, or did you give pricing concessions to enter the states? Who was previously servicing those patients? It\u2019s just been a long time since we\u2019ve seen such large managed care contract wins for you guys, so just curious were other central labs servicing these guys or is it simply payors pushing large labs, who take share from hospital-based labs? Thanks so much. Jim Davis : Yes, so with respect to Elevance, we\u2019ve been in their network broadly on a national basis, except for the markets that I indicated - Colorado and Nevada, we were completely out of their network. Georgia, we had limited access to some products but not all, and the same with Virginia. This is just an opening up, like many of the other large national labs, that provide access to all the independent labs, so we feel great on that. Sentara, we were previously not serving - it was being served by other laboratories, and they made the decision to put us in their network. It\u2019s a great health plan, a great health system that was in Virginia, but the health plan actually goes down well below Virginia into the Carolinas and Florida, so we feel really, really good about that. Look, I think it represents just a commitment on behalf of these health plans to include independent labs that offer great quality. It starts with great quality, great service, and really competitive pricing. Shawn Bevec : Next question, Operator? Operator : The next question will come from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. Your line is open. Meghan Holtz : Good morning guys, and congrats on the quarter. This is Meghan Holtz on for Brian. Just going back to guidance, at [indiscernible] core EPS guidance is up slightly, right? If I just check my math, the midpoint stays at $8.90 but you have to add back the $0.08 from Milton, while LifeLabs should be a little less, so can you just kind of break down that EPS guidance? Sam Samad : Yes, sure. To talk about EPS guidance, let me talk a little bit about revenue as well, because--you know, we took up revenue, as you know, by $285 million at the midpoint. The majority of that was really M&A, and the majority of the M&A was really LifeLabs, so in terms of the $285 million at the midpoint, I would say the majority really is driven by M&A, which as we said scales up with profitability, so little to no profitability in the initial term. To your point around EPS, we tightened the range by a nickel on each side. The midpoint remains unchanged at $8.90. We are absorbing an $0.08 headwind from Milton in Q4, so yes, you are correct in the sense that EPS excluding the impact of Milton would have gone up, and that\u2019s driven by the strength of the organic business. We\u2019re seeing some, as you saw in Q3, great rev per req at 3.3%, organic rev per req was even higher than that. We\u2019re seeing good utilization, so some of that strength is offsetting the impact of Milton, but largely kept the EPS unchanged at the midpoint. Meghan Holtz : Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from David Westenberg of Piper Sandler. David Westenberg : Hi, thanks for taking the question, and congrats on a good quarter. I believe [audio loss] reduced pretty meaningfully. I think you\u2019re still seeing wage inflation here above historical norms, so can you just talk about some of the pushes and pulls in terms of historically low unemployment rate? Are there actually maybe some tailwinds you\u2019re seeing with insurance and other things, maybe even price increases that could help offset that, and can you talk about maybe some of the headwinds in terms of wage pressures, how long they\u2019re expected to continue, and if we did continue to see some of those wage pressures, are there any other ways you can get operating leverage, say AI, automation, etc.? Thank you. Sam Samad : Dave, just real quick, you broke up there in the very beginning. What did you start with? David Westenberg : I started there with turnover rates being reduced; however, I still believe wage inflation is above historical norms, so can you just talk about the pushes and pulls with that, and then I think you got the rest of the question all right. Sam Samad : Yes, we got it, thanks. Jim Davis : Yes, so as we indicated in the script, our turnover rates have come down here in 2024, so last year they were in the low 20s, and we\u2019re now below 20%, in the 18% to 19% range. Some of this still depends on job category, but overall we\u2019ve seen really nice improvement. Now, the wage inflation of 3% to 4%, I\u2019d say it\u2019s slightly less than last year, but in terms of historical norms, if you want to go back to 2012 to 2019, kind of pre-COVID, I would tell you it was in the 2% to 3% range, so it\u2019s 100 basis points higher than it historically was. As we walk into next year, it might be a bit early to tell, but I would still think it\u2019s going to hang closer to 3%, in that range. I think you\u2019re reading the same articles we are - the quit rate in American has certainly come down. I think unemployment is relatively stable, so I think there will be continued tightness in the labor markets, particularly on our frontline employees, and by those employees, we mean our phlebotomists, our logistics, our specimen processors. It\u2019s actually those positions where we see a more competitive labor environment primarily because those three types of roles, they can move from industry to industry. They don\u2019t need to stay in the lab industry. Now, there\u2019s lots of things we\u2019re doing to continue to offset that wage inflation. We\u2019ve talked a lot about the use of automation and AI in our laboratories. As we indicated in the script, we just went live with our third highly automated laboratory, full automation in our Lenexa, Kansas operation. We\u2019ve installed what we called some front end specimen automation sorting types of equipment in several of our laboratories, and we\u2019re getting nice use out of that; and then we continue to expand some of our automated and AI-driven platforms, like the COPAN--the COPAN microbiology platform, which continues to give us a ton of productivity across our laboratories. Sam Samad : Yes, and if I just add a couple of things, David, with regards to just overall productivity and leverage in the P&L as both we look in 2024 and going forward, but we are seeing a couple of positive dynamics there as well that I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware of. In terms of rev per req, pricing is a modest favorable. I don\u2019t mean to say that it still isn\u2019t a challenging pricing environment in the health system space, but overall we\u2019re getting flat to positive reimbursement. We\u2019re seeing tests per req continue to go up versus historically, we\u2019re seeing a nice step up in terms of tests per req as well as test mix, which are both giving us a positive in terms of overall rev per req. Utilization, we\u2019ve talked about continues to be positive, and also aided by the fact that we\u2019ve gained share with some of the acquisitions that we\u2019ve done, so overall all of these would drive us to additional productivity and improved leverage as we look forward, and this year in 2024. Shawn Bevec : Operator, next question, please? Operator : The next question comes from Jack Meehan of Nephron Research. Your line is open. Jack Meehan : Thank you, good morning. I wanted to follow up--for Sam, I have a couple of follow-ups, just trying to dig into the quarterly revenue a little bit. The first was could you just tell me what the COVID sales were? I\u2019m trying to gauge what the base was doing within the 4% organic growth. Then second is it looks like M&A added about $100 million of sales in the quarter. How much was the initial five weeks from LifeLabs versus everything else? Could it have been, like, 50/50? Sam Samad : Sure Jack, yes. With regards to COVID, as you have noted, we\u2019ve stopped really reporting COVID and we\u2019ve stopped reporting base versus total, because it\u2019s really become somewhat insignificant. All I would say is it was largely within our expectations in Q3. It\u2019s impacted from a year-to-year--on a year-to-year basis, it impacted growth by about 50 basis points. That was the impact of COVID in terms of total impact on revenue growth. Now with regards to M&A, I think your other question, so we grew by 8.5% in total revenues for the quarter, organic growth was about 4.2%, so we had about a 4% contribution from M&A. LifeLabs over five weeks or so was about $70 million roughly in terms of revenues in the quarter, so that should give you a sense as to the contribution of LifeLabs. Obviously it\u2019s a significant portion of the M&A growth. Shawn Bevec : Operator, next question, please? Operator : The next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson of Evercore. Your line is open. Elizabeth Anderson : Hi guys. Thanks so much for the question. [Audio loss] so long term question. One, can you just confirm the DCP impact in the quarter? I know that created some unnecessary volatility, just--you know, it was always neutral to EPS. Then longer term, I think what you guys were saying was it sounds like you\u2019re saying in general that unit pricing, we should think of sort of as stable to slightly positive for 2025 as well - I think that\u2019s what you are saying. Just if you could confirm that, that\u2019d be great. Thank you. Sam Samad : Yes, with regards to DCP, Elizabeth - first, thanks for the question. On a year-to-year basis, it was up, I would say close to $10 million in the quarter itself, so it was a negative impact on operating margin in the quarter. That should give you the detail that you want. It\u2019s going to ebb and flow depending on the markets, but this quarter it was a negative impact year-over-year. Then with regards to pricing, I think the current view and what we\u2019ve been seeing in 2024 is that--you know, if I kind of bifurcate that, health systems is definitely a net negative in terms of a challenging health systems environment, in terms of the reimbursement and pricing dynamics. Health plans, I would say modestly positive, flat to modestly positive. Overall when you put the pieces together, and we\u2019ve got the government business right now, we expect to be flat pricing as well since the PAMA cuts were deferred, so overall I\u2019d say the expectation is flat to slightly positive, is the current view. We\u2019ll give you more information when we give specific 2025 guidance on the Q4 call. Shawn Bevec : Operator, next question, please? Operator : Yes, the next question is from Erin Wright of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Erin Wright : Great, thanks. With the hospital outreach deals and the market share gains, you\u2019ve been talking about that a little bit more recently, and are there specific geographies where you\u2019re seeing that sort of halo effect around these deals? Has anything changed in terms of your strategy around what you target or how you\u2019re approaching these hospital outreach deals? I guess any way to quantify it as well how much in terms of market share gains is this contributing at the moment, just from either a volume or revenue perspective? Thanks. Jim Davis : Yes, so the three deals we announced, Allina in the Minneapolis market and closed Ohio Health in Columbus, Ohio, and University Hospitals which we expect to close later in the quarter in Cleveland, Ohio, all three of those markets had the characteristics of the majority of independent physicians were owned by health systems and therefore using the labs of those health systems. It puts us into those three marketplaces. Our share in those markets was de minimis before these acquisitions, and so now we have a strong presence in those three markets, all of which are big markets, growing markets. We will continue to look for other markets in the U.S. where we have strong payor access. By the way, in all of those markets, we were in network with obviously all the nationals and all the Blues plans that play in those markets, so we had strong access but our ability to sell, given that the physicians were largely owned by the health systems, was very limited. Those are the characteristics of the markets that we look for in terms of these outreach acquisitions. We look for markets where we have strong access, which we do nationally, and we look for markets where health systems have dominated in that space and they may be willing to get out of that market. Shawn Bevec : Operator, next question, please? Operator : The next question comes from Stephanie Davis of Barclays. Your line is open. Stephanie Davis : Hey guys, thank you so much for taking my question. You had in the prepared remarks comments about volume and revenue benefits from narrower networks at the MA plans, so I was curious, given some of the challenges those clients are facing, could you see potential for an accelerated pace of adoption of this strategy and some forward benefits in the coming few years? Jim Davis : I think all of the Medicare Advantage plans versus Medicare are going to have, by definition, more narrow networks. Medicare, as you know, is any willing provider, and if you look at the Medicare work spread across the country, that health systems generally do fairly well in that space. Again, by definition when a life moves from a Medicare plan to a Medicare Advantage plan, most of the Medicare Advantage plans have networks that are more defined and more narrow, so there is generally good things that come from that. Now going forward, the Medicare Advantage plans, yes, they seem to be under some--they\u2019re experiencing higher utilization - that\u2019s generally good for us, but they\u2019re experiencing profit pressures on that book of business as well, so to the extent more of that work comes to independent labs like Quest Diagnostics, it means good quality, great service, and generally lower costs, so we welcome the opportunity to work with all the Medicare Advantage plans to continue to move work from high priced out-of-network labs to labs like Quest Diagnostics. Shawn Bevec : Operator, next question, please? Operator : The next question comes from Lisa Gill of JP Morgan. Your line is open. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much, good morning. I just had a couple of follow-up questions on LifeLabs. Jim, I think in your prepared remarks, you made a comment that the demographics are more favorable in Canada. Can you maybe just help us understand what market growth looks like in Canada, and then secondly, you talked about the margins being below the corporate average at Quest today and that over two to three years, you\u2019ll get there? Can you give us an idea of what the margins look like today for LifeLabs? Jim Davis : Yes, so first on the demographics of Canada, the population growth of Canada is actually significantly higher than the U.S., so it\u2019s been north of 1% for the last several years, so that\u2019s good news for us and for all those that participate. Second is the aging of the Canadian population is also--the average age of the population there is north of what it is in the U.S., and the demographics of older people--you know, what we see in the U.S., obviously Medicare and Medicare Advantage, there is more reqs per life, they visit physicians more frequently, generally higher acuity levels, and so serving an older population is also beneficial to the industry, to us. That\u2019s why we like the demographics of Canada. There\u2019s some variation between that in Ontario, in British Columbia, the two major provinces that we serve, but in total we think it\u2019s a great place to operate. Now in terms of the margin, yes, the operating margin rate is lower than our company average, and we expect over the next couple years, through the synergies that we expect to get and through sharing of ideas, best practices from us to them and them to us, we expect to get the margin rate back to close to Quest company average. Shawn Bevec : Operator, next question, please? Operator : The next question comes from Andrew Brackmann of William Blair. Your line is open. Andrew Brackmann : Hi guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Jim, I wanted to go back to your comment on integration and digestion. Can you maybe just sort of talk about how your integration efforts or tactics have evolved over the last few years, the things that you can share which maybe give a little bit more comfort on keeping up this accelerated pace of deals going forward? Thank you. Jim Davis : Yes, so it very much depends on the deal. I mean, let\u2019s start with LifeLabs - LifeLabs, it operates in Canada, obviously we\u2019re here in the U.S., so there is not what I would call big synergies across--we\u2019re not shutting down any laboratories, we\u2019re not changing the phlebotomy network or the logistics network at all. What we do look for in opportunities like that is--you know, we look for procurement synergies, right - what are we buying things at, what are they buying things at, and then we\u2019re going to take the best of the best price, and in general that is on the Quest Diagnostics side. Second is we benchmark their operations versus our operations - you know, in phlebotomy, the draws per FTE, logistics, how many stops per person. In the laboratory, we benchmark not just the overall laboratory but the departments within the laboratory - microbiology, auto chemistry. Really what it is, it\u2019s a series of best practices shared from each side, and in some cases we obviously learn things from them that we bring back into our operations. That\u2019s the nature of LifeLabs. Now, with the health system deals, in general what we\u2019re acquiring is a book of business. We\u2019re not acquiring laboratories, we\u2019re not acquiring logistics. In many cases, we take on the phlebotomists that were serving that network. Really, the integration is about, number one, IT integration, integrating with all of their physicians, whether they\u2019re on Epic or Cerner of whatever EMR they\u2019re on; and then second, it\u2019s about the movement of that work from the hospital lab into Quest Diagnostics, so we look for opportunities in logistics and, again, phlebotomy to get synergies and productivity out of that. Generally, what we bring to these integrations are dedicated full time groups of people. They hit within the regional structure of Quest, so depending on the region, we come in with a dedicated team that works the IT side, the phlebotomy side, the logistics side and the laboratory side, and as Sam said in his remarks, it will take several quarters to get these books of business up to the profitability rate that we expect. It\u2019s a lot of hard work and the team has some deep experience in doing this. Shawn Bevec : Operator, next question, please? Operator : The next question is from Kevin Caliendo of UBS. Your line is open. Kevin Caliendo : Thanks. Thanks for getting my question in - I appreciate it. I just want to go through some of these moving pieces. I appreciated the color that you gave on 2025, but if we just kind of think--tell me I\u2019m not thinking about this incorrectly, revenue growth should probably be better, given all the M&A that\u2019s maturing into next year. You talked about the organic growth is still estimated to be up 3% roughly. The cost trends, wages and the like, 3% to 4%--3%, hopefully Invigorate is there to offset that, plus you add in the benefit of the maturation of LifeLabs, which $0.10 to $0.15, is probably going to be more than that as you\u2019re getting an extra quarter than you anticipated, and you have Haystack dilution coming down. Isn\u2019t it-- I mean, unless I\u2019m not thinking about the impact, or there is a negative impact to core margins, shouldn\u2019t EPS grow faster next year than your traditional CAGR, just thinking about all those moving pieces? Sam Samad : Yes, so I think you\u2019ve got the moving pieces right, Kevin. As you said, we\u2019ve got--and as we talked about in the prepared remarks, we\u2019ve got M&A excluding LifeLabs growing at the high end of the range that we\u2019ve given, about 2%. We\u2019ve got LifeLabs adding a full year worth of revenues in there, so that will help revenues as well, so yes, revenue growth will be faster. We\u2019ve got also the carryover from some of the M&A that we\u2019ve done this year. I mean, in terms of the cost headwinds right now, it\u2019s, I\u2019d say early to say that we\u2019re going to face lesser headwinds in general, like in terms of inflation for instance. We\u2019re still assuming in general that 3% to 4%. I wouldn\u2019t say that we\u2019re assuming that that\u2019s going to moderate significantly next year, so what we\u2019re seeing today is in that 3% to 4% range, and I think we\u2019re expecting that to be the same. I think the pricing dynamics, we\u2019ll give more detail on that on the Q4 call, but in general fairly in line with what we\u2019re seeing right now, which is flat to slightly positive, although as I said before, we are seeing competitive dynamics in the health system space. For now, we\u2019re seeing EPS is growing in the high single digits, so to the extent that we provide more information on the Q4 call that\u2019s different than that, we will; but at this point with the visibility that we have with all the moving pieces, we feel comfortable just reaffirming that growth rate for EPS. There isn\u2019t anything here that\u2019s a negative that we\u2019re--you know, that you\u2019re teasing out, that\u2019s something that we\u2019re not disclosing. It\u2019s basically we feel comfortable that with all the moving parts, that we\u2019re at the high end of the guidance range that we gave before. Shawn Bevec : Operator, next question, please? Operator : Our last question will come from Michael Riskin of Bank of America. Your line is open, sir. Michael Riskin : Great. Thanks for squeezing me in, guys. I\u2019ll close with one, a lot of this has been covered. I wanted to ask a little bit on PAMA - obviously it\u2019s been delayed. You made some comments about potentially working on a permanent legislative solution. Could you expand on that a little bit, like what that could look like, and obviously PAMA has been delayed for a number of years now, so we\u2019re kind of used to this, but any sense of what the future could look like there, just so we\u2019re not in a constant delay cycle again? Thanks. Jim Davis : Yes, so you\u2019re right - PAMA has now been delayed five straight years, and it is certainly a welcome relief to us and to our entire industry. Now having said that, look - SALSA has continued to be on the legislative agenda. It\u2019s a complex task to get these things approved - there is one Senate committee, two House committees that you have to work through, and as you know with the election coming up, a lot of these committees could potentially change - the leadership can change, members can change, and so our trade association and the members of it will be hard at work once the election is over and once the committee memberships are defined, we\u2019ll be hard at work to figure out who on these committees are going to support us and to put forth a fix to this constant year-over-year, I would say battle that we have to defer these cuts. We were happy with the SALSA solution, which called for--if enacted, called for another year of a delay followed by a new data collection process. There were agreed to reductions, but I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s the solution we\u2019re going to put forth on the table. You know, we\u2019ve had five straight years of delayed cuts, and while that sounds good, in fact it\u2019s not good because we\u2019ve had five really heavy years of wage inflation and other inflation, and we\u2019re going to press the case that in fact the Medicare rates should go up. We\u2019ve gotten rates up through our commercial plans. Yes, as Sam said, there\u2019s been pressure on our hospital reference pricing, but we believe, given the inflationary environment that we\u2019ve lived in from 2019 to 2024, that the rates need to go up, and so that\u2019s the fix that we\u2019re going to propose. We believe a new data collection process will indicate that when they benchmark our pricing across all the commercial plans, including what the commercial plans are paying hospital labs. I think we\u2019ll find that the combination of those prices would lead one to believe that Medicare pricing should go up, so that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to push for going forward. Jim Davis : Okay, so thank you very much for joining the call today. We appreciate your support. Have a good day, everyone. Operator : Thank you for participating in the Quest Diagnostics third quarter 2024 conference call.

Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of Quest Diagnostics, is strictly prohibited. I\u2019d now like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Sir, please go ahead. Shawn Bevec : Thank you and good morning. I\u2019m joined by Jim Davis, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, and Sam Samad, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and will discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics\u2019 future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS, and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS. Growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections, including consolidated revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth, and adjusted earnings growth, are compound annual growth rates. Now, here is Jim Davis. Jim Davis : Thanks, Shawn, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, we delivered impressive revenue growth of nearly 15%, including approximately 5% organic growth, while also improving our profitability. For the full year, we drove revenue growth of close to 7%, including approximately 3% organic growth. In 2024, our team completed eight acquisitions, including LifeLabs in Canada and four hospital outreach lab businesses in the US. We also expanded our Advanced Diagnostics menu and drove sustained double-digit growth in several clinical areas during the year. In addition, we attracted new business across the physician, hospital, and consumer channels, while also forming new relationships with health plans to extend our geographic reach. Our investments in automation in AI delivered improvements in quality, customer experience, and productivity during the quarter and throughout all of 2024, which helped us deliver on our annual 3% Invigorate savings and productivity targets. We also meaningfully improved employee retention as we strengthened our position as employer of choice. This morning, we provided guidance for 2025 that reflects our confidence in the core strength of our business, continuing robust utilization, and the momentum from acquisitions we completed in 2024. These dynamics position us favorably to accelerate revenue and earnings growth in 2025. Now, I'll recap our strategy and discuss highlights from the fourth quarter. Then Sam will provide more detail on our financial results and talk about our financial guidance for 2025. Our strategy to drive growth is focused on delivering solutions that meet the evolving needs of our core customers, physicians, hospitals, and consumers. We enable growth across our customer channels through Advanced Diagnostics, with an intense focus on faster-growing clinical areas, including brain health, advanced cardiometabolic, and molecular genomics and oncology. In addition, acquisitions are a key growth driver, with an emphasis on accretive outreach purchases, as well as other independent labs. Our strategy also includes driving operational improvements across the business, with the strategic deployment of automation and AI to improve quality, service, efficiency, and the workforce experience. Here are a few key updates on the progress we have made in these areas in the fourth quarter of 2024. Please note that my following comments are focused primarily on our US operations. In physician lab services, we delivered high single-digit revenue growth, driven primarily by strong organic growth and contributions from acquisitions in the US. As a reminder, volumes from both hospital outreach and independent lab acquisitions originate in the physician offices. Last month, we closed our acquisition of the outreach lab business of University Hospitals in Ohio, and completed the transition of the business in January. We expect to moderate our pace of acquisitions in 2025 as we focus on driving growth from productivity from transactions completed last year. In addition to acquisitions, other growth drivers in the quarter included new customer wins, as well as growth among large physician groups and community health centers. We also saw a step-up in functional medicine testing as more people take an interest in prevention and wellness. In the fourth quarter and full year, we benefited from robust utilization compared to historical rates. We also continue to see strong volume and revenue growth from Medicare Advantage plans, which value our high-quality, low-cost testing for their narrow networks. We are well positioned to benefit from these dynamics as we expand access through our health plan partnerships with Elevance Health and Sentara Health Plans, both of which took effect on January 1st. Today, we have access to more than 90% of the in-network lives in the US. In hospital lab services, we grew revenues nearly 3% in the fourth quarter, primarily due to solid continued demand for reference testing, complemented by growth in professional lab services. Hospitals continue to order a greater range of reference tests from our expanding Advanced Diagnostics menu rather than performing these tests in their own labs. By referring testing to us, hospitals are freed from the pressures that come from performing specialized tests in-house, such as hiring skilled lab personnel and investing in expensive lab testing equipment. In professional lab services, we completed three collaborations with health systems in Connecticut, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. We expect to see modest contribution from these relationships in early 2025. Looking at 2025, we expect hospitals to continue to struggle with high wage and supply inflation, constrained access to capital, and keeping up to date with laboratory innovation. At the same time, patients and payers want greater value from lab services. Hospitals increasingly recognize that Quest can improve access to innovative and cost-efficient lab services through reference testing, lab management, and outreach lab acquisitions. In consumer-initiated testing, our consumer-facing platform, questhealth.com grew total revenues nearly 50% in the fourth quarter, and approximately 40% for the full year to just over $60 million. Together with revenue from our channel partners, consumer-initiated testing revenues grew to nearly $100 million in 2024. During the year, we also greatly expanded our Questhealth.com offering to include 135 different tests to provide a comprehensive platform for serving today's increasingly health-minded consumers. In Advanced Diagnostics, we experienced double-digit growth across several clinical areas in the fourth quarter, including in brain health, advanced cardiometabolic, autoimmune, and women's health. We generated strong growth in brain health, largely due to impressive demand for AD-detect blood tests for assessing Alzheimer's disease risk. We will continue to explore opportunities to extend our portfolio with new biomarkers that can help providers better assess Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia. We also generated strong growth in areas of advanced cardiometabolic and autoimmune testing, and we expect these patterns to continue in 2025. Our growth in women's health was driven largely by prenatal and hereditary genetic testing. We were also pleased to see strong adoption of our self-collection option for testing of genital tract infections during the quarter. In molecular genomics and oncology, we spent much of last year developing and validating our Haystack MRD blood test to aid in the early detection of minimal residual disease from solid tumor cancers. We also engaged with approximately 75 leading academic health systems and community oncology centers in our Haystack MRD Early Experience program, and are pleased with the favorable feedback we received. We are now transitioning these organizations to a commercial program and are focused on expanding utilization among medical oncologists. Turning to operational excellence, our Invigorate program delivered our targeted 3% annual cost savings and productivity improvements. Here are some examples of how we're improving operations. We pilot many of our automation and AI solutions at our laboratory in Clifton, New Jersey. During the fourth quarter, we developed and implemented a proprietary system in Clifton that automates labeling and test tube preparation for tuberculosis testing, eliminating manual intervention and improving quality. In addition, we began testing an automated accessioning solution that speeds requisition processing. Also, in Clifton, we deployed a third-party AI solution that enhances parasitology screening by flagging likely positive specimens requiring closer human examination. We plan to roll out these solutions to our other labs later in 2025. Improving workforce engagement remains a major priority, and I'm pleased that our retention rates significantly improved across multiple job categories in 2024. Now, before I turn it over to Sam, I want to thank our more than 55,000 Quest and LifeLabs colleagues for delivering on our business imperatives last year. This amazing group of people is the engine behind our growth and the reason we entered 2025 strong, energized, and ready to deliver on our purpose, working together to create a healthier world, one life at a time. And now, Sam will provide more details on our performance and 2025 guidance. Sam? Sam Samad : Thanks, Jim. In the fourth quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.62 billion, up 14.5% versus the prior year. Consolidated organic revenues grew by 4.8%. Revenues for diagnostic information services were up 15.1% compared to the prior year, reflecting the contributions from recent acquisitions, including LifeLabs, as well as growth in our key physician and hospital channels. Total volume measured by the number of requisitions increased 13.9% versus the fourth quarter of 2023, with organic volume growing by 0.6%. During the quarter, weather negatively impacted volume by approximately 50 basis points. Total revenue per requisition was up 0.2% versus the prior year, driven primarily by an increase in the number of tests per rec and favorable test mix, mostly offset by the impact of the LifeLabs acquisition, which carries a lower revenue per requisition. On an organic basis, revenue per rec was up 3.3% in the quarter versus last year. Unit price reimbursement was relatively flat, consistent with our expectations. Reported operating income in the fourth quarter was $361 million or 13.8% of revenues compared to $267 million or 11.7% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $409 million or 15.6% of revenues compared to $338 million or 14.8% of revenues last year. The increase in adjusted operating income was due to strong organic revenue growth and the impact of recent acquisitions, partially offset by the impact of weather, wage increases, and higher performance-based compensation. We estimate the impact of weather on operating margin to be approximately 30 basis points. Reported EPS was $1.95 in the quarter compared to $1.70 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $2 23 versus $2.15 the prior year. Adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter was impacted by higher interest expense and the higher tax rate versus the prior year. We estimate the EPS impact of weather to be approximately $0.06 in the quarter. Cash from operations was $1.33 billion in the full year 2024 versus $1.27 billion in the prior year. Turning now to our full-year 2025 guidance. Revenues are expected to be between $10.7 billion and $10.85 billion. Reported EPS expected to be in a range of $8.34 to $8.59, and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $9.55 to $9.80. Cash from operations is expected to be approximately $1.45 billion, and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $500 million. We have posted a presentation on the investor relations page of our website that includes an adjusted EPS bridge, which shows some of the key elements to bridge from our 2024 adjusted EPS to the 2025 adjusted EPS guidance we shared today. Our 2025 guidance reflects the following considerations. Our revenue guidance assumes approximately 3% organic revenue growth, with the remainder coming from the acquisitions closed in 2024. It does not assume any contribution from prospective M&A that could be completed in 2025. As you know, we absorbed the headwind last year related to the CrowdStrike IT outage, which we do not assume repeats in 2025. We expect to begin generating revenue from the launch of our Haystack MRD test in 2025, and continue to anticipate that Haystack oncology will be slightly less dilutive versus the prior year. We are making investments in 2025 to modernize our IT infrastructure, as well as to comply with FDA regulations of laboratory-developed tests that are scheduled to begin later this year. Operating margin is expected to expand versus the prior year. We anticipate net interest expense to be approximately $275 million. Adjusted tax rate is expected to be approximately 25%, and our average share count for the full year is expected to be approximately 114 million diluted shares outstanding. With that, I will now turn it back to Jim. Jim Davis : Thanks, Sam. To summarize, we delivered strong consolidated and organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter and the full year. We expanded our presence in important new geographies, including Canada through eight acquisitions and new health plan relationships. Our innovations and Advanced Diagnostics drove meaningful growth, and Haystack MRD strengthens our position in molecular genomics and oncology. Given these business strengths and robust utilization, we expect to accelerate revenue and earnings growth this year. And now we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator instructions] Our first question will come from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Your line is open, sir. Kevin Caliendo : Oh, thank you, and thanks for getting me in so early. Appreciate it. Just a question on guidance and some of the assumptions that are in there. I appreciate the earnings bridge. I guess what I'm trying to understand a little bit is there's $20 million of additional investment spend for LDT and IT. Are there any other one-timers in there? And specifically, do you expect core margins, not sort of comping out some of the other things that have happened, but you said margins expect to expand, does the guidance assume that just - that core margins will expand ex all of the sort of one-timers that we had from last year, or the accretion from deals and things happening? I want to understand that in weather, if there's any weather built in from 1Q, whether it's the fires or the frozen tundra that we had to deal with. Very long one question, but thanks. Sam Samad : Yes, thanks, Kevin. This is Sam, and good morning. Let me just give some comments on guidance to address your question. First of all, the one-timers that you're asking about, they're all laid out in the bridge that we've included. There are no additional one-timers that you should be adding in or taking out. The key things I think from a positive standpoint that we talked about in addition to the organic revenue growth and the M&A contribution, is a benefit related to CrowdStrike, which obviously we don't expect to repeat in 2025. We've got some benefits in terms of the Haystack reduced dilution, so some benefit year-over-year. But then from an offset in terms of headwinds, we talked about the investments and we can share some more comments on that, and it really relates to the FDA LDT compliance investments to get us in compliance with that and to build up our regulatory capabilities, in addition to some investments in terms of modernizing our systems and our IT systems and the lab information systems. And we can talk some more about that. Interest expense, we've talked about the fact that we had to fund the acquisitions that we took on, especially LifeLabs. That represents a $0.50 headwind. And then there are some other headwinds that are laid out there. In terms of weather, we have not built any specific explicit assumption related to worse weather as a result of what we're seeing. But obviously, we\u2019re monitoring Q1 and January closely because there have been some higher-than-expected weather disruptions, specifically the wildfires in California, specifically the freeze in the south and some of the snow that we've seen, also some lower temperatures in the Northeast and snow as well. So, there are some of these. In terms of operating margin, we are expecting operating margin expansion in terms of what we report, you don't have to normalize or make adjustments to get to expanded operating margins. We are expecting that our operating margin percentage, which finished at 15.6% in 2024, will expand in 2026, or in 2025, I should say. Jim Davis : Yes. Hey, Kevin, let me just provide a little more color on the investment. So, as Sam said, there's two parts to it. One is in preparation for the FDA requirements. Now, the first set of requirements go into effect on May the 6th this year. And notably, we have to stand up a complaint handling unit and enable ourselves to report any, what we call medical device reporting to the FDA. So, that does require some investment. It requires some additional resources to do that. So, in part that is what some of those investments are used for. The second and more substantial piece is, look, as you all know, this is a digital enterprise that we operate today, from order intake to our logistics systems, to how we operate the labs, to how we provide results through our MyQuest application, and our entire billing system. We think about that as our entire order to cash spectrum of systems. And while we have been making investments from time to time, we need to make some more substantial investments this year and next year. And the benefits from those investments are certainly going to help us improve operations and improve the entire customer experience. So, we're modernizing this IT infrastructure. We're going to migrate some of our current systems into cloud-based systems. And over time, that's going to dramatically reduce the complexity. It's going to create more efficiencies between our labs, and it's really, really going to improve the overall customer experience. Ultimately, it's going to lower our IT costs, and there's going to be a good ROI on these investments. We're going to lay this out more at our Investor Day on March 19th, but that's really what that $0.20 is being used for. Operator : The next question will come from Patrick Donnelley of Citi. Your line is open. Patrick Donnelley : Hey guys, thank you for taking the questions. Sam, maybe one for you to start. Just helpful to hear you talk about the margin expansion this year overall. Can you just talk about the cadence, anything to call out as the year progresses? I know LifeLabs is starting lower margin. It's heading to corporate average at some point. So, maybe just talk through that. Would be helpful. And then, Jim, just quickly on utilization, obviously been elevated here. What have you seen as you exited 4Q into this year? And just the assumptions on utilization as we work our way through 2025. Thank you, guys. Sam Samad : Yes, thanks Patrick. So, on margin, so yes, again, let me reiterate, we are expecting margin expansion this year versus 2024. I think the components that you see in the bridge that we laid out in the guidance, organic revenue growth, approximately 3% at the midpoint. That's basically assumed at a contribution margin that comes in at roughly about 40%. Then you have the acquired revenue growth, which is roughly, let's call it $0.70 at the midpoint, is basically a combination of LifeLabs, which is the more significant piece because of the fact that we have three quarters in 2025 that we didn't have in 2024, or at least the better part of three quarters. And that will come at a margin rate, which is in the lower double digits or in the low double digits, I should say, so below our corporate average. I think you mentioned it and you're right. LifeLabs will start at a margin rate which is low double digits. Will ramp up over two to three years to get to our corporate average. But this year it will be lower and it's a bit of a drag on the margin rate. But in terms of the other acquisitions, they come in at somewhere in the 35% to 40% contribution margin. So, all in that, acquired revenue growth is probably coming in at the high teens in terms of contribution margin. Now, you asked about the cadence and I won't talk about margin rate, although it is a bit of a proxy in terms of how EPS will come in, but I think the best way to talk about cycling is really go back to our pre-COVID averages in terms of what the cycling was by quarter. And I'll just mention these just as a comparative point. It doesn't necessarily mean that our cycling is going to be exactly that in 2025, but it's a good proxy and it's a good proxy for how margin rate also will be across the quarters. But in terms of contribution from EPS, I would say roughly 22.5% is what we used to see pre-COVID in the first quarter, 26.5% in the second, 26% in the third, and or approximately 25% in the fourth. Now, again, I'm not telling you this is what our cycling is in 2025, but it's directional and it's a good proxy for what you would expect close to cycling to be in 2025. So, that's what we used to see pre-COVID. Jim Davis : Yes, and then your question on utilization. Look, we're pleased with the utilization coming out of the fourth quarter. We look at it in many ways and across many segments. In terms of overall rec volume, we did have a slight weather impact in the quarter because of the hurricane early in Q4, so that cost us probably 50 basis points. And then we've been getting out of certain capitated business arrangements in California that were impacting just business we weren't making money on. So, we walked away from that, and that cost us a little volume. But when we look at the volume in our core physician and hospital segment, the rec volume from those segments was very, very strong in the quarter. Now, as Sam also mentioned, our rev per rec organically ex LifeLabs was up 3.3% in the quarter. And as you know, there's a lot of things that go into that rev per rec calculation. The first thing we look at is price per test. That was relatively flat in the quarter, but the second and biggest driver of that rev rec increase is test per rec. And that was probably two thirds of the increase in the overall organic rev per rec in the quarter. And so, that's utilization as well. And what's driving it is some of the new tests that we've rolled out, the brain health AB 42/40 in the tau markers, our advanced cardiometabolic testing, we're seeing big increases in things Lp(a) and ApoB. Our autoimmune testing has been really propelling some of the tests per rec growth. And then finally, I'd mention, we're seeing a nice uptick in volume from what we call functional health types of physicians. And as you probably know, they look at a lot of things and a lot of hormone testing and things like that. So, the trends on test per rec, the trends on volume in our core physician and hospital segment remain very, very strong. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Cherny of Leerink Partners. Your line is open, sir. Michael Cherny : Good morning. Congratulations on a great quarter. Maybe if I can just pull a little bit that thread there on rev per rec, it's obviously a really strong year over the course of 2024. As you think about that dynamic heading into 2025 and beyond, how much of the continued technological advancements are the drivers of this versus payer arrangements and marketing, and how should we think about this in terms of a long-term trajectory? Jim Davis : Okay, so again, let's fast forward into 2025. We'll start with price, price per test. At this point in the year, it could probably swing between plus or minus 30 basis points, okay? There's still lots of contracts to negotiate as we go through the year. And the one segment that has been experiencing some price pressure is the hospital segment, in particular reference testing. I think we've indicated on the past calls, during the entire COVID period from 2020 through 2023, hospitals really didn't go out to RFP for reference testing providers, right? They weren't so busy with other things. So, we're seeing an uptick in RFPs, and there's still price pressure in that segment. So, on par though, look, we think it's, again, within a range of plus or minus 25 to 30 basis points. The test per rec, we expect it to continue. We\u2019re still at the very early stages. So, when I talk about incredible test growth on things like ApoB and Lp(a) and the brain health portfolio, the overall volume of these tests is still relatively low. So, we still think there's significant growth in these segments left. Autoimmune disorders is another one. We're just seeing skyrocketing autoimmune disorders across the country. So, we expect those trends to continue. The last thing that goes into it is payer mix. And I didn't mention, but in the fourth quarter, and we saw it all last year, our mix of Medicare, Medicare Advantage, that segment of our business has been growing faster than the rest of the business. And so, that is actually good business mix because they're generally heavier recs. They're more frequent res. And as you know, many Medicare beneficiaries have comorbidities that just lead to more testing. So, all of that is pretty favorable. Sam Samad : Maybe I can add just a couple of comments, Mike, from a financial standpoint. In terms of, if you look at the rev per rec, in Q4 it was up 3.3% organically. If you break that down between the components that Jim talked about, two thirds of that is really a benefit from test per rec, which has been increasing continuously over the last number of quarters. And then the other third benefit is really a combination of payer mix and test mix, test mix being some of the innovations that we have. Payer mix is just driven off of reimbursement and which payers were getting the contribution from the different payers. As we look towards 2025 or this year, test per rec will continue to improve, although our expectation is that it will slow in terms of the improvement. So, that improvement, we don't expect it to be at the same pace that we've seen. I mean, we have been increasing quite substantially over a number of quarters. And I wouldn't say we've peaked, but definitely that rate of improvement is not going to be at the same rate. So, that's the only other comment that I would provide with regards to rev rec expectation in 2025. Operator : The next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Joanna Zhou : Hi, thanks for the question. This is Joanna for Elizabeth. Maybe go back to that $0.20 IT investment for 2025. I think you guys said it is most related to the LDT regulation. Is that expected to be a one-time investment or should we kind of expect to repeat in 2026 and beyond? Thanks. Jim Davis : Yes. First we said on the $0.20, the majority of it will be on modernizing our IT infrastructure, but there is a portion in there that is for FDA readiness. Now, it\u2019s difficult to tell what the future will be for that. As you know, there's a lawsuit in front of the courts right now that ACLA and other trade associations brought, and there'll be oral hearings on that lawsuit on February 19th. And we expect the case to likely be settled by the end of the first quarter or early second quarter. So, depending on the outcome of that, if the outcome supports the FDA position, then yes, there'll be some continued investments. If the outcome favors our trade association, then those investments could certainly moderate. Now, remember outside of what we're doing on the core clinical business to get ready, we do have segments in Quest Diagnostics that already operate under 21 CFR Part A 20. These are segments that serve our pharmaceutical industry customers. And so, there'll continue to be some investments to improve those systems in readiness. But look, a lot of the future investments related to the FDA will depend on the court case. Sam Samad : And then the other part of that $0.20 that you referenced is the IT investments that we're going to make that Jim talked about earlier. Those investments will continue. We have investments to modernize our systems. So, we don't expect that to be just this year. However, we talked on the Q3 call about our long-term guide in terms of expecting high single-digit EPS over the long term, and that we still - we reaffirm. So, those investments will continue, but they're part of our long-term guide expectation. Operator : The next question comes from Luke Sergott of Barclays. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : This is (indiscernible) for Luke Sergott. Thanks for the questions. Just to start off, could you guys provide a little more detail on what you expect the revenue contribution will be for the outreach lab services business acquisition you guys had with University Hospitals? And then assuming you'll get some benefit from the value-based contracts you have in place with payers, first, what's like the typical rate you get on top of your average reimbursement at the onset of these contracts, and how does that trend down in the next couple of years? And can we expect that kind of typical rate for this transaction? Sam Samad : Maybe I'll start with the University Hospitals one, and Jim, you want to talk about value-based compensation or incentives in general, but in terms of University Hospitals, we made this acquisition, we closed it at the end of the year, so right at the end of 2024. It's an acquisition of roughly $180 million. We don't usually provide revenue per each of these outreach acquisitions. So, we're not going to provide exactly what the revenue is, but I'll give you a couple of points here to consider. Usually, there's a certain valuation that we pay for those acquisitions, which is somewhere around 3.5x of revenues. That doesn't mean that's what University Hospitals is, but there's a certain valuation we pay for these outreach acquisitions, and this is a ballpark kind of number on average. And then the other piece that you need to consider is that this contribution from University Hospitals is going to be in that acquired revenue growth bar that you see in the bridge that we have included on our website. And so, it's part of that $0.65 to $0.75 contribution in terms of EPS from acquisitions. Now, as I said before, LifeLabs is a healthy portion of that. There's other carryover from outreach acquisitions that we made in 2024 beyond just university, but that is included in that piece. Jim, did you want to give any comments on value-based incentives? Jim Davis : Yes. From time to time, and we didn't really see any in the fourth quarter, but from time to time we get value-based incentive payments that are tied to moving recs from expensive health systems into Quest Diagnostics. That generally helps the payer, obviously, and as importantly, it helps the employer and it helps the patient. And so, some of those incentives come at a six-month period. Some come after a 12-month period look-back. So, they're hard to predict. And again, we call them out generally in our quarterly results when they do occur. Now, the other way we do collect some of these incentives is when we make these outreach acquisitions. And as you know, some of these health systems are getting 2x to 3x the rates that we're getting. Over time, our rates don't just migrate exactly to Quest Diagnostics rates. They'll come down over a period of two to three years. And so, there's what I call incremental pricing. So, as we move it from a health system payer rate to a Quest Diagnostics payer rate, sometimes those come as bonus payments and sometimes it's just part of the overall pricing. Operator : The next question comes from Pito Chickering of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open, sir. Pito Chickering : Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Looking at the competitive environment, you expanded access in several States in 2025 with two payers, then lost one State. How do you see the landscape shaping up in 2025? And do you see more RFPs coming up this year that could result in more turnover sort of next year? It\u2019s just been a couple of years since you've seen this much volatility with States turnover. Thanks so much. Jim Davis : Yes, so first of all, net-net on all of the payer changes that came about in 2024, we're better off. So, when we look at the lives that we picked up through Elevance in Colorado, Nevada, Virginia, and we were not in network with some of the plans in Georgia, when we look at the lives that we pick up from Sentara and then we subtract the lives we lost in Alabama, we're better off by well more than a million lives. So, our access in total has significantly improved as we enter 2025. In terms of agreements that we will negotiate here in 2025, look, as you know, the typical health plan contract is somewhere between three and five years. So, every year we renew somewhere between 25% and 30% of health plan arrangements. And this year will be in that typical range. So, more to come on that, but every year we're renewing agreements in that magnitude and we're going to do it again this year. Operator : The next question will come from David Westenberg of Piper Sandler. Your line is open. David Westenberg : Hi. Thank you for taking the question. So, just on the acquisition and integration, I believe you completed, my count is eight acquisitions in 2024, including big ones like LifeLabs had a lot of inorganic growth. How do you expect those acquisitions to enhance the revenue stream? And how should we think about as they lap the organic revenue growth, would that actually accelerate? And just thinking about puts and takes on integration speed, what exactly do you have to do this year, given the amount of acquisitions you did in the last year? And what would make you go back to a little bit more aggressive acquisitions, just given the fact that there is a lot out there available to you? Sorry, that was long. Jim Davis : Yes, sure. So, as Sam indicated in his comments, the 2025 revenue growth that is coming from acquisitions, carryover acquisitions is about 6%. And as you know, we only carry that growth through the date - through the 12-month anniversary, okay? So, we closed LifeLabs in September of last year. It had five months of impact, four months of impact last year. And so, we carry that through the first seven, eight months of this year. So, in total, it's about six percentage points of our growth in 2025. And more than two thirds of that is LifeLabs, okay? So, we feel good about that. Now, yes, the team is hard at work at integrating these acquisitions, and yet the funnel of opportunities remains strong. So, we'll continue to assess the opportunities. We're not backing away from any if it fits our criteria of we have great payer access in that market. If our share is very small in that market, then it becomes an attractive opportunity for us to look at. So, while we have a lot of work to do to integrate what we've got on our plate, we're not going to be shy about picking things up and going after things that improve our market access. Sam Samad : Maybe I can add just a couple of quick comments, Dave. You talked about sort of difficulty of integration and complexity of integration, and yes, there were a lot of acquisitions in 2024. Now remember, LifeLabs is more of a standalone entity that's in Canada. It's an established company. They have labs that are established. There's a lot of things that they can learn from us, but we can learn from them as well. So, I would say the integration is lighter there because they are already operating and we're not looking to close labs or move them to our systems at this point. So, that's an easier integration. And then you asked about sort of the cadence of M&A, what would it take to do more? Just keep in mind, I mean, it's not that we're not doing any more M&A in 2025. We have not included in our guide any new M&A that has not been announced, but we do have, in our capital plan, we have allocated certain capital for potential, what we call tuck-in M&A. It's mostly focused on the hospital outreach lab acquisitions. So, we will do more M&A because these are very attractive opportunities that scale very quickly and get to a healthy contribution margin. So, I just want to make sure that people don't expect that we're not going to do any more M& A Operator : The next question comes from Andrew Brackmann of William Blair. Please go ahead with your question. Andrew Brackmann : Question. Hi guys, good morning. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to ask on Haystack. First, can you maybe just sort of shed a little bit more light on any volume or reimbursement expectations for that asset in 2025? But I guess also bigger picture here and way more important than 2025, as you're moving these customers to those commercial programs, how should we be thinking about any additional pull-through or halo effect that having this asset now in the commercial phase should allow on the oncology side of the business? Thanks. Jim Davis : Yes, so thanks, Andrew. So, look, we're pleased with the progress that we've made with Haystack. As we mentioned in the comments, we served over 70 customers on a non-revenue basis last year, a really nice mix of academic medical centers, community oncology. And so, the emphasis right now is on moving those customers into full commercial arrangements. Now, as we start, we're going to bill. We're going to bill Medicare. We're going to bill Medicare Advantage. We expect denials to be high at the beginning, but you then fight those denials, and you then begin the conversations with the appropriate MAC or the appropriate Medicare Advantage plan around the goodness of the test and why it is important for patients. And so, we do expect, as Sam indicated, to get modest revenue from that business this year. Now, you asked about other opportunities. First, let me remind everyone, look, oncology is a billion-dollar business for Quest Diagnostics today. That includes some of our screening assays. That includes a very, very strong anatomical pathology business, and it includes a very, very strong hematology business. So, we actually expect to get pull through of our MRD assay from the existing set of customers that we have. And we're already seeing that pay off. We also have, in addition to an MRD assay, we have a therapy planning assay, our TSO 500 assay. And so, we expect to get some benefits in that segment of our business as well. Operator : [Operator instructions] Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson of Jefferies. Your line is open. Noah Kava : Hey, this is Noah on Tycho. Thanks for taking our call. I wanted to ask about preventative screening, particularly with the braid Well case going on. I was wondering how big your exposure is to preventative screening and if you have any assumptions on potential impact if USPSTF was authority. Thanks. Jim Davis : I'm sorry. I mean, you mentioned that braid well kits. Noah Kava : Case. So, for \u2026 Jim Davis : Yes, I'm not \u2026 Noah Kava : Basically for Jim Davis : Yes, you were cutting out a little bit there, so I'm not I'm not familiar with the case. Sam, I don\u2019t think you are. Okay. So, look, in general there seems to be what I would call a shift in focus going on across the country, and that shift in focus from taking - spending all our time and effort on sickness and in curing disease to this shift towards what I would call prevention and wellness. And in general, we actually think that is a wonderful shift for the lab industry, right? We strongly believe it's tied to our purpose, that lab testing should be used early, early and often in order to ensure somebody is not moving from one morbidity to another morbidity. And so, we're excited by a lot of the work that's going on in functional medicine today because that focus is really on prevention and wellness early. So, we feel good about that, and we think those trends are going to help the lab industry. Operator : The next question will come from Jack Meehan of Nephron Research. Your line is open. Jack Meehan : Thank you and good morning. Wanted to get - not sure if this was addressed. I don't think it was, but latest thoughts on Haystack. I know you talked about you\u2019re expecting to generate some initial revenue here. But can you talk about expectations for clinical data updates we might be able to expect this year and just progress in terms of getting Medicare payment for the test? Thank you. Jim Davis : Yes. Thanks, Jack. So, I did give a few brief comments, but just for everyone, we went through this early experience program for six to seven months during 2024. And so, we gathered a lot of insights on our new assay. We gathered a lot of experience with close to (indiscernible) customers that touched academic medical centers as well as community oncology centers. So, we're now in the process of moving those customers to full commercial arrangements, which will include billing of Medicare and Medicare Advantage plans. Like any new test, you start the billing process, you expect some denials. You respond to those denials in a very thoughtful way, and you engage with the appropriate MAC as well as the Medicare Advantage plans. And so, look, we have a ton of experience with this, as you know. Our broad reach into every Medicare Advantage plan in the country, our health plan access, our relationships, are all very positive. And so, we will get revenue in this segment this year. So, in terms of new clinical studies, all I would say is stay tuned. Haystack, for many, many years, even prior to ownership by Quest Diagnostics, had funded many clinical trials, some of which are coming near an end, and we'll be able to publish, I think, some great results this year. Operator, next question. Operator : The final question for today will come from Erin Wright of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Erin Wright : Great, thanks. Just a bigger picture question as we head into kind of 2025 and how you think about how it's progressing in terms of market share gains versus underlying utilization. What's embedded in your expectations on that front? I know you talked a little bit about the underlying environment, but I particularly want to know because is it accelerating in terms of the market, underlying market share gains that you're seeing as well? And then also just lastly, if I can stick one in there on PAMA SALSA regulatory environment. You spoke to LDT stuff, but any thoughts in terms of the change in kind of administration and how you're viewing your visibility into that? Thanks. Jim Davis : Yes, so let me start with the latter question on PAMA. So, as you know, the rate cuts did not go into place. So, this was the fifth year that rates were left the same. And we feel good about that. I would actually say, there's going to be renewed focus on PAMA reform this year. As you know, there's three committees that we generally work with. There's the Senate Finance Committee, the House and Means committee, and the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Those three committees are really charged with all things healthcare in this country. So, the committee - in two of the three, there's new committee chair people. We know who they are. We've already had outreach to them, and I would say, look, there is strong bipartisan support to actually solve it this year. So, we're excited about the opportunity to get a final solution to PAMA as we work throughout 2025. I can tell you, it's the number one priority of our ACLA trade association. And we've been hard at work since January 2 to get a solution in place. Yes. So, on the market share utilization question, look, I think in general for the independent labs, that all independent labs are making progress from a market share standpoint. What you see, the outreach acquisitions that we've done is a sign that hospitals are less focused on gathering that work in the communities and more focused on deploying their capital, their assets, their resources, their know-how to other parts of health system operations. So, I feel good about our prospects. It was a share gain year and again, I just think we're seeing health systems pay less attention to that outreach book of business than they have in the past. And I think that's great signs for Quest Diagnostics as well as the independent lab industry. Operator : That was our final question for today, sir. Thank you for participating in Quest Diagnostics fourth quarter and full-year 2024 conference call. Jim Davis : Thanks, everyone. We appreciate you joining in and look forward to seeing you all on March 19th at our Investor Day in New York City.
